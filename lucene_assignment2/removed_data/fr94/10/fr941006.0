ACTION:

 Correction to final regulations.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document contains corrections to the final regulations which were published Tuesday, September 13, 1994, (59
FR 46895). The regulations related to the service limits for temporary appointments.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background



The final regulations that are the subject of this correction revise OPM's time limits for temporary appointments
(i.e., appointments limited to 1 year or less) to set a uniform limit for such appointments in both the competitive
and the excepted service at 1 year with no more than one 1-year extension (24 months total service). This change is intended
to ensure that temporary appointments, under which employees receive no benefits, are used to meet truly short-term
needs. 



Need for Correction



As published, the final regulations show the effective date of the new time limits as 60 days following publication.
However, OPM had intended to make the regulations effective 30 days following publication, the earliest date permitted
by law. In view of Congressional and employee concerns and evidence that under existing limits some employees have,
indeed, served for years under a succession of temporary appointments, we believe it is critical to make the revised
limits effective as soon as possible.

The final regulations also listed contact for further information as Tracy Spencer on (202) 606-0960. Her telephone
number is now (202) 606-0830.



Correction of Publication



Accordingly, the publication on September 13, 1994, of the final regulations, which were the subject of FR Doc. 94-22447,
is corrected as follows:

Control of Paperwork Burdens on the Public; Delegation of Review and Approval Authority to the Managing Director
of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Management and Budget, Executive Office of the President.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This Rule delegates to the Managing Director of the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) the authority,
under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, as amended (the Act), and 5 CFR 1320.9, to reauthorize information collection
requests, information collection requirements, and collections of information in current rules conducted or sponsored
by the Commission. This delegation applies to collections of information that have been initially approved by the
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and have an annual total public burden that is 5,000 hours or less and an estimated
burden per respondent of less than 500 hours. In exercising this delegated authority, the Commission is to afford
the public an opportunity to participate in the reauthorization review process. Commission-reauthorized collections
of information will be incorporated into the official OMB inventory of currently approved collections of information.
A report of delegated approval for each information collection reauthorized by the Commission will be placed in OMB's
public docket files when that approval is made. Under the Act, OMB may limit, condition, or rescind this delegation
at any time, but it is intended that OMB will exercise this authority only rarely and in unusual circumstances.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Section 3507(e) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 and 5 CFR 1320.9 authorize OMB to delegate its authority to approve
collections of information to an agency's designated senior official for paperwork reduction or to the agency head
if certain conditions are met. The Act and OMB's implementing regulations require OMB to comply with the notice and
comment procedures of title 5, United States Code, chapter 5, before providing delegation to any agency. Following
extensive consultation with the Commission, OMB preliminarily determined that the FCC met all of the requirements
for delegation of the authority requested. Following this determination, OMB published proposed changes to 5 CFR
part 1320 in a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on June 9, 1994 (59 FR 29738). No comments were received from Federal
agencies or members of the public. 


With one exception, this final rule adopts the NPRM. OMB has added, as new section 2.(a)(3)(v), a requirement that
the FCC hold periodic training on meeting the requirements of the Act and 5 CFR part 1320 for the members of the functional
bureaus and offices (B/Os) responsible for sponsoring information collections. 
The delegation is granted to the Commission's Managing Director who, as the Commission's designated senior official,
has the authority to reauthorize the Commission's extension of collections of information, subject to the Paperwork
Reduction Act. OMB approval will still be required for new, revised, and expired information collections or those
collections that represent more than a total annual burden of 5,000 hours or an individual respondent's burden of
greater than 500 hours.
Under the terms of the delegation, each quarter, the agency clearance officer will identify the information collections
that will need to be reauthorized during the next quarter and notify the appropriate functional Bureau and Office
(B/O) of the Commission. Sponsoring B/Os will analyze each of these collections and consider: the continued need
for the information, including the need for individual report items; how the Commission has used this information
in the past; the reporting frequency; and selection of the reporting instrument. The review will cover clarity of
format and instructions, reporting deadlines, costs and burdens, any public comments the Commission received during
the previous clearance period, and other relevant items. For those eligible collections that the B/Os choose to extend,
the reauthorization process would be initiated by B/O preparation of a ``request for extension of an information
collection.'' This request, and the accompanying supporting statement, will be submitted to the agency clearance
officer in the Office of the Managing Director. After screening by the agency clearance officer, a 

Federal Register

 notice and a 

FCC Public Notice

 will be issued requesting public comment during a 30-day review period beginning on the date of publication of the
notice. Public comments will be evaluated and, where appropriate, incorporated into the collection. The agency
clearance officer will provide written responses to all public comments. The Managing Director will not reauthorize
collections with substantive changes. Finally, when appropriate, the Managing Director will reauthorize the collection
for use and submit a report of delegated approval to OMB. 
This entire process will occur under the general direction of the Managing Director in his capacity as the Commission's
designated senior official. The Commission's clearance process will be under the day-to-day supervision and management
of the agency clearance officer who reports to the Managing Director and is outside and independent of any program
office that would originate requests to extend information collections. The agency clearance officer would maintain
administrative control throughout the review process regardless of how or where the request for extension originates.
Each B/O will designate staff to act as liaison with the review structure described above and to help ensure their organization's
adherence to the paperwork clearance standards and procedures. This staff will receive periodic training from the
agency clearance officer on the Act and the requirements and procedures contained in 5 CFR part 1320. The agency clearance
officer will ensure public access to the Commission's information collection files in compliance with approved
retention and disposition schedules. Over the longer term, the agency clearance officer will work towards making
summary information available electronically. 
OMB believes that this review and reauthorization process meets the requirements for a delegation of OMB's Paperwork
Reduction Act approval authority. These requirements and the reasons why OMB believes that the Commission fully
meets them follow.
(1) The agency review process must exhibit independence from program office responsibility.
Virtually all of these collections are contained in regulatory requirements. The Commissioners generally establish
overall policies with the functional 
B/Os responsible for the decisions to initiate or sponsor a collection of information. The Commission's Managing
Director serves as the senior official for management and administrative matters and is independent of and separate
from the functional B/Os. The Managing Director will serve as the final approval authority on all FCC decisions to
reauthorize information collections. The agency clearance officer in the Office of the Managing Director will review
each information collection to determine if the original purpose and intent of the collection warrants its continued
existence. This review will also assess whether the collection remains necessary for the Commission to perform its
duties and responsibilities as identified in the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and the relevant parts of
the Code of Federal Regulations.
(2) The agency must have sufficient resources to carry out paperwork responsibilities.
OMB believes that the Managing Director has demonstrated a commitment to conduct reviews of information collections
that include the use of resources and personnel from all areas within the Commission. Each functional B/O having programmatic
responsibilities will provide staff resources to prepare the analytical materials described above. This staff
will receive periodic training from the agency clearance officer on the Act and the procedures and requirements contained
in 5 CFR part 1320. The agency clearance officer in the Office of the Managing Director will then conduct the reviews
identified above. To ensure that the agency clearance officer can perform an adequate review of each information
collection, the records management division in the Office of the Managing Director has been assigned a staff of two
senior analysts. These individuals, under the direct supervision of the agency clearance officer, each have extensive
experience in addressing issues related to the Paperwork Reduction Act and information collections. Finally, the
resources of the Office of General Counsel will be available if additional assistance is needed to evaluate the necessity
of an information collection in its current form. The Managing Director of the FCC has requested a delegation to review
and reauthorize collections of information that represent a narrow scope of the Commission's collections. We believe
that the limited number and relative lack of complexity of these collections will not overburden the ability of the
agency clearance officer to perform these reviews. 
(3) The agency review process must evaluate fairly whether the proposed collections of information should be approved.
OMB believes that the Commission has developed a process that ensures that the Office of the Managing Director can
fairly evaluate and reauthorize collections of information. The Office of the Managing Director has assembled an
experienced staff under the direction of a paperwork clearance officer who is independent from the program B/Os.
Additionally, the Managing Director has proposed a process for reauthorizing extensions to approved information
collections that will: maintain public participation; allow OMB the opportunity to consult during the review process;
ensure prompt notification of OMB concerning decisions made about individual information collections and any public
comments received during this process; and provide OMB with information necessary to maintain its inventory of approved
collections. Under the proposed delegation, the Commission would continue to request OMB approval for new, expired,
or revised information collections.
The Commission recognizes that OMB can and will continue to have a consultative role in the approval process. The Commission
will work closely with OMB should an assessment of the existing information collection indicate that a modification
would benefit the Commission or the public. 
(4) Evidence of successful performance of paperwork review activities.
Despite a dynamic regulatory environment that has resulted in the creation of numerous new information collection
requirements, the Commission has been actively working to reduce its overall paperwork burden. The FCC has been working
closely with the public to improve its ability to collect and evaluate information, particularly in the use of information
technology to reduce or minimize the reporting burden of its information collections. Recent FCC innovations include:
(a) use of ``800'' telephone lines to provide direct access to program experts who provide advice on completing the
collection; (b) providing forms that can be faxed by the respondents directly to the program office for FCC advice
or action; and (c) allowing submission of certain financial information in electronic format. The FCC is aggressively
pursuing other applications of information technology to reduce the burden placed on the public. 
In May 1990, the FCC erred in implementing the Paperwork Reduction Act when rules prescribing an information collection
entitled ``Authorization to Construct a Cellular Telephone System'' were found to have been ambiguous concerning
submission of certain documents required to be filed in support of an application. The Commission concurred with
OMB's finding concerning this ambiguity and reopened the proceeding involving this collection. Since then, the
Commission has upgraded the training of both the program B/Os and the Office of the Managing Director, and the Commission
has been conscientious in managing its information collections. The Commission will develop a program of periodic
training sessions to improve and maintain the knowledge of those individuals in the program B/Os responsible for
managing information collections.


Summary


Based on these facts, OMB grants the Managing Director of the FCC a delegation to reauthorize its approved information
collections subject to three exclusions.
The first exclusion would apply to changes to an existing collection. Any change, revision, or modification, other
than non-substantive clarifications or corrections of spelling or grammatical errors, would cause a collection
of information to be submitted to OMB for review and approval. 
The second exclusion would apply to new collections of information or reauthorization of collections for which approval
has lapsed. New or lapsed collections of information would continue to be submitted to OMB for review and approval.

The third exclusion would apply to the reauthorization of information collections employing statistical methods.
Because OMB believes that the agency clearance officer lacks the resources required to effectively evaluate such
collections, these collections would continue to be submitted to OMB for review and approval. Voluntary customer
surveys will be treated under streamlined procedures established by OMB Memorandum M-93-14 dated September 29,
1993.
The Commission will continue to follow OMB rules with respect to information collections excluded from this delegation.
The Commission may also, at its option, request OMB to conduct any delegated review.
The Commission's final action on the reauthorization of a collection of information would be taken after the public
has a reasonable opportunity to comment through notice in the 

Federal Register

 and 

FCC Public Notice.

 The comment period will extend for at least 30 days following publication of the notice in the 

Federal Register.

 These notices will advise the public that a copy of comments may also be submitted to the OMB/Office of Information
and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) desk officer for the Commission.

3. Appendix A to part 1320 is amended by adding a new entry at the end of the appendix to read as follows:



Appendix A to Part 1320_Agencies With Delegated Review and Approval Authority



*  *  *  *  *



2. The Managing Director of the Federal Communications Commission.
(a) Authority to review and approve currently valid (OMB-approved) collections of information, including collections
of information contained in existing rules, that have a total annual burden of 5,000 hours or less and a burden of less
than 500 hours per respondent is delegated to the Managing Director of the Federal Communications Commission.
(1) This delegation does not include review and approval authority over any new collection of information, any collections
whose approval has lapsed, any substantive or material modification to existing collections, any reauthorization
of information collections employing statistical methods, or any information collections that exceed a total annual
burden of 5,000 hours or an estimated burden of 500 hours per respondent.
(2) The Managing Director may ask that OMB review and approve collections of information covered by the delegation.
(3) In exercising delegated authority the Managing Director will:
(i) Provide the public, to the extent possible and appropriate, with reasonable opportunity to comment on collections
of information under review prior to taking final action on reauthorizing an existing collection. Reasonable opportunity
for public comment will include publishing a notice in the 

Federal Register

 and an 

FCC Public Notice

 informing the public that a collection of information is being extended and announcing the beginning of a 30-day comment
period, notifying the public of the ``intent to extend an information collection,'' and providing the public with
the opportunity to comment. Such notices shall advise the public that they may also send a copy of their comments to
the OMB/Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs desk officer for the Commission.
(A) Should the Managing Director determine that a collection of information that falls within the scope of this delegation
must be reauthorized quickly and that public participation in the reauthorization process interferes with the Commission's
ability to perform its statutory obligation, the Managing Director may temporarily reauthorize the extension of
an information collection, for a period not to exceed 90 days, without providing opportunity for public comment.

(B) At the earliest practical date after granting this temporary extension to an information collection, the Managing
Director will conduct a normal delegated review and publish a 

Federal Register

 Notice soliciting public comment on its intention to extend the collection of information for a period not to exceed
3 years.
(ii) Assure that approved collections of information are reviewed not less frequently than once every 3 years and
that such reviews are conducted before the expiration date of the prior approval. When the review is not completed
prior to the expiration date, the Managing Director will submit the lapsed information collection to OMB for review
and reauthorization. 

(iii) Assure that each reauthorized collection of information displays an OMB control number and, except for those
contained in regulations or specifically designated by OMB, displays the expiration date of the approval.
(iv) Transmit to OMB for incorporation into OMB's public docket files, a report of delegated approval certifying
that the Managing Director has reauthorized each collection of information in accordance with the provisions of
this delegation. Such transmittal shall be made no later than 15 days after the Managing Director has taken final action
reauthorizing the extension of an information collection.
(v) Ensure that the personnel in the Commission's functional bureaus and offices responsible for managing information
collections receive periodic training on procedures related to meeting the requirements of this rule and the Act.
(b) OMB will:
(1) Provide notice to the Commission acknowledging receipt of the report of delegated approval and its incorporation
into OMB's public docket files and inventory of currently approved collections of information.
(2) Act upon any request by the Commission to review a collection of information referred by the Commission in accordance
with the provisions of section 2(a)(2) of this Appendix.
(3) Periodically assess, at its discretion, the Commission's paperwork review process as administered under the
delegation. The Managing Director will cooperate in carrying out such an assessment. The Managing Director will
respond to any recommendations resulting from such a review and, if it finds the recommendations to be appropriate,
will either accept the recommendation or propose an alternative approach to achieve the intended purpose.
(c) This delegation may, as provided by 5 CFR 1320.9(c), be limited, conditioned, or rescinded, in whole or in part
at any time. OMB will exercise this authority only in unusual circumstances.

Supplemental Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (Board). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board, with the concurrence of the Office of Government Ethics (OGE), is
issuing regulations for employees of the Board that supplement the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of
the Executive Branch, as issued by OGE, with a requirement to obtain prior approval for outside employment. The Board
also is repealing its remaining old conduct standards which were retained on an interim basis pending issuance of
the Board's supplemental regulations and is inserting in their place a cross-reference to the new provisions.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background



On August 7, 1992, OGE published new Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch (standards).
See 57 FR 35006-35067, as corrected at 57 FR 48557 and 57 FR 52583, with an additional grace period extension at
59 FR 4779-4780. Codified at 5 CFR part 2635, the new standards became effective on February 3, 1993. On June 2,
1993, the Board issued a final rule (58 FR 31332) which replaced all of the provisions of its prior standards of conduct
regulations at 5 CFR part 1633 that had been superseded by part 2635, or by OGE's executive branch financial disclosure
regulations at 5 CFR part 2634. The Board preserved only those provisions that were specifically grandfathered under
the notes following 5 CFR 2635.403(a) and 2635.803.

With the concurrence of OGE, 5 CFR 2635.105 authorizes agencies to publish agency-specific supplemental regulations
that are necessary to implement their respective ethics programs. The Board, with OGE's concurrence, has determined
that the following supplemental rules, being codified in new chapter LXXVI of 5 CFR, are necessary to the success of
its ethics program. The Board is simultaneously repealing the remaining provisions of 5 CFR part 1633, which are superseded
upon issuance of the Board's supplemental regulations, and is replacing those provisions with a single section that
provides cross-references to 5 CFR parts 2634 and 2635, as well as to the Board's new supplemental regulations.



II. Analysis of the Regulations



Section 8601.101 General



Section 8601.101 explains that these regulations supplement the executive branch-wide standards of ethical conduct
and reminds Board employees, including Board members, that they are subject to these regulations and the executive
branch-wide financial disclosure regulations. However, because Board members are special Government employees,
the requirement for prior approval of outside employment in section 8601.102 does not apply to them.

Section 8601.102 Prior Approval for Outside Employment



5 CFR 2635.803 authorizes individual agencies to issue supplemental regulations to require agency employees to
obtain prior approval before engaging in outside employment, with or without compensation. The Board has long had
a prior approval requirement to ensure that any problems relating to an employee's outside employment are resolved
before an employee begins such an undertaking. Section 8601.102 continues that prior approval requirement, but
differs from the old Board requirement because it contains a definition of employment that clarifies the circumstances
under which prior approval must be obtained. The outside employment must be approved by the employee's office director.
In the written request, the employee is required to describe the organizations, duties, hours of work, and remuneration
pertaining to the outside employment. An employee must submit the written request through his or her immediate supervisor,
unless the immediate supervisor is the employee's office director.

In addition to approval by the employee's office director, if the outside employment involves teaching, speaking,
or writing that relates to the employee's official duties, the employee must also obtain the advance written approval
of the Executive Director of the Board. The Executive Director may approve or disapprove such outside employment,
or may permit the performance of the teaching, speaking, or writing as an official duty (for which no compensation
may be received). This requirement does not apply to teaching, speaking, or writing that relates to the purely private
interests of the employee that are nonwork-related.



III. Repeal of Board Standards of Conduct Regulations



Because the Board's retained Standards of Conduct at 5 CFR part 1633 are superseded by the supplemental regulations
contained in new 5 CFR part 8601, the Board is repealing all of existing 5 CFR part 1633. To ensure that employees are
on notice of the ethical standards to which they are subject, the Board is replacing its old standards at 5 CFR part 1633
with a provision that cross-references 5 CFR parts 2634 and 2635 and the Board's new supplemental regulations at 5
CFR part 8601.



IV. Matters of Regulatory Procedure



Administrative Procedure Act



The Board has found that good cause exists under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) and (d)(3) for waiving, as unnecessary and contrary
to the public interest, the general notice of proposed rulemaking and the 30-day delay in effectiveness as to these
rules and repeals. The supplemental regulations are essentially a restatement of rules previously contained in
the standards of conduct, and the Board believes that it is important to a smooth transition from the Board's standards
of conduct to the executive branch standards that these rules become effective as soon as possible. Furthermore,
this rulemaking is related to the Board's organization, procedure and practice.



Regulatory Flexibility Act



The Board has determined under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) that these regulations will not
have a significant impact on small business entities because they affect only Board employees.



Paperwork Reduction Act



The Board has determined that the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. chapter 35) does not apply because these regulations
do not contain any information collection requirements that require the approval of the Office of Management and
Budget.

 8601.101

General.



In accordance with 5 CFR 2635.105, the regulations in this part apply to employees of the Federal Retirement Thrift
Investment Board (Board) and supplement the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch contained
in 5 CFR part 2635. In addition, Board employees are subject to the executive branch financial disclosure regulations
at 5 CFR part 2634.



 8601.102

Prior approval for outside employment.



(a) Before engaging in outside employment, with or without compensation, an employee, other than a special Government
employee, must obtain written approval from his or her office director. The written request shall be submitted through
the employee's immediate supervisor, unless the supervisor is the employee's office director, and shall identify
the employer or other person for whom the services are to be provided, as well as the duties, hours of work, and compensation
involved in the proposed outside employment.

(b) Approval under paragraph (a) of this section shall be granted only upon a determination that the outside employment
is not expected to involve conduct prohibited by statute or Federal regulation, including 5 CFR part 2635.

(c) In addition to the approval required by paragraph (a) of this section, an employee whose outside employment involves
teaching, speaking, or writing that relates to his or her official duties within the meaning of 5 CFR 2635.807(a)(2)
shall obtain approval from the Executive Director of the Board to engage in the activity as an outside activity, rather
than as part of the employee's official duties.

(d) For purposes of this section, employment means any form of non-Federal employment or business relationship involving
the provision of personal services by the employee. It includes, but is not limited to, personal services as an officer,
director, employee, agent, attorney, consultant, contractor, general partner, trustee, teacher or speaker. It
includes writing when done under an arrangement with another person for production or publication of the written
product. It does not, however, include participation in the activities of a nonprofit charitable, religious, professional,
social, fraternal, educational, recreational, public service or civil organization, unless the participation
involves the provision of professional services or advice for compensation other than reimbursement for actual
expenses.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This final rule amends regulations governing funding and 
funds allocation procedures for the Special Supplemental Food 
Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) in order to simplify 
and update the funding process in anticipation of a fully funded 
program. The amendments provide a greater share of funds to State 
agencies receiving comparatively less than their fair share of 
funds based on their WIC income eligible population, provide all 
State agencies with stability funding, adjusted for inflation, to 
the extent funds are available, and simplify the food funding 
allocation process by eliminating obsolete features.

Executive Order 12372 



The Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and 
Children (WIC) is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic 
Assistance Programs under 10.557 and is subject to Executive Order 
12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and 
local officials (7 CFR Part 3015, Subpart V, and final rule-related 
notice published June 24, 1983 (48 FR 29114)). 



Executive Order 12778 



This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, 
Civil Justice Reform. This rule is intended to have preemptive 
effect with respect to any state or local laws, regulations or 
policies which conflict with its provisions or which would 
otherwise impede its full implementation. This rule is not 
intended to have retroactive effect unless so specified in the 
``Effective Date'' paragraph of this preamble. Prior to any judicial 
challenge to the provisions of this rule or the application of its 
provisions, all applicable administrative procedures must be 
exhausted. In the WIC Program, the administrative procedures are 
as follows: (1) local agencies and vendors_State agency hearing 
procedures issued pursuant to 7 CFR  246.18; (2) applicants and 
participants_State agency hearing procedures issued pursuant to 
7 CFR  246.9; (3) sanctions against State agencies (but not claims 
for repayment assessed against a State agency) pursuant to 7 CFR 
 246.19_administrative appeal in accordance with 7 CFR  246.22; 
and (4) procurement by State or local agencies_administrative 
appeal to the extent required by 7 CFR  3016.36. 


Background 



The WIC Program has consistently demonstrated its effectiveness in 
promoting the health and nutritional well-being of low-income 
women, infants and children at nutritional or medical risk, and has 
experienced large increases in its appropriation for the last 
several years. Due to its success, the WIC Program is likely to 
soon achieve ``full funding'' whereby it is estimated that all 
eligible women, infants and children who apply could obtain program 
benefits. In moving toward the full funding objective, the 
Department finds that its current food funding formula presents 
impediments to funding equity and is so complex it is difficult to 
execute and predict its results. 

Historically, WIC has never had enough funds to serve all who are 
in need of, and eligible for, its benefits. Certain State agencies 
receive levels of funding that allow them to serve more of their 
eligible populations than others. The concept of full funding for 
WIC, as set forth by the Administration, does not guarantee 
unlimited funds nor does it establish the WIC Program as a federal 
entitlement program. As before, WIC must manage within a finite 
appropriation level. However, a fully funded WIC Program implies 
that the appropriation level will more adequately provide for all 
eligible persons who apply for benefits, and that each State agency 
should have an equal chance to serve their eligible population. 
Currently, many State agencies are serving lesser proportions of 
their WIC-eligible population than other State agencies. 
Therefore, the formula must support growth among State agencies 
which are now funded to serve a lesser proportion of their eligible 
population, as well as allocate funds fairly among all State 
agencies under a stable, fully funded program. 

Therefore, to better prepare the WIC Program for full funding, the 
Department published a proposed rule on June 8, 1994 to revise the 
food funding formula in order to meet three major objectives: 1) 
to provide a greater share of funds to State agencies receiving 
comparatively less than their fair share of funds based on their 
WIC income eligible population; 2) to simplify the food funding 
formula and delete obsolete components; and 3) to maintain current 
services to eligible participants that State agencies are serving 
to the extent funds are available. 

The proposed rule provided for a 60-day comment period, which ended 
on August 8, 1994. Thirty-six comment letters were received from a 
variety of sources, including State and local agencies, advocacy 
groups and other public interest groups. The Department has given 
all comments careful consideration in the development of this final 
rule and would like to thank all commenters who responded to the 
proposal.

Assumptions Under Full Funding 



As explained in the preamble to the proposed rule, full funding is 
not intended to replace or discourage efficient and effective 
program management. Accordingly, mandatory cost containment 
efforts recently undertaken must continue, and additional voluntary 
cost containment efforts are encouraged. Funds will continue to be 
allocated based on a national average food package cost as an 
incentive for State agencies to manage their food package costs 
more efficiently to serve more eligibles. Finally the commitment 
to WIC full funding can only be met if States continue to utilize 
risk-related eligibility criteria that are based on sound medical, 
nutritional and preventive health research. Income eligibility 
alone is not a sufficient condition for program eligibility. 




Funding Formula Objectives 




The funding process should assure each State agency a grant that 
allows it an equal opportunity to serve its fair share of eligible 
persons seeking WIC service by providing a food package suited to 
the participant's unique nutritional deficiencies, not to exceed 
the maximum food benefit allowed under regulations. This rule 
establishes a funding formula to meet this overall goal. The 
following is a discussion of each provision, as proposed, comments 
received on the proposal, and an explanation of the provisions set 
forth in this final rule. 




1. Section 246.16(c)(1) Allocation Formula_Use of 
participation data in the formula. 




The Department proposed to revise Section 246.16(c)(1) to eliminate 
the use of priority participation data or data reflecting State-funded participation for imputing the figures needed
for the 
targeting components of the formula described in Section 246.16 
(c)(3)(ii) and (c)(1)(ii)(A). 




All commenters on this provision supported it as proposed. 
Therefore, the provision remains unchanged from the proposed rule. 




2. Section 246.16(c)(3)(i) Allocation of stability funds. 




Currently, in allocating funds to State agencies, first priority is 
given to maintaining each State's operating level as ``stability 
funding''. The stability component of a State agency's allocation 
is initially based on the amount of food funds received by each 
State agency in the prior fiscal year, adjusted to restore 50 
percent of any grant funds voluntarily returned in the prior year. 
This base level is then adjusted to account for a portion of the 
inflation estimated for the upcoming fiscal year (except that 
Indian State agencies receive a full inflation adjustment).

<TEXT>
 

The proposed formula retained this component with some 
modification. The principle of stability was maintained to help 
assure that each State agency would receive enough funds to support 
its current participation level. However, the proposed rule 
deleted the provision allowing a State agency the option to retain 
50 percent of funds it returns before July 16 of any given year as 
a part of its stability grant the next fiscal year. 




The majority of commenters addressing this issue opposed the 
provision and stated that the current 50 percent recovery credit 
should be maintained. The commenters indicated that eliminating 
the credit would be a disincentive for State agencies to return 
funds, thereby delaying the reallocation of unspent funds. Several 
commenters suggested maintaining the 50 percent credit for one year 
only. A few commenters were strongly in support of the provision 
to delete the 50 percent recovery credit. 




The 50 percent credit was originally intended as an incentive for a 
State agency to return food funds that it could not spend, thereby 
making those funds available for reallocation to State agencies 
that needed additional funds. However, almost all State agencies 
which have elected to return funds under this provision have been 
those which were in danger of failing to spend at least 95 percent 
of their allocated food funds. Failure to achieve this expenditure 
level results in a specific decrease in the amount of food funds in 
the subsequent fiscal year. In these instances, State agencies 
simply returned the amount of funds necessary to ensure 
expenditures of at least 95 percent of their adjusted food grants. 
The Department no longer believes restoration of 50 percent of 
returned funds to State agencies in the next year is prudent. The 
restoration of these funds makes it possible for a State agency 
already receiving its fair share funding to retain funds it does 
not need. In addition, the credit effectively increases stability 
grants in the subsequent year by 150 percent of the amount of funds 
returned, since the State agencies returning funds receive a 50 
percent credit in the subsequent year's stability grant, while the 
State agencies to which the returned funds are reallocated have 
their subsequent year's stability grants increased by the full 
amount of the reallocation. If there are increases in 
appropriation levels for the subsequent year, this additional 
liability can be funded. However, if funds in the subsequent year 
are not adequate to meet all stability grants, all State agencies 
share in a grant decrease to accommodate the 50 percent credit. 
Accordingly, to ensure equity, the 50 percent recovery credit is 
deleted in this rule. 




3. Section 246.16 (c)(3)(i)(A) Inflation adjustment. 




The current food funding formula uses a calculation referred to as the 
``targeted inflation factor''. It was designed to provide an 
inflation adjustment proportionate to a State agency's service to 
the highest priority participants. Under this process, the full 
inflation increase is adjusted according to each State agency's 
percentage of participants in the top three priority level 
categories (Priority I-III women, infants and children at 
nutritional or medical risk). For instance, if 75 percent of a 
State agency's participation was in the Priority I to III 
participation categories, and the full inflation rate was 4 
percent, that State agency would receive a targeted inflation rate 
of 3 percent applied against its prior year grant to determine its 
stability grant. An exception is made for Indian State agencies 
which receive full inflation. 




The proposed rule took a more straight-forward approach by 
providing all State agencies with a full inflationary increase as 
long as funds are adequate to do so. If, however, the 
appropriation for any given year is insufficient to support prior 
year grant levels plus full inflation, the proposed funding formula 
would reduce State agency grants to allow for funds allocation 
within available funding. Those State agencies with under fair 
share allocations would receive first priority for any available 
inflationary increases, and State agencies at or above their fair 
share allocation for that fiscal year would receive second 
priority. The proposal sought to assure continued progress in 
increasing the grants of States that are under their fair share. 




All of the commenters addressing this issue were opposed to this 
provision. The consensus was that if funds were insufficient to 
provide full inflationary increases, then all State agencies should 
take a prorata reduction for that fiscal year. The commenters were 
opposed to the two-tier concept and stated that small reductions in 
all State agency grants would be less disruptive to WIC operations 
than large cuts to a few State agencies. 




The Department is persuaded by the concerns raised by commenters on 
this aspect of the proposed rule. Therefore, Section 246.6 
(c)(3)(ii) in this final rule provides that in the event that funds 
are insufficient to support prior year grant levels plus full 
inflation, all state agencies would take a prorata reduction for 
that fiscal year. 




4. Section 246.16 (c)(3)(i)(B) Migrant set-aside. 




Section 17(g)(4) of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 



1786(g)(4)) provides that not less than   9/10 of one percent of the funds 
appropriated for the WIC Program be available first for services to 
migrant women, infants and children. The current regulations 
stipulated that the full 9/10 of one percent set-aside is to be 
subtracted from all States' stability grants and then added to 
stability grants of States that report serving migrants. Because 
these adjustments for the migrant set-aside become part of the base 
grant of stability funds for the next fiscal year, FNS found that 
stability grants were skewed over time, directly causing some State 
agencies to receive more than their fair share of funds while 
preventing other States from receiving their fair share. This 
distorting effect becomes even larger as over-all funding 
increases.

The rule proposed that for State agencies that serve migrants, a 
portion of the grant be designated for service to the migrant 
population. The designated amount would be based on prior year 
migrant participation reported by each State agency. By 
designating a target funding level, the migrant grant will not 
distort subsequent grant allocations, yet will establish service to 
this needy population as a priority. This is an approach similar 
to the one employed to target expenditures for breastfeeding 
promotion and support. 

The Department believes that State agencies must estimate and 
accommodate such changes according to the information available 
from State and local sources. Therefore, it was proposed that, for 
planning purposes, expenditure targets would be established for 
both food grants and nutrition services and administration grants 
to insure that 9/10 of one percent of the appropriation is 

made 
available 

for service to migrants. State agencies would be 
expected to plan for migrant participants as now required in their 
State Plan of Operation and give priority service to migrant 
participants that arrive from another State agency seeking WIC 
services. 

Most of the commenters supported this provision. However, two 
commenters thought the proposed change was unclear and implied 
additional reporting requirements. In addition, it was suggested 
that the methodology to be used be clarified. 

The Department is not imposing any additional reporting 
requirements regarding migrant participants. State agencies will 
continue to report migrant participation as in past years. For 
purposes of clarity, the Department has deleted the last sentence 
in section 246.16(c)(3)(iv) of the proposed regulation which 
erroneously implied that migrant funds would be deducted from the 
State agency's stability allocation. Since this was not the intent 
of the regulation, this language was removed for clarification. 
The remainder of section 246.16(c)(3)(iv), which designates a 
migrant service expenditure target, is adopted final as proposed. 



5. Section 246.16(c)(3)(ii) Allocation of residual funds.



Under the current rule, any funds remaining after stability grants 
are allocated are ``residual funds''. Residual funds are allocated 
under two components_``targeting'' and ``growth''. The Department 
proposed eliminating the targeting component and modifying the 
growth component as discussed below. 



``Targeting'' Component for Food Funds (Section 246.16(c)(3)(ii)(A)) 



As explained in detail in the preamble, the targeting component is 
no longer needed to encourage service to Priority I participants, 
and is a barrier to achieving funding equity among State agencies. 
Therefore, the Department proposed the elimination of the targeting 
component to simplify the formula, and ensure greater funding 
equity based on each State agency's eligible population. 

All of the commenters on this provision supported it, and the final 
rule retains the provision that would eliminate targeting as a 
consideration in funds allocation. However, five commenters stated 
that they would oppose the provision unless all States were 
guaranteed prior year funding levels plus full inflation if funds 
are available. In the event that funds are insufficient, the 
commenters wanted a prorata reduction for all States. These 
concerns were addressed above in the discussion of the stability 
allocation (Section 246.16(c)(3)(ii)). 



``Growth'' Component for Food Funds (Section 246.16(c)(3)(ii)(B)) 



Under the current formula, after targeting funds are allocated, the 
remaining half of residual funds are allocated for ``growth'' within 
State agencies that have less opportunity to serve their eligible 
population compared to other State agencies. Growth funds are 
allocated based primarily on a ``fair share'' concept similar to that 
discussed earlier. To determine fair share funding, FNS used a 
mathematical equation to create an estimate of each State's 
eligible WIC population. The estimate began with each State 
agency's number of income eligibles, currently extracted from 
decennial census data. The estimate is adjusted slightly to 
account for State agency variations in infant mortality and low 
birth weight rates (``health indicators''). Also, women, infants and 
children served by the Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP) 
are subtracted from this estimate for those States in which CSFP 
operates. 

As explained below, the Department proposed retaining the ``growth'' 
component of the formula using only the estimate of income 
eligibles (with some adjustments) and deleting the use of health 
indicators. It was believed that this best defines each State 
agency's actual need for program funds and greatly simplifies the 
``fair share'' equation. Each component and revision of the 
eligibles database for the fair share allocation provided in 
Section 246.16(c)(3)(ii) is discussed below.

Income Eligibles. 

Each State agency's estimate of WIC income 
eligible persons is based on data from the 1990 Decennial Census, 
which reflects population characteristics as of 1989. Although the 
Census data provides the most current State-by-State information, 
the Department recognizes that data which describe a population at 
a fixed point in the past may not accurately reflect recent and 
future socioeconomic and demographic trends. Accordingly, the 
Department is currently exploring other potential data sources for 
the state-level income eligibles estimates. The proposed rule did 
not establish or define the exact source of the eligibles database 
in order to allow for the use of the most timely and reliable data 
as it becomes available. This was supported by the majority of 
commenters who commented on the eligibles data. 

Under the proposed rule, fair share funding allocations would be 
based on estimates of the State agency's eligible population at or 
below 185 percent of poverty rather than estimates of the fully-
eligible population (persons income eligible and at nutritional 
risk). Unlike the national estimate of eligibles, State agency 
allocations are not adjusted for an estimate of fully eligible 
persons as nutritional risk standards vary by State agency and 
application of a ``national'' estimate would serve no useful purpose 
for funding allocation purposes. The State level income-eligible 
estimates were used to determine each State's proportion of the 
national total of WIC income-eligibles. Funding allocations are 
based on this 

proportion

_not on the absolute number of estimated 
income eligibles in each State. Each State agency's fair share 
allocation thus depends on both its proportion of income eligibles 
and the total amount of funds available nationally. 

Most commenters stated that they concur with the proposed ``fair 
share'' concept, but that more timely updates of eligibles data are 
critical. Commenters consistently stated that the current data 
seriously under counts the number of WIC eligibles and they 
strongly encourage FNS to continue working on obtaining new and 
better estimates. However, two commenters stated that FNS should 
withdraw the current proposal until better data is obtained. One 
commenter maintained that Medicaid participants should be included 
in the estimates. One commenter proposed an alternative approach 
similar to fair share using a ``full funding'' concept. However, 
after much consideration of this particular alternative, the 
Department believes that it would impede under fair share State 
agencies progress in moving towards full funding. The Department 
will retain the fair share principle as proposed, using the best 
available indicators to determine each State agency's population of 
income eligibles. At the same time, the Department continues its 
commitment to develop more timely and accurate estimates of 
eligibles to be used in the WIC food funding formula. 



Health Indicators.

 
In the current formula, the calculation of each 
State's eligible WIC population, used to compute its fair share 
allocation, includes an adjustment for certain health indicators 
(infant mortality and low birth weight rates) in the food funding 
formula. As explained in the preamble to the proposed rule, the 
population targeted by the health indicators is now largely served. 
Moreover, as service to the highest risk participants has 
increased, the overall impact of the health indicators on the 
amount of food funds received by States has become negligible. 
Furthermore, the inclusion of the health indicators unduly 
complicates and reduces understanding of the food funding formula. 
Therefore, the Department proposed to eliminate the use of the 
health indicator adjustments. All commenters who commented on this 
provision were supportive of removing the health indicators from 
the formula. Therefore, this final rule retains the provision as 
proposed. 



Adjustments for Higher Cost Areas.

 
The current growth component also makes an adjustment for the higher food costs of four specific State agencies located
outside of the continental United States (or 
Indian State agencies located within their borders). These State 
agencies currently are Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, and the Virgin 
Islands. The Department proposed to retain this adjustment, but to 
allow more flexibility than the current regulation. The majority 
of commenters supported the proposed provision. However, some 
commenters misinterpreted this provision to mean that State 
agencies or portions of State agencies (urban areas, rural areas, 
Indian Tribal organizations) within the continental United States 
(i.e., within the 48 contiguous States and the District of 
Columbia) that can document higher food costs should receive an 
adjustment. Other commenters specifically stated that Puerto Rico 
should be considered as an outlying State agency.

<PARENT> FR941006-0-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

This rule retains the provision as proposed. However, the 
Department would like to clarify that the proposed provision was 
not intended to expand the adjustment for higher cost in areas to 
those State agencies located 

within

 the continental United States. 
At this time, there is no data to support adjustments for areas 
within the continental United States. With regard to Puerto Rico, 
although it is potentially eligible for this adjustment under the 
new provision, it must still demonstrate that it meets the 
requisite requirements set forth in Section 246.16(c)(3)(i)(B). In 
particular, it must document that economic conditions result in 
higher food costs, and that it has successfully implemented 


voluntary

 cost containment measures. 


Adjustments for Indian Tribal Organizations (ITOs) 


The growth allocation for the Indian Tribal Organizations has traditionally 
presented problems due to inadequate data regarding eligibles. The 
Department knows of no data source to resolve this problem. 
Therefore, it proposed to give FNS the authority to oversee 
negotiations between one or more ITOs and the geographic State 
agency or agencies in which the ITO is located. FNS could, acting 
independently or at the request of a State agency, involve affected 
State agencies in an agreement on the temporary or permanent 
transfer of funds. Negotiations could be conducted to shift funds 
among these State agencies to better reflect the actual service 
being provided by each of the State agencies. 
Only a few commenters addressed this provision. The commenters 
were generally in favor of the provision but stressed that caution 
must be used in shifting funds from one State agency to another, 
particularly based on eligibles data that is questionable. In 
addition, there may be a misunderstanding that such grant 
adjustments will occur without input from all affected State 
agencies. The Department would like to clarify that any grant 
adjustments must be agreed upon by all State agencies involved, and 
by FNS. At no time would any affected State agency be left out of 
the negotiation process. 
Additionally, since the proposed rule was published, it has been 
brought to our attention that negotiations may need to also take 
place between two or more ITOs not just between ITOs and geographic 
State agencies. The final rule has been modified to reflect this. 
In all other respects, it remains as proposed. 


Commodity Supplemental Food Program 


The Commodity Supplemental Food Program's (CSFP) service to low-income women, infants and 
children contributes to the Administration's goal of fully funding 
the WIC Program by the end of fiscal year 1996. The fiscal year 
1995 budget request and out year budget targets assume CSFP women, 
infants and children participation will equal the authorized 
caseload level. 
In those States where both CSFP and WIC operate, the current rule 
requires the subtraction from the WIC income eligible database of 
those participants (based on actual, average CSFP participation in 
the prior fiscal year) who are estimated as eligible for the WIC 
Program, but elect to receive benefits under CSFP. As CSFP is 
currently authorized to serve, in addition to WIC eligibles, 5 year 
old children and postpartum women from 6 months to 1 year 
postpartum, not all CSFP participants are categorically eligible 
for the WIC Program. Therefore, FNS assumes that one-fourth of the 
children and one-half of the postpartum women participating in CSFP 
are not eligible for the WIC Program. The balance of CSFP 
participants are subtracted from the WIC eligibles estimate. 
The Department proposed to make three changes to this deduction 
from the WIC eligibles database. First, it proposed to modify the 
method for determining the number of CSFP women, infants and 
children to subtract from the WIC eligibles database. It proposed 
to base the deduction upon the authorized caseload for CSFP women, 
infants and children, rather than actual participation. Second, it 
proposed to base the deduction on the CSFP 

caseload

 authorized at 
the beginning of the caseload cycle of the prior fiscal year 
(generally announced on December 1). Finally, it proposed that the 
adjustment described above for those CSFP participants who are not 
also categorically eligible for WIC (postpartum women from 6 months 
to 1 year postpartum and 5 year old children) would no longer be 
made. The Department believed that utilizing the total CSFP 
caseload level for women, infants and children, rather than actual 
participation, more equitably accounts for the resources provided 
to a State agency to serve the WIC target population under CSFP. 
These changes were intended to ensure that States that do not have 
access to CSFP were not disadvantaged in their access to WIC funds 
when compared with States that operate both programs.

Uniformly, commenters were strongly opposed to reducing the WIC 
eligibles data by the CSFP caseload, particularly with no reduction 
for non-WIC eligibles participating in CSFP. Commenters felt that 
deducting CSFP caseload from the WIC eligibles would improperly 
reduce estimates of income eligibles. They also stated that it was 
inequitable to no longer adjust the deduction to account for non-WIC eligible CSFP recipients. Most commenters suggested
retaining 
the method used in the current formula. However, several 
commenters suggested perhaps there are States that could report WIC 
eligibles actually served by CSFP and then that data could be used 
to determine income eligibles. 
In view of the concerns raised by commenters, the Department has 
decided not to adopt the proposed rule. Instead, the method used 
in the current regulations for deducting the CSFP participants 
eligible for WIC from the WIC income eligible data base will be 
retained. 


Performance Standard 


The Department also proposed to revise the 95 percent performance 
standard which reduces the current year grant for any State agency 
that does not spend at least 95 percent of its food grant. The 
Department is concerned that expenditure of only 95 percent of the 
grant is too generous in the context of a fully funded program. 
While the Department is sympathetic to the difficulties of rapidly 
growing States in meeting the 95 percent expenditure level, State 
agencies with relatively stable funding and participation do not 
face the same difficulties. For State agencies at or exceeding 
their fair share level, expending less than the 95 percent of 
allocated food funds is likely to indicate they have funds they 
cannot use. The Department proposed to retain the 95 percent 
standard for State agencies receiving less than their fair share 
allocation, and to increase the performance standard to 98 percent 
for those at or over their fair share level. 
The majority of commenters were adamantly opposed to two different 
performance standards for over and under fair share State agencies. 
Additionally, most commenters felt the 98 percent performance 
standard was much too stringent and unrealistic due to food cost 
fluctuations, infant formula rebates, variations in participation 
and other factors not directly controlled by the WIC State agency. 
In view of these comments, the final rule deletes the proposed two-tier performance standard for over and under fair
share State 
agencies. However, the Department continues to be concerned that 
unspent funds be directed to States with documented need, 
especially as State demographic and socioeconomic situations 
fluctuate from year to year. This is particularly critical in a 
full funding environment. Therefore, the Department has decided to 
retain a uniform performance standard, and to gradually increase it 
over time. Accordingly, paragraph 246.16 (e)(2)(i) in the final 
rule establishes a 96 percent performance spending standard in 
fiscal years 1995 and 1996, and a 97 percent standard for fiscal 
year 1997 and beyond for all WIC State agencies. 
Additionally, prior to applying the performance standard, the 
current regulations in section 246.16(e)(3)(i) allow for exclusion 
from the grant of food funds that are spent forward into a 
succeeding fiscal year as authorized by section 246.16(b)(3)(ii), 
and (iv) and (v). Since spentforward funds are merely unspent 
funds that the State agency can retain, the Department proposed 
that they should no longer be excluded when assessing spending 
performance. A few commenters opposed this provision, but the 
Department continues to believe that spendforward funds should not 
be deducted when calculating the performance standard. This 
deduction has led to the current situation in which there are 
significant amounts of unspent money moving from one fiscal year to 
another. If not rectified, this will compound the extreme pressure 
that will be placed on all Departmental discretionary spending in 
order to meet the commitment to WIC full funding. Therefore, the 
final rule retains this provision as proposed. Any food funds 
backspent under section 246.16(b)(3)(i) or converted to nutritional 
services and administration (NSA) funds under section 246.16(g) 
will continue to be excluded from the food grant for purposes of 
applying the performance standard. These two reductions are 
appropriate in that they reflect food funds actually expended in 
the current year, and not merely reserved for future use.

Summary of the Final Food Funding Formula 


The foregoing has described the decisions reached on the proposed 
provisions. To ensure that the new formula in this final rule is 
fully understood, the following describes the allocation process 
and provides simplified examples of the funding process. 


Fair Share Allocation Objective 


The funding objective is to give each State agency its fair share 
allocation of funds to the extent funds are available. Funds 
available include funds appropriated for the fiscal year as well as 
unspent funds carried over from the prior fiscal year that State 
agencies have not retained under spendforward authority as provided 
in section 246.16 (b)(3)(ii). An example of a simplified fair 
share allocation is shown below. This example assumes that 
available funds total $5000, and the total number of income 
eligibles is 1000 persons.

Stability Allocation
 


Recognizing that State agencies may already have participants on 
the program supported with the grant funds each State agency 
received in the prior year, the formula strives to protect this 
service depending on total funds available. A stability allocation 
is provided to protect prior year grant levels contingent on 
availability of funds. 
If funds are not adequate to fully fund prior year grants, all 
State agencies will receive a prorata reduction from their prior 
year grant level commensurate with the shortfall of available 
funds. If funds are available, each State agency would receive a 
stability allocation equal to its final authorized grant level as 
of September 30 of the prior fiscal year. If funds are still 
available, all State agencies will receive an inflation adjustment. 
This inflation adjustment will reflect the anticipated rate of food 
cost increases as determined by the Department. Should funds be 
inadequate to fully meet this adjustment, each State agency will 
receive an equal percent inflation increase as permitted by the 
amount of funds available. 


Growth Allocation 


If funds remain after the stability allocation, then these funds 
are provided for a ``

growth allocation

''. The growth allocation 
gives additional funds to each State agency which has an 
inflation-adjusted stability allocation which is less than its fair 
share allocation. The formula subtracts each State agency's 
current year stability allocation from its fair share allocation to 
determine the dollar shortfall. Each State agency's shortfall, as 
a percent of all State agency's shortfalls, yields its percent 
share of the funds available for the growth allocation. 


Example of Formula Allocation Process 


The example below describes allocation steps for stability and 
growth. First, all State agencies have received at least their 
prior year final grant, which totaled $4,500. As $5,000 is 
available to allocate in this case, funds are sufficient to do both 
stability and growth allocations. 
1. 

Stability Allocation.

 All State agencies receive an 
inflationary increase, based on full inflation, to the extent 
permitted by available funding. In this example, available funding 
permits the entire inflationary increase: 







2. 

Growth Allocation.

 Under fair share State agencies get a 
proportion of remaining funds based on the shortfall between their 
fair share allocation and stability grant. In the example below, 
the $365 available for growth funding is shared by States B and C 
according to their respective shortfalls from their fair share 
allocations. 






If any funds allocated in the two steps above cannot be used and 
are declined by one or more State agencies, then these funds are 
allocated, using the method in Step 2, to the under fair share 
State agencies which have the ability to use more funds. If all 
funds are still not distributed, then these remaining funds would 
be allocated to State agencies which have a stability allocation 
which is 

at or greater

 than its fair share allocation. Each of 
these State agencies which can document the need for additional 
funds will be eligible to receive additional funds based on the 
difference between its stability allocation level and fair share 
allocation. State agencies closest to their fair share allocation 
shall receive first consideration. The Department recognizes that 
being at or over fair share is a statistical definition that may or 
may not accurately indicate the actual need for funding to serve 
all eligibles within that State. Therefore, over fair share States 
must have the opportunity to receive additional funds, should the 
funding be available. 
For instance, in the example above, State A would be able to 
receive funds declined by State B or C. In this way, the 
precedence for funding will be to increase funding to under fair 
share State agencies to the extent possible, while still allowing 
State agencies that are over their fair share level to receive 
additional funds when a documented need for additional funds 
exists. Additionally, over fair share States must demonstrate 
effective efforts to control food package costs. All grants 
awarded through this process would become the basis of the 
following year's stability allocation.

Accordingly, 7 CFR Part 246 is amended as follows: 


PART 246_SPECIAL SUPPLEMENTAL FOOD PROGRAM FOR WOMEN, INFANTS AND 
CHILDREN 



1. The authority citation for part 246 continues to read as 
follows: 






Authority:

 42 U.S.C. 1786.




2. In  246.16: 

a. Paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(3) and (e)(2)(i) are revised; and 
b. Paragraph (r) is redesignated as paragraph (p) and all 
internal references to the redesignated paragraph are revised. 
The revisions read as follows: 



 246.16 

Distribution of funds. 



* * * * * 



(c) 

Allocation formula.

 * * * 

(1) 

Use of participation data in the formula.

 Wherever the 
formula set forth in paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section 
require the use of participation data, the Department shall use 
participation data reported by State agencies according to 
 246.25(b). 



* * * * * 



(3) 

Allocation of food benefit funds. 

In any fiscal year, any 
amounts remaining from amounts appropriated for such fiscal year 
and amounts appropriated from the preceding fiscal year after 
making allocations under paragraph (a)(6) of this section and 
allocations for nutrition services and administration (NSA) as 
required by paragraph (c)(2) of this section shall be made 
available for food costs. Allocations to State agencies for food 
costs will be determined according to the following procedure: 

(i) 

Fair share allocation. 

(A) For each State agency, establish a 
fair share allocation which shall be an amount of funds 
proportionate to the State agency's share of the national aggregate 
population of persons who are income eligible to participate in the 
Program based on the 185 percent of poverty criterion. The 
Department will determine each State agency's population of persons 
categorically eligible for WIC which are at or below 185% of 
poverty, through the best available, nationally uniform, indicators 
as determined by the Department. If the Commodity Supplemental 
Food Program (CSFP) also operates in the area served by the WIC 
State agency, the number of participants in such area participating 
in the CSFP but otherwise eligible to participate in the WIC 
Program, as determined by FNS, shall be deducted from the WIC State 
agency's population of income eligible persons. 

(B) The Department may adjust the respective amounts of food funds 
that would be allocated to a State agency which is outside the 48 
contiguous states and the District of Columbia when the State 
agency can document that economic conditions result in higher food 
costs for the State agency. Prior to any such adjustment, the 
State agency must demonstrate that it has successfully implemented 
voluntary cost containment measures, such as improved vendor 
management practices, participation in multi-state agency infant 
formula rebate contracts or other cost containment efforts. The 
Department may use the Thrifty Food Plan amounts used in the Food 
Stamp Program, or other available data, to formulate adjustment 
factors for such State agencies. 

(ii) 

Stability allocation. 

If funds are available, each State 
agency shall receive a stability allocation equal to its final 
authorized grant level as of September 30 of the prior fiscal year 
plus a full inflation increase. The inflation factor shall reflect 
the anticipated rate of food cost increases as determined by the 
Department. If funds are not available to provide all State 
agencies with their full stability allocation, all State agencies 
shall receive a prorata reduction from their full stability 
allocation as required by the short fall of available funds.

(iii) 

Growth allocation

. (A) If additional funds remain available 
after the allocation of funds under (c)(3)(ii) of this section, 
each State agency which has a stability allocation, as calculated 
in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, which is less than its 
fair share allocation shall receive additional funds based on the 
difference between its stability allocation and fair share 
allocation. Each State agency's difference shall be divided by the 
total of the differences for all such State agencies, to determine 
the percent share of the available growth funds each State agency 
shall receive. In the event a State agency declines any of its 
allocation in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section or this 
paragraph, the funds declined shall be allocated to the remaining 
State agencies which are still under their fair share. 

(B) In the event funds still remain after completing the 
distribution in paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, these 
funds shall be allocated to all State agencies including those with 
a stability allocation at, or greater than, their fair share 
allocation. Each State agency which can document the need for 
additional funds shall receive additional funds based on the 
difference between its prior year grant level and its fair share 
allocation. State agencies closest to their fair share allocation 
shall receive first consideration. 

(iv) 

Migrant services

. At least 9/10 of one percent of 
appropriated funds for each fiscal year shall be available first to 
assure service to eligible members of migrant populations. For 
those State agencies serving migrants, a portion of the grant shall 
be designated to each State agency for service to members of 
migrant populations based on that State agency's prior year 
reported migrant participation. The national aggregate amount made 
available first for this purpose shall equal 9/10 of one percent of 
all funds appropriated each year for the Program. 

(v) 

Special provisions for Indian State agencies

. The Department 
may choose to adjust the allocations and/or eligibles data among 
Indian State agencies, or among Indian State agencies and the 
geographic State agencies in which they are located when eligibles 
data for the State agencies' population is determined to not fairly 
represent the population to be served. Such allocations may be 
redistributed from one State agency to another, based on negotiated 
agreements among the affected State agencies approved by FNS. 



* * * * * 



(e) 

Recovery and reallocation of funds. 



* * * * * 



(2) Performance standards. * * * 

(i) The amount allocated to any State agency for food benefits in 
the current fiscal year shall be reduced if such State agency's 
food expenditures for the preceding fiscal year do not equal or 
exceed 96 percent of the amount allocated to the State agency for 
such costs for fiscal year 1995 and fiscal year 1996 and 97 percent 
for fiscal year 1997 and beyond. Such reduction shall equal the 
difference between the State agency's preceding year food 
expenditures and the performance expenditure standard amount. For 
purposes of determining the amount of such reduction, the amount 
allocated to the State agency for food benefits for the preceding 
fiscal year shall not include food funds expended for food costs 
incurred under the spendback provision in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of 
this section or conversion authority in paragraph (g) of this 
section. Temporary waivers of the performance standard may be 
granted at the discretion of the Department.

Oranges and Grapefruit Grown in the Lower Rio Grande Valley in Texas; Revision of Special Purpose Exemption Provisions



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This final rule revises the administrative rules and regulations in effect under the Texas citrus marketing order.
The revision eliminates the provision which exempts fruit handled for home use from the order's grade, size, pack,
container, inspection and assessment requirements. This rule will help prevent unauthorized shipments of uninspected
citrus from being shipped out of the production area. Individuals will continue to be able to handle up to 400 pounds
of citrus per day exempt from order requirements which should be sufficient for fruit purchased for home use.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 906 [7 CFR part 906] regulating the handling of oranges
and grapefruit grown in the Lower Rio Grande Valley in Texas, hereinafter referred to as the order. The order is effective
under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601-674], hereinafter referred
to as the Act. 


The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This final rule is not intended to have
retroactive effect. This final rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they
present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
8c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a
hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district
court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of
business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is
filed not later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. 
Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. 
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
There are approximately 15 handlers of oranges and grapefruit regulated under the order each season and approximately
750 orange and grapefruit producers in Texas. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business
Administration [13 CFR  121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural
service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. The majority of these handlers
and producers may be classified as small entities.
Section 906.40 of the order authorizes the establishment of grade, size, quality, maturity, pack and container requirements
for fresh shipments of Texas oranges and grapefruit. Whenever such requirements are in effect, oranges and grapefruit
are required to be inspected and certified as meeting applicable standards in accordance with  906.45 of the
order. The program is financed through handler assessments, established pursuant to  906.34. 
The order provides, in  906.42, that regulations issued under   906.34, 906.40, and 906.45 may
be modified, 
suspended or terminated to facilitate the handling of citrus fruit for certain purposes. Under this authority,  906.120
of the order's rules and regulations provides that oranges and grapefruit may be handled for relief, charity or home
use exempt from order requirements. Handlers desiring to utilize this exemption are required to apply to the Texas
Valley Citrus Committee (committee), the agency established to administer the order locally. In making an application,
the handler is required to submit information such as the quantity of fruit to be handled under the exemption and its
intended destination. Based on the information provided, the committee determines whether to approve the application
and issue the handler a certificate of privilege. 
The committee met on May 10, 1994, and unanimously recommended revising paragraph (c)(1) of  906.120 by deleting
``home use'' from the provision which allows fruit to be handled exempt from regulation. Current regulations allow
for an unlimited amount of fruit to be shipped for home use (not for resale) exempt from all marketing order requirements.
The committee recommended this amendment to reduce the potential for abuse of the home use exemption. The committee
has had difficulty in verifying the final disposition of exempted fruit. 
This final rule revises  906.120(c)(1) by deleting the phrase ``home use''. The committee expressed concern
that bulk loads of uninspected fruit may enter fresh, commercial markets and prove detrimental to producer returns
if the exemption is not removed. 
Other exemptions from order requirements remain unchanged. Under paragraph (a) of  906.120, individuals
will continue to be able to handle up to 400 pounds of citrus per day exempt from order requirements. The committee believes
that this minimum quantity exemption is sufficient to cover fruit purchased for home use and not for resale. Thus,
it is not expected that this action will adversely impact those persons who purchase Texas oranges and grapefruit
directly from handlers for their own use. 
A proposed rule concerning this revision was issued on July 21, 1994, and published in the 

Federal Register

 on July 27, 1994, [59 FR 38138]. That rule provided a 30-day comment period which ended August 26, 1994. No comments
were received.

The information collection requirements contained in the referenced sections have been previously approved by
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. chapter 35 and have been assigned OMB number
0581-0068 for Texas oranges and grapefruit. 
This rule reduces the reporting burden on approximately 6 handlers of oranges and grapefruit who have been completing
the Special Purpose Shipments Form (Application for fundraiser-specialty pack), taking about 5 minutes to complete
each report. 
Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including the information and recommendations submitted
by the committee and other available information, it is hereby found that this final rule, as hereinafter set forth,
will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rescission of rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On April 5, 1994, the FDIC published for comment a proposal to rescind a section of its regulations on notification
of rapid growth. The FDIC is publishing herewith a final rule to rescind this section. 


The section, known as the ``rapid growth rule,'' currently requires all insured banks, with the exception of insured
bankers' banks, to give the FDIC prior notice of planned rapid growth as a result of any ``special funding plan or arrangement.''
For purposes of this requirement, such a funding plan is any effort to increase the assets of a bank through the solicitation
and acceptance of fully insured deposits obtained from or through the mediation of brokers or affiliates (which would
include insured brokered deposits); the solicitation of fully insured deposits outside a bank's normal trade area;
or secured borrowings, including repurchase agreements. 
This rescission is intended to lessen the regulatory burden on banks which are currently also required to comply with
the FDIC's brokered deposit regulation and the prompt corrective action rule, both of which were designed in part
to address the same risks resulting from rapid growth.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


Although rapid growth is not necessarily an indicator of unsafe or unsound banking practices, and many banks have
been able to manage rapid growth safely, rapid growth does present special risks to a bank (and to the FDIC's insurance
fund). Because these risks warrant special monitoring, the FDIC adopted a rule requiring advance notice to the FDIC
of planned rapid growth. That provision of the FDIC's regulations, 12 CFR 304.6, known as ``the rapid growth rule,''
states that an insured bank may not undertake any special funding plan or arrangement designed to increase its assets
by more than 7.5 percent during any consecutive three-month period without first notifying the appropriate FDIC
regional director for supervision in writing at least 30 days before the implementation of the special funding plan
or arrangement. A special funding plan or arrangement is defined as any effort to increase the assets of a bank through
(1) the solicitation and acceptance of fully insured deposits obtained from or through the mediation of brokers or
affiliates (which would include insured brokered deposits), (2) the solicitation of fully insured deposits outside
a bank's normal trade area (depending upon the circumstances, these may be insured brokered deposits) or (3) secured
borrowings, including repurchase agreements.

In regulating rapid growth, the rapid growth rule in part overlaps both the FDIC's brokered deposit regulation, 
12 CFR 337.6, and its prompt corrective action regulation, 
12 CFR 308.200 

et seq.

 and 325.101 

et seq.

 With the rescission of the rapid growth rule, the brokered deposit and prompt corrective action regulations are now
the principal means by which rapid growth will be regulated. In deciding whether to rescind the rapid growth rule,
the FDIC examined the rationale and history behind all three regulations, to see if the FDIC's safety-and-soundness
concerns will be satisfied without the rapid growth rule. 
The rapid growth rule, adopted in 1990, replaced a regulation that called for the reporting of fully insured brokered
deposits and fully insured deposits placed directly by other depository institutions. In the preamble to the proposed
rapid growth rule, the FDIC stated that its intention was to broaden the prior regulation's focus from brokered deposits
to other funding of rapid growth, including brokered deposits:

 

Since a bank may obtain its funding from a variety of sources in addition to brokered deposits, the FDIC believes that
any effort to monitor and control rapid growth in insured banks should not focus solely or even principally on brokered
deposits. Instead, the focus should be on rapid growth 

per se

 as an indication of the need for close monitoring and supervisory oversight.

 

54 FR 13693, April 5, 1989. The proposed rapid growth rule stated that

 

An insured bank may not undertake any special funding plan or arrangement designed to increase its assets by more than
nine percent during any consecutive three-month period without first notifying the appropriate FDIC regional director
for supervision in writing at least 30 days in advance of the implementation of the special funding plan or arrangement.
For purposes of this requirement, a special funding plan or arrangement is any effort to rapidly increase the assets
of the bank by any means.

 



Id.

 at 13695. The final rule changed the 9 percent to 7.5 percent, making the rule more stringent in that respect, but it
narrowed the scope of the rule by making the notice necessary only if there was 7.5 percent growth resulting from one
or more of the following activities: (1) The solicitation and acceptance of fully insured deposits obtained from
or through the mediation of brokers or affiliates (which would include insured brokered deposits); (2) the solicitation
of fully insured deposits outside a bank's normal trade area (this category would also include some insured brokered
deposits); or (3) secured borrowings, including repurchase agreements. Thus, while it is not the sole aim of the rapid
growth rule to curb the rapid growth that may result from the acceptance of brokered deposits, controlling a bank's
acceptance of brokered deposits is one of the primary aims of that rule. 


Although the rapid growth rule was not mandated by any statute, the history of the present brokered deposit regulation
involves two statutes, the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) and the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA). In 1989, FIRREA amended the Federal Deposit
Insurance Act (FDI Act), prohibiting an undercapitalized institution from accepting funds obtained, directly
or indirectly, by or through any deposit broker for deposit into one or more deposit accounts except upon specific
application to, and waiver of the prohibition by, the FDIC. Section 224 of FIRREA, adding section 29 to the FDI Act,
12 U.S.C. 1831f. In addition to deposits obtained through the mediation of third-party brokers, the definition of
``brokered deposits'' included deposits on which an institution offers or has agreed to pay rates of interest that
are ``significantly'' higher than the prevailing rates of interest offered by other depository institutions with
the same type of charter in the first institution's normal market area. 
Two years later, the FDI Act was amended again. This time, FDICIA rewrote section 29 of the Act to restrict 
the acceptance of brokered deposits by certain institutions on the basis of their capital levels. Section 301 of FDICIA,
amending section 29 of the FDI Act and adding section 29A thereto, 12 U.S.C. 1831f, 1831f-1. According to FDICIA
and the brokered deposit regulation implementing it, 12 CFR 337.6, undercapitalized institutions may not accept
brokered deposits at all, and adequately capitalized institutions must obtain a waiver from the FDIC before they
can accept brokered deposits. Further, FDICIA limits the interest rates which adequately capitalized institutions
can pay on brokered deposits. Well-capitalized insured depository institutions, however, can accept, renew or
roll over brokered deposits without first obtaining a waiver from the FDIC, and without being limited in the interest
rates they can pay.

In addition to these restrictions on brokered deposits, FDICIA also established a comprehensive regulatory scheme
for insured depository institutions based on their capital levels. Section 131 of FDICIA, adding section 38 to the
FDI Act, 12 U.S.C. 1831o. Under the ``prompt corrective action'' provisions of FDICIA, the statute places severe
constraints on what undercapitalized institutions can do, including severe restrictions on asset growth. As explained
in the regulation which implements section 131 of FDICIA, 12 CFR 308.200 

et seq.

 and 325.101 

et seq.,

 and which took effect on December 19, 1992, as soon as a bank receives notice, or is deemed to have received notice, that
it is undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized, the bank must restrict
the growth of its assets as set forth in section 38(e)(3) of the FDI Act. That section of the Act states that an undercapitalized
insured depository institution shall not permit its average total assets during any calendar quarter to exceed its
average total assets during the preceding calendar quarter unless: (1) The appropriate Federal banking agency has
accepted the institution's capital restoration plan; (2) any increase in total assets is consistent with the plan;
and (3) the institution's ratio of tangible equity to assets increases during the calendar quarter at a rate sufficient
to enable the institution to become adequately capitalized within a reasonable time. 
12 U.S.C. 1831o(e)(3). 
In view of the above statutes and regulations, the FDIC considered whether there was a continuing need for the rapid
growth rule. Under the rule, the FDIC, upon being informed by a bank that it is about to undergo rapid growth, can engage
the institution in a dialogue as to whether such growth would be prudent and should be pursued. Under the brokered deposit
and prompt corrective action regulations, restrictions on brokered deposits and rapid growth attach automatically
to certain banks having an insufficient capital level. Thus, although the rapid growth rule operates somewhat differently
from the brokered deposit and prompt corrective action regulations, the FDIC felt that the rapid growth rule is no
longer necessary given the existence of those other two regulations. For this reason, the FDIC proposed (59 FR 15869,
April 5, 1994) that the rapid growth rule be rescinded. This action would ease the regulatory burden on those institutions
now subject to all three rules. 
While the rapid growth rule overlaps the brokered deposit regulation and the prompt corrective action regulation,
this overlap is only partial. For instance, rescinding the rapid growth rule would mean that an insured bank would
no longer have to notify the FDIC before it either solicited fully insured deposits outside its normal trade area,
or when it acquired secured borrowings, including repurchase agreements, if one or a combination of both of these
activities were designed to increase the bank's assets by more than 7.5 percent during any consecutive three-month
period. And while a well-capitalized bank planning to accept brokered deposits on a large scale would no longer have
to inform the FDIC of this fact in advance once the rapid growth rule is rescinded, that bank still must report the amount
of brokered money it has accepted after the fact in its quarterly Report of Condition and Income (``Call Report'').
Also, deposit brokers must continue to register with the FDIC, and, if requested, could be required to provide data
on the extent of a given bank's brokered deposit activities, under the brokered deposit regulation. With rescission
of the rapid growth rule, some of the rapid growth resulting from rapid growth rule activities will continue to be detected
by the FDIC's Growth Monitoring System (a system administered by the FDIC's Division of Supervision which identifies
rapid growth over a single quarter in assets or loans and long-term securities and any related deterioration in key
performance ratios), some rapid growth will be controlled or prohibited by the brokered deposit rule, and some will
be prohibited by the regulation on prompt corrective action, but a small part of rapid growth might not be controlled
or detected at all. Thus, comment was sought on whether the rescission of the rapid growth rule would create a regulatory
gap that would have harmful effects on banking.

Public Comment 


The FDIC received only four comment letters on the proposal, three from banking trade associations and one from the
parent company of several insured banks. All four comment letters enthusiastically supported the rescission of
the rapid growth rule. 
One commenter acknowledged that the rescission would create a regulatory gap_in that neither the brokered deposit
rule nor the prompt corrective action rule limits the activities of well-capitalized institutions_but the same
commenter believed that this gap would not pose a significant supervisory risk due to the FDIC's system of Call Reports
and its Growth Monitoring System. A second commenter echoed these sentiments, adding that rescission would reduce
an unnecessary regulatory burden. The third commenter opined that rescission of the rapid growth rule would have
no negative impact on the banking system; on the contrary, rescission would remove unnecessary reporting burdens
and marketing restrictions. The fourth commenter added that, given the trend toward consolidation in the banking
industry, most institutions will soon be so big that fewer and fewer of them will ever achieve the percentage of rapid
growth necessary to trigger the rapid growth rule. 
After considering these comments and staff analysis of the issues noted above, the FDIC has decided to rescind the
rapid growth rule. (In rescinding the rapid growth rule, 12 CFR 304.6, the FDIC will also rescind the line on the table
in 12 CFR 304.7, which pertains to the Office of Management and Budget's Control Number for the rapid growth rule.)



Paperwork Reduction Act 


The collection of information contained in the rapid 
growth rule, which consists of the required written notice of rapid growth, has been approved by the Office of Management
and Budget under Control Number 3064-0074, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

). The current estimate of annual reporting burden for the collection of information in this regulation is 1,625 burden
hours. Rescission of the rapid growth rule will result in a saving of 1,625 burden hours a year. 


Regulatory Flexibility Act 


The FDIC's Board of Directors has concluded that the final rule will not impose a significant economic hardship on
small institutions. The rule does not establish any recordkeeping or reporting requirements that necessitate the
expertise of specialized accountants, lawyers or managers. The rule would, in fact, reduce the reporting requirements
to which banks are presently subject. Rescinding the rapid growth rule will afford some insured banks the opportunity
to conduct activities previously prohibited unless notice were given in accordance with the rule (for instance,
the solicitation of fully insured deposits outside a bank's normal trade area, or the acquisition of secured borrowings,
including repurchase agreements, such that one or a combination of both activities were designed to increase the
bank's assets by more than 7.5 percent during any consecutive three-month period). 
The FDIC's Board of Directors therefore certifies pursuant to section 605 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act 
(5 U.S.C. 605) that the final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

).

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the animal drug regulations to reflect approval of a supplemental
new animal drug application (NADA) filed by Merck Research Laboratories, Division of Merck & Co., Inc. The NADA
provides for use of a 1 percent ivermectin injection for cattle for the treatment and control of gastrointestinal
roundworm, lungworm, grub, lice, and mange mite infections. The supplement provides for revised tolerances for
residues of ivermectin in cattle tissues.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Merck Research Laboratories, Division of Merck & Co., Inc., P.O. Box 2000, Rahway, NJ 07065, is sponsor of NADA
128-409 that provides for the use of Ivomec

 

 1 percent Injection (ivermectin) for cattle for the treatment and control of gastrointestinal roundworm, lungworm,
grub, lice, and mange mite infections. The supplement provides for revised tolerances for residues of ivermectin
in cattle liver of 100 parts per billion (ppb) and revised safe concentrations in cattle muscle of 120 ppb, in liver
of 240 ppb, in kidney of 360 ppb, and in fat of 480 ppb. The supplement is approved as of September 12, 1994, and the regulations
in 21 CFR 556.344 are amended to reflect the approval. The basis of approval is discussed in the freedom of information
summary.


Currently,  556.344(a) (21 CFR 556.344(a)) provides identical tolerances for ivermectin residues in cattle
and reindeer. With the approval of this supplement, those tolerances will no longer be identical. Therefore,  556.344(a)
will reflect the revised cattle tolerances and new  556.344(d) is established to reflect the reindeer tolerances.
In accordance with the freedom of information provisions of part 20 (21 CFR part 20) and  514.11(e)(2)(ii) (21
CFR 514.11(e)(2)(ii)), a summary of safety and effectiveness data and information submitted to support approval
of this application may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, rm.
1-23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
 Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b(c)(2)(F)(iii)), this
supplement does not qualify for marketing exclusivity because the supplement does not contain reports of new clinical
or field investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) essential to the approval and conducted
or sponsored by the applicant.
The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(d)(1)(i) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.

Statutory Authority 



This interim rule provides regulatory guidance in accordance with the Department of Justice Appropriations Act,
1995, Title VIII of Pub. L. 103-317, 108 Stat. 1724, 1778 (``Appropriation Act''), which provides $130 million
for the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program for Fiscal Year 1995. Section 501 of the Immigration Reform and Control
Act of 1986 (IRCA), as amended (8 U.S.C. 1365), authorizes the Attorney General to reimburse the States for costs associated
with the incarceration of illegal criminal aliens. 

Title II, subtitle C, section 20301, of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, Pub. L. 103-322, which
amends section 242 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1252), also authorizes reimbursement to State
and local governments for the costs associated with incarceration of undocumented criminal aliens, and authorizes,
as well, the option of federal incarceration of such criminals. 

The program authorized by the Crime Bill, though similar to section 501 of IRCA, differs in certain respects. One issue
raised by the differences among the two statutes is whether local governments can apply for reimbursement. The Crime
Bill language authorizes reimbursement to State and local governments. However, the Appropriations Act only provides
reimbursement to States. The Appropriations Act provided funding for FY 1995 only for State reimbursement pursuant
to section 501 of IRCA. No funding has yet been provided for the program authorized by the Crime Bill. Accordingly,
the interim rule only implements the Appropriations Act and section 501 of IRCA. When funding is made available in
the future to implement the Crime Bill Program, this rule will be amended to effectuate it. 

The Appropriations Act provides that one-third of the funds must be distributed within 120 days of the start of the
fiscal year and that final applications be received from all States by September 30, 1995. In addition, regulations
prescribing the distribution of these sums must be promulgated to govern the process. These regulations must: 

(a) Prescribe requirements for program participation eligibility for States; 
(b) Require verification by States of the eligible incarcerated population with the Immigration and Naturalization
Service (INS); 
(c) Prescribe a formula for distributing assistance to eligible States; and, 
(d) Award assistance to eligible States. 



Background 



The presence of illegal criminal aliens in this country has presented a formidable challenge to State law enforcement
officials and policy makers. Some States with disproportionate numbers of undocumented aliens have been particularly
challenged by this population in light of crowded State prison facilities, which have made it exceedingly difficult
to keep up with the burdens of incarcerating these individuals. 

BJA commissioned a study, conducted by the Urban Institute, entitled ``Fiscal Impacts of Undocumented Aliens: Selected
Estimates for Seven States'' (1994), which focused on the seven States in which the largest majority of aliens are
concentrated (Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, New York, Texas) and that are most affected by
illegal immigration. The study estimates that incarcerated illegal aliens number 21,215 in these States. California
alone, according to this study, had 71% of all these incarcerated aliens. The Urban Institute study also estimates
the numbers and costs per State of incarcerating illegal criminal aliens. The Study will be used to make preliminary
distribution of funds as is explained below. 

Aliens covered by the program are defined within the authorizing legislation and this regulation in some detail.
Essentially the term refers to foreign-born persons who entered the United States without inspection or who entered
the United States legally as non-immigrants, but whose period of authorized stay expired before commission of the
crime for which they are incarcerated. Only those illegal aliens convicted of a felony are included. 

In keeping with the mandate that one-third of the funds be distributed within the first 120 days, BJA will make an initial
award to the seven States covered in the Urban Institute Study based on the estimates contained in the study. The rationale
for this initial procedure, described in more detail hereafter, is that use of an independent estimate of number of
aliens and cost of incarceration will allow an equitable but quick calculation of partial award amounts for these
States, without need to await the type of substantial documentation necessary for final awards, as described herein.
The known burden upon their correctional systems due to criminal aliens justifies immediate assistance to these
seven States. 

No reliable estimates are available for other potential applicants, but the overall administration plan described
herein will result in an equitable distribution of FY 1995 funds to all eligible applicants on a reimbursement basis.

Final awards will be made to all States after the close of FY 1995 based on verified numbers of illegal criminal aliens
and costs. All States, the District of Columbia, Guam, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands (hereafter
included in the term ``State'') would be eligible for these final awards. All awards will be calculated against the
total amount of $130 million (as a proportion of actual cost) with any amounts initially awarded being subtracted
from final awards to the same applicants. 
In following years, when appropriations are made, one award cycle after the close of the fiscal year will be based on
each State's documentation of that year's number of illegal criminal aliens and costs of incarceration. 
Each State is asked to designate an administrative agency, which would presumably be their Department of Corrections,
but can be any other State agency. All States must submit applications within the prescribed time periods to receive
awards pursuant to this program. The application must conform with the requirements set out below. Each State will
receive a proportion of total costs expended each year on the incarceration of an illegal alien. The formula will be
based on the number of States that wish to participate in this program and the figures submitted in their applications.

BJA, in cooperation with INS, will work together to ensure that all information submitted is verified and supports
the final awards made. 
Comment is particularly solicited on the issue of whether or not the definition of custody in  82.3 should be
expanded to include local/county facilities which are housing criminal alien felons as defined herein. Should the
coverage of this program be so expanded, the State would remain the primary Grantee and would be responsible for administering
or sub-granting funds to local entities for program purposes. Also, comments on the verification provisions in Section
82.8 are especially welcomed. 



Administrative Requirements 


This regulation has been drafted and reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866, section 1(b), Principles
of Regulation. This rule is a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866, section 3(f), Regulatory
Planning and Review, and accordingly this rule has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. 
The Director, BJA, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this regulation
and by approving it certifies that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities. 
The information collection requirement contained in this rule has been cleared by the Office of Management and Budget
(OMB) under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3504(h). The OMB control number for this collection
is 1121-0183. 
This regulation is being published as an interim final rule, without prior publication of notice and comment, and
is made effective immediately, for good cause as explained below. Under 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(2), matters relating to grants
are exempted from notice and comment requirements. Moreover, in this case, advance notice and comment would be impractical,
unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest in the prompt implementation of this grant program. The Appropriations
Act requires that the first one-third of the available funds must be distributed by January 1995. In order to comply
with that requirement, these regulations must be effective immediately so that eligible states can apply for the
preliminary grants. Publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking and awaiting receipt of comments would delay significantly
the implementation of this grant program. Such delay would be contrary to the public interest and would contradict
the Congressional intent to provide immediate grant assistance to the states most impacted by the cost of incarcerating
illegal aliens. However, BJA is very interested in receiving public comment on all aspects of this program and will
consider all such comments fully in preparing a final rule.

by Congress pursuant to the standards of Public Law 103-317 and to section 501 of the Immigration Reform and Control
Act of 1986 (IRCA), (8 U.S.C. 1365), to provide assistance to the States for the cost of incarceration of illegal criminal
aliens. 


 82.2 

Reimbursement of States. 


Under section 501 of IRCA, the Attorney General shall reimburse any State which applies for a grant for the costs incurred
by the State for the incarceration of any illegal criminal alien who is convicted of a felony by such State, to the extent
an appropriation is made for such a purpose for any fiscal year. This program will be administered by the Bureau of Justice
Assistance (BJA). 


 82.3 

Definitions. 


(a) 

Illegal criminal alien

 means an alien who has been convicted of a felony and is in the custody of a State; and who: 
(1) Entered into the United States without inspection or at any time or any place other than as designated by the Attorney
General; or 
(2) Was admitted as a nonimmigrant and before the date of the commission of the crime had failed to maintain the nonimmigrant
status in which the alien was admitted or to which it was changed under section 248 of Immigration and Nationality Act
(8 U.S.C. 1258), or to comply with the conditions of any such status; or 
(3) Is a Mariel Cuban as defined in Section 501 of IRCA. 
(b) 

State 

means any State of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin
Islands of the United States. 
(c) 

Compensation 

means the pro-rata average cost of incarcerating the alien in the relevant State as documented by the State. 
(d) 

Cost 

means routine operating expenses, as generally defined and used by the Bureau of the Census and the Bureau of Justice
Statistics (BJS) for reporting purposes. See, e.g., ``Census of State and Federal Correctional Facilities, 1990.''
Capital expenses, expenses reimbursed by other Federal funds, and other non-routine costs should be eliminated
from the baseline for per bed estimates. 
(e) 

Custody 

means any State correctional facility for the confinement or rehabilitation of individuals convicted of criminal
offenses within the State. 

(f) 

Reimbursement period 

means the federal fiscal year, October 1 through September 30, for which an appropriation is made. 



 82.4 

Allocation and use of funds. 


(a) The program will reimburse the States for partial expenses incurred by them for criminal aliens incarcerated
in facilities within the State during the reimbursement period. The State shall designate an administrative agency
to administer the program. A budget or expenditure plan is not required, as the award will be used solely for reimbursement
purposes. Matching funds are not required.

<TEXT>
 

(b) Awards will be based on the average number of aliens incarcerated by each applicant during the reimbursement period
multiplied by the average inmate cost per year, divided into the appropriation for that reimbursement period. Each
State will receive the same percentage of actual cost. In FY 1995, Congress has appropriated a total of $130 million
for the purpose of making grants to States. 

(c) Reimbursement will be based on an average of four one-day counts of individual aliens housed by the State during
the reimbursement period (i.e., one year). These four counts must fall within the period from October 1 through September
30 of the reimbursement year and be evenly spaced. For example, for this fiscal year 1995, counts could be November
15, 1994 and February 15, May 15 and August 15, 1995 or December 23, 1994, and March 24, June 23, and September 22, 1995.


(d) Applicants are expected to provide some narrative explanation of the method used for these counts and the type
of records underlying the counts. BJA will consult with the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) in determining
the validity of the applicant's average alien count. 

(e) Each State's application narrative must also provide an average cost per bed space, per year, supported by descriptive
information indicating how these actual costs of incarceration, incurred during the period for which they are seeking
reimbursement, were derived. This method takes into account the widely varying costs of incarceration in the different
States. BJA will consult with BJS in determining the validity of applicant's average inmate costs per year. 

(f) If a State uses a fiscal year different than the Federal fiscal year (October 1 to September 30), the State may use
cost of incarceration calculations based upon its own fiscal year calculations. The reimbursement period, however,
will still be based on the Federal fiscal year, and the four one-day counts of individual aliens pursuant to paragraph
(c) of this action should fall within the reimbursement period. 

(g) In addition each State will be asked to provide specific information on each individual alien included in any one
of the four one-day counts. An unduplicated listing containing this information must be provided in hard copy and
should also be provided in an automated data entry format, if possible. The following information should be provided:


(1) Name (last name first). 

(2) AKA (also known as) and full surnames. 

(3) Alien Identification number (e.g., A24 456 789) if any. 

(4) Social Security number, if any. 

(5) Inmate Number. 

(6) Date of Birth. 

(7) Place of Birth. 

(8) Primary Conviction Offense and Longest Sentence Imposed. 

(9) Probable Earliest Release Date. 

(10) Incarcerating Facility. 

(11) INS Detainer Number, if any. 



 82.5 



Method for calculating distribution of funds. 



(a) Assistance amounts will be calculated on a pro rata or proportional share of actual costs of incarceration as borne
by the State. That is, there will not be a national average payment per alien or bed space, but rather a percentage, applied
across the board, to each State's actual costs for each bed space filled. This percentage will depend on the total amount
of the appropriation by Congress for the fiscal year and the total amount of actual costs incurred by all applying States
during the reimbursement period. 

(b) The ``formula'' thus becomes: State A's average number of aliens incarcerated that year times its average cost
for a bed space filled by any prisoner during that year 

plus 

State B's average number of aliens incarcerated that year times its average cost for a bed spaces filled by any prisoner
during that year 

plus

 State C's * * *, etc., for all applicant States. This provides a total dollar amount of all assistance
requested. The actual appropriation provided for the fiscal year divided by that total dollar amount provides a ratio
or percentage, e.g., 15% or 25%, which is then applied to each State's total request to calculate their actual award
amount. It is not anticipated that the FY 1995 appropriation will allow 100% reimbursement of actual costs. However,
each State will receive the same percentage of actual costs as all others.

 82.6 



Preliminary awards. 



(a) During FY 1995, this first year of the program, in keeping with the Congressional directive to make one-third of
the funds available as soon as possible, a preliminary award will be made to some States. A preliminary award amounting
to approximately one-third of the funds available will be made to applicants from the States named below, if their
applications are received by BJA by November 30, 1994. Application should be made on the Federal Standard Form 424,
and include all assurances and certifications required by law. BJA will provide applicants with these forms as necessary.
An original and three copies of the application are required. 

(b) While the amount of these preliminary awards will not be based on actual information provided by the seven States,
applicants are requested to provide in their application brief descriptive information on: Their overall alien
problem as it burdens their correctional system; their method of determining which inmates are undocumented aliens
within the meaning of this regulation; currently available estimates of the incarcerated criminal aliens population,
in terms of bed spaces, if possible; currently available cost per bed figures; and, the methods to be used to provide
inmate specific information, as described in these regulations, to the granting agency. In particular, the applicant
should address its ability to provide the types of data elements for individual aliens that are specified in the regulation,
and its ability to provide this information in electronic form. 

(c) These types of information will enable BJA to plan with greater certainty for the final award process and to work
with INS and these applicant States during the period of time between preliminary and final award to establish verification
mechanisms which will ensure a proper final distribution of funds. 

(d) The amounts of these preliminary awards have been calculated solely on estimates of eligible aliens and costs
provided in the recently released Urban Institute report, ``Fiscal Impact of Undocumented Aliens: Selected Estimates
for Seven States,'' (1994), which was commissioned by BJA. This report contains reliable estimates for the numbers
and costs of incarcerating illegal criminal aliens in the seven States with the highest percentage of illegal aliens.
Reliance on this report enables BJA to award the one-third of the $130 million, as is statutorily required to be distributed
within 120 days from the start of the fiscal year, in a timely and reasonable fashion. However, the final awards for
these, and any other applicant, States will be based on actual counts and other information provided by the applicant
States themselves, as verified by BJA and INS.

<TEXT>
 

(e) Preliminary awards, in the following amounts, calculated from estimates in the Urban Institute Study using the
method described previously in this regulation, will be made to the following States no later than January 27, 1995:







(f) These awards total $42,897,400, or one-third of the available appropriation. The Urban Institute estimates
of costs incurred by the seven States is $471.4 million, which when divided into one-third of the available appropriation
gives a distribution percentage of 27.3%. The preliminary awards are based solely on the Urban Institute estimates
for the seven States and do not take into account the possible distributions to other States, which may together constitute
10-15% of all incarcerated criminal aliens eventually identified for which reimbursement will be made. Accordingly,
this preliminary calculation is not predictive of the percentage of total costs which will be reflected in final award
for these States. 

(g) At the end of the reimbursement period, recipients of the initial round of awards will be expected to file all information
described within this regulation, based on actual full year counts and averaged costs. The final award amount for
these seven States will be adjusted to subtract their preliminary award amounts from remaining funds. 



 82.7 

Full application and final award process.



(a) A final application cut-off date of September 30, 1995, will be used for applications seeking full year reimbursement
for FY 1995 funds. All interested States, including the seven receiving the preliminary distribution, must make
application by this date to receive an award. An original and three copies of the application are required. However,
only one hard copy report of the inmate identification measures described herein need be submitted. If possible,
the inmate identification data should also be submitted in machine readable form, with necessary documentation
to assist BJA and INS in using this electronic data.

<PARENT> FR941006-0-00011 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(b) States not eligible for a preliminary award that do want to participate in this assistance program should provide
BJA with a Notice of Intent to Apply, by letter or preliminary application, no later than April 30, 1995. Preliminary
estimates of numbers of bed slots and costs and brief descriptive information such as described for the initial applications
from the seven named States would be appreciated, as this will allow BJA to better plan for the final award process.



(c) As soon as possible after all final applications are received, BJA will determine award amounts for each applying
State, based upon the available funds and the costs incurred by the States, pursuant to  82.5. For FY 1995, the
final percentage will be applied to the full appropriation of $130,000,000 (less one percent administrative costs)
made available for the fiscal year, and the amount of the preliminary awards to the States pursuant to  82.6 will
be subtracted from the final award to those States. Awards will be made as expeditiously as possible, dependant on
the verification process as described herein. 


(d) All State applicants must submit Standard Form 424 (Application for Federal Assistance), including all necessary
assurances and certifications and a certified listing of incarcerated illegal criminal alien prisoners. Participants
in this program will be required to provide: information on average number of aliens incarcerated, actual identifiers
for these aliens, and average cost per bed space for the period for which assistance is being sought. 

(e) Each application must contain all the information discussed in this regulation. A certification form, available
from BJA, will be used to provide the total numbers and average per bed costs upon which the final application for reimbursement
is based. This certification does not relieve the applicant from providing sufficient narrative detail about its
recordkeeping and cost calculation processes to support and justify the amount of assistance sought. The certification
will be sent to all potential applicants who file a Notice of Intent to Apply with BJA as well as to the initial seven applicants.


(f) In addition to certification of some information and description of the methods for calculations made, the applicant
is expected to provide both hard copy and, if possible, electronically readable information on all aliens included
in the one detailed listing pursuant to  82.4(g) reimbursement counts. This unduplicated listing of all aliens
identified must be certified by the head of the designated State agency or one of his or her authorized representatives.



(g) All applicants should be aware that the percentage used in making the preliminary awards to the seven States will
not be the same as that determined after all States' applications are received, total requests based on final inmate
counts and bed space calculations are made, and the BJA/INS verification process is concluded. At that point, the
percentage upon which final distribution is made is expected to be significantly lower than 27%. 



 82.8 

Verification of applicant information and monitoring.



(a) In reviewing the applications from the States, numbers and cost figures given, as documented by the State's procedures
used to obtain that information, will be subject to verification and possible adjustment by BJA. BJA will consult
with INS on cost calculations and on both overall counts of the average number of aliens and on adequacy of individual
inmate identifiers. BJA will share both application information and inmate information with INS to allow INS to work
directly with the applicant agencies to assure proper identification of criminal aliens and to begin deportation
procedures, as appropriate. Award acceptance will be conditioned on the applicant's agreement to cooperate fully
with INS in matters related to this assistance program. 

(b) It is anticipated that INS field staff, with or independently of BJA staff, will undertake on-site reviews with
selected applicant agencies, to assist in properly identifying aliens as defined in the regulations and statutes.
Applicants will be expected to provide documentation on inmates counted whose status is questioned. 

(c) It is unlikely that INS verification will be fully developed prior to the distribution of the preliminary awards
pursuant to  82.6. Rather, this will be an ongoing process in which developing better systems of alien identification
and making individual verifications will be a major goal. 

(d) The application should contain an official designation from the chief executive officer of the State naming the
applicant as the State agency to receive the award.

ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of the Air Force revised its rule to update Air Force procedures for the Air Force Freedom of Information
Act (FOIA) Program. This revision provides guidance for making records public. It tells how to process FOIA requests
and tells the public how to request copies of Air Force records using the FOIA. It outlines requirements for For Official
Use Only (FOUO) material. The intended effect is to provide current information on Air Force policy and procedures
for the disclosure of records to the public under the Freedom of Information Act.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This rule implements 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended, and DODD 5400.7 (32 CFR Part 285) and DOD 5400.7-R (32 CFR Part 286).





Because this part implements a higher authority directive, it is not published as a proposed rule for comment.

The Department of the Air Force has determined that this rule is not a major rule because it will not have an annual effect
on the economy of $100 million or more. The Secretary of the Air Force has certified that this rule is exempt from the
requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601-612, because this rule does not have a significant
economic impact on small entities as defined by the Act, and does not impose any obligatory information requirements
beyond those imposed by DoD. This rule revises Air Force Regulation (AFR) 4-33, Air Force Freedom of Information
Act Program, 31 July 1992.

 806.0


Purpose.



This part implements Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 5400.7, 13 May 1988, DoD Freedom of Information Act Program;
and DoD Regulation 5400.7-R, 3 October 1990, DoD Freedom of Information Act Program, 10 May 1991, with Change
1 (32 CFR Parts 285 and 286). It provides guidance for making records public and for the Air Force Freedom of Information
Act (FOIA) Program. It tells how to process FOIA requests and tells the public how to request copies of Air Force records
using the FOIA (Title 5, United States Code, Section 552, as amended). It outlines the requirements for For Official
Use (FOUO) material. If this part conflicts with other Air Force publications, it takes precedence over those that
deal with making records public.



 806.1


General guidance.



The Air Force discloses its records in its possession and control to the public, except those records exempt under
the FOIA which, if released, would cause an identifiable harm. Make discretionary disclosures of exempt information
whenever possible. (Discretionary releases are generally not appropriate for exemptions 1, 3, 4, 6, and 7(C)). A
discretionary release to one requester will prevent withholding the same record if someone else requests it. Answer
all requests for information and records promptly. Handle requests in a customer-friendly manner. Get misrouted
FOIA requests to the FOIA Office immediately. Do not withhold a record simply because it might suggest administrative
error or inefficiency or cause embarrassment. Do not deny a request just because the record is stored in a computer.



 806.2


Responsibilities.



(a) The Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Air Force (SAF/AA) takes overall responsibility for making
sure the Air Force complies with the FOIA.

(b) The Office of the General Counsel to the Secretary of the Air Force (SAF/GSA) makes final decisions on appeals.

(c) The Director of Information management (SAF/AAI), through the Access Programs Office of the Administrative
Communications and Records Management Division, SAF/AAIQ:

(1) Administers procedures described in this part.

(2) Submits required reports to the Office of the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense (Public Affairs).

(3) Provides guidance and instructions to major commands (MAJCOM) and field operating agencies (FOA).

(d) MAJCOM and FOA commanders implement this part in their commands and agencies.

(e) FOIA managers:

(1) Control and process FOIA requests.

(2) Obtain recommendations from the office of primary responsibility (OPR) for records.

(3) Provide a reading room for inspecting, copying and giving copies of records to requesters.

(4) Provide training.

(5) Review publications to make sure they comply with this part.

(6) Conduct periodic program reviews.

(7) Approve or deny fee waivers.

(8) Assess and collect fees.

(9) Send extension notices to requesters.

(10) Submit required reports.

(11) Make final determinations on ``no records'' responses.

(f) OPRs:

(1) Coordinate the release or denial with the offices of collateral responsibility (OCR) and with the Staff Judge
Advocate (SJA) and FOIA office on proposed denials.

(2) Provide requested records.

(3) Help the disclosure authority determine whether to release record; and act as declassification authority when
appropriate.




(g) Disclosure authorities determine whether to release records and provide them to the FOIA office.




(h) Initial denial authorities:




(1) Make final decisions to deny records.




(2) Tell requesters the nature of records or information denied, exemption supporting the denial with reason, and
appeal procedures.




 806.3 

Material not covered by the FOIA.




(a) Objects or articles, such as structures, furniture, vehicles, and equipment, whatever their historical value
or value as evidence.




(b) Administrative tools for creating, storing, and retrieving records, if not created or used as sources of information
about organizations, policies, functions, decisions, or procedures of DoD. Normally computer software, including
source code, object code, and listings of source and object codes, regardless of medium, are not agency records. This
does not include the supported data that is processed and produced by such software an that in some instances may be
stored with the software.




(c) Personal notes of an individual not subject to agency creation or retention requirements, created and maintained
primarily for the convenience of an agency employee, and not distributed to other agency employees for their official
use.




(d) Information stored in a computer for which there is no existing computer program for retrieval of the requested
information.

(e) If other procedures for processing requests for material not covered by FOIA exist:

(1) Log the request and refer the request outside of the FOIA to the proper office.

(2) Acknowledge the requester's letter, tell the individual where you referred the request, and that the material
is not a record under the FOIA.

(f) If no alternative release procedures exist, process the request under FOIA by advising the requester that materials
are not agency records and give the requester appeal rights.

 806.4 

FOIA requests.



(a) Under FOIA, members of the public, including foreign citizens, military and civilian personnel acting as private
citizens, organizations and businesses, and individual members of the Congress, for themselves or constituents,
may request records in writing. Federal agencies or fugitives from the law cannot make FOIA requests.

(b) Requesters should not use Government equipment, supplies, stationery, postage, telephones, or official mail
channels to make FOIA requests. FOIA managers will process such requests and tell requesters that using government
resources to make FOIA requests is not an authorized official use.



 806.5 

Submitting FOIA requests.



Submit written requests that reasonably describe the desired records and include a statement on fees. Address letters
to the FOIA office of the activity that has the record. List other addressees to save time.



 806.6 

Processing requests under FOIA and Privacy Act (PA).



Process requests under the Act that gives the most information. If the requester cites both Acts, address each in the
reply.



 806.7 

Describing records.



The requester is responsible for identifying the desired record. He or she should sufficiently describe the record
to help locate it with a reasonable amount of effort. Generally a reasonable description contains enough information
for an organized, nonrandom search. Offices must make reasonable efforts to find the records described. This means
searching all activities and locations most likely to have the records, including staged or retired records. If the
description is unclear, ask for more specific information. When possible, tell the requester what information would
help.



 806.8 

Creating a record.



(a) The Air Force is not required to create, compile, or obtain a record from outside the Air Force to fulfill a request.
You may want to create a new record when it would be a more useful response to the requester or is less burdensome for the
agency than providing an existing record and the requester agrees. Do not charge the requester more for creating a
record than you would charge for the existing record.

(b) Apply a standard of reasonableness for electronic data when there is a question on whether you are creating, programming,
or formatting a record. If you can respond with a ``business as usual'' approach, process the request, otherwise offer
the requester appeal rights.



 806.9 

Special disclosure procedures.



Some instructions have disclosure procedures for certain types of records. Refer to those instructions for specific
disclosure procedures when you process FOIA requests. The only reason to deny a request is a FOIA exemption.

(a) Process FOIA requests from foreign citizens, foreign governments, their representatives, or international
commands under this part, and coordinate with your foreign disclosure office. If the command has no foreign disclosure
office, refer the request to SAF/AAIS (FOIA) for SAF/IAD coordination through the MAJCOM FOIA office.

(b) If requests from foreign government officials do not cite the FOIA, refer them to your foreign disclosure office
and notify the requester.

<TEXT>
 

(c) If you have a non-U.S. Government record, coordinate with the record's originator before releasing it (see  806.10(e)(1).
This includes records created by foreign governments and organizations like the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) and North American Aerospace Defense (NORAD). Coordinate release of foreign government records with the
U.S. Department of State through the MAJCOM FOIA office. Coordinate release or denial of Letters of Offer and Acceptance
(LOA) and SAF/IA through SAF/AAIS (FOIA).


 806.10 

FOIA exemptions.


Denial authorities may withhold records or information when an identifiable harm would result by disclosure, and
the records are exempt under 5 U.S.C. 552(b).
(a) Exemption 1_Classified Records. Records properly and currently classified in the interest of national defense
or foreign policy, as authorized by executive order and implementing instructions. Apply this exemption when disclosing
information by itself or in the context of other information that could reasonably be expected to damage national
security.
(1) To make a sound decision, review the record paragraph by paragraph for releasable information. Review all unclassified
parts before release to see if they are exempt. Before releasing a reviewed and declassified document, draw a single
black line through all the classification markings, so they are still legible and stamp the document ``Unclassified.''
Review material, if appropriate, to determine if it should be classified, even though it was not classified when requested.
AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management (formerly AFRs 205-1 and 205-43), tells how
to classify and declassify records. Check to see if information from foreign sources is classified. Delete exempt
parts of records and disclose the rest if it does not distort meaning and you can reasonably assume that a skillful,
knowledgeable person could not reconstruct the information deleted. Denial letters must say that unauthorized
disclosure of such information could reasonably be expected to cause damage to national security and cite the appropriate
executive order paragraph(s) as authority for classification. When denying a whole classified record, release
all unclassified parts that would cause no identifiable harm. Coordinate with the local information security specialist
when invoking this exemption for consistency of classification policy and procedures.
(2) When simply knowing whether a record exists or not reveals classified information, use the ``Glomar'' (refusal
to confirm or deny) response. Apply it consistently, not only when a record exists but also when a record does not exist.
Otherwise, the pattern of using a ``no record'' response when a record does not exist, and a ``refusal to confirm or
deny'' when a record does exist will disclose exempt information. Cite the FOIA exemption when you use the ``Glomar''
response.
(b) Exemption 2_Internal Personnel Rules and Practices. Exempt information falls in two categories:
(1) ``High'' 2 protects records which, if disclosed, would substantially hinder the effective performance of a significant
function of the DoD by risking circumvention of a statute or Air Force instruction or policy.
(2) ``Low'' 2 is for trivial internal administrative matters of no genuine public interest and the process of releasing
such records would constitute an unwarranted administrative burden. You can only use the ``low'' 2 exemption before
fully processing the requested records. Otherwise, you may eliminate the administrative burden justification.
(c) Exemption 3_Other Statutes. Records of matters that a statute specifically exempts from disclosure by terms
that permit no discretion on the issue of withholding or according to defined standards for withholding or referring
to particular types of matters we must withhold. When using this exemption, cite both exemption 3 and the specific
statute.
(d) Exemption 4_Confidential Commercial Information. Records with trade secrets and commercial or financial information
submitted by a person or entity outside the Federal Government on a privileged or confidential basis that, if released,
is likely to cause substantial competitive harm to the submitter of the information or impair the government's future
ability to obtain necessary information. Examples of exempt information follow:
(1) Trade secrets that are commercially valuable plans, formulas, processes, or devices used for making, preparing,
compounding, or processing trade commodities and are the product of innovation or substantial effort and were given
in confidence.
(2) Commercial or financial information given in confidence, in connection with loans, bids, contracts, or proposals;
or privileged information, such as trade secrets, inventions, discoveries, or other proprietary data.
(3) Statistical data and commercial or financial information concerning contract performance, income, profits,
losses, and expenditures, offered and given in confidence by a contractor or potential contractor.
(4) Personal statements made during inspections, investigations, or audits, if such statements are given in confidence
by the individual and kept confidential, because they reveal trade secrets or commercial or financial information
normally considered confidential or privileged.
(5) Financial data private employers provide in confidence for local wage surveys, used to set and adjust pay schedules
for prevailing wage rate employees of the DoD.
(6) Scientific and manufacturing processes or developments concerning technical or scientific data or other information
submitted with a research grant application or with a report during research.
(7) Computer software qualifying as a record under this part that is copyrighted under the Copyright Act of 1976 (17
U.S.C. 106), the disclosure of which would adversely affect its market value.
(8) Technical or scientific data a contractor or subcontractor developed entirely with private funds and technical
or scientific data developed with both Federal and private funds, which the contractor or subcontractor legally
owns per 10 U.S.C. 2320-2321 and DoD Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), chapter 2 of 48 CFR
227.4. You may withhold technical data developed entirely with Federal funds under Exemption 3 if the data meets the
criteria of 10 U.S.C. 130.
(e) Before releasing information submitted from outside the Air Force:

<TEXT>
 

(1) Write to the submitter of the data for views on releasability and include appendix b with your letter.

(2) Tell the requester that we must give the submitter of the data the opportunity to comment before the Air Force decides
whether to release the information.

(3) Give the submitter a reasonable period of time (no more than 30 calendar days) to object to release and provide justification.

(4) If the submitter does not respond, write that you have not received a reply, tell the submitter of the decision to
release with the reason and give the expected release date (at least 2 weeks from the date of your letter).

(5) If the submitter objects, but the Air Force disclosure authority considers the records releasable, tell the submitter
before releasing the data. Include in the letter a brief explanation and a release date at least 2 weeks from the date
of the letter.

(f) Exemption 5_Inter- or Intra-Agency Records. Intra-agency or inter-agency memoranda or letters that, according
to recognized legal privileges are not routinely released to a party in litigation with the Air Force or DoD. If such
a record or part of such a record would be made available routinely through the discovery process in the course of litigation
with the agency, release it. In the discovery process, litigants get from each other information relevant to issues
in a trial or hearing. if the information is only made available through the discovery process by special court order,
then it is exempt. Release factual records or parts unless the information is privileged or otherwise exempt. Generally,
release a direction or order from a superior to a subordinate, though contained in an internal communication, if it
forms policy guidance or a decision, but is not a discussion of preliminary or other matters that would compromise
decision making. Consult your SJA about whether Exemption 5 material would be routinely available through the discovery
process. Here are examples of exempt information.

(1) The deliberative process privilege_those parts of records with internal advice, opinions, evaluations, or
recommendations that reveal Air Force or DoD deliberations.

(2) Those nonfactual parts of Air Force personnel evaluations of contractors and their products.

(3) Advance information of a speculative, tentative, or evaluative nature on such matters as proposals to buy, lease,
or otherwise acquire and dispose of materials, real estate, facilities, or functions, if such information gives
private personal interests an unfair competitive advantage or impedes legitimate governmental functions. Generally,
you cannot use this privilege to withhold factual information. However, you may withhold facts when they are so interconnected
with deliberative information that disclosing facts necessarily discloses the Air Force's deliberative process
or when facts and deliberative information are so interconnected that separating them would be uninformative or
redundant.

(4) Official reports of inspection, audits, investigations, or surveys on safety, security, or internal management,
administration, or operation of the Air Force.

(5) The attorney work product privilege_records an attorney prepares, or supervises the preparation of, in contemplating
or preparing for administrative proceedings or litigation.

(6) The attorney-client privilege_confidential communication between an attorney and client. For example, a commander
expresses concerns in confidence to his or her judge advocate and asks for a legal opinion. The legal opinion and everything
the commander tells the judge advocate in confidence qualify.

(7) Unlike deliberative process privilege, you may withhold both facts and opinions in attorney work product or privileged
communications.

(8) Trade secrets or other confidential research, development, or commercial information the Air Force or DoD owns,
whose premature release probably would affect the Air Force's or DoD's negotiating position or other commercial
interests.

(9) Computer software qualifying as a record under this part which is deliberative in nature, if its release would
inhibit decisionmaking. In this case, closely examine the use of the software to ensure its deliberative nature.

(10) Planning, programming, and budget information involving defense planning and resource allocation.

(g) Exemption 6_Invasion of Personal Privacy. Personnel, medical, and similar personal information in other files
whose release to the public clearly invades personal privacy. To decide whether to release personal information,
balance the privacy interest against what its release would tell the public about how the Air Force functions or about
the conduct of an Air Force functions or about the conduct of any Air force employee (the public interest). Withhold
records only when the privacy interest exceeds the public interest. Do not use this exemption to protect a deceased
person's privacy, but you may use it to protect the privacy of the deceased person's family in rare instances. Generally
let a person (or their representative) see their own personnel, medical, or similar files and withhold information
from the subject only using 5 U.S.C. 552a, The Privacy Act of 1974 (see part 806b of this chapter).

(1) Withhold names and duty addresses of personnel serving overseas or in sensitive or routinely deployable units.
Routinely deployable units normally leave their permanent home stations on a periodic or rotating basis for peacetime
operations or for scheduled training exercises conducted outside the United States or U.S. territories on a routine
basis. Units based in the United States for a long time, such as those in extensive training or maintenance activities,
do not quality during that period. Units designated for deployment or contingency plans not yet executed and units
that seldom leave the United States or U.S. territories (e.g., annually or semiannually) are not routinely deployable
units. However, units alerted for deployment outside the United States or U.S. territories during actual execution
of a contingency plan or in support of a crisis operation qualify. The way the Air Force deploys units makes it difficult
to determine when a unit that has part of its personnel deployed becomes eligible for denial. The Air Force any consider
a unit deployed on a routine basis or deployed fully overseas when 30 percent of its personnel has been either alerted
or actually deployed. In this context, alerted means that a unit has received an official written warning of an impending
operational mission outside the United States or U.S. territories.

(2) Sensitive units are primarily involved in training for special activities or classified missions, including,
for example, intelligence-gathering units that collect, handle, dispose of, or store classified information and
materials, as well as units that train or advise foreign personnel.

(3) Each MAJCOM and FOA will establish a system and OPR(s) to identify units in their command qualifying for this exemption.
Appropriate OPRs could include Directors of Operations, Plans, and Programs, and Personnel. The resulting list
of nonreleasable units will be reviewed and updated in January and July and provided to the MAJCOM or FOA FOIA office.
This listing will be in ASCII format on a 31/2 or 51/4 inch floppy disk (double sided, high density), which contains
the unit's eight-position personnel accounting symbol (PAS) code, with 1 pas code per line (record) (8-byte record).
The MAJCOM or FOA FOIA manager will forward an electronic copy of the list of nonreleasonable units to AFMPC/RMI to
be included in the personnel data system. The MAJCOM and AFMPC FOIA offices will use it to determine releasable lists
of names and duty addresses.

(h) Exemption 7_Investigative Records. Records or information gathered for law enforcement purposes but only when
releasing these records would probably:

(1) Interfere with enforcement proceedings.

(2) Deprive a person of the right to a fair trial or an impartial judgment.

(3) Invade personal privacy unnecessarily.

(4) Identify a confidential source, including a state, local, or foreign agency or authority or any private institution
that gives confidential information.

(5) Disclose information from a confidential source and obtained by a criminal law enforcement authority in a criminal
investigation or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation.

(6) Disclose methods for law enforcement investigation or prosecutions.

(7) Disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if the release would probably encourage
circumvention of the law.

(8) Endanger an individual's life or physical safety.

(i) You may use this exemption to prevent disclosure of documents not originally created for, but later gathered for
law enforcement purposes.

(j) Exemption 8_Financial Institutions. Those records contained in or related to examination, operation, or condition
reports prepared by, on the behalf of, or for the use of, an agency that regulates or supervises financial institutions.

(k) Exemption 9_Wells. Records with geological and geophysical information and data, including maps, concerning
wells.



 806.11 

FOIA exclusions.



(a) Under two limited situations, requests for law enforcement records are not subject to disclosure under FOIA:

(1) Requests for law enforcement records when the investigation involves a possible criminal violation, the subject
is unaware of the investigation, and disclosing the record's existence could interfere with enforcement.

(2) Requests for informant records a criminal law enforcement agency keeps under the informant's name or personal
identifier made by a third party using the informant's name or personal identifier, but only when the informant's
status as an informant has not been officially confirmed.

(b) In these cases, do not use denial procedures; instead, say you found no records. Coordinate with the SJA on these
cases. When you write to the requester, do not give the statutory citation for the exclusion nor state your reliance
on an exclusion.



 806.12 

Denials.



Only denial authorities may withhold information. Denial authority level is at the deputy chiefs of staff and chiefs
of comparable offices or higher at HQ USAF, and MAJCOM and FOA commanders. These officials may name an additional official
as a denial authority. Send SAF/AAIQ a letter with the position titles only. Only the Administrative Assistant to
the Secretary of the Air Force can approve a request for more than one additional denial authority. Send those requests,
with justification, to SAF/AAIQ.

(a) When denying information, delete only the exempt parts of a record, release what remains, and let the requester
know that you are providing all reasonably segregable, releasable parts of the record. Clearly show the requester
where you deleted information.

(b) Denial letters must include the reason for the denial and cite the statutory exemption. Only authorized denial
authorities sign denial letters. FOIA managers may sign ``no records'' responses. Denial letters and ``no records''
responses must also include an appeal paragraph that:

(1) Tells the requester to address appeals to the Secretary of the Air Force, through the FOIA office of the activity
that issued the denial or ``no records'' response.

(2) Tells the requester to appeal within 60 calendar days from the date of the letter and to include reasons for reconsideration.

(3) Asks the requester to attach a copy of the response.



 806.13 

Freedom of Information Act annual report



(a) MAJCOM and FOA FOIA managers submit a calendar-year report on 31/2- or 51/4-inch disk using the FOIA System. Send
the report by 10 January to SAF/AAIQ. The report control symbol (RCS) is DD-PA(A)1365.

(b) SAF/AAIQ submits the report to the Office of the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense (Public Affairs) Directorate
for Freedom of Information and Security Review on DD Form 2564, Annual Report_Freedom of Information Act.

 806.14 

Host-tenant relationship.



(a) The host base FOIA manager logs, processes, and reports FOIA requests for tenant units. The host base FOIA office
refers all recommended denials and ``no records'' appeals to the tenant MAJCOM FOIA manager.

(b) This host-tenant relationship does not apply to disclosure authorities for specialized records, such as the
Air Force Audit Agency and the Air Force Office of Special Investigations.



 806.15 

Processing FOIA requests.



All FOIA offices use the FOIA system to track and manage FOIA requests. AFM 4-196 is the FOIA System End Users Manual.

(a) After receiving a FOIA request, the FOIA manager:

(1) Records the date and time of receiving the request, logs the request in the FOIA system and sets a suspense date.
For more than 10 FOIA requests, sets up a first-in, first-out system to process the requests in the order received.

(2) Considers a request received when the FOIA office responsible for processing the request receives it; and when
the requester states a willingness to pay fees set for his or her category (see  806.17), has paid past FOIA debts,
and has reasonably described the requested records.

(3) Determines the fee according to the requester's category, writes to requesters who have not made arrangements
to pay for the information and whose fees are more than $15, telling them the category and cost of the request.

(4) Answers fee waiver requests before processing. Asks for more justification, if needed to make a good decision.
Do not consider this notice a denial.

(5) Attaches DD Form 2086, Record of Freedom of Information (FOI) Processing Cost, or DD 2086-1, Record of Freedom
of Information (FOI) Processing Cost for Technical Data, to each request. The OPR must complete and return this form
to the FOIA office. These forms give the fees for charging, if any, and processing costs you use to prepare the FOIA annual
report.

(6) Writes the requester to acknowledge receipt of the request if the date or postmark (whichever is later) is more
than 10 workdays ago and informs the requester of any unusual problems.

(7) Tells the requester if the record is not sufficiently described and asks for more information. If possible, offers
to help the requester identify the requested records and tells what kind of information makes searching for a record
easier.

(8) Sends the request to the OPR who searches for the record and decides whether to release it.

(9) Sends classified records with no OPR or functional equivalent to SAF/AAIS, through the MAJCOM or FOA FOIA office,
for HQ USAF/SP review. Telephones SAF/AAIS before sending the records.

(10) Tells the requester in a letter sent within 10 workdays after receiving the request of the final decision to release
or deny the records.

(11) When answering requests for lists of names and duty addresses, tells requesters as early as possible about the
mass mailing restrictions outlined in AFI 37-125, Official Mail, Small Parcel and Distribution Management
(formerly AFR 4-50).

(12) Grants 10 additional workdays for one or more of three reasons:

(i) All or part of the requested records are not at the installation processing the request.

(ii) Fulfilling the request means collecting and reviewing an enormous number of records.

(iii) Other Air Fore activities or other agencies need to be involved in deciding whether to release the records.

(13) Sends the requester a letter within 10 workdays, giving the reason for the delay and a date (within 20 workdays
after receiving the request) when the requester can expect a final decision.

(14) Records extensions and reasons for them in the FOIA system.

(15) Coordinates with the public affairs office if the requested records are potentially newsworthy or if the news
media sent the request.

(16) Sends releasable records to requesters with a bill (if appropriate).

(17) Sends a request the OPR wants to deny through the MAJCOM or FOA FOIA office to the denial authority for a decision.
The package must include:

(i) The request.

(ii) A copy of the requested records.

(iii) The OPR's and SJA's written recommendations.

(iv) The exemption cited.

(v) The reason for denial.

(b) The OPR locates the information and recommends its release. In cases where several OPRs have functional responsibility
for the information, the primary OPR is the one responsible for most of the information in the document. The OPR:

(1) Works with the offices of collateral responsibility (OCR) inside and outside the Air Force, considers the opinions
and information they provide, and makes the final release decision.

(2) Forwards records that need coordination with other Air Force functional areas and outside agencies to the MAJCOM
or FOA FOIA office, which sends them to the appropriate FOI office for review and return for final decision.

(3) Answers each functional request and follows FOIA denial procedures for records withheld.



 806.16 

Referrals.



A FOIA manager refers requests to another FOIA office after consulting with them when the request asks for records
or information originated by someone other than the activity receiving the request or when an OPR finds records in
a search that belong to another activity.

(a) Refer FOIA requesters to sources that can provide unaltered publications and processed documents, such as maps,
charts, regulations, and manuals to the public, with or without charge. For example, people can obtain documents
published in the 

Federal Register 

without using the FOIA. The National Technical Information Service (NTIS), 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA
22161, sells current Air Force standard numbered (departmental) publications, but does not stock superseded, obsolete,
rescinded, classified, FOUO, limited (L), or ``X'' distribution Air Force publications. FOIA requests for these
publications go through normal FOIA channels to the OPR for a release recommendation.

(b) Usually, tell the requester about the referral, identify the record referred as security permits, and tell the
requester to expect an answer from the agency or activity receiving the referral.

(c) If a request would involve many referrals, tell the requester where to address the request; don't refer it yourself.

(d) Before releasing records or information originated with the National Security Council (NSC) or the White House,
refer them through the Office of the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense (Public Affairs) Directorate for Freedom
of Information (OATSD[PA]DFOISR), Washington DC 20301. The OATSD(PA) will consult with them and reply back to you.

(e) The General Accounting Office (GAO) is outside the Executive Branch and not subject to the FOIA. However, if the
FOIA manager receives a FOIA request directly from the public or referred from GAO for GAO documents that contain Air
Force or DoD information, process the request under FOIA.



 806.17 

Categorizing requesters.



(a) Requesters' fees depend on which group they belong to:

(1) Category 1: Commercial. Requesters pay all search, review, and duplication. To decide who belongs in this category
find out how these requesters will use the requested documents. If you are unsure how the requester plans to use the
records or the request itself does not clearly state plans, seek additional information before you categorize the
request.

(2) Category 2: Educational or Noncommercial Scientific Institution or News Media. Requesters get the first 100
copies free and pay for additional copies. These requesters do not pay search or review charges. Requesters who use
requested records to write and spread news are not considered commercial requesters.

(3) Category 3: Others. Requesters get the first 2 hours of search and the first 100 copies free. These requesters do
not pay review charges.

(b) Analyze each request to categorize the requester. If you think the requester's category differs from what the
requester claims, ask the individual for more justification and say you cannot begin searching for records until
you have agreed on the category. If the requester does not send the FOIA manager more justification in reasonable time
(normally, 30 calendar days), the manager makes a final decision and notifies the requester of the decision and of
the right to appeal it.

(c) Tell requesters that you cannot begin to answer their requests until they state they will pay the costs set for their
category.

 806.18 

Fee assessment.


The FOIA limits charges to search, review, and duplication based on the requester's category.
(a) Estimate fees if the requester asks. Do not charge an amount more than the estimate or the amount the requester agrees
to unless the requester first agrees to pay more.
(b) Search time includes all time spent looking for records to respond to a request. Personnel must search efficiently
to minimize both the Air Force's and the requester's costs. Search efforts must be thorough and include all locations
and activities most likely to have the requested records. Searches may include retired or staged records. Time spent
reviewing documents to decide whether statutory exemptions apply counts as review time, not search time. For computer
searches, determine the first 2 free hours against the salary scale of the person operating the computer.
(1) FOIA managers may charge for search time for the appropriate category (and review time for commercial requesters
only), if the requester agreed in advance to pay, even if:
(i) A search does not uncover the requested records.
(ii) The records found are entirely exempt from disclosure.
(2) When estimated search charges exceed $25, tell the requester the estimated fees, unless the requester has already
indicated a willingness to pay fees as high as the estimate. When feasible, offer the requester the opportunity to
restate the request so that the search costs less.
(c) Review is the process of examining documents to determine if one or more of the statutory exemptions allows withholding.
It also includes the time it takes to excise information. Review does not include time spent resolving general legal
or policy issues on exemptions. FOIA managers may only assess commercial requesters for initial review. This does
not include reviews at the appeal stage for exemptions already applied, but it may include review to apply an exemption
not previously cited.
(d) Requesters pay only for copies of the records they actually receive. Copies may be on paper, microfiche, audiovisual,
or machine-readable magnetic tape or disk, among other media. FOIA managers must try hard to ensure copies are clear.
If you cannot possibly provide a clear copy, tell the requester that the copy is the best available and that he or she
can make an appointment to review the master copy. For copies of computer tapes and audiovisual material, charge the
actual copying cost, including the operator's time.
(e) Before beginning or continuing work on a request, FOIA managers may require advance payment from requesters:
(1) Who have not paid fees on time (usually within 30 calendar days) in the past.
(2) Whose estimated fees are over $250, unless the requester always pays promptly. In that case, give the requester
an estimate and ask the requester to ensure full payment.
(f) If the requester has always paid promptly, the FOIA manager sends the records and requests payment at the same time.
(g) If a requester has not paid on time in the past, FOIA managers may ask the requester to:
(1) Pay (or show proof of payment of) outstanding bills, plus interest, for past FOIA requests. Consult 31 U.S.C. 3717
for interest rates and coordinate with your accounting and finance office.
(2) Pay estimated fees in advance.

<PARENT> FR941006-0-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(h) If a requester has no payment history, or has not paid on time in the past, FOIA managers may ask the requester to pay
after processing the request but before sending the records.

(i) When employees with different hourly rates search for information for an ``Other'' (Category 3) requester, waive
the cost of the most expensive 2 hours of search. Requesters receive the first 2 hours search (Category 3 requesters
only) and the first 100 pages of duplication (Categories 2 and 3) free only once per request. If you complete your work
and refer the request to another FOI office for action, tell that FOI office how much time you spent searching and how
many pages you copied for the requester.



 806.19

Aggregating requests.



A requester may make many requests at once, each seeking parts of a document or documents, just to avoid paying fees.
When a requester or a group of requesters breaks a request into many requests to avoid paying, the FOIA manager may combine
the requests and charge accordingly. Before combining requests, be sure you have solid evidence that the requesters
are trying to avoid fees. Do not combine one requester's multiple requests on unrelated subjects. Contact SAF/AAIQ
before taking action.



 806.20

Fee waivers.



(a) Waive fees for requesters of all categories when:

(1) FOIA costs total $15 or less.

(2) A record is created voluntarily to save the cost of supplying many records.

(3) A record previously withheld is released at small cost (e.g., $15 to $30).

(4) Releasing the information is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or
activities of the DoD and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.

(b) A waiver in the public interest establishes the two basic requirements below. Both must be met before you waive
or reduce fees. Use the following six factors. Begin with the first four factors to determine ``public interest''
and then use the two remaining factors to decide if release ``is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.''

(1) 

Requirement 1. 

Is releasing the information in the public interest business it will probably contribute significantly to public
understanding of the government's operations or activities?

(i) 

Factor 1_Subject of the Request. 

Analyze whether the subject matter will significantly contribute to the public understanding of DoD operations
or activities. Requests made for records in DoD's possession originated by nongovernment organizations for their
intrinsic content rather than informative value will likely not contribute to public understanding of DoD operations
or activities. Press clippings, magazine articles, or records expressing an opinion or concern from a member of the
public regarding a DoD activity are such records. Releasing older records may be relevant to current DoD activities,
so do not discount it under this factor simply because it is old. For example, a requester might want historical records
to study how a certain current DoD policy evolved. Review these requests closely, comparing the requester's stated
purpose for the records and the potential for public understanding of DoD operations and activities.

(ii) 

Factor 2_Informative Value. 

Closely analyze a record's substantive contents to determine whether disclosure is meaningful, and will inform
the public on DoD operations or activities. While the subject of a request may contain information concerning DoD
operations or activities it may not always help people understand these operations or activities. One example is
a heavily edited record, containing only random words, fragmented sentences, or paragraph headings. Another example
is information already in the public domain.

(iii) 

Factor 3_General Public Will Understand the Subject Better. 

Will the records' release inform, or have the potential to inform, the public or just the requester or a few interested
persons? Knowing the requester's identity is essential to determine whether he or she plans to, and knows how to, communicate
information to the public. Plans to write a book, research a subject, work on a doctoral dissertation, or indigency
are not reason enough to waive fees. The requester must tell how he or she plans to disclose the information to the general
public. You may ask requesters for their qualifications, the nature of their research, the purpose of requesting
information, and their plans for making information public.

(iv) 

Factor 4_Significance of Public Understanding. 

Balance the relative significance or impact of the disclosure against the level of public knowledge or understanding
that exists before disclosure. Records released on a subject of wide public interest should contain previously unknown
facts that increase public knowledge. They should not duplicate what the general public already knows. Determining
the significance of information requires objective judgment. Take care to determine whether disclosure will probably
lead to significant public understanding of the issue. Do not judge whether the information is important enough to
be public.

(2) 

Requirement 2.

 Does disclosure of the information primarily mean profit for the requester?

(i) 

Factor 5_Commercial Interest.

 If you determine the requester will use the records to make a profit, then decide if it's primary, as opposed to a personal
or noncommercial interest. In addition to profit-making organizations, individuals, and other organizations
may have a commercial interest in certain records. When you have difficulty deciding whether a request is commercial
in nature, the requester's identity and the circumstances of the request may help. You may write to the requester and
ask for more details.

(ii) 

Factor 6_Primary Interest.

 After you have determined the requester's commercial interest, decide if it is primary. Commercial interests are
primary only if the requester's profit clearly overrides a personal or nonprofit interest. You must decide whether
the commercial interest outweighs any benefit to the public as a result of disclosure. Waive or reduce fees when the
public gains more than the requester. If the requester's commercial interest is greater than the public interest,
do not waive or reduce fees even if public interest is significant. As business organizations, news organizations
have a commercial interest; however, you can assume that their primary interest is giving the general public news.
Scholars writing books or engaging in other academic research, may profit, either directly or indirectly (through
the institution they represent); however, such work is primarily done for educational purposes. Usually you would
not assess scholars fees. Assume that brokers or others who compile government information for marketing use the
information for profit.

(iii) 

Decide each fee waiver case by case.

 When you have doubts about waiving or charging a fee, favor the requester.



 806.21


Transferring fees to accounting and finance offices.



The Treasurer of the United States has two accounts for FOIA receipts. Use account 3210, Sales of Publications and
Reproductions, Freedom of Information Act, for depositing fees for publications and forms described in Federal
Account Symbols and titles. Use receipt account 3210, Fees and Other Charges for Services, Freedom of Information
Act, to deposit fees for searching for, copying, and reviewing records to provide information not in existing publications
or forms. Add your disbursing office's prefix to the account numbers. Deposit all FOIA receipts in these accounts
except those from industrially funded and nonappropriated funded activities. Deposit these receipts in the applicable
fund.



 806.22


Fee rates.



(a) These fees apply only to FOIA requests. Part 813 of this chapter, Schedule of Fees for Copying, Certifying and Searching
Records and Other Documentary Material, contains the fee schedule for non-FOIA services. Refer to Part 806B of this
chapter for guidance on fees for PA requests.

(b) Search and review:

(1) Clerical (E9 and GS-8 and below)_$12 an hour.

(2) Professional (01-06 and GS-9-GS/GM-15)_$25 an hour.

(3) Executive (07 and GS-16/ES1 and above)_$45 an hour.

(c) Computer search fees are based on direct costs of the central processing unit, input-output devices, and memory
capacity of the actual computer configuration. Also include the salary scale (equal to hourly rates above) for the
computer operator or programmer who planned and carried out the search.

 806.25

Appeals.



Requesters may appeal denials of records, category determinations, fee waiver requests, and ``no records'' determinations
by writing to the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force, within 60 calendar days after the date of the denial letter.
A requester who sends the appeal after 60 calendar days, should explain the reason for the delay.

(a) Requesters who appeal have exhausted all administrative remedies within the Department of the Air Force and The
Office of the General Counsel to the Secretary of the Air Force (SAF/GC) makes a final decision. Requesters must address
all appeals to the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force, through the MAJCOM or FOA FOIA office that denied the request.
Requesters should attach a copy of the denial letter to their appeal and give their reasons for appealing.

(b) After coordinating with the local SJA (and the OPR, if appropriate), MAJCOM and FOA FOIA offices send all appeals,
including late submissions, to Air Force Legal Services Agency (AFLSA/JACL) for determination, unless they have
reconsidered and approved the request. MAJCOM and FOA FOIA offices give appeals priority. They do not have 20 workdays
to process an appeal.

(c) Requesters must appeal denials involving Office of Personnel Management's controlled civilian personnel records
to the Office of the General Counsel, Office of Personnel Management, 1900 E Street NW, Washington DC 20415.

(d) When sending appeals to AFLSA/JACL, attach:

(1) The original appeal letter and envelope.

(2) The initial request and any attachments.

(3) The denial letter, with an index of the denied material, if applicable.

(4) Copies of all records you have already provided; or if the records are massive (Several cubic feet) and AFLSA/JACL
agrees, an index or description of released records.

(5) Copies of all administrative processing documents, including extension letters and opinions and recommendations
about the request.

(6) Copy of the denied record or denied portions of it marked to show what you withheld. If the records are massive and
AFLSA/JACL agrees, you may substitute a detailed description of the documents.

(7) A point-by-point discussion of factual and legal arguments the requester's appeal contains and, proof that the
denial authority considered and rejected these arguments and why.

(8) An explanation of the decisionmaking process for intraagency documents denied under the deliberative process
privilege and how the denied material fits into that process.

(e) Assemble appeal packages:

(1) Arrange attachments in the order listed in paragraph (d) of this section. Use tabbed dividers to separate attachments.

(2) List all attachments in your cover letter.

(3) Include the name of the person to contact and a phone number.

<TEXT>
 

(f) AFLSA/JACL sends the appeal of the Office of the General Counsel, who makes a final determination. The law requires
a final decision within 20 workdays after receipt of the appeal letter. The 20 days begins when the denial authority's
FOIA office receives the appeal. The time limit includes processing actions by all levels. If a final determination
cannot be made within 20 days, AFLSA/JACL writes to the requester to acknowledge the appeals' receipt and to explain
the delay. If SAF/GC upholds the denial, in whole or in part, SAF/GC tells the requester, explains reasons for the denial,
and tells the requester about judicial review rights. If SAF/GC grants the appeal, that office tells the requester
in writing and releases, or directs the release of, the record.
(g) For ``no records'' determinations, search again, if warranted, or verify the first search. Include in the package
you send to AFLSAS/JACL any letters that show you systematically tried to find records. Tell, for example, what areas
or offices you search for how you conducted the search_manually, by computer, by telephone, etc.
(h) For appeals to denials of fee waiver requests, fully account for actual and estimated costs with a copy of the DD
2086 or DD Form 2086-1.


 806.26 

For Official Use Only (FOUO).


FOUO is not a classification. Information marked FOUO must meet the criteria for exemptions 2 through 9, or you cannot
withhold it. Do not consider or mark any other records FOUO.
(a) Originators mark records when they create them to call attention to FOUO content. An FOUO marking does not mean
you must withhold a record under the FOIA. You still need to review a requested record. Examine records with and without
markings to identify information that needs protection and is exempt from public release or to decide whether discretionary
release is appropriate.
(1) Information in a technical document that requires a distribution statement per AFI 61-204, Controlling
the Distribution of Classified and Unclassified Scientific and Technical Information (formerly AFR 80-30),
must show that statement. The originator may also mark the information FOUO, if appropriate.
(2) Mark an unclassified document containing FOUO information ``For Official Use Only'' at the bottom, on the outside
of the front cover (if any), on each page containing FOUO information, on the back page, and on the outside of the back
cover (if any).
(3) In unclassified documents, the originator may also mark individual paragraphs that contain FOUO information
to alert users and assist in review.
(4) In a classified document, mark:
(i) An individual paragraph that contains FOUO, but not classified information, by placing ``(FOUO)'' at the beginning
of the paragraph.
(ii) The top and bottom of each page that has both FOUO and classified information, with the highest security classification
of information on that page.
(iii) ``FOUO'' at the bottom of each page that has FOUO but not classified information.
(5) If a classified document also contains FOUO information or if the classified material becomes FOUO when declassified,
place the following statement on the bottom of the cover or the first page, under the classification marking: If declassified,
review the document to make sure material is not FOUO and not exempt under this part before public release.
(6) Mark other records, such as computer printouts, photographs, films, tapes, or slides,``For Official Use Only''
or ``FOUO'' so the receiver or viewer knows the record contains FOUO information.

<DOCNO> FR941006-0-00054 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941006-0-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(7) Mark FOUO material sent to authorized persons outside the DoD with an explanation typed or stamped on the document:

 


This document contains information EXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE UNDER THE FOIA. Exemption(s) . . . . . . applies
(apply). (Further distribution is prohibited without the approval of (enter OPR)).

 


(b) DoD components, officials of DoD components, and authorized DoD contractors, consultants, and grantees send
FOUO information to each other to conduct official DoD business. Tell recipients the status of such information,
and send the material in a way that prevents unauthorized public disclosure. Make sure documents that transmit FOUO
material call attention to any FOUO attachments. Normally, you may send FOUO records over facsimile equipment. To
prevent unauthorized disclosure, consider attaching special cover sheets (i.e., AF Form 3227, Privacy Act Cover
Sheet, for Privacy Act information), the location of sending and receiving machines, and whether authorized personnel
are around to receive FOUO information. FOUO information may be passed to officials in other departments and agencies
of the executive and judicial branches to fulfill a government function. Mark the records ``For Official Use Only,''
and tell the recipient the information is exempt from public disclosure under the FOIA and whether it needs special
handling. If the records are subject to the PA, refer to Part 806b of this chapter for PA disclosure policies. 

(c) AFI 90-401, Air Force Relations With Congress (formerly AFR 11-7), governs the release of FOUO information
to members of the Congress and AFI 65-401, Air Force Relations With the General Accounting Office (formerly
AFR 11-8), governs its release to the General Accounting Office (GAO). Review records before releasing to see
if the information warrants FOUO status. If not, remove FOUO markings. If the material still warrants FOUO status,
mark the records FOUO and explain the appropriate exemption and marking to the recipient. 

(d) When you use the US Postal Service, package records with FOUO information so their contents are safe. If FOUO information
is not combined with classified information, individuals may send FOUO information by First Class Mail or Parcel
Post. Bulky shipments, such as FOUO directives or testing materials, that qualify under postal regulations may be
sent by Fourth Class Mail. 

(e) Mark each part of a message that contains FOUO information. Unclassified messages containing FOUO information
must show the abbreviation ``FOUO'' before the text begins. 

(f) To safeguard FOUO records during normal duty hours, place them in an out-of-sight location if people who do not
work for the government come into the work area. After normal duty hours, store FOUO records to prevent unauthorized
access. File them with other unclassified records in unlocked files or desks, etc., if the Government or a Government
contractor provides normal internal building security. When there is no internal security, locked buildings or
rooms usually provide adequate after-hours protection. For additional protection, store FOUO material in locked
containers such as file cabinets, desks, or bookcases. 

(g) When a record is no longer FOUO, remove the markings or indicate on the document the markings no longer apply. Try
to tell everyone who has the records that their status has changed. 

(h) Destroy FOUO materials by tearing them up so no one can put them back together and throwing them into trash containers.
When the information needs more protection, local authorities may use other methods. However, balance the expense
of extra protection against the degree of sensitivity of the FOUO information in the records. You may recycle FOUO
material. Safeguard the FOUO documents or information until recycling to prevent unauthorized disclosure. Recycling
contracts must include agreements on how to protect and destroy FOUO and PA materials. 

(i) Unauthorized disclosure of FOUO records is not an unauthorized disclosure of classified information. Air Force
personnel must act to protect FOUO records under their control from unauthorized disclosure. When unauthorized
persons gain access to these records, administrators find out who is responsible and take disciplinary action where
appropriate. Unauthorized disclosure of FOUO information containing PA information may also result in civil or
criminal sanctions against individuals or the Air Force. Tell the originating organization when its records are
improperly disclosed.

Appendix B to Part 806_Requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4) (Send With Letter to Submitters)


(a) The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requires Federal agencies to provide their records, except those specifically
exempted, for the public to inspect and copy.
(b) Section (b) of the Act lists nine exemptions that are the only basis for withholding records from the public.
(c) In this case, the fourth exemption, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4), may apply to records or information the Air Force maintains.
Under this exemption, agencies may withhold trade secrets and commercial or financial information they obtained
from a person or organization outside the government which is privileged or confidential.
(d) This generally includes information provided and received with the understanding that it will be kept privileged
or confidential.
(e) Commercial or financial matter is ``confidential'' and exempt if its release will probably:
(1) Impair the Government's ability to obtain necessary information in the future.
(2) Substantially harm the source's competitive position or impair some other legitimate Government interest.
(f) The exemption may be used to help the source when public disclosure will probably cause substantial harm to its
competitive position. Examples of information that may qualify for this exemption include:
(1) Commercial or financial information received in confidence with loans, bids, contracts, or proposals, as well
as other information received in confidence or privileged, such as trade secrets, inventions, discoveries, or other
proprietary data.
(2) Statistical data and commercial or financial information concerning contract performance, income, profits,
losses, and expenditures, offered and received in confidence from a contractor or potential contractor.
(3) Personal statements given during inspections, investigations, or audits, received and kept in confidence because
they reveal trade secrets or commercial or financial information, normally considered confidential or privileged.
(4) Financial data that private employers give in confidence for local wage surveys used to set and adjust pay schedules
for the prevailing wage rate of DoD employees.
(5) Information about scientific and manufacturing processes or developments that is technical or scientific or
other information submitted with a research grant application, or with a report while research is in progress.
(6) Technical or scientific data a contractor or subcontractor develops entirely at private expense, and technical
or scientific data developed partly with Federal funds and partly with private funds, in which the contractor or subcontractor
retains legitimate proprietary interests per 10 U.S.C. 2320-2321 and 48 CFR 227.4.
(7) Computer software copyrighted under the Copyright Act of 1976 (17 U.S.C. 106), the disclosure of which would adversely
impact its potential market value.
(g) If release of the subject material would prejudice your commercial interests, give detailed written reasons
that identify the specific information and the competitive harm it will cause to you, your organization, or your business.
The Act requires we provide any reasonably segregable part of a record after deleting exempt parts. So, tell us if deleting
key words or phrases would adequately protect your interests.
(h) If you do not prove the probability of substantial harm to your competitive position or other commercial interests,
we may be required to release the information. Records qualify for protections case by case.

Outer Continental Shelf Air Regulations Consistency Update for California 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (``EPA''). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule_consistency update. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is finalizing the updates of the Outer Continental Shelf (``OCS'') Air Regulations proposed in the 

Federal Register

 on June 30, 1994 and August 17, 1994. Requirements applying to OCS sources located within 25 miles of states' seaward
boundaries must be updated periodically to remain consistent with the requirements of the corresponding onshore
area (``COA''), as mandated by section 328(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act (``the Act''), the Clean Air Act Amendments of
1990. The portion of the OCS air regulations that is being updated pertains to the requirements for OCS sources for
which the Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District (Santa Barbara County APCD), South Coast Air Quality
Management District (South Coast AQMD), and the Ventura County Air Pollution Control District (Ventura County APCD)
are the designated COAs, and a requirement submitted by the state of California. The intended effect of approving
the requirements contained in ``Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District Requirements Applicable to
OCS Sources'' (August 30, 1994), ``South Coast Air Quality Management District Requirements Applicable to OCS Sources''
(Parts I and II) (August 30, 1994), ``Ventura County Air Pollution Control District Requirements Applicable to OCS
Sources'' (August 30, 1994), and ``State of California Requirements Applicable to OCS Sources'' (August 30, 1994)
is to regulate emissions from OCS sources in accordance with the requirements onshore. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



On June 30, 1994 in 59 FR 33719 and August 17, 1994 in 59 FR 42194, EPA 
proposed to approve the following requirements into the OCS Air Regulations: ``Santa 
Barbara County Air Pollution Control District Requirements Applicable to OCS Sources'', ``South Coast Air Quality
Management District Requirements Applicable to OCS Sources'' (Parts I and II), ``Ventura County Air Pollution Control
District Requirements Applicable to OCS Sources'', and ``State of California Requirements Applicable to OCS Sources''.
These requirements are being promulgated in response to the submittal of rules from local air pollution control agencies
and the state of California. EPA has evaluated the above requirements to ensure that they are rationally related to
the attainment or maintenance of federal or state ambient air quality standards or part C of title I of the Act, that
they are not designed expressly to prevent exploration and development of the OCS and that they are applicable to OCS
sources. 40 CFR 55.1. EPA has also evaluated the rules to ensure that they are not arbitrary or capricious. 40 CFR 55.12(e).
In addition, EPA has excluded administrative or procedural rules. 

A 30-day public comment period was provided in 59 FR 33719 and 59 FR 42194 and no comments were received. 



EPA Action 



In this document, EPA takes final action to incorporate the proposed changes into 40 CFR part 55. No changes were made
to the proposals set forth in the June 30, 1994 and August 17, 1994 notices of proposed rulemaking. EPA is approving
the submittal as modified under section 328(a)(1) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7627. Section 328(a) of the Act requires that
EPA establish requirements to control air pollution from OCS sources located within 25 miles of states' seaward boundaries
that are the same as onshore requirements. To comply with this statutory mandate, EPA must incorporate applicable
onshore rules into part 55 as they exist onshore. 



Administrative Requirements 



A. Executive Order 12291 (Regulatory Impact Analysis) 



The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291.
This exemption continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September
30, 1993. 



B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 



The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires each federal agency to perform a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
for all rules that are likely to have a ``significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' Small entities
include small businesses, 
organizations, and governmental jurisdictions. 

As was stated in the final regulation, the OCS rule does not apply to any small entities, and the structure of the rule
averts direct impacts and mitigates indirect impacts on small entities. This consistency update merely incorporates
onshore requirements into the OCS rule to maintain consistency with onshore regulations as required by section 328
of the Act and does not alter the structure of the rule. 

The EPA certifies that this final rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.




C. Paperwork Reduction Act 



The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has approved the information 
collection requirements contained in the final OCS rulemaking dated September 4, 1992 under the provisions of the


Paperwork Reduction Act

, 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq., 

and has assigned OMB control number 2060-0249. This consistency update does not add any further requirements.

Clean Air Act Promulgation of Reclassification of Ozone Nonattainment Area; States of New Jersey and New York 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing its final decision to reclassify the Poughkeepsie ozone
nonattainment area from a marginal nonattainment area to a moderate nonattainment area. This action also announces
a final determination that the Albany-Schenectady-Troy, NY; Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton, NJ-PA; Buffalo-Niagara
Falls, NY; Essex County, NY; and, Jefferson County, NY ozone nonattainment areas classified as marginal have attained
the ozone air quality standard by the attainment date of November 15, 1993. These actions are based on monitored air
quality readings of the national ambient air quality standard for ozone during the years 1991-1993.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On July 28, 1994, the EPA published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 38410) a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) concerning the reclassification of the Poughkeepsie ozone nonattainment
area from marginal to moderate. The NPR also proposed a determination that the Albany-Schenectady-Troy, NY; Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton,
NJ-PA; Buffalo-Niagara Falls, NY; Essex County, NY; and, Jefferson County, NY marginal nonattainment areas attained
the ozone air quality standard by the attainment date of November 15, 1993. The reclassification and determinations
are based solely on ozone air quality data measured during the 1991-1993 period. 


The rationale for EPA's proposed action was explained in the NPR and will not be restated here since EPA's final action
does not differ from the proposed action in the NPR. EPA received eleven separate letters submitted by the public in
support of the proposed reclassification of the Poughkeepsie area. No adverse comments were received on the NPR.
Therefore, EPA is finalizing the proposed reclassification of the Poughkeepsie nonattainment area. This rule fulfills
EPA's obligations under Section 181(b)(2) to determine whether the Poughkeepsie area attained the ozone national
ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) by its attainment date, and to publish its determination in the 

Federal Register

. 
No comments were received on the proposed attainment determinations of the Albany-Schenectady-Troy, NY; Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton,
NJ-PA; Buffalo-Niagara Falls, NY; Essex County, NY; and, Jefferson County, NY marginal nonattainment areas. Therefore,
this rule also fulfills EPA's obligation under Section 181(b)(2)(A) which requires the Administrator, shortly
after the attainment date, to determine whether ozone nonattainment areas attained the NAAQS.

Final Action 


The EPA is reclassifying the Poughkeepsie ozone nonattainment area from a marginal nonattainment area to a moderate
nonattainment area. This action also determines that the Albany-Schenectady-Troy, NY; Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton,
NJ-PA; Buffalo-Niagara Falls, NY; Essex County, NY; and, Jefferson County, NY ozone nonattainment areas classified
as marginal have attained the ozone air quality standard by the attainment date of November 15, 1993. These actions
are based on measured ozone air quality levels during the years 1991-1993. Consequently, these areas are eligible
to be redesignated to attainment under section 107(d)(3), if the criteria of that provision are met. 
Nothing in this final rule should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future
request for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific
technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.

Under Executive Order 12866, which revoked and replaced Executive Order 12291, EPA is required to judge whether an
action is a ``significant regulatory action'' and therefore subject to the requirement of a regulatory impact analysis.
The Agency has determined that this reclassification would not adversely affect the economy to the degree set forth
in section 3(f) of the Executive Order as grounds for a finding that an action is a ``significant regulatory action.''
Furthermore, under the Executive Order, qualitative costs and benefits, such as environmental costs and benefits,
are given as much weight in determining the impact of a regulatory action as quantifiable costs and benefits, such
as economic costs and benefits. As such, the environmental benefits of this reclassification far outweigh any economic
effect of this regulatory action. Consequently, this action will not undergo review by the Office of Management and
Budget. 
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq., EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing
the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that
the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small
businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of
less than 50,000. 
Reclassification of nonattainment areas under section 181 of the Act do not create any significant new requirements
applicable to small entities. This action does not directly regulate small entities and there are no alternatives
to taking this action of 
the types identified in sections 603(c) and 604(a)(3) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Therefore, I certify that
this action does not have a significant impact on small entities.

ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Director of Defense Procurement has issued a final rule amending the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation
Supplement to fully implement the Department of Defense's authority to use simplified procedures for acquisitions
in support of a contingency operation.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
A. Background 



These revisions provide for the use of small purchase procedures up to $100,000 for any contract to be performed outside
the United States in support of a contingency operation as defined in 10 U.S.C. 101(a)(13). The revisions are based
on language in Sections 631 and 805 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1992 and 1993, which
modified the definition of small purchase threshold at 10 U.S.C. 2302(7) and added a definition of the term ``contingency
operation'' at 10 U.S.C. 101(a)(13).



B. Regulatory Flexibility Act



The rule does not constitute a significant revision within the meaning of FAR 1.501 and Public Law 98-577 and
publication for public comment is not required.



C. Paperwork Reduction Act



The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply as this rule imposes no information collection requirements which require
approval of the Office of Management and Budget.

101(a)(13).

3. Section 213.101 is revised to read as follows:



213.101 

Definitions.





Small purchase

 also means an acquisition of $100,000 or less using the procedures prescribed in FAR Part 13, if the contract is awarded
and performed outside the United States in support of a contingency operation as defined in 10 U.S.C. 101(a)(13).
10 U.S.C. 101(a)(13) defines ``contingency operation'' as a military operation that_

(1) Is designated by the Secretary of Defense as an operation in which members of the armed forces are or may become involved
in military actions, operations or hostilities against an enemy of the United States or against an opposing military
force; or

(2) Results in the call or order to, or retention on, active duty of members of the uniformed services under section

Interim rule with request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Director of Defense Procurement has issued an interim rule amending the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation
Supplement (DFARS) to permit contracting officers to consider factors other than cost or price when evaluating offers
for stevedoring services.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
A. Background


Section 15.605 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) permits contracting officers to evaluate offers on the
basis of cost or price and non-cost or non-price-related factors. The Director of Defense Procurement issued an interim
rule on September 29, 1994, by Departmental Letter 94-016, to revise the guidance at DFARS 247.270-5 and
247.270-6 for consistency with section 15.605 of the FAR.


B. Regulatory Flexibility Act


The interim rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within
the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq., 

because the rule is consistent with the existing policy at FAR 15.605. An initial regulatory flexibility analysis
has therefore not been performed. Comments are invited from small businesses and other interested parties. Comments
from small entities concerning the affected subpart will be considered in accordance with Section 610 of the Act.
Such comments must be submitted separately and cite DFARS Case 94-D005 in correspondence.


C. Paperwork Reduction Act


The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the rule does not impose any information collection requirements
which require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501, 

et seq.

Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Final Rule to Reclassify the Plant Isotria medeoloides (Small Whorled
Pogonia) From Endangered to Threatened


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) determines that 

Isotria medeoloides 

(small whorled pogonia) warrants reclassification from endangered to threatened. The determination is based on
the fulfillment of reclassification criteria as stated in the Small Whorled Pogonia (

Isotria medeoloides

) Recovery Plan: First Revision (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1992) and substantial improvement in the status of
this orchid species. As outlined in the revised Recovery Plan, reclassification of 

Isotria medeoloides 

from endangered to threatened should proceed when a minimum of 25 percent of the known viable sites (as of 1992) are
protected. Currently, 61 percent of the viable populations are permanently protected. This rule implements the
Federal protection and recovery provisions for threatened species as provided by the Act.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


Background




Isotria medeoloides 

(small whorled pogonia), a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae), was first described by Frederick Pursh in 1814
as 

Arethusa medeoloides. 

In 1838, this orchid was placed in its own genus and recognized as 

Isotria medeoloides; 

however, it also became known as 

Pogonia affinis 

and 

Isotria affinis. 

M.L. Fernald clarified the nomenclature in 1947, making the latter names synonyms of 

Isotria medeoloides.
Isotria medeoloides 

is an herbaceous perennial with slender, hairy, fibrous roots that radiate from a crown or rootstock. The five or six
milky-green or grayish-green, elliptic and somewhat pointed leaves (four leaves in some vegetative plants) are
displayed in a whorl at the apex of a smooth, green stem. 

Isotria medeoloides 

flowers from mid-May in the south to mid-June in the northern part of its range. A single yellowish-green flower, or
occasionally flower pair, stands in the center of the whorl of leaves.
An individual plant is usually single-stemmed, although two or more stems may occur; however, closely grouped double
stems may in fact be two single plants (Bill Brumback, New England Wildflower Society, 

in litt. 

1993). Because of the difficulty in differentiating double stemmed plants from closely neighboring plants, population
estimates are often based on the number of stems, as opposed to the number of plants.


Isotria medeoloides 

can be confused with 

Isotria verticillata 

(Willd.) Raf. (large whorled pogonia), the only other species in the genus 

Isotria. 

Characteristics that distinguish 

I. medeoloides 

from 

I. verticillata 

include the stem and flower color, the relative lengths of the sepals and petals, and the length of the stem of the fruit
capsule in relation to the length of the capsule itself (Rawinski 1989a). Colonies of 

Isotria verticillata 

are often found near colonies of 

Isotria medeoloides 

in the extensive region in which they occur together (A. Belden, Virginia Division of Natural Heritage, 

in litt. 

1991). They have also been reported to grow mixed together (Dixon and Cook 1988).


Isotria medeoloides 

occurs both in fairly young forests and in maturing stands of mixed-deciduous or mixed-deciduous/coniferous forests.
The majority of small whorled pogonia sites share several common characteristics. These may include sparse to moderate
ground cover in the microhabitat (except when among ferns), a relatively open understory canopy, and proximity to
old logging roads, streams, or other features that create long-persisting breaks in the forest canopy (Mehrhoff
1989a). The soil in which the shallow-rooted small whorled pogonia grows is usually covered with leaf litter and decaying
material (Mehrhoff 1980, Sperduto 1993). The spectrum of habitats includes dry, rocky, wooded slopes to moist slopes
or slope bases crisscrossed by vernal streams.


Isotria medeoloides 

is widely distributed with a primary range extending from southern Maine and New Hampshire through the Atlantic seaboard
States to northern Georgia and southeastern Tennessee. Outlying colonies have been found in the western half of Pennsylvania,
Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, and Ontario, Canada.

There are three main population centers of 

Isotria medeoloides. 

The northernmost concentration, comprising 66 sites in 1993, is centered in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains
in New England and northern coastal Massachusetts, with one outlying site in Rhode Island. A second grouping of 18
sites is located at the southern extreme of the Appalachian chain in the Blue Ridge Mountains where North Carolina,
South Carolina, Georgia, and Tennessee join. The third center, with 13 sites, is concentrated in the coastal plain
and piedmont provinces of Virginia, with outliers in Delaware and New Jersey. Seven sites scattered in the outlying
States and Ontario are considered disjunct populations.


Previous Federal Action




Isotria medeoloides 

was listed as endangered on September 10, 1982 (47 FR 39827-39831). At that time, records for the species were
known from 48 counties in 16 States and Canada, though there were only 17 extant sites, in 10 States and Ontario, Canada.
These sites had less than 500 stems. Subsequent searches led to the discovery of many new sites. In 1991, 86 sites in
15 States and Canada (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1992) were known. By 1993, 17 additional sites in New Hampshire
and 1 site in Maine were discovered, bringing the total to 104 extant sites (Table 1). A number of States currently have
only historic sites; these include Vermont, New York, Maryland, Missouri, and the District of Columbia.






The first Small Whorled Pogonia Recovery Plan was completed in 1985 (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1985). The original
objective, outlined in the 1985 recovery plan and based on the best available information at that time, was to locate
and protect 30 populations (sites) of at least 20 individuals each, with at least 15 of the sites to be located in New
England. Implementation of several recovery tasks generated additional life history and population information,
the identification of new sites and protection of those sites deemed important to the survival and recovery of this
species.
Upon review of new life history and site information, this recovery objective was no longer considered appropriate.
Viability, based on the reproductive status and persistence of a population, as opposed to merely a stem count, is
now considered to be an important factor in determining the recoverability of this species.
The Small Whorled Pogonia Recovery Plan: First Revision, was completed and approved in 1992. New recovery goals for
the reclassification and delisting of 

Isotria medeoloides 

and tasks for the recovery of this species were developed using the most recent information regarding population
trends and dynamics, life history, and previous recovery efforts. The current recovery strategy is based on a multi-faceted
approach of habitat protection and management (on a site specific basis), threat reduction, and environmental education.

The Service identified recovery criteria required for the reclassification of 

Isotria medeoloides 

from endangered to threatened in the 1992 recovery plan. Reclassification would be pursued when a minimum of 25 percent
of the known, viable sites (as of 1992) is permanently protected. A site is considered viable if it has a geometric mean
(over 3 years) of 20 emergent stems, of which at least 25 percent are flowering stems. Though not discussed in the recovery
plan, an alternative viability definition has since been developed for sites located in the southern part of the range.
This definition was based upon information provided by botanists familiar with these small, yet persistent populations
(B. Sanders, U.S. Forest Service, pers. comm. 1993). Viability for smaller populations may be considered for those
sites where less than 20 stems have persistently emerged for over 15 years. A determination of viability based on a
stem count of less than 20 stems would require a long-term commitment to monitoring a site.
In addition to site viability and protection, reclassification necessitates that the protected, viable sites be
distributed proportionally throughout the species' current range. Site protection should include a sufficient
buffer zone around the populations to allow the potential for natural colonization of adjacent, unoccupied habitat.
As defined in the 1992 recovery plan, protection can be accomplished through_(1) Ownership by a government agency
or a private organization that considers maintenance of the 

I. medeoloides 

population to be a management objective for the site, or (2) a deeded easement or covenant that effectively commits
present and future landowners to protecting the population and allowing the implementation of management activities
when appropriate. This high level of landowner commitment to site protection may be critical if it is determined that
the species needs management to counteract the loss of nearby unoccupied habitat. The need for habitat management
would be reviewed on a site-by-site basis, and be dependent upon the completion of Task 2.1 of the 1992 recovery plan,
which is to determine appropriate management strategies.
Adequate protection for the purposes of reclassification has been achieved for approximately 50 percent of the viable
New England center populations; 57 percent of viable populations in the Virginia center; and 100 percent of the viable
populations in the Blue Ridge center. No populations in the outlying States are considered to be viable, though 4 of
the 6 extant populations are protected. As a result of meeting the reclassification criteria outlined in the 1992
recovery plan, the Service published a proposed rule to reclassify 

Isotria medeoloides 

from endangered to threatened in the 

Federal Register

 on October 19, 1993 (FR 53904).
The ultimate goal of the 1992 recovery plan is to ensure long-term viability of 

Isotria medeoloides, 

facilitating the removal of the species from the Federal list. This objective would be reached when a minimum of 61
sites (75 percent of the number of viable sites known in 1992) are permanently protected.
As in the reclassification criteria, the distribution of these sites must be proportionate among the three geographic
centers and the outliers. Viable sites for delisting the species are those sites with self-sustaining populations
having an average of 20 emergent stems (over a 10-year period), of which an average of 25 percent are flowering stems.
The extended period of monitoring time is required to ensure long-term viability, and should factor in the potential
for naturally induced dormancy of individual plants. An alternative definition for viability of smaller populations
in the southern portion of the small whorled pogonia's range may be considered and substantiated through the recovery
process for sites where less than 20 stems, of which an average of 25 percent are flowering, have persistently emerged
for over 15 years.
Ideally, unoccupied habitat adjacent to existing colonies must also be protected to allow for natural colonization
and maintenance of a self-sustaining population. In some cases, only the immediate area encompassing 

Isotria medeoloides 

populations has been protected, while surrounding habitat has been destroyed. For these sites, management strategies
to maintain self-sustaining populations may need to replace the historical availability of additional habitat.
The management strategies would be dependent upon completion of Tasks 2.1 and 5.2 of the 1992 recovery plan.

An individual suggested that reclassification was premature because the Service's definition of viability is based
on the population's reproductive status as opposed to a stem count and reproductive status. However, the Service's
definition of a viable population for this species includes both stem counts (geometric mean of 20 plants over a 3-year
period) and reproductive status of the population (25 percent of the population must have flowering individuals).
Therefore, the Service believes the definition for viable populations requires both constancy of stem emergence
and reproduction, and provides for the best possible determination given current life history information.
Another comment questioned the Service's standard of an average of 20 stems over a 10-year period for a viable population.
The individual suggested that the majority of extant populations be monitored for 10 years prior to determining the
viability for all populations with 20 stems or more. The Service assumes that the commenter is referring to the delisting
criteria. The stated recovery criteria are based on the best scientific and professional judgment available and
were given public review during the revision of the recovery plan in 1992. No comments were received at that time opposing
the criteria. Furthermore, the majority of populations averaging 20 or more stems have been monitored periodically
for close to 10 years or since their discovery. Waiting to reclassify this species until such time as 10 years have passed
for all sites with 20 stems or more would delay reclassification indefinitely, given that new populations continue
to be discovered. The Service believes that the reclassification criteria are sufficiently protective and adequately
define viability.
The commenter also interpreted the Service's recovery strategy to include habitat management and questioned its
inclusion given the lack of information on appropriate and successful management. While it is true that habitat management
strategies currently have not been developed, the Service believes that the potential for habitat management may
exist. Habitat management will only be an aspect of the recovery strategy should it be deemed a useful tool. The proposed
rule did not mean to imply that this was a given.
The Service was requested to consider reclassifying the species in a section of its range. The Act does not provide
for the separate listing or reclassification of plant populations.
Two commenters questioned the protection afforded threatened plants under the Act. The Service does not believe
that protection will be significantly lessened by reclassification to threatened. The protection given to this
threatened species under sections 7 and 9 of the Act is essentially the same as when listed as endangered. The only exception
to future protection is the exemption given to seeds from cultivated specimens of threatened plants. Cultivated


Isotria medeoloides 

seeds will be exempt from the trade prohibitions of section 9(a)(2) of the Act, provided that a statement of ``cultivated
origin'' appears on their containers. However, retention of threatened status reflects the Service's awareness
that threats continue to exist for 

Isotria medeoloides, 

though it is no longer in immediate danger of extinction.


Summary of Factors Affecting the Species


After a thorough review and consideration of all information available, the Service has determined that 

Isotria medeoloides 

should be reclassified as a threatened species. Procedures found in section 4(a)(1) of the Act and regulations implementing
the listing provisions of the Act (50 CFR part 424) for reclassifying species on the Federal lists were followed. A
species may be listed or reclassified as threatened or endangered due to one or more of the five factors described in
section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to 

Isotria medeoloides 

(Pursh) Raf. (small whorled pogonia) are as follows:
A. 

The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range. 

Following the listing of 

Isotria medeoloides 

as endangered, recovery activities carried out by Federal and State agencies, private organizations, and the academic
community resulted in the discovery of many new sites. The number of extant sites has more than tripled in the 11 years
since the orchid was listed, with approximately 48 percent of the 

I. medeoloides 

sites afforded some level of protection.


Isotria medeoloides 

and its habitat continue to be vulnerable to development pressures throughout its range. With the exception of a few
States, the upland habitat in which it is found receives limited protection through State or Federal regulatory means
when occurring on private land. Residential and commercial development, both directly and indirectly, are primarily
responsible for the destruction of 

Isotria medeoloides 

habitat. Of the 104 extant 

I. medeoloides 

sites, 2 States, Maine and New Hampshire, account for 57 percent (59 sites) of all of the known sites. Only 15 of the 59
sites in these 2 States are protected.

Historical records exist for localities throughout the small whorled pogonia's range. The habitat of many of these
known historical sites has been destroyed; for example, sites in Vermont, Maryland, New Jersey, and the District
of Columbia were lost to habitat destruction, primarily from development. Recent intensive efforts to relocate
historical sites in eastern Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont, and Missouri have been unsuccessful (U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service 1992). 
Since the listing of 

Isotria medeoloides, 

New Hampshire has seen the destruction of a large, viable population by the construction of summer housing and the
potential destruction of a second, recently discovered (1992) population. This second population of over 30 stems
will most likely be severely impacted, if not destroyed, within the next few years as the habitat is developed for a
subdivision. In Virginia, one of the larger sites will most likely be destroyed within the next few years as its habitat,
and adjoining suitable habitat, is developed for housing. Without voluntary landowner protection, many more 

I. medeoloides

 populations could be destroyed as development pressures increase. 
Development in areas surrounding 

Isotria medeoloides 

habitat could indirectly be responsible for habitat destruction as roads, power lines and sewer mains are designed
to connect settled areas. In addition, housing developments, though not necessarily directly destroying habitat,
may cause the alteration of habitat parameters by creating large, permanent openings in the canopy that in turn encourage
denser understory growth. Disturbance to populations through increased visitation (however unintentional) from
people and pets might also cause direct damage to plants, and eventually a decline in affected populations. 
This plant primarily appears to reproduce sexually, though little is known at this time regarding seed dispersal
and seed banking. The formation of barriers to seed dispersal, either through development of adjacent habitat or
from logging or land clearing, may prevent the recolonization of suitable habitat by naturally declining populations.
Careful and selective logging may not be harmful to a population; however, heavy timbering and clear-cutting may
have long-term impacts on 

Isotria medeoloides 

populations and their habitat. The creation of logging roads and use of heavy machinery that severely alters soil
composition could significantly modify the habitat and cause the direct loss of plants. 
B. 

Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes. 

The 1982 final listing identified the collecting for scientific purposes as contributing to the loss of 

Isotria medeoloides

 in the past. Since the listing and the release of both recovery plans, collecting for these purposes is no longer considered
to be a threat to the species. However, the potential collecting by wildflower garden enthusiasts for transplanting
is still great due to the rarity of this orchid. One landowner in North Carolina was literally harassed by orchid and
wildflower enthusiasts when a local garden club publicized the location of his 

I. medeoloides

 population (Nora Murdock, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 

in litt.

 1993). Furthermore, vandalism of populations (either out of capriciousness or for private collections) whose locations
were publicized continue to be documented (Rawinski 1986b). 
Significant commercial trade in the species is not known or expected in the future, nor is any significant import or
export of this species expected. Therefore, taking of 

I. medeoloides

 for these purposes is not considered to be a factor in its decline.

C. 

Disease or predation. 

Herbivory by white-tailed deer and invertebrates, including slugs and camel crickets is a known threat of currently
unknown extent. Increasing development pressure near 

Isotria medeoloides 

populations results in the concentration of deer onto smaller parcels of woodland and may decrease local hunting
pressure on suburban deer populations. As the local deer herd increases and is forced onto less land, there is a greater
likelihood of herbivory on 

Isotria medeoloides. 

In Virginia, the magnitude of threat from deer browse of 

I. medeoloides

 populations may be second only to development of its habitat (D. Ware, College of William and Mary, pers. comm. 1994).
The precipitous decline of a large Virginia 

I. medeoloides 

population located near a housing development, appears to be primarily due to grazing (Ware 1991). However, symbolic
fencing placed around four subpopulations appears to have prevented deer from grazing on the orchids. In 1993, no
plants were observed to have been browsed, prior to the fencing a majority of the plants were impacted by deer browse
(D. Ware, pers. comm. 1994). 

Additional threats include wild pigs trampling or uprooting 

I. medeoloides 

plants and herbivory by rabbits in the southern portion of the small whorled pogonia's range (B. Sanders, pers. comm.
1993) and occasionally trampling or herbivory by moose in the northern portion of its range. 

D. 

The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms. Isotria medeoloides 

is afforded protection by the Endangered Species Act. The Act prohibits the take of endangered and threatened plants
from lands under Federal jurisdiction or in knowing violation of any State law or regulation, and prohibits the violation
of any regulation pertaining to any endangered or threatened species of plant. Under the Act, Federal agencies are
required to ensure that their actions do not jeopardize the continued existence of listed species and must consult
(under section 7) when an activity may affect a listed species or critical habitat. 

Section 7(a)(1) requires Federal agencies to carry out programs for the conservation of threatened and endangered
species. In this respect, several Federal agencies have intensified their search and protection efforts on behalf
of 

Isotria medeoloides. 

In Virginia, the National Park Service provided funding for research and monitoring, and is seeking ways to prevent
disturbance to sites under its jurisdiction. The Department of Defense has also facilitated searches and monitoring
of populations at two bases in Virginia. In Georgia, the U.S. Forest Service has been particularly successful in finding
new sites. The Forest Service in this State conducts plant surveys in areas potentially impacted by management activities
and regularly monitors known sites (B. Sanders, 

in litt.

 1993). In 1993, two sites were located on the White Mountain National Forest in New Hampshire. Base maps for potential


I. medeoloides 

habitat were developed for the White Mountain National Forest; the Forest Service now consults the Service on all
activities proposed for those areas. 

Consultations under section 7 of the Act can provide protection for this species; a road and sewer main near an 

Isotria medeoloides 

population in Virginia were re-routed to avoid direct destruction of the plants and their habitat. Coordination
with State and local agencies, as well as private developers, has resulted in the avoidance of adverse impacts to 

Isotria medeoloides 

and its habitat. In Connecticut, a trail was re-routed to avoid a population in a State forest. 

Additional protection through Federal and State legislation has been provided since 

Isotria medeoloides 

was listed. All States with current and historical populations have cooperative plant agreements with the Fish and
Wildlife Service as specified under section 6(c)(2) of the Act. The 1988 amendments to the Act increased protection
for plant species not on Federal lands, where State endangered species laws provide specific protection to endangered
plant species. 

Twenty-seven sites have been discovered on lands under State and Federal jurisdiction and are afforded some level
of protection. For those populations on private lands, conservation easements or agreements with the landowners
have been actively pursued. Eight sites are on lands owned by private conservation organizations, while two other
sites have deeded conservation easements ensuring the protection of the plants and their habitat. Some State agencies
pursue voluntary registration of I. 

medeoloides 

sites. While such registration does not guarantee habitat protection, it does seek to recognize the importance of
the site in the hopes of voluntary protection on the part of the landowners. 

The number of States protecting 

I. medeoloides

 has increased from 6 in 1985 to include all States in its present range. With the exceptions of New Jersey, Rhode Island
and South Carolina, all States have enacted laws that prohibit the take of State listed plants, including 

I. medeoloides

, without the landowner's permission. However, plants growing on privately owned lands are subject to take by the
landowner. Massachusetts, Michigan and Vermont provide additional protection to listed plants in that permits
are required for take on both private and public lands. 

In Georgia, 

Isotria medeoloides 

is protected under a regional Forest Service Manual regulation, 2670.44 R-8 supp 37. Since this species is federally
listed, it qualifies as a Forest Service Potential Endangered, Threatened or Sensitive (PET) species, and as such
should receive a level of protection that will lead to identification of possible recovery opportunities and ensure
that no adverse effects occur to plants on lands under the Forest Service's jurisdiction. 

The Service does not believe that reclassification to threatened status will result in substantive changes in the
protection afforded this species under these regulatory mechanisms.

E. 

Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.

 Recovery efforts have been directed toward research and environmental education. A predictive habitat model was
developed using Geographical Information System (GIS); 10 additional sites were discovered in 1993 using maps delineating
potential habitat (Sperduto 1993). Educational materials in the form of posters, brochures and fact sheets were
designed and made available to the general public. Ongoing research includes the investigation of mycorrhizal relationships
(Larry Zetler, Clemson University, 

in litt.

 1993), and habitat manipulation to encourage or stabilize 

I. medeoloides

 populations (Alison Dibble, University of Maine, 

in litt.

 1993). 
Mycorrhizal associations are important factors in the germination and seedling establishment of most orchids.
Though a mycorrhizal fungus was isolated from the closely related 

Isotria verticillata,

 host-specific mycorrhizae have not been identified for 

I. medeoloides.

 Alterations to 

I. medeoloides

 habitat that adversely affect the mycorrhizae would also result in adverse impacts to the orchid. However, until
the specific mycorrhizal associate is determined, it will be difficult to understand the effects of subtle habitat
alteration on the orchid or the fungal community. 
Recent monitoring results indicate a decline in viability of many of the populations that have been followed over
a number of years. It appears that no obvious changes have occurred to the habitat of most of these populations and no
causes for this decline have been determined. Though life history and demographic studies have provided some clues
to the habitat requirements of this species, there is still a large gap in the understanding of what is required to maintain
viable populations. 
Dormancy of 

Isotria medeoloides

 plants continues to be a matter of speculation and debate. The 1985 recovery plan provided preliminary information
that a small whorled pogonia could go dormant for 10 to 20 years. To date, this length of dormancy has not been verified.
The length of dormancy might also vary throughout the range of the orchid. Mehrhoff (1989b) conducted a 6-year study
and observed that no plants emerged after 3 or more consecutive years; other studies indicate that plants may be dormant
up to 4 years and dormancy may vary by year and by site (Brumback and Fyler 1988; Vitt 1991). Without better clarification
of specific dormancy periods, it is difficult to distinguish between a dead or dormant plant. 
As adjacent, suitable habitat is developed, precluding the natural colonization of suitable habitat, management
may be the only alternative for maintaining viable populations. It may be vital to develop habitat management strategies
for existing sites in order to maintain self-sustaining populations. Without the knowledge of key habitat characteristics,
management and the precise identification of potential habitat will be impossible. Soil type (including texture
and moisture), nutrient availability, overstory cover, understory density, slope position and aspect are some
of the habitat characteristics that might be important factors in population viability. Other unknown parameters
include the variation of climatological factors and relative humidity throughout the species' range, and how these
differences impact population stability, plant reproduction, recolonization and viability. 
The dearth in knowledge of habitat characteristics and life history information may result in the further decline
of many populations through benign neglect. The 1992 recovery plan identified a number of tasks required to advance
the understanding of 

Isotria medeoloides

 in furtherance of its recovery. 
The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past,
present, and future threats faced by this species in determining to make this rule final. Based on this evaluation,
the preferred action is to reclassify this species from endangered status to threatened status. Threatened status
is more appropriate because the number of known populations has tripled since the species was listed and 61 percent
of the current viable sites are afforded permanent protection. However, it may still be likely to become an endangered
species within the foreseeable future without additional site protection and further investigation of its life
history and habitat parameters. 


Effects of the Rule

This rule changes the status of 

Isotria medeoloides

 from endangered to threatened and formally recognizes that this species is no longer in imminent danger of extinction
throughout a significant portion of its range. Reclassification to threatened does not significantly alter the
protection for this species under the Act (see Summary of Comments and Recommendations). 
Conservation measures prescribed for 

Isotria medeoloides

 would proceed. The recovery program approved in 1992 prescribes continued efforts to_(1) protect known 

Isotria medeoloides

 populations and essential habitat; (2) develop habitat management strategies; (3) manage protected sites; (4)
monitor sites and determine viability; (5) survey for new sites; (6) investigate population dynamics and species
biology; and (7) provide public information and education. 
Many State and Federal agencies continue to monitor extant sites and search for new ones. The application of a predictive
model should further assist in the location of new sites in New England. Investigations into the genetic structure
of this species, the mycorrhizal relationships, and the development of habitat management measures have been targeted
in the 1992 recovery plan as important tasks. These activities are either ongoing or proposed for the near future.
Recovery activities are not expected to diminish as a result of this reclassification since the primary objective
of the recovery strategy is delisting of the species. 
This action will not be an irreversible commitment on the part of the Service. Reclassifying 

Isotria medeoloides

 to endangered would be possible should changes occur in management, habitat, or other factors that alter the present
threats to the species' survival and recovery. 


National Environmental Policy Act 


The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that Environmental Assessments and Environmental Impact Statements,
as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, need not be prepared in connection
with regulations adopted pursuant to section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A notice outlining
the Service's reasons for this determination was published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244).

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of reserve release; request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS announces the release of that portion of the 1994 Pacific whiting (whiting) harvest guideline that will not be
used by shoreside processors by the end of the year. The released amount is available for harvest by all U.S. fishing
vessels, whether delivering shoreside or at sea. This action is intended to assure full utilization of the whiting
resource, as authorized by the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan (FMP).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The regulations at 50 CFR 663.23(b)(4) allocate whiting in 1994-1996 between fishing vessels that deliver
at sea (catcher/processors and catcher boats delivering to motherships) and those that deliver shoreside (59 FR
17491, April 13, 1994). When 60 percent of the annual harvest guideline is taken, further at-sea processing is prohibited,
and the remaining 40 percent is reserved for use by vessels delivering shoreside. The portion of the harvest guideline
that the shoreside sector will not use by the end of the year will be made available for harvest by all fishing vessels,
whether delivering shoreside or at sea, by August 15 or as soon as practicable thereafter. Whiting may be released
at a later date if it becomes apparent that shore-based needs have been substantially over-estimated (50 CFR 663.23(b)(4)(ii)).



The amount of whiting available for release is determined by the Regional Director, based on estimates of actual and
projected amounts of whiting harvested, using state catch and landings data, the survey of domestic processing capacity
and intent, testimony received at Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) meetings, and/or other relevant
information. 
In 1994, the whiting harvest guideline is 260,000 mt. Of this, 104,000 mt was set aside as a reserve for shoreside processing.
At-sea processing of whiting was prohibited on May 13, 1994, when 60 percent (156,000 mt) of the harvest guideline
was projected to be reached. 
During the last week of July, 1994, the Regional Director reviewed catch and landings data provided by the States of
Washington, Oregon, and California; surveyed shore-based fishing and processing representatives; and consulted
with the three States in determining the amount of whiting expected to be processed shoreside for the remainder of
the year. Approximately 62,000 mt of whiting were projected to remain in the harvest guideline after August 1, 1994.
An estimated 35,500 mt had been delivered shoreside by August 1. Additional shore-based fishing and processing effort
entered the fishery late in July, and an additional 41,000-72,000 mt were estimated to be needed by the shore-based
sector through the end of 1994. Based on this information, the Regional Director determined that the shore-based
industry could use the remainder of the harvest guideline, and no whiting was made available for at-sea processing
on August 15. The Council concurred with this determination, and agreed that progress of the shore-based fishery
should be reevaluated in September 1994, and any surplus whiting released on or near October 1, 1994.
The States and industry were contacted again in late September, 1994 to determine the shore-based sector's use of
whiting for the remainder of 1994. Whiting had become less available to the fishery in September and catch rates were
lower than in earlier projections. Based on the most recent week's catch rate (389 mt/day applied through November
15, 1994) and interest of some operations to continue to the end of the year, the Regional Director has determined that,
of the 38,000 mt of the harvest guideline remaining after September 25, 1994, 16,000 mt are available for release to
all vessels on October 1, 1994. The remaining 22,000 mt are in reserve for shore-based processing.
After October 1, 1994, shore-based landings of whiting will be deducted first from the reserve for shore-based processing.
When the shoreside reserve is taken, shoreside deliveries will be deducted from the portion of the harvest guideline
that was released for harvest by all vessels. When the released amount is reached, or projected to be reached, further
at-sea processing will be prohibited. When the harvest guideline is reached, a 10,000 lb (4536 kg) trip limit will
be imposed, allowing landings only of whiting caught incidentally or in the small fresh and bait fisheries (as authorized
at 50 CFR 663.23(b)(3)(i) and (c)(1)(i)(I), and at 59 FR 685 (January 6, 1994)). 


Secretarial Action


For the reasons stated above, the Regional Director announces that, at 0001 hours local time October 1, 1994, an additional
16,000 mt of Pacific whiting are made available for harvest by all fishing vessels. When this amount is reached, further
at-sea processing will be prohibited, according to the procedures at 50 CFR 663.23(b)(4)(iv).


Classification


The determination to take this action is based on the most recent data available. 
This action is taken under the authority of 50 CFR 663.23(b)(4) and is exempt from review under E.O. 12866.
