Equine Infectious Anemia 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are proposing to amend the regulations concerning interstate movement of horses that test positive for equine
infectious anemia to allow the horses to be moved interstate directly to slaughter under a permit and in a sealed conveyance,
as an alternative to the horses being officially identified prior to the interstate movement with a hot iron or chemical
brand, freezemarking, or a lip tattoo. This proposed change in the regulations would provide owners of equine infectious
anemia reactors with an alternative means of handling their animals while preventing the spread of this communicable
disease. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



The regulations in 9 CFR part 75 (referred to below as the regulations) contain provisions for the interstate movement
of horses, asses, ponies, mules, and zebras that test positive for communicable diseases, including equine infections
anemia (EIA). The purpose of these provisions is to prevent the spread of communicable diseases, including EIA. A
viral disease of equines, EIA, also known as swamp fever, may be characterized by sudden fever, swelling of the legs
and lower parts of the body, severe weight loss, and anemia. 

Section 75.4(a) of the regulations defines an EIA reactor as any horse, ass, mule, pony or zebra which is subjected
to an official test and found positive. Under  75.4(b) of the regulations, no EIA reactor may be moved interstate
unless the reactor is officially identified and meets certain other requirements. Section 75.4(a) of the regulations
defines ``officially identified'' as the permanent identification of a reactor with markings permanently applied
by an Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) representative, a State representative, or an accredited
veterinarian using a hot iron or chemical brand, freezemarking or a lip tattoo. 

APHIS believes that EIA reactors could be moved interstate to slaughter under a permit and in a sealed conveyance,
as an alternative to being officially identified prior to the interstate movement. Moving EIA reactors interstate
to slaughter under a permit and in a sealed conveyance would ensure that the animals are not diverted for other uses.


Therefore, we are proposing to amend the requirements for interstate movement in  75.4(b) by adding a provision
stating that ``Official identification is not necessary if the animal is moved directly to slaughter, traveling
under a permit and in a sealed conveyance.'' In addition, we propose to add definitions to  75.4(a) for ``official
seal'' and ``permit.'' An official seal would be defined as a ``serially numbered metal or plastic strip, or a serially
numbered button, consisting of a self-locking device on one end and a slot on the other end, which forms a loop when the
ends are engaged and which cannot be reused if opened. It is applied by an APHIS representative or State representative.''
A permit would be defined as an ``official document (VS Form 1-27 or a State form which contains the same information,
but not a `permit for entry') issued by an APHIS representative, State representative, or accredited veterinarian
which lists the owner's name and address, points of origin and destination, number of animals covered, purpose of
the movement, and one of the following: The individual animal registered breed association registration tattoo,
individual animal registered breed association registration number, or similar individual identification, including
name, age, sex, breed, color, and markings.'' 



Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 



This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The rule has been determined to be not significant
for purposes of Executive Order 12866, and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.

Because this proposed rule would provide an alternative, the economic impact to horse owners would be minimal. The
horse owners that would be affected by this rule change are those that have horses which test positive for EIA and voluntarily
choose to transport their horses interstate to slaughter under an official seal. APHIS estimates that, annually,
between 500 and 1,000 horse operations have horses that become infected with EIA. Although it is not known how many
of these operations are ``small'' entities (less than $0.5 million in annual sales, according to Small Business Administration
size criteria), it is likely that most are in that category. 

Current estimates put the number of horses in the United States between 6 and 10 million. In 1993, about 1 million horses
were tested for EIA. Of these, 1,859 (about 0.18 percent) tested positive for EIA. 

Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 



Executive Order 12372 



This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive
Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. (See 7 CFR part 3015,
subpart V.) 



Executive Order 12778 



This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. If this proposed rule is adopted:
(1) All State and local laws and regulations that are in conflict with this rule will be preempted; (2) no retroactive
effect will be given to this rule; and (3) administrative proceedings will not be required before parties may file
suit in court challenging this rule. 



Paperwork Reduction Act 



In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the information collection or recordkeeping
requirements included in this proposed rule have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under
OMB control number 0579-0051. 



List of Subjects in 9 CFR Part 75 



Animal diseases, Horses, Quarantine, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Transportation.




Accordingly, 9 CFR part 75 would be amended as follows: 



PART 75_COMMUNICABLE DISEASES IN HORSES, ASSES, PONIES, MULES, AND ZEBRAS 



1. The authority citation for part 75 would continue to read as follows:

7 CFR 2.17, 2.51, and 371.2(d).




2. In  75.4, paragraph (a) would be amended by adding new definitions, in alphabetical order, and in paragraph
(b), the introductory text would be amended by adding a statement immediately before the colon, to read as follows:




 75.4 

Interstate movement of equine infectious anemia reactors and approval of laboratories, diagnostic facilities,

<ACTION>
action:

 Request for data.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary:

 This document announces that the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service is requesting additional information
to determine whether the regulations under the Virus-Serum-Toxin Act should be amended to require that rabies vaccines
be distributed and used only by or under the direct supervision of licensed veterinarians.


The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has received requests from the National Association of State Public
Health Veterinarians to consider proposing such a restriction.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information:

 The regulations concerning veterinary biological products in 9 CFR 102.5(e) provide that:



[W]here the Administrator determines that the protection of domestic animals or the public health, interest, or
safety, or both necessitates restrictions on the use of a product, the product shall be subject to such additional
restrictions as are prescribed on the license. Such restrictions may include, but are not limited to, limits on distribution
of the product or provisions that the biological product is restricted to use by veterinarians, or under the supervision
of veterinarians, or both.



The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has received requests from the National Association of State
Public Health Veterinarians (NASPHV) to consider proposing a Federal restriction that animal rabies vaccines be
distributed and used only by or under the direct supervision of a licensed veterinarian. The NASPHV believes that
a uniform national restriction would result in: (1) proper handling of animal rabies vaccines to help ensure potency
and (2) improved documentation of animal rabies vaccinations.
APHIS has attempted to identify specific issues that need to be addressed prior to proposing such restrictions on
animal rabies vaccines. The Agency is seeking data and information on these issues for consideration before it decides
whether or not to proceed with such a proposal.

In 1979, APHIS published a notice of proposed action (44 FR 54737-54738, September 21, 1979) to restrict animal
rabies vaccines to distribution and use by or under the direction of a licensed veterinarian. APHIS received 150 comments
in response to that notice of proposed action. Sixty-six commenters supported the proposed action without change.
Seventy-two commenters were opposed to the proposed action. At that time, there was a lack of agreement concerning
the need and justification for a Federal restriction. The prevailing opinion of those opposed to a Federal restriction
was that there was a need for flexibility to meet local needs, especially in rural areas.
Based on the comments received in 1979, the restriction that animal rabies vaccine be distributed and used by or under
the direction of a veterinarian was not imposed on a nationwide basis. Rather, APHIS determined that the decision
concerning control of distribution and use of animal rabies vaccines should be made by each State based on what would
work best for a particular State. Thus the current restriction reads in relevant part that animal rabies vaccines
are restricted ``to authorized recipients designated by proper State officials under such additional conditions
as those authorities may require'' (

see

 44 FR 18411, March 21, 1980).
At least 34 States currently restrict or have pending legislation to restrict the distribution and use of animal rabies
vaccines. Some sixteen States do not restrict the distribution and use of animal rabies vaccines.
The National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians (NASPHV), the American Veterinary Medical Association
(AVMA), and other organizations including State public health agencies have expressed concern regarding rabies
control programs in various States. They requested in 1989 that APHIS consider the promulgation of a Federal restriction
on the distribution and use of animal rabies vaccines on a nationwide basis to protect the health and safety of animals
and the public.
The groups that took an active role in studying the various problems associated with the control of rabies were the
NASPHV Compendium Committee, the National Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the AVMA, State and local
veterinary medical associations, veterinary medical schools, veterinary practitioners, and numerous State public
health agencies.
The NASPHV evaluated the progress of rabies control programs in the United States. As a result of its study, NASPHV
requested that the Federal Government consider strengthening current restrictions aimed toward controlling rabies
nationwide.
In response to the request from the NASPHV to amend the Federal restriction on animal rabies vaccines to require that
they be distributed and used only by or under the direct supervision of a licensed veterinarians, APHIS requested
that the NASPHV address four issues raised by the comments to the 1979 notice of proposed action concerning restrictions
on animal rabies vaccines. Four main points were cited by commenters opposing the 1979 proposed restriction that
rabies vaccines be distributed and used only by or under the direction of a veterinarian: (1) There were inadequate
veterinary services in remote rural areas of the United States; (2) a veterinary monopoly on rabies vaccine would
raise the cost of vaccination to unaffordable amounts (especially for individuals with many animals), resulting
in fewer animals being vaccinated; (3) traveling to and from a veterinary clinic during business hours (especially
for individuals with many animals) could be very inconvenient and impractical; and (4) APHIS has no information whether
misuse of rabies vaccines by nonveterinarians is a problem.

In response to the questions which were raised, NASPHV made the following replies. The local needs of rural areas within
the United States have changed since 1979, and the lack of adequate veterinary services in rural States is no longer
a problem. The veterinary profession stands ready to accommodate owners of multiple pets. NASPHV also indicated
that in many cases, the cost of a rabies vaccination from a veterinarian had not kept up with the rising consumer price
index. In addition, the Association stated that the inconvenience of traveling to and from a veterinary clinic during
business hours for rabies vaccinations was no different than the inconvenience of pet ownership in general, and that
improper vaccination by nonveterinarians was worse than no vaccination at all because such vaccination gave a false
sense of security.

The NASPHV argued that proper handling of animal rabies vaccines, including cold storage, physical examination
of the animal receiving vaccine to ensure the health status of the animal, proper timing and route of administration
according to label instructions, and knowledge of rabies control were essential for effective rabies vaccination.

The NASPHV further argued that in a mobile society such as the United States, it was unfair and unsafe for the public
to rely on so many different State rabies laws and regulations to protect the public. The restriction of rabies vaccines
at the Federal level would reduce confusion, unnecessary revaccination, and the necessity for human post-exposure
treatment. Further, as endemic reservoirs of wildlife rabies continue to spread and put more areas of the United States
at risk, the standardization of rabies control becomes more important. The Association concluded that the need for
proper administration and improved documentation of animal rabies vaccinations are the most important issues concerning
national rabies prevention in man and animals.

A case arose in 1986, in which a rabies vaccine manufacturer needed to follow documentation of rabies vaccinations
in order to trace recipients of its vaccine after a change had been made in the instructions for administration. Since
the particular manufacturer's vaccine was sold to and administered by veterinarians or State authorized recipients,
in large part, the appropriate records were available for the tracking and revaccination of thousands of animals.

Public health officials have expressed concern regarding the uncertainties of vaccine administration and certification
when animals are vaccinated by nonveterinarians or without adequate veterinary supervision. There is reason to
believe that some distributors, in States without restrictions on vaccine sale or administration, are distributing
rabies vaccines to unauthorized individuals in other States that currently have such restrictions. This practice
destroys the effectiveness of State programs designed to monitor and verify vaccine sale and administration in such
States and is contrary to their law. Such practice also creates significant safety concerns since any failure associated
with vaccine administration and documentation increases the risk of rabies exposure to both animals and man.

Dogs and cats that have properly documented rabies vaccinations and that are involved in bite cases involving a human
being are isolated and observed for 10 days at a veterinary quarantine facility to confirm the absence of rabies. When
the vaccination record of a dog or cat that has bitten someone cannot be verified, the animal may be euthanized to determine
if rabies virus is present in brain tissue. In these cases, the individual who has been bitten and the physician are
placed in the position of weighing the risks and costs of post-exposure prophylactic treatment against the odds of
having been exposed to rabies. Because the verification of animal rabies vaccination is important in decisions relating
to both animals and man, the Association argued that the issue of proper documentation of vaccination is a major concern.
The fact that 618 cases of rabies among domestic animals in the United States (including 155 dogs and 189 cats) were
reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 1991 makes an informed choice important. Because of
questions concerning proper vaccine handling, storage, administration, documentation of vaccination and revaccination,
and recordkeeping, many State public health departments disregard rabies vaccination claims by owners and only
rely on documentation from a veterinarian as proof of vaccination.

After reviewing NASPHV's request to amend the Federal restriction on the distribution and use of animal rabies vaccines,
APHIS has determined that it needs additional information to determine the appropriate course of action with respect
to this matter. Before proceeding with a proposal to amend the Federal restriction on animal rabies vaccines, the
Agency must determine whether such an amendment would in fact be beneficial, whether rabies control programs and
rabies vaccination could not be better managed by the States and local jurisdictions, and whether the benefit of Federal
control would outweigh the cost of such a program.

It could be argued that the anticipated benefits from amending the Federal restriction on animal rabies vaccines
to require that they be distributed and used only by or under the direct supervision of a licensed veterinarian would
be: (1) more uniform regulation of the distribution and administration of animal rabies vaccines, (2) improved documentation
of animal rabies vaccinations to enable public health officials to make an informed choice concerning the therapy
for animal bite victims; (3) facilitation of the recall of any unsatisfactory serials of rabies vaccines, and (4)
assurance of the identification of animals receiving vaccines determined not to meet requirements for stability
or potency.
Currently, it is reported that 98.4 percent of the 25,000,000 doses of animal rabies vaccine that are distributed
in the United States each year are sold directly to veterinarians. It is not known, however, how many of these doses
are redistributed through catalogs and over the counter for administration by 
nonveterinarians.
An estimated 9,000 human beings are treated annually in the United States for potential exposure to rabid dogs and
cats. Post-exposure human rabies prophylaxis costs an estimated $1,000 per patient. In 1989, the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention recommended that the most effective methods for reducing human exposure to rabies are education
of the public to avoid unfamiliar, especially wild animals, and vaccination of pet dogs and cats.



Request for Comments


Since receiving the request from the NASPHV to amend the Federal restrictions on animal rabies vaccines, APHIS has
attempted to identify specific issues (enumerated below) that need to be addressed before the Agency can proceed
with a notice of proposed rulemaking. Some of these issues raise questions and identify competing interests that
are difficult to resolve. For example, a Federal restriction that animal rabies vaccines only be distributed to veterinarians
and administered by or under the direct supervision of a licensed veterinarian could have the benefit of ensuring
proper administration and could also enable public health officials to certify that a rabies vaccine was properly
administered. An unintended effect of such a restriction, however, could be a reduction in the number of animals vaccinated
with a corresponding reduction in the effectiveness of rabies prevention by making it more expensive or impractical
to vaccinate multiple animals in single households, animals in kennels, farm animals, or animals in metropolitan
animal shelters_animals which are often vaccinated by nonveterinarians. With regard to the issue of proper vaccine
administration, a 1989 study showed that only 5% of rabid cats and 14% of rabid dogs reported that year had been vaccinated
against rabies, suggesting that rabies incidence in dogs and cats is related more to the failure to vaccinate than
the failure of vaccination. After considering the various factors involved in rabies control, APHIS believes that
any amended Federal restriction that the Agency may promulgate should encourage the vaccination of pets while providing
the greatest benefit/cost value. Towards this end, the Agency seeks input on alternative approaches to the control
of animal rabies vaccines. The experience of States that have enacted their own State restrictions is sought on these
issues.
Public comment is requested to assist APHIS in its evaluation of the benefits and costs of a Federal restriction providing
that animal rabies vaccines be distributed and used only by or under the direct supervision of a licensed veterinarian.
In order to obtain a better understanding of the benefits versus the costs of such a Federal restriction, specific
comments, projections, or data are requested on the following issues:
1. The rate of vaccine misuse and failure when vaccine is administered by nonveterinarians versus veterinarians;

<DOCNO> FR941006-1-00008 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941006-1-00002 </PARENT>

2. the projected cost versus benefits (e.g. decreased incidence of animal rabies, better recordkeeping, or fewer
human rabies prophylaxes being sought) of a regulatory requirement that animal rabies vaccines be distributed and
used only by or under the direct supervision of a licensed veterinarian, based on the experience of States that have
passed such legislation;
3. the number of persons seeking post-exposure rabies prophylaxis in situations in which a current animal vaccination
could not be confirmed by a veterinarian;
4. information indicating that 98.4 percent of the 25,000,000 doses of animal rabies vaccines that are distributed
in the United States each year are sold directly to licensed veterinarians only;
5. the number of doses, if any, of animal rabies vaccine that are distributed or sold to nonveterinarians for administration
by nonveterinarians that are not under the supervision of a veterinarian;
6. the impact of a Federal restriction concerning the distribution and use of animal rabies vaccines by or under the
direct supervision of a licensed veterinarian on metropolitan animal shelters and other organizations that currently
vaccinate their own animals;
7. the availability of low-cost rabies clinics nationwide and particularly in rural areas to accommodate those individuals
who currently vaccinate their own animals because of cost;
8. the effect, if any, of such a Federal rabies restriction on animal rabies vaccines on the number of animals that are
vaccinated based on the experience of States that have passed such restrictions; and
9. the impact, if any, on the number of companion animals versus farm animals that are vaccinated, of such a Federal
restriction on animal rabies vaccines; and
10. less restrictive, alternative approaches to animal rabies control such as a Federal requirement that distribution
of animal rabies vaccines be restricted to licensed veterinarians only; or that distribution and use of animal rabies
vaccines be by or under the direction of a licensed veterinarian only, or other options.
Factual data supported by verifiable sources (published reports in peer-reviewed journals, university-sponsored
studies, objective scientific data, etc.) will be given greater weight by the Agency than anecdotal information
in arriving at its decision whether or not to proceed with a proposed rulemaking. Any projections provided to APHIS
should indicate data sources and the assumptions made in reaching whatever conclusions obtained. 
For those questions for which data are not available, APHIS also requests comments on the most cost-effective means
to obtain such data.

Communications should identify the airspace docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address listed above.
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments on this notice must submit with those comments
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Airspace Docket No. 94-ACE-16.''
The postcard will be date/time stamped and returned to the commenter. All communications received on or before the
specified closing date for comments will be considered before taking action on the proposed rule. The proposal contained
in this notice may be changed in light of comments received. All comments submitted will be available for examination
in the Office of General Council, at 601 East 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri, after the closing date for comments.
A report summarizing each substantive public contact with FAA personnel concerned with this rulemaking will be filed
in the docket.


Availability of NPRM's


Any person may obtain a copy of this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) by submitting a request to the Federal Aviation
Administration, System Management Branch, Air Traffic Division, 601 East 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri, 64106.
Communications must identify the number of this NPRM. Persons interested in being placed on a mailing list for future
NPRM's should also request a copy of Advisory Circular No. 11-2A, which describe the application procedure.


The Proposal


The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class
E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface at Monticello, MO. A SIAP based on the Quincy VORTAC has
been established. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate Class E airspace for IFR operators executing
the VOR/DME SIAP at Lewis County Regional Airport. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American
Datum 83. Class E airspace areas extend upward from 700 feet or more above the surface of the earth are published in Paragraph
6005 of FAA Order 7400.9B, dated July 18, 1994 and effective September 16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference
in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document would be published
subsequently in the Order.
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.


List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 71


Airspace, Incorporation by reference, Navigation (air).


The Proposed Amendment


In consideration of the foregoing, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend 14 CFR part 71 as follows:

Customer Limit Orders 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Securities and Exchange Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Securities and Exchange Commission proposes a rule setting standards for market makers in handling customer
limit orders in NASDAQ National Market System securities. The rule would prohibit a market maker from trading for
its own account, directly, or indirectly, at a price at which the market maker could execute a customer limit order
it is holding, without executing the customer's limit order at the limit price or a price more favorable to the customer
under the specific terms and conditions by which the order is accepted by the market maker.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Introduction and Background 



The Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') today is proposing a rule (17 CFR 240.15c5-1)
to prohibit market makers in NASDAQ National Market System (``NASDAQ/NMS'') securities from trading ahead of customer
orders that they are holding at the same or better price. The Commission is proposing to change existing practices
because it believes this will enhance broker-dealer competition, promote efficient pricing of securities, facilitate
best execution of customer orders and better reflect investor expectations in the NASDAQ/NMS market. The growth
of the NASDAQ market and the concomitant visibility of and investor interest in its companies has changed investors'
expectations. 

In designing the proposed rule, the Commission has been mindful of the special role of NASDAQ market makers in discovering
prices and providing liquidity in NASDAQ/NMS stocks. The proposal seeks comment on specific trading standards that
would govern individual market makers. The proposed rule is intended to have the effect of giving priority to orders
that improve the market (

i.e.

, narrow the bid-ask spread) being made by a specific market maker. 

Generally, an order to buy or sell a security at a specified price (``limit order'') is first received by the customer's
broker, who either routes the order to an affiliated or non-affiliated market maker for execution or, if the firm is
itself a market maker in the security, to the firm's market making desk. The combination of limit order execution and
market maker functions can lead to the market maker competing with a customer for executions. While the past few years
have seen several positive efforts at improving limit order handling practices in the NASDAQ market, the Commission
believes that it should consider a limit order priority rule to ensure protection for all customer orders in this market.


The priority accorded a customer limit order today is different depending on the structure of the marketplace of execution.
The rules of national securities exchanges generally require specialists and other market professionals to yield
to a customer's limit order; the specialist cannot trade for its own account at prices equal to or better than the limit
order until the limit order is executed.

1

 The rules of the National Association of Securities Dealers (``NASD'') similarly prohibit third market makers (over-the-counter
market makers in listed securities) from trading ahead of customer limit orders in the third market.

In 1988, the Commission addressed the issue of customer limit order protection in the NASDAQ market.

3

 In the Manning decision, the Commission affirmed, based on principles of agency law, an NASD determination that it
is inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade for a market maker to trade ahead of a customer limit order
unless the customer is first informed of the firm's limit order policy. As a result of the Manning decision, the NASD
filed a proposed rule change with the Commission stating that a member firm will not be deemed to have violated NASD
Rules of Fair Practice if it provides customers with a statement setting forth the circumstances in which the member
firm accepts limit orders and the policies and procedures that the firm follows in handling these orders.

4

 





In July, 1993, the NASD Board of Governors reviewed the handling of limit orders in NASDAQ securities and concluded
that ``the continuation of the disclosure exception appeared inappropriate.''

5

 The NASD solicited member comment on eliminating the disclosure ``safe-harbor'' approach for members trading ahead
of customer limit orders and the effect a rule prohibiting trading ahead might have on integrated broker-dealers,
on limit orders received from other firms, and on market liquidity.

6

 





After full consideration of the concerns articulated in the comment process, the NASD withdrew its rule filing proposing
the disclosure safe harbor approach,

7

 and submitted a proposed Interpretation to its Rules of Fair Practice, prohibiting member firms from trading ahead
of their customers' limit orders in their market making capacity.

8

 The Division of Market Regulation's Market 2000 study examined this practice and recommended that a ban apply to trading
ahead of all customer limit orders, not just those of a firm's own customer.

9

 The study noted that the adverse effects of trading ahead exist whether the customer's order is handled by the customer's
firm or by another market maker.

10

 







The Commission approved the NASD Interpretation on June 29, 1994, but expressed concern that the prohibition did
not extend to trading ahead of limit orders of other firms' customers that have been sent to the market maker for execution.
 The NASD also convened a special task force to study the potential effect of expanded limit order protection on market
liquidity and market maker capital commitment and to report back to the Board in September. The Commission stated
that while such a study could be helpful to a future consideration of this issue, the Commission believed that member-to-member
trades raise significant concerns that should be addressed and, if necessary, the Commission would consider instituting
its own rulemaking proceeding for that purpose.

The task force has now submitted its report to the NASD Board of Directors and the Board has proposed for member comment
market maker standards that would restrict market makers from trading ahead of certain member-to-member trades,
keyed in part on the size of the customer limit order.

13

 Under the NASD proposal, market makers would be prohibited from trading at prices equal to or better than the price
of a customer limit order they hold if the size of that order was 1,000 shares or less and from trading at prices better
than a customer's limit order if the size of that order was greater than 1,000 shares. 





The Commission believes that the NASD's proposal is an instructive step and will provide useful comment from the member
firm community. The Commission, however, believes that comment from the broader constituency of the investing public
and other non-NASD members will be critical in formulating adequate limit order protection for the NASDAQ market.
In addition, the Commission believes that alternatives which provide more extensive limit order protection for
public customers also should be the subject of public comment. Therefore, the Commission has determined to propose
its own rule. Publication of the proposal will complement the efforts of the NASD and enable the Commission to act on
its own initiative if it deems such action appropriate. 



II. Discussion 



The Commission proposes to adopt Rule 15c5-1 pursuant to Section 15(c)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (``Exchange Act''),

14

 among other provisions.

15

 Section 15(c)(5) grants the Commission authority over dealers acting in the capacity of market makers by permitting
the Commission to impose standards with respect to dealing as the Commission, by rule, shall prescribe as necessary
or appropriate in the public interest and for the protection of investors, to maintain fair and orderly markets, or
to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a national market system.

16

 







The legislative history of the Securities Acts Amendments of 1975, under which Section 15(c)(5) was adopted, endorsed
priority for customer limit orders in national market system securities and stated that the Commission should have
discretion to achieve this protection. Congress noted that for suitable securities, every effort should be made
to ensure that public investors in these securities would receive the benefits and protections that would result
from the placing of public orders ahead of dealers' orders in determining the sequence in which orders entering the
market are executed.

NASDAQ has evolved from a market of thinly traded companies in 1975 to one that today accounts for 42% of share volume
and 29.2% of dollar volume in the U.S. equity markets.

18

 During that time, the Commission, together with the NASD, has attempted to implement rules that reflect increased
investor interest in this market. The events which gave rise to the Manning case date back to 1984 and the Commission
has been pressing for improved limit order priority since then. 





In its order approving the recent NASD Interpretation, the Commission indicated that a further Commission rule might
be necessary to ensure protection for all public limit orders in NASDAQ/NMS securities, should the NASD fail to do
so. The NASD's Interpretation prevents a market maker from trading ahead of its own customers' limit orders, but does
not prevent the same market maker from trading ahead of the limit orders of other firms' customers that are sent to the
market maker for execution.

19

 The Commission believes that it is reasonable for customers to expect that the quality of the execution received will
not vary from trade to trade. Under current NASD rules, the quality of the execution received could vary depending
on whether the customer's firm or an affiliate makes a market in a security or whether that firm sends the order to another
market maker for execution. Customers choose their brokers for a variety of reasons, including cost and integrity;
whether the broker also makes a market in a security in which the customer may be interested should not affect the quality
of the execution. 





The Commission agrees with the conclusion of the Division of Market Regulation's Market 2000 Study that the adverse
effects of trading ahead exist whether the customer's order is handled by the customer's firm or by another market
maker.

20

 Rule 15c5-1 would apply to customer limit orders, regardless of where the order is ultimately routed for execution.






The Commission believes that the principles of investor protection and market integrity would be advanced by a limit
order priority rule. The lack of limit order protection results in inferior executions for customers and adversely
affects the price discovery process for these securities.

21

 





By providing a customer's limit order priority over the market maker's proprietary trading, more trade volume will
be available to be matched with the customer's order, resulting in quicker and more frequent executions for limit
order customers. In the past, customers may have refrained from placing limit orders because of the uncertainty of
and difficulty in obtaining an execution at a price between the spread. A customer limit order rule will encourage
dealers that accept customer limit orders to execute them in a timely fashion so that they may resume their proprietary
trading activities. With the improvement in the quality of these executions, investors will have greater confidence
in this market and trade volume from retail investors could increase.

22

 





In addition, customer limit order priority would improve the price discovery process in NASDAQ/NMS securities.
Limit orders aid price discovery by adding liquidity to the market and by tightening the effective spread between
the bid and ask price of a security, even though these limit orders would not be displayed in the market maker's quote.
The practice of not executing a limit order until the inside quotation price reaches the customer's limit order price
also impedes the price discovery process by preventing those orders from interacting with other orders. More expeditious
handling of customer limit orders under the proposed rule could provide investors with a more accurate indication
of the buy and sell interest at a given moment.

23

 





One of the problems with not giving customer limit orders priority is the cost to public customers in terms of inferior
or missed executions for limit orders. It is currently impossible for customers to monitor these costs. The ability
of a customer to monitor the cost of the transaction and choose a broker-dealer on that basis imposes a competitive
discipline on the market maker to achieve the best possible execution for the customer or risk losing the business.
Unlike institutional clients who are in a better position to negotiate their own protection with market makers, public
customers have less viable alternatives in determining where their orders are ultimately sent for execution. Under
these circumstances, market makers lack the same incentive to provide superior executions to public customers.


Market makers who oppose a comprehensive rule mandating limit order priority for customers do so in part on the ground
that such a rule would reduce their return from market making.

24

 Market makers are, of course, entitled to earn a profit from their service; A limit order rule could force market makers
to recoup the cost of the transaction in ways more apparent to the customer, such as by charging a commission for handling
the limit order. The Commission requests comment in the form of specific data regarding the potential consequences
of the proposed rule for market liquidity and market maker capital commitment. 





III. Description of the Proposed Rule 



Limit order protection in the NASDAQ market is now required only of firms that execute their own customers' limit orders.
Market makers still may trade ahead of the limit orders entered by customers of other firms that are sent to them for
execution. Proposed Rule 15c5-1 would provide limit order protection to all customers in NASDAQ/NMS securities,
regardless of where the order is ultimately sent for execution.

A. General Prohibition on Trading Ahead 


Paragraph (a) of the proposed rule establishes the general prohibition on trading ahead of limit orders: a market
maker shall not effect a transaction involving a covered security for its own account, directly or indirectly, at
a price at which the market maker could execute a customer limit order it is holding without executing the customer
limit order at the limit price or a price more favorable to the customer, under the specific terms and conditions by
which the order was accepted by the market maker. 

The rule applies once a market maker has accepted a customer limit order for execution.

25

 The rule applies to all market makers, whether they are handling orders for their firm's clients or orders sent from
another firm. Finally, the rule applies to all accounts of the market maker in which the market maker or any person associated
with the market maker is directly or indirectly interested. 





The application of the rule can best be illustrated through the following example. Firm 

A

 is a retail brokerage firm. Firm 

B

 is a market making firm with no customers of its own. Firm 

C

 is an integrated firm with both brokerage and market making units. The present NASD Interpretation applies only to
orders received and executed internally by firm 

C.

26

 The proposed rule would cover these orders as well as orders sent from firm 

A

 to firm 

B

 or 

C

, and orders sent from firm 

C

 to firm 

B

. 





For instance, firm 

A

 may send firm 

B

 a customer limit order to buy 1,000 shares of stock at $201/4. Firm 

B,

 a market maker in that security, is quoting a bid of $20 and an offer of $201/2. Under the proposed rule, a purchase of
a certain number of shares by firm 

B

 at $201/4 or lower would trigger an obligation to fill the same number of shares in the customer's order at $201/4. A
failure to execute the customer's limit order either before or immediately after the market maker's purchase would
constitute a violation of the rule. The Commission is requesting comment on whether it should exclude from the protection
of the rule limit orders to buy at the bid or limit orders to sell at the offer. 



B. ``Covered Security'' 



The rule would apply to NASDAQ securities that have been designated National Market System securities. A NASDAQ security
is a registered equity security for which quotation information is disseminated in the National Association of Securities
Dealers Automated Quotation system. A NASDAQ National Market System security is a NASDAQ security as defined above
for which transaction reports are required to be made on a real-time basis pursuant to an effective transaction reporting
plan.

27

 The Commission requests comments on the feasibility of extending the limit order protection measures incorporated
herein to other NASDAQ securities, such as NASDAQ SmallCap securities and over-the-counter (``OTC'') Bulletin
Board-eligible securities.

28

 






C. Definition of ``Customer Limit Order'' 



Paragraph (c)(3) of the proposed rule defines the term ``limit order'' as an order to buy or sell shares of a security
at a specified price or other price more favorable to the customer. In the example above, the customer placed a limit
order to buy 1,000 shares of stock at $201/4, indicating that the customer wishes to pay no more than $20.25 for the security.
The market maker may fill the order at a lower price, but not at a price higher than the limit the customer has set. 

The Commission proposes to limit the class of persons who would be protected by the rule to public customers only. To
this end, the term ``customer'' in paragraph (c)(3) is defined as a person who is not a registered broker or dealer.
Nevertheless, because customer limit orders often are sent to a market maker by a broker or another market maker that
originally received the order, the definition of ``customer'' would encompass such orders as customer orders entitled
to protection under the rule. Orders for registered brokers or dealers that are sent to a market maker by another broker
or market maker would not be entitled to this protection. The Commission requests comment on the necessity of restricting
limit order protection to customers and the effectiveness of the definition in carrying out that purpose.

D. ``Terms and Conditions'' 


While the proposed rule does not distinguish institutional from retail orders, the Commission believes that larger-sized
orders may qualify for special treatment. The language of the proposed rule that would allow the parties to set the
specific terms and conditions for acceptance of limit orders is intended to permit market makers to employ the appropriate
strategy in filling a larger sized order without being subjected to the requirements of the proposed ban. 
By distinguishing the protection afforded a limit order by its size or dollar value, the rule would recognize the greater
significance of larger size orders to market makers seeking to establish or liquidate a position and the ability of
larger sized customers to negotiate specific order handling procedures. Market makers actively compete for customer
order flow. A customer dealing in greater size or amount generally can better monitor the market for the security and
negotiate alternative execution procedures with another market maker.





The Commission preliminarily believes that larger sized orders should be distinguished by measurable characteristics
such as number of shares or dollar amount. To this end, comment is requested on the appropriate level of a size limit,


i.e. 

5,000 or 10,000 shares, and/or a dollar value limit, 

i.e. 

$50,000, $100,000 or $200,000, that would determine market maker obligations with respect to these two types of orders
in the final rule. This will insure that the rule ultimately adopted includes limit order protection for retail investors
while maintaining the ability of market makers to negotiate order handling arrangements with their institutional
clients. 



E. Exceptions 


The rule proposal also establishes exceptions for all-or-none and odd-lot orders as well as a general exemptive provision
[paragraph (d)]. The specific exceptions to the rule [paragraph (b)] are discussed below. The Commission requests
comment on the need for an all-or-none or odd-lot order exception and a general exemptive provision. 


Exception for All-or-None Orders 


The proposed rule includes an exception for all-or-none customer limit orders [paragraph (b)(2)]. An all-or-none
customer limit order is defined in paragraph (c)(1) as one that carries a condition that instructs the market maker
to execute all of the shares in the order only if it can be done all at once. The purpose of this exception is to prevent
delays in executing other orders that a market maker may be receiving at the time the market maker is handling the all-or-none
order. In the example above, the customer's limit order for 1,000 shares of stock could be filled in several separate
transactions. With an all-or-none order, a market maker must execute all the shares of the order in a single trade.
The market maker may not have immediate access to that number of shares. In the meantime, other orders may be received
that require the market maker to purchase shares from other market makers or their customers. Without this exception,
the market maker would not be able to buy any stock at less than the all-or-none limit order price and, ultimately, the
execution quality of other customer orders would suffer. Thus, using the above example, the exception would permit
a market maker handling an all-or-none order to purchase shares in the security for its own account at $20 1/4 or lower
without filling the customer's limit order, but only for amounts smaller than the 1,000 shares in the all-or-none
order. The market maker could not, however, purchase 1,000 shares or more at $20 1/4 or lower for its own account without
satisfying the customer limit order.

IV. Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 


The Commission has prepared an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (``IRFA'') in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 603
regarding proposed Rule 15c5-1. The IRFA uses certain definitions of small entities adopted by the Commission
for purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The IRFA indicates that regulatory action is required in order to
ensure that market makers in NASDAQ/NMS securities adhere to certain minimum standards of fair treatment of customers.
Specifically, by prohibiting a market maker from trading ahead of a customer limit order that it holds, the rule would
improve the quality of executions for customers and the price discovery process in the market for these securities.

In 1993, there were 492 active NASDAQ market makers.
 Data on the number of market makers meeting the definition of small entity that make markets in NASDAQ/NMS securities
and execute customer limit orders is unavailable. The Commission is unable to quantify reasonably the impact that
the proposed rule would have on small market makers or small issuers. The Commission does not believe it would be practicable
to exempt small market makers from the proposed rule because to do so would be inconsistent with the Commission's statutory
mandate to protect investors. 




A copy of the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis may be obtained by contacting Scott C. Kursman, Attorney, Office
of Market Supervision, Division of Market Regulation, Securities and Exchange Commission, Washington, D.C. 20549
(202) 942-3197. 


V. Effects on Competition 


Section 23(a)(2) of the Exchange Act
 requires the Commission, in adopting rules under the Act, to consider any anti-competitive effects of such rules
and to balance these effects against the regulatory benefits gained in furthering the purposes of the Act. As previously
noted, comment letters received prior to the adoption of the NASD Interpretation suggested that such a rule would
deny market makers an opportunity to earn a profit in some situations. If true, this may result in less market maker
commitment in the NASDAQ/NMS market which may in turn effect competition in this market. The Commission is soliciting
comment on the effect the rule may have on market maker capital commitment and small issuers. 




The Commission preliminarily views Rule 15c5-1 as causing no burden on competition unnecessary or inappropriate
in furtherance of the purposes of the Exchange Act. The Commission believes that the principles of customer protection
that Congress envisioned and that would be advanced by this rule justify the burdens that the rule will impose on market
makers. The Commission, however, requests comment on any competitive burdens that might result from adoption of
the proposed rule described in this release.

shall mean an order to buy or sell a security at a specified price or a price more favorable to the customer, that is not
for the account of either a broker or dealer; provided, however, that the term 

customer limit order 

shall include an order transmitted by a broker or dealer on behalf of a customer. 
(4) The term 

market maker 

shall have the meaning provided in Section 3(a)(38) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(38)). 
(d)

Electronic Transmission of Required Family Data 
for Public Housing, Indian Housing, and the Section 8 
Rental Certificate, Rental Voucher, and Moderate 
Rehabilitation Programs 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, HUD.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This proposed rule requires all housing agencies (HAs) to submit certain data electronically to HUD in a HUD prescribed
format. For HAs that are not already automated or who determine that automation is not cost-effective, transmission
of the data through the use of a service bureau is permitted. Electronic transmission is necessary because the manual
submission of HUD forms has become a burden to HAs and HUD. 
This proposed rule applies to projects administered under the public housing, Indian housing, and Section 8 Rental
Certificate, Rental Voucher, and Moderate Rehabilitation programs. A similar rule, 24 CFR part 208, was issued with
respect to multifamily subsidized projects administered under programs subject to the oversight of the Assistant
Secretary for Housing-Federal Housing Commissioner.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Paperwork Burden 


The information collection requirements contained in this proposed rule have been submitted to the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) for review under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520). The submission
amends the current requirements approved by OMB on January 26, 1994 (Number: 2577-0083). 
The public reporting burden for the collection of information requirements contained in this proposed rule is estimated
to include the time for reviewing the instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining
the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Information on the estimated public
reporting burden is provided under the Preamble heading, 

Other Matters.

 Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions
for reducing this burden, to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Rules Docket Clerk, 451 Seventh Street,
SW, Room 10276, Washington, DC 20410-0500; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office
of Management and Budget, Attention: Desk Officer for HUD, Washington, DC 20503. 


II. Background


A. Impetus for Change 


Housing agencies have been submitting to HUD data forms for each family assisted under the public housing, Indian
housing, and Section 8 Rental Certificate, Rental Voucher and Moderate Rehabilitation Programs. The Forms HUD-50058,
Family Report, and HUD-50058-FSS, Family Self-Sufficiency Addendum, concern family characteristics,
rent, income, subsidy payments and participation in the Family Self-Sufficiency Program.

<TEXT>
 

As of March 1, 1994, these forms were being processed by the Department's central processing facility. Approximately
85 percent of reporting agencies (3,655 HAs) are submitting paper forms. This extensive processing of paper forms
has become a burden to the HAs as well as to HUD. 
To reduce the cost to the Department of processing this information and to improve its accuracy, the Department is
issuing this proposed rule to require that the information be submitted electronically. The change is expected to
contribute significant savings to the Department, in a time when budget contraints demand such savings. 
Housing agencies that report on paper have the time consuming task of completing the calculations which are prone
to error. The Department edits the information on the forms. When errors are found, HAs are notified (by letter) and
requested to make appropriate corrections. 
The time spent by HAs in initiating electronic transmission and making corrections to the electronic data submissions
will be offset by future savings in the reexamination and reporting process, as well as increased accuracy and speed
associated with the admission, reexamination and reporting processes, and the reduced number of HUD adjustments
and paperwork required by these adjustments. This change to electronic submission of family data will also encourage
HAs to automate other functions or to automate this particular function as they automate others, in the course of revising
their own management practices. 
The rule will require HAs to submit data electronically via telephone modem, rather than through tape, diskette,
or paper. However, the rule also provides that the Department may approve transmission of the data by tape or diskette
where the Department determines that the cost of telephonic transmission would be excessive. (It is contemplated
that this would only occur in a few instances, involving very large HAs.) 


B. Voluntary Automation 


Several years ago, the Department began to develop a computer system to collect all rental assistance data and ensure
the accuracy of subsidy payments. This system serves as the basis for the Department's electronic data transmission
requirements in lieu of hard copy. 
In July 1993, the Department distributed a Form HUD-50058 Information Packet, which gave instructions for
submitting the data electronically. The Department encouraged program participants to begin transmitting data
electronically to HUD (via tape, diskette, or telephonic network). Approximately 600 housing agencies have responded
by submitting the data electronically. Recently, the Department initiated a pilot test with 20 HAs using the telephonic
network mode (via SprintMail_a commercial software package) to evaluate HA capability for data transmission. In
addition, a test program (for use by all HAs) has been initiated to assure that errors are not introduced by the sender's
software. Both processes will facilitate implementation of this rule. 
These electronic transmissions consist of information requested on the forms, organized into various categories
and transmitted in an ASCII fixed format (not field delimited). These fixed format ASCII files will deliver the data
with the field lengths as specified by HUD in the July 1993 guide. (This guide may be obtained from the office listed
above for program information.) 
The Department encourages HAs to begin electronic transmission as soon as the capability exists. An earlier electronic
transmission will allow timely correction of errors found during the data load into the automated software. These
corrections will then reduce the number of errors formerly found when manual information entered the Department's
system. Early electronic transmission will also help minimize an initial surge of data in the system from the number
of currently nonautomated HAs. 


C. Action Required 


Nonautomated HAs (i.e. those who currently prepare the Forms HUD-50058 and HUD-50058-FSS manually)
should immediately begin to obtain information on the cost of purchasing hardware or software, or both, to determine
whether it is financially feasible to purchase these items or whether they should contract out the electronic transmission
of data to another entity. These HAs must: (1) Complete the search and either purchase the necessary hardware and software,
or sign service contracts, (2) complete their data loading, and (3) begin electronic transmission by one year after
the publication of the final rule.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941006-1-00022 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941006-1-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

While the Department would prefer each HA to obtain its own hardware and software, HAs may elect to contract out the
electronic transmission function. However, when HAs contract out the electronic transmission function, they are
still required to continue to retain the ability to monitor the day-to-day operations of the projects and be able to
demonstrate that ability to their local HUD Office. 
In recognition of the difficulty some HAs may have in conversion to electronic submission of data, the rule will permit
HUD Field Offices to grant extensions of time beyond the stated implementation date for commencement of electronic
submission under certain circumstances. 


D. Cost 


Housing agencies may be concerned about funding the initial cost of automation. For public and Indian housing, the
costs of the electronic transmission of the correctly formatted data, including either the purchase and maintenance
of computer hardware or software, or both; the cost of contracting for those services; or the cost of centralizing
the electronic transmission function; are eligible operating expenses and can be included in the operating budget.
However, they are not eligible for additional operating subsidy funding. Automating this management function also
is an allowable expense under the Comprehensive Improvement Assistance Program and the Comprehensive Grant Program.
For Section 8 programs, the costs may be paid from ongoing administrative fees or the Section 8 operating reserve.
Ultimately, the cost of automating this function will be recovered in reduced administrative costs. 
The Department anticipates that the large number of vendors competing in the marketplace will cause the cost of automation
and electronic transmission to be reasonable, and a large number of HAs will therefore be able to purchase and maintain
their own equipment. However, the decision to purchase and maintain the necessary equipment and services or to contract
for the automation and electronic transmission function, will only be made by each housing agency. 


III. Parts Amended 


This proposed rule would add a new part 908 to specify the electronic submission requirements. The requirements for
obtaining and verifying family income information in the various programs are found in  813.109 for the Section
8 Rental Certificate, Rental Voucher and Moderate Rehabilitation programs, in  905.315 for the Indian housing
program, and in  913.109 for the public housing program. This rule would add a new paragraph to each of these sections
to cross reference the requirements of the new part 908. 


IV. Other Matters 


A. Environmental Impact 


In accordance with 40 CFR 1508.4 of the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality and 24 CFR 50.20(o) of the
HUD regulations, the policies and procedures contained in this proposed rule relate only to HUD administrative procedures
and, therefore, are categorically excluded from the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act. 


B. Federalism Impact 


The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that the policies contained in this proposed rule will not have substantial direct effects on states or their political
subdivisions, or the relationship between the Federal government and the states, or on the distribution of power
and 
responsibilities among the various levels of government. Specifically, this proposed rule is directed to housing
agencies that operate HUD-assisted housing, whose functions and authority remain unchanged. It merely changes
the format of data submitted to HUD to make its transmission more accurate and efficient. It will not impinge upon the
relationship between the Federal Government and State and local governments. As a result, the proposed rule is not
subject to review under the order.

C. Impact on the Family 


The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, 

The Family,

 has determined that this proposed rule does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance,
and general well-being, and, thus, is not subject to review under the order. No significant change in existing HUD
policies or programs will result from promulgation of this proposed rule, as those policies and programs relate to
family concerns. 


D. Regulatory Flexibility Act 


The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)) has reviewed and approved this
proposed rule, and in so doing certifies that this proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Because this proposed rule changes the way in which the data is transmitted to HUD, and all
costs associated with implementation of the electronic transmission will be considered allowable project operating
costs, the proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact. 


E. Regulatory Agenda 


This proposed rule was not listed in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on April 25, 1994
(59 FR 20424) under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act, and therefore was submitted to the Committee
on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of the House
of Representatives under section 7(o) of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act. 


F. Catalog 


The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance numbers for the programs covered by this proposed rules are 14.850, 14.855,
14.856, and 14.857.

 908.101 


Purpose. 


The purpose of this part is to require Housing Agencies (HAs) that operate public housing, Indian housing, or Section
8 Rental Certificate, Rental Voucher and Moderate Rehabilitation programs to electronically submit certain data
to HUD for those programs. This electronically submitted data is required for HUD Forms HUD-50058, Family Report,
and HUD-50058-FSS, Family Self-Sufficiency Addendum. 



 908.104 


Requirements. 


(a) 

Automated HAs. 

Housing agencies that currently use automated software packages to transmit Forms HUD-50058 and HUD-50058-FSS
information by tape or diskette to the Department's data processing contractor must convert to telephonic electronic
transmission of that data in a HUD specified format by 

[insert date 120 days after publication of the final rule]

. 
(b) 

Nonautomated HAs. 

Housing agencies that currently prepare and transmit the HUD-50058 and HUD-50058-FSS information
to HUD paper must: 
(1) Complete a vendor search and obtain either: 
(i) The necessary hardware and software required to develop and maintain an in-house automated data processing system
(ADP) used to generate electronic submission of the data for these forms via telephonic network; or 
(ii) A service contract for the operation of an automated system to generate electronic submission of the data for
these forms via telephonic network; 
(2) Complete their data loading; and 
(3) Begin electronic transmission by 

[insert date 365 days after publication of the final rule]

. 
(c) 

Electronic transmission of data. 

Electronic transmission of data consists of submission of all required data fields (correctly formatted) from the
forms HUD-050058 and HUD-50058-FSS telephonically, in accordance with HUD instructions. Regardless
of whether an HA obtains the ADP system itself or contracts with a service bureau to provide the system, the software
must be periodically updated to incorporate changes or revisions in legislation, regulations, handbooks, notices,
or HUD electronic transmission data format requirements. 
(d) 

Service contract. 

HAs that determine that the purchase of hardware and/or software is not cost effective may contract out the electronic
data transmission function to organizations that provide such services, including, but not limited to the following
organizations: local management associations and management agents with centralized facilities. HAs that contract
out the electronic transmission function must retain the ability to monitor the day-to-day operations of the project
at the HA site and be able to demonstrate the ability to the relevant HUD Field Office. 
(e) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the Department may approve transmission
of the data by tape or diskette if it determines that the cost of telephonic transmission would be excessive. 


 908.108 


Cost. 


(a) 

General. 

The costs of the electronic transmission of the correctly formatted data, including either the purchase and maintenance
of computer hardware or software, or both, the cost of contracting for those services, or the cost of centralizing
the electronic transmission function, shall be considered Section 8 Administrative expenses, or eligible public
housing operating expenses that can be included in the public housing operating budget. At the HA's option, the cost
of the computer software may include service contracts to provide maintenance or training, or both. 
(b) 

Sources of funding. 

For public and Indian housing, costs may be covered from operating subsidy for which the HA is already eligible, or
the initial cost may be covered by funds received by the HA under HUD's Comprehensive Improvement Assistance Program
(CIAP) or Comprehensive Grant Program (CGP). For Section 8 programs, the costs may be covered from ongoing administrative
fees or the Section 8 operating reserve.

United States Treasury Certificates of Indebtedness, Treasury Notes, and Treasury Bonds_State and Local Government
Series 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Bureau of the Public Debt, Fiscal Service, Department of the Treasury.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of the Treasury hereby publishes, for comment, a proposed rule governing United States Treasury Certificates
of Indebtedness, Notes, and Bonds of the State and Local Government Series. These securities are available for purchase,
as provided in this offering, by State and local governments and certain other entities with proceeds (or amounts
treated as proceeds) which are subject to yield restrictions or arbitrage rebate requirements under the Internal
Revenue Code. The securities are characterized in the regulations as time deposit, demand deposit, and special zero
interest. 



This proposed rulemaking sets out the regulatory requirements which stem from the Department of the Treasury's new
processing environment for United States Treasury Certificates of Indebtedness, Notes, and Bonds of the State and
Local Government Series (SLGS). 

The Bureau of the Public Debt is implementing operational and regulatory changes expected to benefit investors by
providing streamlined procedures, a centralized processing facility, and improved customer services.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Background 


The proposed rule is a revision of existing regulations codified at 31 CFR part 344, published on July 7, 1989, at 54
FR 28752, with technical corrections published July 7, 1993, at 58 FR 31908. 
In 1992, the Bureau of the Public Debt established the Division of Special Investments at its offices in Parkersburg,
West Virginia (WV). The primary mission of the Division of Special Investments has been to provide policy guidance
and direction for the State and Local Government Series securities program. The Division has reviewed the current
processing environment and is implementing operational and regulatory changes which are expected to benefit investors
in United States Treasury securities of the State and Local Government Series by providing streamlined procedures,
a centralized processing facility, and improved customer services.

In the current processing environment for State and Local Government Series securities, the Bureau of the Public
Debt has authorized selected Federal Reserve Banks or Branches, acting as fiscal agents of the United States, to provide
services in connection with the purchase of, transactions involving, and redemption of, the securities. Subscriptions
for the purchase of State and Local Government Series securities are accepted at designated Federal Reserve Banks
or Branches, subject to verification by the Bureau of the Public Debt. Full payment for each subscription must be available
in an account for debit by the Federal Reserve Bank or Branch on or before the date of issue. 

The current processing environment requires that staffing and technical expertise be maintained at 12 designated
Federal Reserve Banks or Branches to provide unique services in connection with State and Local Government Series
securities. The Bureau of the Public Debt, Office of Securities and Accounting Services, Division of Special Investments
(hereafter referred to as the Division of Special Investments) has determined that the volume of transactions in
this securities program does not merit the expense of maintaining technical expertise at 12 different locations.


The Bureau of the Public Debt has decided to centralize all issuance, funds collection, and accounting functions
for the State and Local Government Series securities program in the Division of Special Investments. The responsibility
for these functions will be withdrawn from the designated Federal Reserve Banks beginning on a specific issue date
which will be announced in the final rule. It is anticipated that this date will be January 3, 1995. 

After centralization, Federal Reserve Bank or Branch involvement in this program will be limited to processing interest
and redemption payments made through reserve account credits for a very small number of existing securities accounts.
This method of payment is limited to securities for which subscriptions were submitted prior to February 1, 1987.
More than 98% of all interest and redemption payments for State and Local Government Series securities are made by
the Automated Clearing House method (ACH), with credit directed to the owner's account at a financial institution.


Beginning on the effective date of the final rule, subscriptions for the purchase of State and Local Government Series
securities which request issuance on or after a designated date will only be accepted by the Division of Special Investments.
Full payment for each subscription will be submitted by the investor's financial institution on or before the issue
date utilizing the Fedwire funds transfer system which is available throughout the commercial banking industry.
It will no longer be necessary for investors to deposit the funds in an account subject to debit by a Federal Reserve
Bank or Branch on or before the date of issue. 

This proposed rule change is expected to provide investors in State and Local Government Series securities with several
benefits. Investors will enjoy a higher level of customer service and more consistent application of the regulations
pertaining to this securities program. Investors will be dealing directly with staff in the Division of Special Investments
who are trained and skilled in the many unique aspects of this securities program and whose principal responsibility
it is to manage the State and Local Government Series securities program. 

In addition, United States taxpayers will benefit in terms of the reduced costs of operating this securities program
which will be realized by centralizing operations within the Division of Special Investments. 

Because the responsibility for all issuance, funds collection, and accounting functions for the State and Local
Government Series securities program will be withdrawn from the designated Federal Reserve Banks and because the
Division of Special Investments must assume these operations on or about January 3, 1995, the Bureau of the Public
Debt has determined that a comment period of 15 days is necessary. This will allow time for comments to be incorporated
in a final rule within operational time constraints. Although most of the changes in this proposed rule are ministerial
in nature (for example, changes to increase the use of facsimile transmittals and to provide new addresses), proposed
changes concerning amending subscriptions ( 344.3(b)(3)(iv) and  344.7(b)) and concerning waivers
and fees associated with the failure to settle subscriptions ( 344.4(b) and  344.8(b)) merit special
attention. 

The Department of the Treasury is also in the process of considering the revision of the regulations governing the
State and Local Government Series securities program, with a view to increasing the flexibility of the program. The
proposed rule does not include these types of changes due to the need to adopt the proposed rule very quickly. Changes
to the State and Local Government Series securities program could include changes in the certification requirements
and in the rules relating to the redemption of SLGS securities before maturity. 



II. Section By Section Summary

are as follows: 

(1) Section 344.2(b)_This section would delete reference to the Federal Reserve Banks as a receiving point for initial
subscriptions to reflect the consolidation of program administration in Parkersburg, WV, and would expressly allow
for sending of initial subscriptions by facsimile equipment (FAX) or other carriers, in addition to postal delivery.


(2) Section 344.2(c)(2)_This section would clarify the authority governing Automated Clearing House payments
on account of United States securities. 

(3) Section 344.2(c)(2)(iii)_This section would clarify that fiscal agency checks, rather than Treasury checks,
are an alternative payment mechanism for securities for which subscriptions were submitted prior to February 1,
1987. 

(4) Section 344.3(a)_This section would delete reference to the Federal Reserve Banks as the receiving point for
subscriptions for purchase of securities under this offering, as well as the reference to in person delivery to such
Banks, to reflect the consolidation of program administration in Parkersburg, WV. In addition, this section would
expressly allow for sending of initial subscriptions by facsimile equipment. Whether subscriptions are sent by
FAX, mail or other carrier, subscribers are encouraged to expedite delivery. 

(5) Section 344.3(b)(1)_This section would permit sending of initial subscriptions by facsimile and other carriers.
The Bureau of the Public Debt is substituted for the Federal Reserve Banks to reflect the consolidation of program
administration in Parkersburg, WV. 

(6) Section 344.3(b)(3)_The current rule requires that amendments to initial subscriptions be filed on or before
the issue date. As proposed, this section would add a 3 p.m., Eastern time, submission deadline. In addition, this
section would permit sending of amendments to initial subscriptions by facsimile, provided the notification is
clearly identified as an amendment and is immediately followed by the submission by mail or other carrier of written
notification of the amendment. 

(7) Section 344.3(b)(3)(i)_This section would clarify that an amendment to an initial subscription may not change
the issue date to require issuance earlier than the issue date originally specified. In this section, the Bureau of
the Public Debt is substituted for the Federal Reserve Banks to reflect the consolidation of program administration
in Parkersburg, WV. The current regulation requires that changes under this section be submitted no later than one
business day before the originally specified issue date. As proposed, this section would add a 3 p.m., Eastern time,
submission deadline. 

(8) Section 344.3(b)(3)(ii) and (iii)_This section would make technical changes required by the addition of new
section 344.3(b)(3)(iv). 

(9) Section 344.3(b)(3)(iv)_This new section would govern amendments to initial subscriptions which are not submitted
timely. Under this proposed new section, where an amendment is not submitted timely, the Division of Special Investments
may determine, pursuant to the provisions governing waiver of regulations set forth under 31 CFR 306.126, that such
an amendment is acceptable on an exception basis. Where an amendment is determined to be acceptable on an exception
basis, the amended information shall be used as the basis for issuing the securities, and an administrative fee of
$100 per subscription will be assessed. The Secretary reserves the right to reject amendments which are not submitted
timely.

(10) Section 344.3(c)_In this section, the Bureau of the Public Debt is substituted for the Federal Reserve Banks
to reflect the consolidation of program administration in Parkersburg, WV. The current rule requires that a final
subscription must be submitted on or before the issue date. As proposed, this section would add a 3 p.m., Eastern time,
submission deadline. In addition, this proposed section is updated to reflect sending of a final subscription by
facsimile equipment. 
(11) Section 344.3(c)(1)_A typographical error in the current regulation is corrected. 
(12) Section 344.4_The current section is divided into two parts, (a) and (b). 
(13) Section 344.4(a)_This section would require that the issue date selected by the subscriber must be a business
day and would allow for the sending of initial subscriptions by facsimile or other carrier. In this section, the Bureau
of the Public Debt is substituted for the Federal Reserve Banks. The current rule requires investors to make payment
by having their financial institution deposit funds in a reserve account for debit by a Federal Reserve Bank or Branch
on or before the date of issue. Under the proposed section, full payment for each subscription must be submitted utilizing
the Fedwire funds transfer system. 
(14) Section 344.4(b)_The current regulation provides that any subscriber which fails to make settlement on a subscription
once submitted is ineligible thereafter to subscribe for securities under this offering for a period of six months.
Under the current regulation, the Commissioner of the Public Debt may determine, given the circumstances of the case,
that the six month penalty need not apply. As proposed, the Division of Special Investments may determine to waive
the six month penalty, pursuant to the provisions governing waiver of regulations set forth under 31 CFR 306.126.
Where settlement occurs after the proposed issue date and the Division of Special Investments determines, pursuant
to 31 CFR 306.126, that settlement is acceptable on an exception basis, the six month penalty will be waived, and the
subscriber shall be subject to a late payment assessment. The assessment will include payment of an amount equal to
the amount of interest that would have accrued on the securities from the proposed issue date to the date of settlement,
as well as an administrative fee of $100 per subscription. Assessments under this subsection are due on demand. Failure
to pay an assessment shall render the subscriber ineligible thereafter to subscribe for securities under this offering
until the assessment is paid. 
(15) Section 344.5(b)(2)_This section would add a reference to a designated Treasury form and delete a reference
to wire as an authorized means of submitting notice for redemption prior to maturity. The agency's Parkersburg, WV,
address is substituted for its former Washington, DC, address. This proposed section would allow the notice of redemption
to be sent by facsimile or by other carriers. The current regulation provides that notice of redemption must be received
no less than 15 calendar days before the requested redemption date. However, owners are encouraged to provide as much
notice of redemption as possible to assure that payment can be timely made. As proposed, this section would provide
that notice be submitted no less than 15 calendar days and no more than 60 calendar days before the requested redemption
date. 
(16) Section 344.5(b)(3)(ii)_The current regulation states that the applicable rate table for determining the
``current borrowing rate'' is the one in effect on the day the request for early redemption is received or, where mailed,
the postmark date. This section would clarify that the applicable rate table is the one in effect on the day the request
for early redemption is telecopied, postmarked, or where delivered by other carrier, date-stamped.

Subpart C_Demand Deposit Securities 


The Tax Reform Act of 1986 imposed arbitrage rebate requirements on issuers of tax-exempt bonds and directed the Department
of the Treasury to accommodate such requirements by enabling entities to invest qualifying funds in a Treasury money-market
type investment vehicle. Accordingly, the Department expanded the State and Local Government Series program, beginning
with its 1986 regulations, to include a demand deposit security offering. This security is not treated as investment
property for purposes of sections 143(g)(3) and 148 of the Internal Revenue Code and, therefore, enables eligible
entities to invest proceeds of tax-exempt bonds in an obligation which avoids the earning of arbitrage subject to
rebate. Proposed changes from the current rule are as follows: 
(1) Section 344.6(c)_A typographical error in the current regulation is corrected. 
(2) Section 344.7(a)_A typographical error in the current regulation is corrected, and the Bureau of the Public Debt
is substituted for the Federal Reserve Banks to reflect the consolidation of program activities in Parkersburg,
WV. The current regulation provides that subscriptions must be received under this section at least three business
days before the issue date, by a 1 p.m., Eastern time, deadline. The proposed section would clarify that subscriptions
may be submitted by certified or registered mail, or by other carrier. In addition, the proposed section provides
that a subscription may be submitted by facsimile equipment, at least three business days before the issue date, provided
that the original subscription form is submitted by mail, or other carrier, and is received by the Bureau of the Public
Debt by 3 p.m., Eastern time, on the issue date. 
(3) Section 344.7(b)_Current  344.7(b) is redesignated  344.7(c) and a new  344.7(b) is added.
The current regulation provides that the principal amount to be invested may be changed without penalty so long as
notice is provided by 1 p.m., Eastern time, at least one business day before the issue date. The proposed section provides
that the principal amount to be invested may be changed without penalty on or before the issue date, but no later than
1 p.m., Eastern time, on the issue date. This section would allow for sending of amendments to original subscriptions
by facsimile, provided the notification is clearly identified as an amendment and is immediately followed by the
submission, by mail or other carrier, of written notification of the amendment. In addition, this section would provide
that, where an amendment is not submitted timely, the Division of Special Investments may determine, pursuant to
the provisions governing waiver of regulations set forth under 31 CFR 306.126, that such an amendment is acceptable
on an exception basis. Where an amendment is determined to be acceptable on an exception basis, the amended information
shall be used as the basis for issuing the securities, and an administrative fee of $100 per subscription will be assessed.
The Secretary reserves the right to reject amendments which are not submitted timely. 
(4) Section 344.7(c)_Current  344.7(b) is redesignated as  344.7(c). A typographical error in current
 344.7(b)(5)(vii) is corrected. 
(5) Section 344.8_The current section is divided into two parts, (a) and (b). 
(6) Section 344.8(a)_In this section, the Bureau of the Public Debt is substituted for the Federal Reserve Banks to
reflect the consolidation of program activities in Parkersburg, WV. The current rule requires investors to deposit
funds in an account for debit by a Federal Reserve Bank or Branch on or before the date of issue. As proposed, this section
would require that full payment for each subscription be submitted utilizing the Fedwire funds transfer system.

(7) Section 344.8(b)_The current regulation provides that any subscriber which fails to make settlement on a subscription
once submitted is ineligible thereafter to subscribe for securities under this offering for a period of six months.
Under the current regulation, the Commissioner of the Public Debt may determine, given the circumstances of the case,
that the six month penalty need not apply. As proposed, the Division of Special Investments may determine to waive
the six month penalty, pursuant to the provisions governing waiver of regulations set forth under 31 CFR 306.126.
Where settlement occurs after the proposed issue date and the Division of Special Investments determines, pursuant
to 31 CFR 306.126, that such settlement is acceptable on an exception basis, the six month penalty will be waived, and
the subscriber shall be subject to a late payment assessment. The assessment will include payment of an amount equal
to the amount of interest that would have accrued on the securities from the proposed issue date to the date of settlement,
as well as an administrative fee of $100 per subscription. Assessments under this subsection are due on demand. Failure
to pay an assessment shall render the subscriber ineligible thereafter to subscribe for securities under this offering
until the assessment is paid. 

(8) Section 344.9(b)_The Bureau of the Public Debt is substituted for the Federal Reserve Banks to reflect the consolidation
of program activities in Parkersburg, WV. This section would allow for sending of the notice of redemption by facsimile
or by other carriers. The notice must show the account number and the tax identification number of the subscriber.
Under this proposed section, the notice must be received at the Bureau of the Public Debt by 1 p.m., Eastern time, one
business day prior to the requested redemption date. 



Subpart D_Special Zero Interest Securities 



To give investors flexibility in investing certain proceeds that may become subject to yield restrictions, a new
special zero interest security was offered for the first time with the 1989 rule. Under the terms of this offering,
subscribers are not required to certify that as of the date of investment all the proceeds subject to yield restrictions
are being invested in State and Local Government securities. With exceptions, this offering is the same as that for
time deposit securities. Proposed changes from the 1989 rule are as follows: 

(1) Section 344.13_This section would add a reference to a designated Treasury form and delete a reference to wire
as an authorized means of submitting notice for redemption prior to maturity. The agency's Parkersburg, WV, address
is substituted for its former Washington, DC, address. In addition, the section would allow for sending of the notice
for redemption by facsimile or by other carriers. The current regulation provides that notice of redemption must
be received no less than 15 calendar days before the requested redemption date. However, owners are encouraged to
provide as much notice of redemption as possible to assure that payment can be timely made. Under this proposed section,
notice is to be submitted no less than 15 calendar days and no more than 60 calendar days before the requested redemption
date. 



Procedural Requirements 



It has been determined that this proposed rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined in Executive Order
12866. Therefore, an assessment of anticipated benefits, costs and regulatory alternatives is not required. 

Although this rule is being issued in proposed form to secure the benefit of public comment, the rule relates to matters
of public contract, as well as the borrowing power and fiscal authority of the United States. The notice and public
procedures requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act are inapplicable, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(2).
As no notice of proposed rulemaking is required, the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601, et
seq.) do not apply. 

The collections of information contained in this regulation have been previously reviewed and approved by the Office
of Management and Budget, in accordance with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507) under
control number 1535-0091. The principal purpose of the proposed rule is to change the address of the receiving
entity. The revision would not impose a new collection of information requirement.

Subpart A_General Information 


 344.0 

Offering of securities. 


(a) In order to provide issuers of tax exempt securities with investments which allow them to comply with yield restriction
and arbitrage rebate provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, the Secretary of the Treasury offers for sale the following
State and Local Government Series securities: 
(1) Time deposit securities: 
(i) United States Treasury Certificates of Indebtedness, 
(ii) United States Treasury Notes, and 
(iii) United States Treasury Bonds. 
(2) Demand deposit securities_United States Treasury Certificates of Indebtedness. 
(3) Special zero interest securities: 
(i) United States Treasury Certificates of Indebtedness. 
(ii) United States Treasury Notes. 
(b) As appropriate, the definitions of terms used in this Part 344 are those found in the relevant portions of the Internal
Revenue Code and regulations. The term ``government body'' refers to issuers of State or local government bonds described
in section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code, as well as to any other entity subject to the yield restrictions in sections
141-150 of the Internal Revenue Code, or the arbitrage rebate requirements in section 143(g)(3) or 148 of the
Internal Revenue Code. The term ``postmark date'' refers to the date affixed by the U.S. Postal Service, not to a postage
meter date. The ``date telecopied'' for material sent by facsimile equipment is the date transmitted as it appears
on the document received. The term ``date-stamp'' refers to the date affixed by the carrier service upon the carrier's
taking receipt of the material. 
(c) This offering will continue until terminated by the Secretary of the Treasury. 


 344.1 

General provisions. 


(a) Regulations.

 United States Treasury State and Local Government Series securities shall be subject to the general regulations
with respect to United States securities, which are set forth in the Department of the Treasury Circular No. 300 (31
CFR part 306), to the extent applicable. Copies of the circular may be obtained from the Bureau of the Public Debt, Forms
Management_Room 301, 200 Third Street, PO Box 396, Parkersburg, WV 26102-0396, or a Federal Reserve Bank or
Branch. 
(b) 

Issuance.

 The securities will be issued in book-entry form on the books of the Department of the Treasury, Bureau of the Public
Debt, Parkersburg, WV 26102-0396. Transfer of securities by sale, exchange, assignment or pledge, or otherwise
will not be permitted. 
(c) 

Transfers.

 Securities held in an account of any one type, i.e., time deposit, demand deposit, or special zero interest, may not
be transferred within that account or to an account of any other type. 
(d) 

Fiscal agents.

 Selected Federal Reserve Banks and Branches, as fiscal agents of the United States, may be designated to perform such
services as may be requested of them by the Secretary of the Treasury in connection with the purchase of, transactions
involving, and redemption of, the securities. 
(e) 

Authority of subscriber.

 Where a commercial bank submits an initial or final subscription on behalf of a government body, it must certify that
it is acting under the latter's specific authorization; ordinarily, evidence of such authority will not be required.
Subscriptions submitted by an agent other than a commercial bank must be accompanied by evidence of the agent's authority
to act. Such evidence must describe the nature and scope of the agent's authorization, must specify the legal authority
under which the agent was designated, and must relate by its terms to the investment action being undertaken. Subscriptions
unsupported by such evidence will not be accepted.

(2) To refuse to issue any such securities in any case or any class(es) of cases; and 
(3) To revoke the issuance of any security, and to declare the subscriber ineligible thereafter to subscribe for securities
under this offering, if any security is issued on the basis of an improper certification or other misrepresentation
by the subscriber, other than as the result of an inadvertent error, if the Secretary deems such action to be in the public
interest. 
(4) Any of these actions shall be final. The authority of the Secretary to waive regulations under 31 CFR 306.126 applies
to this Part 344. 
(g) 

Debt limit contingency.

 The Department of the Treasury reserves the right to change or suspend the terms and conditions of this offering, including
provisions relating to subscriptions for, and issuance of, securities, interest payments, redemptions, and rollovers,
as well as notices relating hereto, at any time the Secretary determines that issuance of obligations sufficient
to conduct the orderly financing operations of the United States cannot be made without exceeding the statutory debt
limit. Announcement of such changes shall be provided by such means as the Department deems appropriate.

 

(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 1535-0091) 


Subpart B_Time Deposit Securities 


 344.2 

Description of securities. 


(a) 

Terms. 
(1) Certificates of Indebtedness.

 The certificates will be issued in a minimum amount of $1,000, or in any larger amount, in multiples of $100, with maturity
periods fixed by the government body, from 30 calendar days up to and including one year, or for any intervening period.

(2) 

Notes.

 The notes will be issued in a minimum amount of $1,000, or in any larger amount, in multiples of $100, with maturity periods
fixed by the government body, from one year and one day up to and including 10 years, or for any intervening period. 
(3) 

Bonds.

 The bonds will be issued in a minimum amount of $1,000, or in any larger amount, in multiples of $100, with maturity periods
fixed by the government body, from 10 years and one day up to and including 30 years, or for any intervening period. 
(b) 

Interest rate.

 Each security shall bear such rate of interest as the government body shall designate, but the rate shall not exceed
the maximum interest rate. The applicable maximum interest rates for each day shall equal rates shown in a table (Form
PD 4262), which will be released to the public by 10 a.m., Eastern time, each business day. If the Treasury finds that
due to circumstances beyond its control the rates will not be available to the public by 10 a.m., Eastern time, on any
given business day, it will provide an immediate announcement of that fact and advise that the applicable interest
for the last preceding business day shall apply. The applicable rate table for any subscription is the one in effect
on the date the initial subscription is telecopied, if transmitted by facsimile equipment, postmarked, if mailed,
or carrier date-stamped, if the initial subscription is delivered by other carrier. Subscriptions telecopied,
postmarked, or date-stamped on a non-business day will be subject to those interest rates which are in effect for the
next business day. The rates specified in the tables are one-eighth of one percent below the then current estimated
Treasury borrowing rate for a security of comparable maturity.

(c) 

Payment. 
(1) Interest computation and payment dates.

 Interest on a certificate will be computed on an annual basis and will be paid at maturity with the principal. Interest
on a note or bond will be paid semiannually. The subscriber will specify the first interest payment date, which must
occur any time between 30 days and one year of the date of issue, and the final interest payment date must coincide with
the maturity date of the security. Interest for other than a full semiannual interest period is computed on the basis
of a 365-day or 366-day year (for certificates) and on the basis of the exact number of days in the half-year (for notes
and bonds). See appendix to subpart E of part 306 of this chapter for rules regarding computation of interest. 
(2) 

Method of payment.

 For securities for which subscriptions are submitted on or after February 1, 1987, payment will only be made by the
Automated Clearing House method (ACH) for the owner's account at a financial institution designated by the owner.
To the extent applicable, provisions of  357.26 on ``Payments,'' as set forth in 31 CFR part 357 and provisions
of 31 CFR part 370, shall govern ACH payments made under this offering. For securities for which subscriptions were
submitted prior to February 1, 1987, payment will be made:
(i) By a direct credit to a Federal Reserve Bank or Branch for the account of the financial institution servicing the
investor; or 
(ii) By ACH for the owner's account at a financial institution; or 
(iii) By fiscal agency check; or 
(iv) In accordance with other prior arrangements made by the subscriber with the Bureau of the Public Debt. 


 344.3 

Subscription for purchase. 


(a) 

Subscription requirements.

 Subscriptions for purchase of securities under this offering must be submitted to the Division of Special Investments,
Bureau of the Public Debt, 200 Third Street, PO Box 396, Parkersburg, WV 26102-0396. Initial and final subscriptions
may be submitted by facsimile equipment at (304) 480-6818, by mail, or by other carrier. All subscriptions submitted
by mail, whether initial or final, should be sent by certified or registered mail. 
(b) 

Initial subscriptions.

 (1) An initial subscription, either on a designated Treasury form or in letter form, stating the principal amount
to be invested and the issue date, must be telecopied, postmarked, or where delivered by other carrier, must be date-stamped
at least 15 calendar days before issue date. For example, if the securities are to be issued on March 16, the subscription
must be telecopied, postmarked, or date-stamped no later than March 1. If the initial subscription is in letter form,
it should read substantially as follows:

(2) The provisions set out in paragraph (e) of 
 344.1, dealing with the authority of the subscriber to act on behalf of a government body, and in  344.4,
relating to the failure to complete a subscription, apply to initial, as well as final subscriptions. 
(3) An initial subscription may be amended on or before the issue date, but no later than 3 p.m., Eastern time, on the
issue date. Notification may be telecopied by facsimile equipment to the Bureau of the Public Debt at (304) 480-6818
provided the request is clearly identified as an amendment and is immediately followed by the submission, by mail
or other carrier, of written notification. Amendments to initial subscriptions are acceptable with the following
exceptions: 
(i) The issue date may not be changed to require issuance earlier than the issue date originally specified or to require
issuance more than seven calendar days later than originally specified. If such change is made, notification should
be provided to the Bureau of the Public Debt as soon as possible, but no later than 3 p.m., Eastern time, one business
day before the originally specified issue date; 
(ii) The aggregate amount may not be changed by more than the ten percent limitation set out in paragraph (c) of this
section; 
(iii) An interest rate may not be changed to a rate that exceeds the maximum interest rate in the table that was in effect
on the date the initial subscription was submitted; and 
(iv) Where an amendment is not submitted timely, the Division of Special Investments may determine, pursuant to the
provisions governing waiver of regulations set forth under 31 CFR 306.126, that such an amendment is acceptable on
an exception basis. Where an amendment is determined to be acceptable on an exception basis, the amended information
shall be used as the basis for issuing the securities, and an administrative fee of $100 per subscription will be assessed.
The Secretary reserves the right to reject amendments which are not submitted timely. 
(4) No initial subscription will be required where a final subscription is received or postmarked at least 15 calendar
days before the issue date. Such final subscription will be treated as the initial subscription for purposes of determining
the applicable interest rate table (see  344.2(b)), and may be amended on or before the issue date, subject to
the exceptions in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. 
(c) 

Final subscriptions.

 A final subscription must be received by the Bureau of the Public Debt on or before the issue date, but no later than 3
p.m., Eastern time, on the issue date. The final subscription may be telecopied by facsimile equipment to the Bureau
of the Public Debt at (304) 480-6818 provided the facsimile is properly identified as a final subscription and
is immediately followed by the submission of the original subscription form by mail or other carrier. The final subscription
must be for a total principal amount that is no more than ten percent above or below the aggregate principal amount specified
in the initial subscription. The final subscription, dated and signed by an official authorized to make the purchase
and showing the taxpayer identification number of the beneficial owner, must be accompanied by a copy of the initial
subscription, where applicable. The various maturities, interest rates, and semiannual interest payment dates
(in the case of notes and bonds), must be specified in the final subscription, as well as the title(s) of the designated
official(s) authorized to request early redemption. Final subscriptions submitted for certificates, notes and
bonds must separately itemize securities of each maturity and each interest rate. The final subscription must contain
a certification by the subscriber that, as of the date of investment (without regard to any temporary period of no longer
than 30 days): 
(1) The total investment consists only of proceeds (including amounts treated as proceeds) of a tax-exempt bond issue
which are subject to yield restrictions under sections 141-150 of the Internal Revenue Code during the entire
period of investment; 
(2) The total investment is not less than all of such proceeds except for_
(i) An amount not to exceed $100, and 
(ii) Amounts required for payment due less than 30 days from the date of issue; 
(3) None of the proceeds submitted in payment is derived (directly or indirectly) from the redemption before maturity
of other securities of the State and Local Government Series; and

(4)(i) No portion of the investment is being made (directly or indirectly) with amounts that are to be used to discharge
a tax-exempt bond issue and that are derived or are to be derived (directly or indirectly) from the sale of escrowed
open market securities, the proceeds of which were to be used to discharge a tax-exempt bond issue; or 
(ii) Although a portion of the investment is being made (directly or indirectly) with amounts that are to be used to
discharge a tax-exempt bond issue and that are derived or are to be derived (directly or indirectly) from the sale of
escrowed open market securities, the proceeds of which were to be used to discharge a tax-exempt bond issue, the composite
yield to maturity of all investments being purchased with such amounts does not exceed the composite yield to maturity
of the securities that were sold, based on the price at which they were sold. 
(5) Where proceeds are subject to yield restrictions for a limited period of time, under paragraph (c)(1) of this section,
no investment of such proceeds beyond such period may be made. For example, if a reserve fund of a refunding issue is
subject to yield restrictions for a period of four years, the securities purchased as an investment of the reserve
fund may not have a maturity longer than four years. With respect to obligations described in section 103 of the Internal
Revenue Code issued after January 31, 1987, paragraph (c)(2) of this section is satisfied only if on the date of investment,
all the proceeds of the issue which are subject to yield restrictions are invested in State and Local Government Series
securities. Paragraph (c)(2) of this section does not apply to purpose investments, such as mortgage notes or student
loan obligations. Transferred proceeds of the tax exempt bond issue that were proceeds of another issue shall not
be treated as proceeds for purposes of paragraph (c)(2) of this section if no portion of the total investment consists
of such proceeds. See  344.1(f) as to improper certifications.

 344.4 

Issue date and payment. 


(a) 

General.

 The subscriber shall fix the issue date of each security in the initial subscription. The issue date must be a business
day and may not exceed by more than 60 calendar days either the date the initial subscription was telecopied to the Bureau
of the Public Debt or, where mailed, the postmark date, or where delivered by other carrier, the carrier date-stamp
thereof. Full payment for each subscription must be submitted by the Fedwire funds transfer system with credit directed
to the Treasury's General Account. Full payment should be submitted by 3 p.m., Eastern time, to ensure that settlement
on the securities occurs on the date of issue.

(b) 

Noncompliance

. The penalty imposed on any subscriber which fails to make settlement on a subscription once submitted shall be to
render the subscriber ineligible thereafter to subscribe for securities under this offering for a period of six months,
beginning on the date the subscription is withdrawn or the proposed issue date, whichever occurs first. The Division
of Special Investments may determine to waive the six month penalty, pursuant to the provisions governing waiver
of regulations set forth under 31 CFR 306.126. Where settlement occurs after the proposed issue date and the Division
of Special Investments determines, pursuant to 31 CFR 306.126, that settlement is acceptable on an exception basis,
the six month penalty will be waived, and the subscriber shall be subject to a late payment assessment. The assessment
will include payment of an amount equal to the amount of interest that would have accrued on the securities from the
proposed issue date to the date of settlement, as well as an administrative fee of $100 per subscription. Assessments
under this subsection 
are due on demand. Failure to pay an assessment shall render the subscriber ineligible thereafter to subscribe for
securities under this offering until the assessment is paid. 




(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 1535-0091) 



 344.5

Redemption. 




(a) 

General

. A security may not be called for redemption by the Secretary of the Treasury prior to maturity. Upon the maturity of
a security, the Department will make payment of the principal amount and interest due to the owner thereof. A security
scheduled for redemption on a non-business day will be redeemed on the next business day. 

(b) 

Before maturity. 

(1) In general

. A security may be redeemed at the owner's option no earlier than 25 calendar days after the issue date in the case of
a certificate, and one year after the issue date in the case of a note or bond. Partial redemptions may be requested in
multiples of $100; however, an account balance of less than $1,000 will be redeemed in total. 

(2) 

Notice

. Notice of redemption prior to maturity must be submitted, either on a designated Treasury form or by letter, by the
official(s) authorized to redeem the securities, as shown on the final subscription form, to the Division of Special
Investments, Bureau of the Public Debt, 200 Third Street, PO Box 396, Parkersburg, WV 26102-0396. The notice
may be submitted by facsimile equipment to the Bureau of the Public Debt at (304) 480-6818, by mail, or by other
carrier. The notice must show the account number, the maturities of the securities to be redeemed, and the tax identification
number of the subscriber. The notice of redemption must be telecopied, postmarked, or where delivered by other carrier,
must be date-stamped no less than 15 calendar days before the requested redemption date, but no more than 60 calendar
days before the requested redemption date. A notice of redemption prior to maturity may not be cancelled. 

(3) 

Redemption proceeds

_

Subscriptions on or after September 1, 1989

. For securities subscribed for on or after September 1, 1989, the amount of the redemption proceeds is calculated
as follows: 

(i) 

Interest

. If a security is redeemed before maturity on a date other than a scheduled interest payment date, interest will be
paid for the fractional interest period since the last interest payment date.

<PARENT> FR941006-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(ii) 

Market charge

. An amount shall be deducted from the redemption proceeds in all cases where the current borrowing rate of the Department
of the Treasury for the remaining period to original maturity of the security prematurely redeemed exceeds the rate
of interest originally fixed for such security. The amount shall be the present value of the future increased borrowing
cost to the Treasury. The annual increased borrowing cost for each interest period is determined by multiplying the
principal by the difference between the two rates. For notes and bonds, the increased borrowing cost for each remaining
interest period to original maturity is determined by dividing the annual cost by two. For certificates, the increased
borrowing cost for the remaining period to original maturity is determined by multiplying the annual cost by the number
of days remaining until original maturity divided by the number of days in the calendar year. Present value shall be
determined by using the current borrowing rate as the discount factor. The term ``current borrowing rate'' means
the applicable rate shown in the table of maximum interest rates payable on United States Treasury securities_State
and Local Government Series_for the day the request for early redemption is telecopied, postmarked, or where delivered
by other carrier, date-stamped, plus one-eighth of one percentage point. Where redemption is requested as of a date
less than 30 calendar days before the original maturity date, such applicable rate is the rate shown for a security
with a maturity of 30 days. The market charge for bonds, notes, and certificates of indebtedness can be computed by
use of the formulas in Appendix A to this part. 

(4) 

Redemption proceeds

_

Subscriptions from December 28, 1976 through August 31, 1989

. For securities subscribed for from December 28, 1976 through August 31, 1989, the amount of the redemption proceeds
is calculated as follows: 

(i) 

Interest

. Interest for the entire period the security was outstanding shall be recalculated on the basis of the lesser of the
original interest rate at which the security was issued, or the interest rate that would have been set at the time of
the initial subscription had the term for the security been for the shorter period. If a note or bond is redeemed before
maturity on a date other than a scheduled interest payment date, no interest will be paid for the fractional interest
period since the last interest payment date. 

(ii) 

Overpayment of interest

. If there have been overpayments of interest, as determined under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section, there shall
be deducted from the redemption proceeds the aggregate amount of such overpayments, plus interest, compounded semiannually,
thereon from the date of each overpayment to the date of redemption. The interest rate to be used in calculating the
interest on the overpayment shall be one-eighth of one percent above the maximum rate that would have applied to the
initial subscription had the term of the security been for the shorter period. 

(iii) 

Market charge

. An amount shall be deducted from the redemption proceeds in all cases where the current borrowing rate of the Department
of the Treasury for the remaining period to original maturity of the security prematurely redeemed exceeds the rate
of interest originally fixed for such security. The amount shall be calculated using the formula in paragraph (b)(3)(ii)
of this section. 

(5) 

Redemption proceeds

_

Subscriptions on or before December 27, 1976

. (i) For securities subscribed for on or before December 27, 1976, the amount of the redemption proceeds is calculated
as follows. 

(ii) The interest for the entire period the security was outstanding shall be recalculated on the basis of the lesser
of the original interest rate at which the security was issued, or an adjusted interest rate reflecting both the shorter
period during which the security was actually outstanding and a penalty. The adjusted interest rate is the Treasury
rate which would have been in effect on the date of issuance for a marketable Treasury certificate, note, or bond maturing
on the quarterly maturity date prior to redemption (in the case of certificates), or on the semiannual maturity period
prior to redemption (in the case of notes and bonds), reduced in either case by a penalty which shall be the lesser of:


(A) One-eighth of one percent times the number of months from the date of issuance to original maturity, divided by
the number of full months elapsed from the date of issue to redemption, or 

(B) One-fourth of one percent. 




There shall be deducted from the redemption proceeds, if necessary, any overpayment of interest resulting from previous
payments made at a higher rate based on the original longer period to maturity.

Subpart C_Demand Deposit Securities 


 344.6

Description of securities. 



(a) 

Terms

. The securities are defined as one-day certificates of indebtedness. The securities will be issued in a minimum of
$1,000 and any increment above that amount. Each subscription will be established as a unique account. Securities
will be automatically rolled over each day unless redemption is requested.

<PARENT> FR941006-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(b) 

Interest rate

. (1) Each security shall bear a variable rate of interest based on an adjustment of the average yield for three-month
Treasury bills at the most recent auction. A new rate will be effective on the first business day following the regular
auction of three-month Treasury bills and will be shown in the table (Form PD 4262), available to the public on such
business day. Interest will be accrued and added to the principal daily. Interest will be computed on the balance of
the principal, plus interest accrued through the immediately preceding day. 
(2)(i) The annualized effective demand deposit rate in decimals, designated ``I'' in Equation 1 is calculated as:






I

=[(100/P)

Y/DTM

-1] (1-MTR)-TAC


(Equation 1) 


where 
P=The average auction price for the Treasury bill, per hundred, to three decimal places. 
Y=365 if the year following issue date does not contain a leap year day and 366 if it does contain a leap year day. 
DTM=The number of days from date of issue to maturity for the auctioned Treasury bill. 
MTR=Estimated average marginal tax rate, in decimals, of purchasers of short-term tax exempt bonds. 
TAC=Treasury administrative costs, in decimals. 



(ii) The daily factor for the demand deposit rate is then calculated as: 



DDR=(1+I)

1/Y

-1


(Equation 2) 


(3) Information as to the estimated average marginal tax rate and costs for administering the demand deposit State
and Local Government Series securities program, both to be determined by Treasury from time to time, will be published
in the 

Federal Register

. 
(c) 

Payment

. Interest earned on the securities will be added to the principal and will be reinvested daily until redemption. At
any time the Secretary determines that issuance of obligations sufficient to conduct the orderly financing operations
of the United States cannot be made without exceeding the statutory debt limit, the Department will invest any unredeemed
demand deposit securities in special 90-day certificates of indebtedness. These 90-day certificates will be payable
at maturity, but redeemable before maturity, provided funds are available for redemption, or reinvested in demand
deposit securities when regular Treasury borrowing operations resume, both at the owner's option. Funds invested
in the 90-day certificates of indebtedness will earn simple interest equal to the daily factor in effect at the time
demand deposit security issuance is suspended, multiplied by the number of days outstanding.

set forth under 31 CFR 306.126, that such an amendment is acceptable on an exception basis. Where an amendment is determined
to be acceptable on an exception basis, the amended information shall be used as the basis for issuing the securities,
and an administrative fee of $100 per subscription will be assessed. The Secretary reserves the right to reject amendments
which are not submitted timely.
(c) 

Certification. 

By completing the subscription form, subscribers certify to the following:
(1) Neither the aggregate issue price nor the stated redemption price at maturity of the bonds that are part of the tax-exempt

(i) Gross proceeds of an advance refunding issue to be used to discharge another issue;
(ii) Gross proceeds accumulated in a reserve or replacement fund (other than a bona fide debt service or reasonably
required reserve or replacement fund); and
(iii) Solely for purposes of this paragraph (c)(3), gross proceeds previously invested at any time pursuant to any
exception in paragraph (c)(5) of this section, other than paragraph (c)(5)(vi) (Exception 6) (relating to amounts

(4) At least 25 percent of the eligible gross proceeds received from the sale of the tax-exempt bond issue have been
or will be invested in demand deposit securities within three business days of the date of receipt thereof;
(5) All eligible gross proceeds of the tax-exempt bond issue have been and will be invested within four business days
of the date of receipt thereof in demand deposit securities (principal repayments on purpose investments are treated
as gross proceeds received on the date of repayment). This paragraph (c)(5) shall not apply to gross proceeds that
are at all times (prior to the date of expenditure thereof) invested pursuant to one of the exceptions:
(i) 

Exception 1. 

Gross proceeds that are invested solely in investments the earnings on which are not subject to rebate under section
148(f) or 143(g)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (whichever applies).
(ii) 

Exception 2. 

Gross proceeds that are invested in obligations the earnings on which are not reasonably expected to be subject to
rebate by reason of section 148(f)(4)(A)(ii) (relating to certain bona fide debt service funds) of the Internal Revenue
Code or section 148(f)(4)(B) (relating to exception for temporary investments) of the Internal Revenue Code.
(iii) 

Exception 3. 

Gross proceeds that are not reasonably expected to be gross proceeds of the tax-exempt bond issue for more than seven
business days.

Gross proceeds that are part of a reasonably required reserve or replacement fund (other than a bona fide debt service
fund) for the tax-exempt bond issue. 
(v) 

Exception 5. 

Gross proceeds that are invested in taxable obligations, but only if the yield on each obligation (computed separately
and on the basis of an arm's length purchase price) is no higher than the yield on the tax-exempt bond issue. 
(vi) 

Exception 6. 

Eligible gross proceeds that are not invested in one-day certificates of indebtedness or pursuant to paragraphs
(c)(5)(i-v) (Exceptions 1 through 5), but only if the total amount of such eligible gross proceeds on any particular
day is less than $25,000. This paragraph (c)(5)(vi) (Exception 6) shall not apply to gross proceeds that are part of
a reasonably required reserve or replacement fund (other than a bona fide debt service fund). 
(vii) 

Exception 7. 

Gross proceeds that are not invested pursuant to paragraph (c)(5)(iv) (Exception 4) or paragraph (c)(5)(vi) (Exception
6), and that are invested in any taxable obligation the yield on which is higher than the yield on the tax-exempt bond
issue, but only if taxable obligations described in paragraph (c)(5)(v) (Exception 5), and the tax-exempt obligations
described in (c)(5)(i) (Exception 1) are not available for investment (for example, because market interest rates
are too high and statutory or indenture restrictions prevent investments in tax-exempt obligations). 
(viii) 

Exception 8. 

Gross proceeds that are not invested in demand deposit securities due to an inadvertent error. 
(6) See  344.1(f) as to improper certifications.

payment should be submitted by 3 p.m., Eastern time, to ensure that settlement on the securities occurs on the date
of issue. 
(b) 

Noncompliance. 

The penalty imposed on any subscriber which fails to make settlement on a subscription once submitted shall be to render
the subscriber ineligible thereafter to subscribe for securities under this offering for a period of six months,
beginning on the date the subscription is withdrawn or the proposed issue date, whichever occurs first. The Division
of Special Investments may determine to waive the six month penalty, pursuant to the provisions governing waiver
of regulations set forth under 31 CFR 306.126. Where settlement occurs after the proposed issue date and the Division
of Special Investments determines, pursuant to 31 CFR 306.126, that settlement is acceptable on an exception basis,

Appendix A to Part 344_Early Redemption Market Change Formulas and Examples


A. The amount of the market charge for bonds and notes can be determined through use of the following formula:








where
M=market charge
b=increased annual borrowing cost (i.e., principal multiplied by the excess of the current borrowing rate for the
period from redemption to original maturity of note or bond over the rate for the security)
r=number of days from redemption to beginning of next semiannual interest period
s=number of days in current semiannual period
i=current borrowing rate for period from redemption to maturity (expressed in decimals)
n=number of remaining full semiannual periods to the original maturity date











B. The application of this formula may be illustrated by the following example:

(1) Assume that a $600,000 note is issued on July 1, 1985, to mature on July 1, 1995. Interest is payable at a rate of 8%
on January 1 and July 1.
(2) Assume that the note is redeemed on February 1, 1989, and that the current borrowing rate for Treasury at that time
for the remaining period of 6 years and 150 days is 11%.
(3) The increased annual borrowing cost is $18,000. ($600,000)x(11%-8%)

I. Introduction



The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region II announces its intent to delete the Radium Chemical Company site,
Woodside, Queens County, New York from the NPL and requests public comment on these actions. The NPL constitutes appendix
B to the NCP, which EPA promulgated pursuant to section 105 of CERCLA, as amended. The EPA identifies sites that appear
to present a significant risk to public health, welfare, or the environment and maintains the NPL as the list of those
sites. Sites on the NPL may be the subject of remedial actions financed by the Hazardous Substances Superfund Response
Trust Fund (Fund). Pursuant to  300.425(e)(3) of the NCP, any site deleted from the NPL remains eligible for
Fund-financed remedial actions, if conditions at the site warrant such action.

The EPA will accept comments concerning the Radium Chemical Company site for thirty days after publication of this
notice in the 

Federal Register.



Section II of this notice explains the criteria for deleting sites from the NPL. Section III discusses procedures
that EPA is using for these actions. Section IV discusses how the sites meet the deletion criteria.



II. NPL Deletion Criteria



The NCP establishes the criteria the Agency uses to delete sites from the NPL. In accordance with 40 CFR Section 300.425(e),
sites may be deleted from the NPL where no further response is appropriate. In making this determination, EPA will
consider whether any of the following criteria have been met:

(i) EPA, in consultation with the State, has determined that responsible or other parties have implemented all appropriate
response actions required; or

(ii) All appropriate Fund-financed responses under CERCLA have been implemented and EPA, in consultation with the
State, has determined that no further cleanup by responsible parties is appropriate; or

(iii) Based on a remedial investigation, EPA, in consultation with the State, has determined that the release poses
no significant threat to public health or the environment and, therefore, taking of remedial measures is not appropriate.

III. Deletion Procedures



The NCP provides that EPA shall not delete a site from the NPL until the State in which the release was located has concurred,
and the public has been afforded an opportunity to comment on the proposed deletion. Deletion of a site from the NPL
does not affect responsible party liability or impede agency efforts to recover costs associated with response efforts.
The NPL is designed primarily for informational purposes and to assist Agency management.

EPA Region II will accept and evaluate public comments before making a final decision to delete. The Agency believes
that deletion procedures should focus on notice and comment at the local level. Comments from the local community
may be the most pertinent to deletion decisions. The following procedures were used for the intended deletion of the
Radium Chemical Company site:

1. EPA Region II has recommended deletion and has prepared the relevant documents.

2. The State of New York has concurred with the deletion decisions.

3. Concurrent with this Notice of Intent to Delete, a notice has been published in local newspapers and has been distributed
to appropriate federal, state and local officials, and other interested parties. This notice announces a thirty-day
public comment period on the deletion package, which starts two weeks from the date of the notice, October 15, 1994,
and will conclude on November 15, 1994.

4. The Region has made all relevant documents available in the Regional Office and local site information repositories.

The comments received during the notice and comment period will be evaluated before any final decision is made. EPA
Region II will prepare a Responsiveness Summary, which will address the comments received during the public comment
period.

The deletion will occur after the EPA Regional Administrator places a Notice in the 

Federal Register

. The NPL will reflect any deletions in the next final update. Public notices and copies of the Responsiveness Summary
will be made available to local residents by the Region II Office.



IV. Basis for Intended Deletion of the Radium Chemical Company Site



The Radium Chemical Company (RCC) site is located at 60-06 27th Avenue in Woodside, Queens County, New York,
in a light industrial/residential sector. The site consisted of a 1-story brick building (and a part of a second brick
building which shared a wall with this building) bordered on the west by 27th Avenue and on the east by the Brooklyn-Queens
Expressway (BQE), a major roadway into New York City.

Founded in New York in 1913, RCC initially produced luminous paint for watch dials and instruments. Later, the company
manufactured, leased and sold radium-226 in the form of implant sources to hospitals, medical centers, and research
laboratories. In the late 1950's, RCC transferred its operations to the present location in Woodside, New York. The
radium and radon devices were stored on-site in lead containers in a brick vault room. Eventually the demand for radium
sources lagged as they were replaced with advanced radiotherapy techniques using cesium and cobalt sources. Subsequently,
many leased radium sources were returned to RCC and were stored on-site.

In 1983, the State of New York suspended the RCC operating license due to various disposal and safety infractions.
RCC attempted to obtain permission to begin operations again in 1986, but was denied. The New York State Department
of Labor issued its first Stipulation and Order against RCC on October 17, 1987, for the removal of the radium sources
and decontamination of the building. The owner was unable to finance the remediation and, subsequently, abandoned
the building. This resulted in a second Stipulation and Order, issued on July 20, 1988, determining that the facility
could not be maintained and that it was 

de facto

 abandoned by RCC. Remaining on-site were a large number of radium-containing sealed devices, some of which were suspected
of releasing radium and radon gas. The amount of radium-226 at the site was established to be 110 Curies (Ci). Also on-site
were hundreds of containers of laboratory chemicals, many of which were reactive, corrosive, flammable, and/or
potentially shock-sensitive.

In July 1988, at the request of the State of New York, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) undertook a limited
emergency removal action under CERCLA, et seq., to secure the facility and remove the radioactive sources. EPA provided
24-hour security and initiated measures to stabilize the site. By August 1988, EPA had erected fencing around the
perimeter and installed remote monitoring surveillance, a foam fire suppressant system, special vents, and other
safety measures. In February 1989, EPA contracted with Chem-Nuclear Systems, Inc. to remove the radium sources and
other hazardous materials from the site and transport them to approved disposal facilities. The removal action was
completed in October 1989. Approximately 120 Ci of radium in the form of sources, contaminated debris, and loose radium
salts and luminous compounds were removed from the site. This material was disposed of at facilities located in Richland,
Washington and Beatty, Nevada, both operated by U.S. Ecology.

On February 10, 1989, at EPA's request, the U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) issued a
Public Health Advisory to alert the public, EPA, and the State of New York of a serious threat to human health, based
on the threatened release of radium-226 from the RCC site. In an August 1989 special NPL update, EPA proposed the RCC
site for the NPL based on the ATSDR advisory. On November 21, 1989, the RCC site was added to the National Priorities
List.

EPA completed a Focused Feasibility Study (FFS) of the site in April 1990. Excessive levels of Rn-222 and Ra-226 remained
in the RCC facility, along with various radium contaminated hazardous chemicals. On June 21, 1990, EPA signed a Record
of Decision (ROD) selecting a remedy for the RCC site. The ROD called for the following remedial activities at the site:
decontamination of the RCC facility; dismantlement of the RCC building; excavation of contaminated soils and subsurface
structures; and transport and disposal of wastes to an approved waste disposal facility.

The EPA community relations activities at the site included a public meeting in May 1990 to present the results of the
FFS and the preferred alternative for remediation of the site. All public comments received were addressed. A major
concern of the public was the disruption to the local businesses caused by street closings. EPA held subsequent meetings
with the local business owners to determine the least obtrusive method for achieving our needs.

The remedial action at the site began in September 1990 with limited mobilization of the Site for surveying purposes.
On-site decontamination began on November 16, 1990 and the first shipment of radioactive wastes left the Site on July
11, 1991. The RCC building was decontaminated and dismantled. A portion of an adjoining building, leased by RCC, was
fully decontaminated and restored. Dismantling, excavation, and restoration activities were essentially completed
by January 1993. Removal of all wastes from the site and revegetation was completed in August 1993. A limited excavation
of soils surrounding a sewer line adjacent to the RCC property was conducted during July 1994.

Approximately 812 tons of radioactive soil and debris and 92 cubic feet of radium-contaminated hazardous wastes
were transported to the Envirocare of Utah, Inc. facility in Clive, Utah for disposal. Approximately 862 tons of uncontaminated
masonry and concrete building debris were transported to the Fresh Kills Landfill on Staten Island, New York for disposal.
Other wastes, including approximately 45 tons of elemental lead and 20 tons of structural steel, were transported
to the Scientific Ecology Group (SEG), Inc. facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee for decontamination and recycling to
the nuclear industry. Approximately 2.5 Ci of tritium watch faces were transported to the Chem-Nuclear Systems,
Inc. facility in Barnwell, South Carolina for disposal. Approximately 36.7 kilograms of radium-contaminated elemental
mercury were transported to the University of Tennessee for decontamination, followed by ultimate disposal of the
treated residuals at the Chem-Nuclear facility in Barnwell, South Carolina and recycling of the decontaminated
elemental mercury. Approximately 1.03 millicuries, associated with a radium calibration source, was transported
to Rutgers University for use in radon-generation research. Confirmatory sampling showing the site has been decontaminated
below the required levels, that contaminated soils have been excavated and disposed of off-site, and that the site
has been backfilled with clean soil, provide further assurance that the site no longer poses any threats to human health
or the environment.

EPA, with concurrence of the State of New York, has determined that all appropriate Fund-financed responses under
CERCLA at the Radium Chemical Company site have been completed, and that no further cleanup is necessary.

Qualification Of Drivers; Vision Deficiencies; Waivers


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Determination; request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The FHWA announces a Determination which will extend, for thirty days, waivers issued to certain vision-impaired
drivers as part of a study instituted in July, 1992. The purpose of the study is to gather information and data to determine
whether there should be a change in the current vision standards for operators of commercial motor vehicles (CMVs)
in interstate commerce, or provision for individualized waivers. This action is directed solely at those drivers
who had been granted temporary waivers to participate in the previously authorized vision waiver study, who numbered
2,411 as of September 30, 1994. This Notice also proposes to revalidate the waivers, allowing the aforementioned
drivers to continue to participate in the study until its conclusion, which will occur on or before March 31, 1996.
This revalidation would be based upon the Determination made in this document. This action follows, and is consistent
with, the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in the case captioned Advocates for Highway and
Auto Safety v. Federal Highway Administration, 28 F.3d 1288, D.C. Cir. 1994, which vacated the rule authorizing the
temporary waivers and remanded the matter to the agency for further action not inconsistent with the Court's ruling.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 206(f) of the Motor Carrier Safety Act of 1984, (MCSA) Pub. L. No. 98-554, 98 Stat. 2832 (codified at 49
U.S.C. 31136(e), formerly 49 U.S.C. app. 2505(f)) allows the Secretary of Transportation to grant waivers from the
Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations only after a determination that such waivers are not contrary to the public
interest and are consistent with the safe operation of CMVs. Historically, except for a limb-handicap waiver program
established in 1979 (49 CFR 391.49), the agency had granted no individual waivers to drivers who did not meet the physical
qualification requirements set forth at 49 CFR 391.41.


Current Vision Standard


The current Federal vision standard for CMV drivers requires:



Distant visual acuity of at least 20/40 (Snellen) in each eye without corrective lenses or visual acuity separately
corrected to 20/40 (Snellen) or better with corrective lenses, distant binocular acuity of at least 20/40 (Snellen)
in both eyes with or without corrective lenses, field of vision of at least 70 degrees in the horizontal meridian in
each eye, and the ability to recognize the colors of traffic signals and devices showing standard red, green, and amber.



49 CFR 391.41(b)(10).

<TEXT>
 

This standard has been applied absolutely in the sense that any individual who does not meet the standard is determined
to be physically unqualified to drive a CMV in interstate commerce without further consideration of individual ability.
Public policy enunciated in the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Pub. L. 93-112, 87 Stat. 355, as amended) and the
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1991 (Pub. L. 101-336, 104 Stat. 327, as amended) indicates that a preferable
standard would allow drivers to demonstrate their individual ability to drive safely, in spite of their vision deficiency.
However, because no practical means of testing the ability of an individual with various vision deficiencies to safely
operate a CMV were known to exist, except actual driving experience, the agency could not grant waivers and be certain
that such waivers were ``consistent with the safe operation of commercial motor vehicles'' as required by the MCSA.
The FHWA determined that a group of drivers did exist who, although they did not meet the standard, had already demonstrated
their ability to drive safely. These drivers were either operating in intrastate commerce and subject to a less stringent
State vision standard, or were operating, unwittingly or otherwise, in contravention of the existing interstate
standard. Adoption of the Federal standard by many States, along with stepped-up enforcement at both the State and
Federal levels, exposed these drivers to disqualification determinations. This was not inadvertent, however.
Laws enacted over the past ten years have effectively increased resources dedicated to the enforcement of the Federal
safety regulations or compatible State regulations by a factor of ten. Congress has insisted on uniform standards
consistent with Federal regulations issued pursuant to the MCSA of 1984, and has authorized programs to encourage
states to adopt those standards. Moreover, Federal regulations implementing the Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety
Act of 1986 and its commercial driver's license provisions, have further helped detect drivers operating in interstate
commerce who did not meet the Federal physical qualification requirements. Because of these efforts, more than 5,000
unqualified drivers have been identified and removed from interstate driving positions. That is, in fact, the intent
of establishing minimum Federal standards and insuring they are enforced.


Vision Waiver Study


At the same time that these enforcement efforts were increasing, heightened awareness of the rights of disabled individuals,
and the fact that some of the physical qualification standards were absolute in that they permitted no demonstration
of ability notwithstanding the physical deficit, caused the FHWA to reexamine its vision standard. Several research
studies, although acknowledging that visual capacity was an essential element of safe commercial vehicle operation,
had failed to fully resolve the issue of what level of visual capacity would be required to assure safety. The FHWA decided
to conduct a further study in an attempt to gather essential information that would lead to an improved standard. The
difficulties with some of the previous studies included insufficient subjects and the absence of exposure data.
The FHWA believed these difficulties could be overcome, in part, by using as subjects drivers who, although they did
not meet the Federal vision standards, had been safely operating CMVs for some time and were now, for the reasons mentioned
above, becoming more readily identifiable.
The FHWA announced its vision waiver study in a Notice of Intent to accept applications for waivers on March 25, 1992,
(57 FR 10295). The intent of the proposed program was to obtain valuable information on the relationship between visual
capacity and the ability to operate a CMV safely. This vision waiver study was initiated as part of an overall regulatory
review of the medical qualification standards applicable to interstate CMV drivers. It was also responsive to several
Congressional Committee reports accompanying the Americans With Disabilities Act directing the Secretary within
two years to ``undertake a thorough review of (the driver qualification) regulations to ascertain whether the standards
conform with current knowledge * * * and whether such regulations are valid under this Act.'' (42 U.S.C.
12101, Pub. L. 101-336, 104 Stat. 327). (See H. Rep. 596, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 60-61 (1990) (conference
report); H. Rep. 485, Part 2, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 57 (1990) (House Committee on Education and Labor); H. Rep. 458,
Part 3, 101st. Cong., 2d Sess. 34 (1990) (House Committee on the Judiciary); S. Rep. 116, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. 27-28
(1989) (Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources).

A further notice with request for comments was published on June 3, 1992, (57 FR 23370), and a notice of final disposition
was published on July 16, 1992, (57 FR 31458). The period during which applications for participation in this waiver
program would be considered expired on December 31, 1992, after having been extended from September 21, 1992 (57 FR
45002, September 30, 1992). Over 3,700 applications were received.
To assure consistency with safety, the FHWA set minimum requirements which a driver would have to meet before being
considered eligible for a waiver. These included visual acuity of at least 20/40 (Snellen) in the better eye, three
years driving experience with the vision deficiency, a safe driving record for that period, and a report on the condition
of the applicant's vision from an ophthalmologist or optometrist, including an opinion as to the driver's ability
to operate a CMV safely with the condition. A safe driving record was defined as the absence of chargeable accidents,
no convictions for serious traffic offenses, and no more than two convictions for other moving violations. The agency
based its requirement that drivers participating in the study have a three-year safe driving history with their vision
impairment upon studies (discussed more fully in ``Rationale for the Determination'') indicating that past experience
can be used to predict future performance, especially when combined with other predictive factors such as geographic
location, mileage driven, and conviction history. The agency also relied upon opinions from the medical community
that individuals with vision impairments are often able to compensate for that impairment over a period of time. Because
of the discrepancy as to how much time is necessary to allow an individual to compensate for an impairment (which generally
ranged from several months to a full year), the agency's choice of three years provided added assurance that drivers
would have had sufficient time to develop compensatory behavior. It was also the longest period for which driver histories
were uniformly available from State motor vehicle departments (MVD).


Court Decision


The Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety (Advocates) filed suit in the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C.
Circuit, requesting a review of the FHWA's notice of final disposition granting waivers to individuals who otherwise
did not meet the Federal vision standard required for the qualification of CMV drivers in interstate commerce. The
Advocates asserted that the waiver program was in violation of the Administrative Procedures Act (5 U.S.C. 553) because
the rule implementing the program was not issued with opportunity for meaningful comment and was otherwise arbitrary,
capricious, or not in accordance with law.
A three-judge panel for the D.C. Circuit issued its opinion in the case on August 2, 1994. The Court found that the FHWA's
notices of the program did provide for meaningful comment and that the comments received were given consideration.
The Court also held that the FHWA's approach, given the apparently conflicting demands, was reasonable, and therefore
not arbitrary and capricious. The Court observed, however, that the FHWA ``initiated a program to issue temporary
waivers to visually impaired drivers in order to procure the hard evidence needed to determine the effect of visual
deficiencies on safety. Yet, before it may grant a waiver, the Safety Act required the agency to determine that such
waiver * * * is consistent with the safe operation of commercial motor vehicles.'' 28 F.3d at 1294.
The Court found that the agency's ``determination that the waiver program will not adversely affect the safe operation
of CMVs is devoid of empirical support in the record,'' 28 F.3d at 1294, and that ``the FHWA has failed to meet the exacting
requirements of section 2505(f) (now 49 U.S.C. 31136(e)).'' 28 F.3d at 1294. Consequently, the Court concluded that
the FHWA's adoption of the waiver program was contrary to law, and vacated and remanded the rule to the agency.

This notice of determination is issued in response to the Court's remand. The FHWA has analyzed the Court's decision
and its effect on the vision waiver study, and has evaluated evidence that was not before the Court, including considerable
data gathered through the vision waiver study during its two years of operation. As of September 30, 1994, there were
2,411 individuals participating in the vision waiver study. Unless the agency acts on the D.C. Circuit Court's remand,
the waivers, without which most of these drivers would not be qualified, would have to be rescinded immediately because
the decision of the Court, when mandated, will invalidate the existing rule authorizing the waivers. 

Generally, a truck driver's ability to operate is demonstrated by possession of a currently valid commercial driver's
license or other authorized license, and based upon other safety-related information pertaining to the type of vehicle
to be operated. A commercial driver's license or other authorized license is issued after subjecting the driver to
knowledge and performance tests usually administered in the course of a few hours. Some employers may add a performance
test, or a safe driving probationary period before permanent employment. How safely the driver may operate thereafter
is based on compliance with traffic laws and regulations and involvement in accidents. 

The drivers accepted for the waiver study had to meet the licensing requirement of their States and any employer-mandated
prerequisites, in addition to demonstrating beforehand a safe driving record for three years as required by the Vision
Waiver Program. 

By allowing these drivers to continue to drive under a waiver program, i.e., in effect, grandfathering them, the FHWA
placed itself in the position of receiving information on the relationship between visual capacity and the ability
to operate a CMV safely. Because they did not meet existing vision standards, these drivers could not be allowed to
operate in interstate commerce, unless they obtained waivers. The Court acknowledged that ``this approach may be
entirely reasonable,'' but it found that the FHWA lacked data to support the conclusion that the conditions it imposed
on the granting of waivers assured consistency with the safe operation of CMVs. 

In order to revalidate the waivers, and to remain consistent with the Court's remand, the FHWA is relying upon several
research studies demonstrating the effectiveness of methods to ascertain the probability of an individual experiencing
accidents in the future based on accident history. The first major effort in this area was done in England by Greenwood
and Yule in 1920. Subsequent studies, building on that model, concluded that accident rates for the same individual
exposed to certain risks for two different time periods vary only slightly. (See Bates and Neyman, University of California
Publications in Statistics, April 1952.) Other studies demonstrated theories of predicting accident proneness
from accident history coupled with other factors. These factors, such as age, sex, geographic location, mileage
driven and conviction history, are used every day by insurance companies and motor vehicle bureaus to predict the
probability of an individual experiencing future accidents. (See Weber, Donald C., ``Accident Rate Potential:
An Application of Multiple Regression Analysis of a Poisson Process,'' Journal of American Statistical Association,
June, 1971). A 1964 California Driver Record Study prepared by the California Department of Motor Vehicles concluded
that the best overall accident predictor for both concurrent and nonconcurrent events is the number of single convictions.
This California study used three consecutive years of data, comparing the experience of drivers in the first two years
with the experience of those same drivers the final year. Copies of the several studies relied upon here have been added
to the docket.

Based upon the studies and practices noted above, the FHWA has determined that three years safe driving experience
with the vision deficiency not only allowed for sufficient adjustment by drivers to the condition, but also provided
for the longest period of experience for which records were uniformly available from which to predict future performance.
As noted above, the California study was limited to a two-year base period because, like many jurisdictions, the accumulation
of accurate driver histories does not exceed three years. The use of a three-year base period improves the predictability
of the future period because the longer the period, the more likely the elimination of random anomalies. (See Bates
and Neyman, University of California Publications in Statistics, April 1952.) Therefore, the FHWA believes it has
required and applied a sufficiently long period of safe driving to project continued safe driving over a future period
of the same duration. 
The FHWA accepted only those drivers with no chargeable accidents for the three-year period of most recent driving
experience. This translated into no chargeable accidents, as verified through motor vehicle records, in approximately
300 million vehicle miles travelled (VMT), as reported by the applicants. Although the FHWA certainly could not conclude
that this rate would remain at zero, some of the studies noted above concluded that the correlation between the accident
experience of the same individual over two different time periods was strongest when the rate of accidents was lowest.
Moreover, the FHWA is confident that the chargeable accident rate of the general commercial driving population over
three years could not be less 
than 0. In fact, the chargeable accident rate for the year 1991, the year prior to the inception of the vision study,
for the general truck driving population was 0.46 per 1 million vmt. 
If the waived drivers were not permitted to continue to drive, they would have to be replaced by other drivers. These
``replacement'' drivers come from the general commercial driving population, which includes new, inexperienced
commercial drivers. The FHWA has established that the chargeable accident rate for the general commercial driving
population for the year 1992 well exceeds that of the drivers participating in the vision waiver program. Information
about the past performance of new, inexperienced commercial drivers, many of whom are younger in age, does not exist.
Studies have shown, however, that younger drivers of passenger vehicles produce the highest accident rates. Consequently,
the agency required a three-year experience factor for applicants to the waiver program as a means of eliminating
a similar risk posed by inexperienced commercial drivers. See Wyckoff, D. Truck Drivers in America, D.C. Heath &
Co., Lexington, Mass. 1979. 
The good driving record demonstrated by the waiver applicants not only required the absence of chargeable accidents
over a three-year period, but also the absence of serious traffic violations and no more than two minor traffic violations.
According to the California Driver Record Study mentioned above, this is the best predictor of future safe driving.

The requirement of three years safe driving experience with the vision deficit severely limited participation by
the highest accident-risk age group. Each driver's application was individually examined, any missing information
was required to be furnished, and each driver was measured against the waiver standards to assure that all the conditions
were met, i.e., individualized determinations were made on the basis of complete data submitted by each applicant,
to determine eligibility for participation in the waiver program.

The FHWA now has new, significant data, which had also not been considered by the Court in reaching its decision, to
support its present determination. The vision waiver study has now been in effect since July 1992, and has collected
driver safety and performance data periodically for approximately two years. Individuals driving pursuant to waivers
are required to submit reports of vehicle miles travelled monthly. They are also required to report any citation for
a moving violation involving a CMV and the judicial or administrative disposition of such charge, and, within 15 days
of occurrence, any accident involvement whatsoever while operating a CMV. All accident information is verified
periodically through each driver's State motor vehicle record (MVR) by the FHWA's contractor, Conwal, Inc. of Falls
Church, Virginia. Participants in the waiver program also submitted, prior to their acceptance, detailed information
of their individual vital statistics, employment history, current status of driving privilege as recorded on the
licensing State's MVR and the license status for the past three years, and expert medical opinion by an ophthalmologist
or optometrist as to current visual acuity and its effect on his or her ability to perform the driving task safely. Participating
drivers are required to submit annual reports from an ophthalmologist or optometrist attesting to the present condition
of their vision. Any loss of vision bringing them below the waiver standard of 20/40 in the better eye results in immediate
discharge from the program. 
Drivers participating in the program are subject to revocation of their waiver for failure to meet certain reporting
requirements or if the vision in their better eye falls below the required standard. The agency strictly holds waived
drivers to these requirements and standards. As of September 30, 1994, a total of 201 drivers have had their waivers
revoked. Of that number, 21 drivers were revoked for failing to submit an annual medical exam. The remaining 180 drivers
were revoked for failing to submit monthly driving reports on time. No drivers have had their waivers revoked for decreasing
visual acuity; however, two drivers have voluntarily withdrawn from the program on this basis. 
Based upon statistical analysis of this information conducted by the contractor, the agency can conclude that the
driving performance of individuals participating in the vision waiver program is better than the driving performance
of all CMV drivers collectively, based on data obtained from the General Estimates Service (GES). The GES is a national
survey conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and was selected for use as the best measure
of the prevailing national norm relative to large truck accidents. 
The Third Interim Monitoring Report, prepared by the contractor responsible for FHWA's vision waiver program, dated
June 27, 1994, reported on the cumulative driving performance of those individuals participating in the waiver group
between July 1992 and February 1994. During that period, a total of 211 accidents were reported and a total of 136.4
million VMT had been recorded. The number of accidents in this period divided by the VMT give an accident rate of 1.547
accidents per million VMT. The national accident rate for large truck accidents, as reported by the GES for the year
1992, is 2.531 accidents per million VMT. A copy of this report is contained in the docket. 
The reports submitted by the drivers are independently verified through periodic records checks with State MVDs.
While drivers in the study are required to report all accident involvement, the State MVDs only record accidents warranting
reports under existing State requirements. Similarly, the GES data only contain accidents recorded by State MVDs.
Therefore, the drivers in the waiver study are held accountable for more accidents than those included in GES statistics.

The FHWA's contractor, which is performing the data collection, the statistical analysis and preparation of the
interim reports, was subjected to a peer review of its procedures and methodology, a summary of which is included in
the docket. A Fourth Interim Report is in preparation at this time, and covers cumulative activities and mileage through
June 30, 1994. A review of the data indicates that the performance of the study group remains relatively unchanged,
as the accident rate is only slightly higher than previously reported, i.e. 1.636 accidents per one million VMT. The
completed report will be placed in the docket along with all preceding Interim Reports.

FHWA's Determination 


Statistical studies mentioned above support the proposition that accident-free performance coupled with low numbers
of traffic violations over a three-year period is a reliable predictor of continued safe performance over a similar
period in the future. As a condition of admission into the waiver program, each applicant had to demonstrate a three-year
period of safe driving performance prior to being admitted into the study group. The performance data obtained from
the waived drivers since the study began confirms the FHWA's determination that the continued operation of the waived
group, as provided for in this notice, will not diminish safety. The data also show that this class of drivers performed
and is performing more safely than the pool of drivers from which its replacements would have to be drawn, that is, the
general driving population. Accordingly, the FHWA has determined that to revalidate waivers, as stated in this notice,
for drivers in the class of drivers defined by the study and operating under the conditions of the study is consistent
with the safe operation of CMVs. 
This evidence, examined in conjunction with the previously available medical and scientific evidence, and detailed
driving records provided prior to acceptance into the waiver program and periodically thereafter by each individual
participating in the waiver group, clearly indicates that the continued operation of CMVs by the group of drivers
currently participating in the waiver program will not adversely affect CMV safety. 
The FHWA has also determined that to conduct the waiver study program under the conditions prescribed herein is consistent
with the public interest of assuring the physical condition of operators of CMVs is adequate to enable them to operate
the vehicles safely and of providing opportunities for drivers with real or perceived visual disabilities to demonstrate
their ability to drive safely and continue in their chosen field of occupation. 
Finally, the FHWA believes that the information contained in this notice provides a sufficient degree of empirical
evidence to satisfy the safety requirement mandated by both the MCSA and the D.C. Circuit Court. 


Revalidation of Waivers and Request for Comments 


In view of the above, the agency is revalidating the vision waivers possessed by drivers as of September 30, 1994, for
thirty days from the date of this notice. 
The FHWA is also proposing that this evidence is sufficient to allow those drivers currently participating in the
vision waiver study (2,411 as of September 30, 1994) to continue operating CMVs with waivers, subject to the same standards
and conditions applicable to the original waivers, for the duration of the study, which shall conclude not later than
March 31, 1996. By that date, approximately 93 percent of the drivers presently participating in the study will have
completed at least three years driving in the study program. 
The FHWA is requesting comments on this proposal. A short comment period is necessitated by the precarious position
in which the drivers participating in the study, as well as the FHWA, are placed by virtue of the Court's decision. If
this determination is delayed, individuals who have received a waiver from the application of certain regulations
will immediately be subject to irreparable harm in the form of job loss and financial hardship. Moreover, if the agency
allows the waiver program to continue without presenting a reasoned analysis and justification, it could be found
to be acting contrary to the order of the Court. Finally, this additional period of 15 days for comments will allow for
the submission of persuasive reasons why the FHWA should not complete its study by revalidating waivers to the study
participants subject to the same standards or conditions. 


Public Hearing on the Vision Standard and Waiver Program 


Due to the strong public interest surrounding this matter, the FHWA will conduct a public hearing within six months
of the date of this notice of determination to explore the remaining issues surrounding the vision standard and the
vision waiver program. Examples of issues to be addressed at the public hearing include: 
(1) The relationship of visual capacity to the 
commercial driving task; 
(2) Identification of research and data helpful in defining the vision standard;

<DOCNO> FR941006-1-00064 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941006-1-00013 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(3) What additional research is needed to help the FHWA define its vision standard; 
(4) Upon conclusion of the Vision Waiver Program, what should be the driving status of waived drivers, assuming continued
safe driving performance. 
The FHWA is eager to gain a broader perspective of the public's viewpoint concerning other studies, data and experiences
which will enhance the agency's knowledge on the subject. The FHWA is also interested in sharing its data with other
researchers and modes which may undertake useful analysis and initiate studies leading to more enlightened approaches
to establishing future physical qualification standards, standards that are both necessary and valid to increasing
opportunities in the truck-driving profession while ensuring that society's high expectations of CMV safety are
realized. Notice of the hearing will be published in the 

Federal Register

 and will contain further questions to which the agency seeks responses, as well as directions on how to obtain information
about the data collected during the vision waiver study. 








Conclusion 


The FHWA will publish, within 30 days of the date of publication of this notice, its determination regarding the continuation
of the vision waiver program through the proposed March 31, 1996 deadline. This determination will be based upon comments
received in response to this notice, as well as all empirical evidence gathered to date. 
If the FHWA determines, based upon comments and related information, not to extend the program to such date, the agency
will publish its rationale for such determination and the date upon which waived drivers may no longer operate in interstate
commerce. Additionally, waived drivers will be notified directly of the agency's decision to terminate the program.

If the FHWA determines, based upon comments and related information, that the waiver program may continue until March
31, 1996, the agency will also publish that determination as well in the 

Federal Register

.

(You must submit an MVR from each State in which you were licensed during that cumulative three-year period); 






Note: 

The driving record must be furnished by an official State agency, on its letterhead, bear the State seal, or official
stamp and be signed by an authorized State official. No other documentation will be accepted. If the MVR shows either
convictions for moving violations or accident involvement but does not indicate the type of vehicle operated or the
number of miles above the posted speed limit, additional official documentation must be provided by you (e.g., a copy
of the citation or accident report, or copies of court records). 






Special Note: 

Any waiver applicant who is arrested or cited for, or convicted of, any disqualifying offense or other moving violation
during the period of time the application is pending must immediately report such arrests, citations, or convictions
to the Vision Waiver Program, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590. Failure to do so may result in a denial
or rescission of the waiver. No waiver will be issued while any charge against an applicant, for what would be a disqualifying
offense, is still pending. Convictions occurring during the processing of the application will be considered in
the overall driving record.



(4) That you have been examined by an ophthalmologist or an optometrist after the FHWA reaches its decision on the reopening
of the vision waivers program, and a notice of final disposition announcing such decision has appeared in the 

Federal Register

(a) Identified and defined the visual deficiency; 
(b) Certified that the visual deficiency has not worsened since the last vision examination required by your State's
driver licensing agency; 
(c) Certified that your visual acuity is at least 20/40 (Snellen), corrected or uncorrected, in the better eye; and

(d) Certified that in his/her professional opinion, you are able to perform the driving tasks required to operate
a commercial motor vehicle. 






Note: 

Do not submit other medical records, bills, etc. 



Conditions for Retaining A Vision Waiver Once Issued 


There would be special requirements attached to any waiver issued to a vision-impaired driver. These requirements
would be imposed to ensure that the FHWA receives the data needed to complete the research effort. The reporting requirements,
a six month verification of every waived driver's MVR, and the CDL standards applicable to waived drivers will ensure
that unsafe, vision-impaired drivers are removed from operation in the same manner as other unsafe drivers. Waived
drivers will not be afforded any additional privileges that would allow them to operate differently from other CMV
drivers in interstate commerce. Each driver would be required to: 
(a) Report, in writing, any citation for a moving violation involving the operation of a CMV to the Vision Waiver Program
within 15 days following issuance (a photostatic copy of the citation issued must accompany the written report);

(b) Report, in writing, the judicial or administrative disposition of any citation for a moving violation involving
the operation of a CMV to the Vision Waiver Program within 15 days following the notice of disposition; 
(c) Report, in writing, any accident involvement whatsoever while operating a CMV to the Vision Waiver Program within
15 days following the accident (include State, insurance company, and/or motor carrier accident reports); 
(d) Report, in writing, any change of residential address or telephone number to the Vision Waiver Program within
15 days after such a change; 
(e) Report, in writing, any change of employer, (include name, address, and telephone number of new employer), or
type of vehicle operated to the Vision Waiver Program within 15 days after such a change. 
(f) Submit documentation of an annual examination by an ophthalmologist or an optometrist to the FHWA at least 15 days
before each anniversary of the waiver issuance date, that you have been reexamined within the past 6 weeks. The documentation
must contain the medical specialist's certification that the individual is still eligible under the waiver's vision
criteria and the vision deficiency has not worsened since the last vision examination required by the waiver; and

(g) Report to the Vision Waiver Program, by the 15th calendar day of each month (not including the month in which the
waiver becomes effective), the following information: 
(1) The number of interstate/intrastate miles you drove a commercial motor vehicle (CMV) during the preceding month.
For example, if you drove 3,000 miles for the preceding month (July), you must report that information by the 15th day
of the next month (August); 
(2) The number of daylight hours and the number of nighttime hours you drove a CMV during the preceding month. For example,
if you drove 170 daylight hours and 50 nighttime hours during the preceding month (July), you must report that information
by the 15th day of the next month (August); and 
(3) The number of days you did not drive a CMV during the preceding month. For example, if you did not drive a CMV a total
of 9 days during the preceding month (July), you must report that information by the 15th day of the next month (August).






Note: 

The monthly report should be mailed within the first few days of each month in order to ensure that the report will be
received at the office of the Vision Waiver Program by the 15th day of each month. 




If the answer to one or all of the above questions is 0, then state ``0'' or ``none'', do not leave any question unanswered
or it will be considered ``Failure to report,'' and your waiver is in jeopardy. All documentation described in items
(a) through (g) above, must be mailed to the Vision Waiver Program, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590.
Failure to submit reports within the time periods described above may be cause for revocation of the waiver.

<SUMMARY>
summary: 

The Federal Election Commission is seeking comments on proposed revisions to its regulations governing publicly

the Presidential Election Campaign Fund Act and the Presidential Primary Matching Payment Account Act, which establish
eligibility requirements for Presidential candidates seeking public financing and indicate how funds received
under the public financing system may be spent. They also require the Commission to audit publicly financed campaigns
and seek repayment where appropriate. The proposed rules reflect the Commission's experience in administering
this program during the 1992 election cycle and also seek to anticipate some questions that may arise during the 1996
Presidential election cycle. The Commission is requesting comments on the draft rules set out in this Notice, and
is also seeking comments on several issues for which no specific regulatory language is proposed at this time. No final
decisions have been made by the Commission on any of the proposed revisions in this Notice. Further information is
provided in the supplementary information which follows.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information: 

The Commission is considering revising parts of its regulations governing public financing of Presidential campaigns,
11 CFR Parts 9001 

et seq. 

and 9031 

et seq., 

in order to more effectively administer the public financing program during the 1996 election cycle. The Commission
is publishing this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to invite comments on the proposed revisions.



The areas in which the Commission is considering possible revisions are described in this portion of the Notice in
narrative form. Those revisions that would affect both primary and general election campaigns are described in the
first section of the narrative. The revisions that would affect only primary or general elections, respectively,
are set out in the next two sections. The fourth section summarizes other miscellaneous and technical amendments
the Commission is proposing for the public financing rules.

The Commission has prepared proposed regulatory language for many of these revisions, and included this language
in the last section of the Notice. However, the Commission is also interested in receiving comments on other possible
changes for which no regulatory language has been prepared. The narrative describes these approaches and highlights
the issues to which commenters are encouraged to direct their attention. Please note that the narrative discussion
is arranged by topic, whereas the draft rules are set out in numerical order. Readers should use the citations contained
in the narrative to locate the corresponding proposed language in the draft rules.

Primary and General Election Regulations



A. Qualified Campaign Expenses



1. Negligent Handling of Public Funds



Accounting procedures employed by the Commission make allowance for reasonable loss and normal spoilage of equipment
leased or purchased by a campaign. However, the Commission has at times encountered incidents involving the mismanagement
or negligent handling of public funds that do not fall into either of these categories. The proposed rules therefore
seek to clarify how such negligence and mismanagement is handled in the audit process.

The Commission is seeking comment on whether, as a precondition for the receipt of public funds, the candidate should
agree to meet certain standards in handling public monies as well as in overseeing the use of and accounting for public
funds. Such standards would be specified at 11 CFR 9003.1(b) and 9033.1(b). If this approach is taken, the Commission
welcomes comment on what standard(s) would be appropriate.

The proposed rules would amend 11 CFR 9004.4(b) and 9034.4(b), to clarify that the cost of items that are lost or misplaced
due to negligence of a campaign committee will be considered a non-qualified expense for purposes of these rules.
However, the Commission recognizes that there are varying degrees of negligence in this area, and that certain factors
should be considered prior to any determination that a repayment is required. For example, these factors could include,
but would not be listed to, whether the committee demonstrates that it made careful efforts to safeguard the missing
equipment; the type of equipment involved; the number of items that were lost; and the value of the lost equipment as
a percentage of the total value of the equipment leased or owned by the committee. On this latter point, the Commission
notes that a lost item, such as a newly-acquired vehicle, may involve a major investment of taxpayer funds, irrespective
of the fact that its cost is only a small percentage of the total amount of equipment leased or owned by the campaign committee.
The Commission welcomes comments on other factors that should be considered in making this determination.

Another approach would be to limit the dollar amount of lost property that could be considered a qualified campaign
expense. If a committee lost goods worth more than the specified amount, any amount over that figure would be a non-qualified
campaign expense. This would have the advantage of not requiring the Commission to get involved in what could become
a substantial number of negligence determinations, while recognizing that some loss is inevitable in large, lengthy
campaigns. The Commission welcomes comments on this approach as well as on what reimbursement limit should be specified,
if this were to be adopted.

The Commission is also seeking comments on how lost or stolen uninsured items should be reflected on statements of
net outstanding campaign obligations [``NOCO'']. If an item is lost through negligence, the question is whether
it should continue to be treated as an asset for purposes of the NOCO statement to avoid increasing the committee's
entitlement. Comments are welcome on how this should be done.

Please note that other proposed amendments to the NOCO requirements are discussed under ``NOCO Statements,'' 

infra.

 A related topic, the treatment of insurance proceeds, is discussed under ``Gains on the Use of Public Funds,'' 

infra.





2. Closed Captioning



In 1992, Congress amended 26 U.S.C. 9003 to add a new paragraph (e), stating that no publicly funded candidate may receive
funding for either the primary or general election campaign unless the candidate agrees that all of his or her television
commercials will be closed captioned or otherwise capable of being viewed by deaf and hearing impaired individuals.
Pub. L. 102-393, section 534, 106 Stat. 1764 (1992). Although no corresponding amendment was made to 26 U.S.C.
9033, section 9003(e) states that this requirement applies not only to candidates who are eligible to receive amounts
from the Presidential Election Campaign Fund, but also to those eligible for funding ``under chapter 96'' of Title
26 of the United States Code, that is, the Presidential Primary Matching Payment Account Act. The Commission is therefore
proposing to add the statutory language to the candidate and committee agreement requirements found at both 11 CFR
9003.1(b) and 9033.1(b).

3. Media Reimbursements


Section 9004.6 contains rules governing expenditures for transportation and other services provided to media and
Secret Service personnel by presidential campaign committees receiving public financing for the general election.
Section 9034.6 is a parallel provision governing primary committees that receive public funds from the matching
payment account. These provisions indicate that expenditures for these purposes will, in most cases, be regarded
as qualified campaign expenses subject to the overall limitations of sections 9003.2 and 9035.1, respectively.
However, sections 9004.6 and 9034.6 also allow committees to accept limited reimbursement for these expenses from
the media, and deduct any reimbursements received from the amount of expenditures subject to the overall expenditure
limitation. These rules set limits on the amount of reimbursement that a committee can accept, and require committees
to repay a portion of any reimbursement that exceeds those limits to the Treasury.
The proposed rules seek to clarify the application of sections 9004.6 and 9034.6 by reorganizing them without any
substantive change. Under the proposed revisions, paragraphs (a) and (b) have been broken into smaller subparagraphs.
Paragraph (c) has been renumbered as paragraph (e). Paragraph (d) has been renumbered as paragraph (c) and broken
into smaller paragraphs, and new paragraph (d) has been inserted in order to clarify the interplay between two aspects
of the existing rules: The requirement that the committee return to the media representative that portion of any reimbursement
received that exceeds the actual cost of the transportation and services provided by more than 10%, and the requirement
that the committee repay to the Treasury any part of the reimbursements it receives that exceeds the actual and administrative
costs incurred by the committee. The Commission welcomes comments on the proposed revisions to sections 9004.6 and
9034.6.


4. Travel Expenditures


The Commission seeks comments on modifying 11 CFR 9004.7 and 9034.7 to address several issues regarding the cost of
campaign-related travel using government airplanes, helicopters and other vehicles. The current rules contemplate
that for plane flights between cities served by a regularly scheduled commercial airline service, the campaign must
reimburse the appropriate governmental entity for the first class airfare, and that this amount is treated as a qualified
campaign expense. New language in section 9004.7(b)(5)(i) and section 9034.7(b)(5)(i) would specify that, for
travel by airplane, the amount of the lowest unrestricted non-discounted first class commercial airfare available
for the time traveled is to be used. Discounted fares that are subject to restrictions on the dates and times of travel,
or restrictions on changing flights, are not comparable to the service provided when the campaign uses a government
conveyance. Campaign committees are responsible for determining these amounts at the time of the flight to ensure
that the right amount is paid to the appropriate government entity, and would need to maintain documentation supporting
these amounts. The lowest unrestricted non-discounted first class airfare is available from several sources including
travel agents and the Official Airline Guide.
Questions have also arisen regarding cities that are served by regular air service, but first class flights are not
available. In this case, the Commission proposes specifying that committees should use the lowest unrestricted
non-discounted coach fare available for the time traveled. This approach is consistent with the valuation method
established by the Select Committee on Ethics of the United States Senate for the use of private aircraft. See Interpretive
Ruling No. 412, Select Committee on Ethics, United States Senate, 101st Cong., 1st Sess., S. Prt. 101-18 at 251-52
(1989). It is also consistent with the valuation methods used by the House of Representatives' Committee on Standards
of Official Conduct with respect to gifts of private transportation not associated with official travel. See, Valuation
of Gifts of Transportation on Private Aircraft, Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, Letter dated June 11,
1987.
For cities not served by regularly scheduled commercial service, the current rules specify that the amount to be reimbursed
is the charter rate. The proposed revisions would clarify that the charter rate used should be for a comparable airplane
of similar make, model and size. This provision would also be consistent with the approaches used by the Congressional
Committees.

Questions have also arisen regarding the costs of ``positioning'' flights that are needed to bring the government
aircraft from one stop where it dropped off the candidate and campaign staff to another stop where it will pick them
up to continue the trip or return to the point of origin. New language in sections 9004.7(b)(5)(ii) and 9034.7(b)(5)(ii)
would incorporate the Commission's policy that the committee should pay the costs noted above for one passenger plus
fuel used and crew time. This approach recognizes that positioning flights are campaign-related, and therefore
these costs are properly treated as qualified campaign expenses.

Paragraphs (b)(5)(iii) in sections 9004.7 and 9034.7 would contain provisions regarding travel on government conveyances
other than airplanes. For travel by helicopter or ground conveyance, the commercial rental rate should be paid for
a comparable conveyance in terms of size, model and make. Additional guidance on this area can be found in Advisory
Opinion 1992-34. Proposed sections 9004.7(b)(5)(iv) and 9034.7(b)(5)(iv) would continue to require payment
for the use of accommodations paid for by a government entity. Under 11 CFR 100.7(a)(1)(iii)(B), the committee should
use the usual and normal charge in the market from which it ordinarily would have purchased the accommodations. The
term ``accommodations'' includes both lodging and meeting rooms.

New paragraph (B)(8) of these sections would explicitly reflect Commission policy that travel on corporate conveyances
is governed by 11 CFR 114.9(e).

Finally, new language in paragraph (b)(2) of these sections would provide additional guidance as to when a stop will
be considered campaign-related. Campaign activity includes soliciting, making or accepting contributions, and
expressly advocating the nomination, election or defeat of any candidate. See, e.g., AOs 1994-15, 1992-6,
and opinions cited therein. The Commission has also indicated that the absence of solicitations for contributions
or express advocacy regarding candidates will not preclude a determination that an activity is ``campaign related.''


Id.

 Accordingly, the proposed rules would include other factors to be considered in determining whether a stop is campaign-related.
The rules would also retain the current language indicating that incidental campaign-related contacts during an
otherwise noncampaign-related stop would not cause the stop to be considered campaign-related.



5. Winding Down Costs; Gifts and Bonuses



The current regulations at 11 CFR 9004.4(a)(4)(i) and 9034.4(a)(3)(i) permit candidates to receive contributions
and matching funds, and make disbursements, for the purpose of defraying winding down costs over an extended period
after the candidate's date of ineligibility [``DOI'']. These amounts are treated as qualified campaign expenses,
and can result in additional audit fieldwork and preparation of addenda to audit reports to focus on these receipts
and disbursements.

The Commission is proposing several ways to streamline and shorten the audit process, discussed below. In addition,
comments are welcome on whether the amount that a candidate may receive for winding down costs should be limited to
no more than a flat dollar amount, or a set percentage of the candidate's total expenditures during the campaign, or
a set percentage of total matching funds certified for the candidate. If so, what should the amount or percentage be?
If campaigns receive a set dollar amount, but do not use the entire amount for winding down costs, should they be permitted
to retain the unspent amount? Allowing them to keep the remainder would serve as an incentive to complete the winding
down process promptly. However, there are public policy reasons for requiring the remaining funds to be returned
to the U.S. Treasury. Placing a cap on winding down expenses would assist the Commission's goal of streamlining, but
the amount chosen would have to be sufficient to meet reasonable expenses incurred in winding down the campaign. Another
option would be to establish a cutoff date after which winding down expenses would not longer be considered qualified
campaign expenses. Other suggestions that would simplify and shorten the required audit process are encouraged.
The proposed rules do not include language regarding these proposals.

The Commission seeks comments on new language in section 9034.4(A) incorporating the current practice of permitting
publicly-funded primary committees to treat 100% of salary, overhead and computer expenses incurred after the candidate's
date of ineligibility (DOI) as exempt compliance expenses, beginning with the first full reporting period after
DOI. See, Financial Control and Compliance Manual for Presidential Primary Candidates Receiving Public Financing,
p. 25 (January, 1992). Please note that this approach does not apply to expenses incurred during the period between
DOI and the date on which a candidate either re-establishes eligibility or ceases to continue to campaign. Similarly,
for general election candidates, new language would be added to section 9004.4(a) to allow 100% of salary and overhead
expenses incurred after the end of the expenditure report period to be paid from the legal and accounting compliance
fund, provided these expenses are solely to ensure compliance with the FECA and the Fund Act.

Finally, new language in sections 9004.4(a) and 9034.4(a) would permit campaign committees to use federal funds
to defray the costs of gifts or monetary bonuses for committee staff and consultants, as long as the gifts do not exceed
$150 per individual and as long as all gifts and bonuses (except bonuses provided for at the outset in employment and
consulting contracts) are limited to $20,000. This approach is somewhat similar to a provision included in the public
funding rules for convention committees at 11 CFR 9008.7(a)(4)(xii). See 59 FR 33618 (June 29, 1994). With regard
to bonus arrangements provided for in advance in employment and consulting contracts, comments are sought on whether
the amount of these bonuses should be restricted to a fixed percentage of the compensation paid as provided by the contract,
or whether these bonuses should be subject to the overall $20,000 limit. Such an approach would be intended to ensure
that committees do not give out sizable bonuses simply because they have surplus public funds at the end of the campaign.

B. Documentation and Reporting


1. Documentation of Disbursements


Sections 9003.5(b)(1)(i) and 9033.11(b)(1)(i) set forth the documentation required for disbursements in excess
of $200. Although a canceled check, negotiated by the payee, is required in most situations, it is not currently required
if the committee presents a receipted bill from the payee stating the purpose of the disbursement. The proposed rules
would change the documentation requirements so that committees must provide canceled checks negotiated by the payees
for all disbursements over $200. This change would assist the Commission's audit staff in verifying that public funds
are spent on qualified campaign expenses. Committees should already have canceled checks in their possession, so
production would not be burdensome. Please note that, as in the past, the proposed rules would require that documentation
in addition to the committee's check be provided for disbursements exceeding $200.


2. Alphabetized Schedules


The proposed rules include two new sections, 11 CFR 9006.3 and 9037.4, which would require that presidential campaign
committee reports containing schedules generated from computerized files, list in alphabetical order the sources
of the receipts, the payees and creditors. For individuals, including contributors, the list must be in alphabetical
order by surname. However, presidential campaign committees would not be required to computerize their records
if they do not wish to do so. The new provision is intended to remedy situations in which committees maintain computerized
records of contributors or payees in alphabetical order, but file schedules with the order of the names scrambled.
That practice makes it very difficult, if not impossible, to locate particular names on the committee's reports if
the schedules are voluminous, thereby thwarting the public disclosure purposes of the Federal Election Campaign
Act, 2 U.S.C. 431 

et seq

. [``FECA''] and making it more difficult to monitor compliance with the contribution limits.


C. Audits


1. Sampling and Disgorgement


The Commission has a statutory obligation to complete the audits of publicly funded committees in a thorough and timely
manner. In the past, the resources required to conduct reviews of the contributions received by presidential committees
contributed to the Commission's difficulty in fulfilling that obligation.
Beginning with the 1992 election cycle, however, the Commission began to make more extensive use of statistical sampling
for audits of contributions received by publicly financed presidential primary election committees, and to use
the sample results to quantify, in whole or in part, the dollar value of any related audit findings. While the Commission
continues to conduct a limited non-sample review of contributions received by these committees, most audit testing
of contributions and supporting documentation is now done on a sample basis. The Commission is now proposing that
new paragraph (f) be added to 11 CFR 9007.1 and 9038.1 to incorporate these procedures.
The Commission notes that this approach would apply in a general election only to contributions raised due to a deficiency
in the Presidential Election Campaign Fund, or to contributions raised by new or minor party candidates. See 26 U.S.C.
9003(c)(2), 9006(c); 11 CFR 9003.2(b)(2), 9003.3(b).
The use of statistical sampling is legally acceptable for projecting certain components of a large universe, such
as excessive and prohibited contributions. 

See, e.g., Chavez County Home Health Service

 v. 

Sullivan,

 931 F.2d 904 D.C. Cir. 1991) (sampling audit used to recoup Medicaid overpayments to health care providers); 

Michigan Dep't of Education

 v. 

U.S. Dep't of Education,

 875 F.2d 1196 (6th Cir. 1989) (sampling of 259 out of 66,368 total payment authorizations upheld as proper basis for
determining amount of misexpended federal funds in vocational-rehabilitative program); 

Georgia

 v. 

Califano,

 446 F. Supp. 404 (N.D. Ga. 1977) (Medicaid overpayments).
The statistical sampling technique currently employed in this process, known as Dollar Unit Sampling, Probability
Proportional to Size, or Combined Attribute Variable Sampling, is widely accepted in the auditing profession. This
plan is discussed in the American Institute of Certified Public Accounts' Audit and Accounting Guide entitled Audit
Sampling, and is the only sampling plan capable of producing dollar projections supported by the audit software package
IDEA, which is marketed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. This same technique has been used
by the Commission since 1980 to determine the amount of committees' matching fund payments.
The Commission is using this sampling plan to evaluate committees' compliance with contribution prohibitions and
limitations, itemization of contributions, omission of disclosure information and receipts documentation. See
2 U.S.C. 432(c), 434(b), 441a, 441b, 441c, 441e, 441g. For example, the Commission projects the total amount of excessive
or prohibited contributions based on apparent excessive or prohibited contributions identified in a sample of a
committee's contributions. This projection becomes the basis, in whole or in part, of the audit finding.


</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941006-1-00073 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941006-1-00015 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Commission informs the committee which items serve as the basis for the sample, and the committee responds only
to the specific sample items used to make the projection. If the committee shows that any errors found among the sample
items were not excessive or prohibited contributions, timely refunded, reattributed or redesignated, or for some
other reason were not errors, a new projection is made, based on the reduced number of errors in the sample.

The Commission is further proposing to clarify at new paragraphs 9007.1(f)(3) and 9038.1(f)(3) that the amount of
any excessive or prohibited contributions that are not refunded, reattributed or redesignated in a timely manner
shall be paid to the United States Treasury. Committees have 30 days from the date of receipt in which to refund prohibited
contributions, and 60 days in which to seek the reattribution, redesignation or refund of excessive contributions.
11 CFR 103.3(b) (1), (2) and (3). A committee's failure to take action on these contributions, as well as attempts to
cure them outside of the specified time periods, would cause these contributions to be treated as in violation of the
FECA.

The equitable doctrine of disgorgement supports the payment to the Treasury under these circumstances. 

See generally, United States

 v. 

Bonanno Organized Crime Family of La Cosa Nostra,

 683 F. Supp. 1411 (E.D.N.Y. 1988), 

aff'd

 879 F.2d 20 (2d Cir. 1989) (disgorgement an appropriate, non-punitive remedy to deprive wrongdoers of their ill-gotten
gains and to deter future violations). A payment to the Treasury is an equitable remedy for contributions that have
been accepted in violation of 2 U.S.C. 441a and 441b, and is also consistent with past Commission practice. See Matter
Under Review [``MUR''] 1704 (based upon preliminary estimates, Commission directed respondents to pay $350,000
to the United States Treasury for contributions that would have exceeded section 441a limits); Plaintiff's Motion
to Effectuate Judgment, 

FEC 

v. 

Populist Party,

 No. 92-0674 (HHG) (D.D.C. filed May 4, 1993).

Moreover, this proposed payment is analogous to, and consistent with, the requirement at 11 CFR 9038.6 that stale-dated
checks be paid to the Treasury. This issue arose after the 1984 election cycle, and the rule was promulgated as a means
to codify the Commission practice of requiring disgorgement, which was implemented during that cycle. 

See, e.g.,

 52 FR 20864, 20874 (June 3, 1987).

Disgorgement eliminates the need for the Commission to monitor a committee's refunds of excessive or prohibited
contributions. In addition, it is easier for a committee to make one payment to the Treasury, as opposed to refunding
multiple contributions. Finally, this is a practical approach in those situations where it is difficult to discern
the original contributors.



2. Further Streamlining the Audit Process



The Commission is seeking comments and suggestions on ways to further reduce the amount of time it takes to audit publicly
funded presidential committees, to make repayment determinations, and to complete the enforcement process for
these committees. The Commission's responsibility for conducting a thorough audit and examination of qualified
campaign expenses is set out at 26 U.S.C. 9007(a) and 9038(a). The Commission has an additional responsibility to
conduct adjudications as to whether any portion of the public funds received should be subject to a repayment. 26 U.S.C.
9007(b) and 9038(b). The public financing statutes at 26 U.S.C. 9007(c) and 9038(c) specify a three year time period
in which the Commission will notify publicly funded committees of repayment determinations. Separate enforcement
procedures are prescribed under 2 U.S.C. 437g.

The Commission has taken several actions to help insure that the audit and repayment processes are completed as expeditiously
as possible. For example, the 1991 revisions to the public financing regulations eased compliance with the state-by-state
allocation rules set forth at 11 CFR 106.2, and implemented improved use of subpoenas in presidential audits. See
56 FR 35899-900, 35903-04 (July 29, 1991). In addition, as noted above, the Commission has begun to use
generally accepted sampling procedures in conducting these audits, and has instituted a policy that limits a committee
to one extension of time in which to respond to the Interim and Final Audit Reports [``IAR'' and ``FAR'']. These actions
are having the desired effect, in that the Commission is currently on schedule, or ahead of schedule, with respect
to nearly all 1992 audits.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941006-1-00074 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941006-1-00015 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Given this situation, one approach would be to wait until after the new rules and procedures have been in place for an
entire presidential election cycle before evaluating what additional streamlining methods are warranted, if any.
In the alternative, the Commission welcomes suggestions for further streamlining these processes, and seeks comments
on several possible changes that are explained below.

The Commission notes that it is important to ensure that whatever streamlining measures are adopted do not adversely
affect the statutorily required audit process, the committees' due process rights when repayment determinations
are made, or the Commission's ability to effectively conduct subsequent enforcement actions.

As for modifications to the actual audit and repayment processes, the Commission is first considering whether the
committee's oral presentation should be held at an earlier point. Currently a committee may request the opportunity
to make an oral presentation if the committee submits written materials disputing the initial repayment determination
contained in the FAR. 11 CFR 9007.2(c)(3), 9038.2(c)(3). Please note that the Commission is not considering adding
a second hearing to the audit and repayment processes, but only whether the current hearing should be held at a different
point.

The Commission recognizes that some committees might prefer to make this presentation earlier in the process. Moving
up the hearing could also help the Commission resolve issues at an earlier date. However, it is unclear whether advancing
the hearing would in and of itself shorten either the audit or repayment process.

The Commission's experience has been that many issues are resolved or narrowed as the audit progresses and the amount
of the repayment is further refined. Hence, an earlier date could result in a longer, less manageable hearing on more
issues. To date, the Commission has averaged only five oral hearings per cycle, because sufficient issues were resolved
in or before the FAR in the other audits to make a hearing unnecessary. The earlier in the process a hearing is held, the
more likely it is that a committee will request one. This approach could thus slow down, rather than speed up, the audit
process.

The Commission also seeks comments on whether to shorten the time between various stages of the audit, repayment,
and enforcement processes, or to eliminate some of these stages. For example, the IAR currently includes a preliminary
repayment calculation, while the FAR includes an initial repayment determination. 11 CFR 9007.1(c), (d); 9038.1(c),
(d). The Commission issues the final repayment determination following consideration of the initial repayment
determination in the FAR, along with, 

inter alia,

 information contained in the committee's written response or presented at the hearing, if one is held. 11 CFR 9007.2(c)(4),
9038.2(c)(4).

One alternative would be to include the initial repayment determination in the IAR, and include the final repayment
determination and statement of reasons in the FAR. The committee would then respond to the IAR with a written statement
and could request the opportunity to make an oral presentation, as is now done following the FAR. This hearing and related
documentation would serve as the basis for the FAR.

The committee would continue to have the right to petition for a rehearing, in accordance with 11 CFR 9007.5 and 9038.5,
but would exercise this right following the FAR/final repayment determination, rather than after the later, separately-issued
final repayment determination that occurs under the present rules. Please note that including the initial repayment
determination in the IAR would not change the rule that issuance of an IAR serves as notification of repayment determinations.
See 11 CFR 9007.2(a)(2) and 9038.2(a)(2).

A variation of this approach would be to provide a staff draft of the IAR to the committee at the same time it is sent to
the Commission, much in the manner that the Commission currently provides a probable cause to believe brief to respondents
pursuant to 2 U.S.C. 437g(a)(3). The committee could provide a written response to the staff-prepared IAR and request
a hearing before the Commission. The hearing and additional materials submitted would serve as the basis for the Commission's
adoption of the FAR. The Commission would subsequently issue the final repayment determination and statement of
reasons.

While this approach could take less time, committees might prefer to know when they are preparing their responses
whether the Commission agrees with the staff's analysis of the issues presented. This would not be possible if the
committee received the staff draft of the IAR at the same time it was sent to the Commission. Also, the staff draft could
not contain an interim repayment determination, as that must be approved by the Commission.

The Commission is also concerned with how confidentiality requirements could impact on these proposed revisions.
When committee activities raise both repayment and enforcement issues, the current confidentiality provisions
require that matters already determined by the Commission to warrant enforcement action not be made public during
the Commission's discussion of the initial repayment determination. For example, the publicly released FAR does
not discuss the referral of specific matters for enforcement under 2 U.S.C. 437g. See 11 CFR 9007.1(e)(2), 9038.1(e)(2).

Regardless of what other changes might be made, the Commission is considering whether the IAR should be made public
at the time it is sent to the committee. If this were done, the Commission's ``sunshine'' rules might require a public
discussion of the IAR, unless the document met other criteria requiring closed discussion under 11 CFR 2.4.

The Commission recognizes that committees may prefer that the preliminary repayment calculation, which is now contained
in the IAR, not be publicly released, because the amount of the requested repayment may be substantially altered prior
to the issuance of the FAR or the final repayment determination. On the other hand, publicly releasing the IAR could
encourage committees to address issues at an earlier point, rather than waiting until the later stages of the audit
and repayment processes, as now sometimes occurs. If the decision is made to release the IAR, the revised rules would
note that the repayment sought could be adjusted upwards or downwards, based on any subsequent information.

Finally, the Commission is considering whether, in those audits that lead to enforcement actions, the enforcement
process should begin at an earlier point, such as by making reason to believe findings when the IAR is issued. This would
permit the investigation to proceed concurrently with the audit and repayment processes, so that the final repayment
determination and statement of reasons could be issued when the enforcement matter is concluded.

The Commission already has begun to initiate enforcement actions at an earlier point, in appropriate cases. However,
it may prove difficult, if not impossible, to formulate a specific policy that would apply equitably to all audits
as to when the enforcement process should begin and when it should be completed. The Commission would not want the completion
of the audit and repayment processes to be delayed because the enforcement action is still underway. Also, in some
situations, it may not be possible for the Commission to open an enforcement matter before it issues a final repayment
determination, if that determination constitutes the Commission's earliest analysis of whether certain actions
may constitute violations. Thus the current case-by-case approach may prove to be the best alternative.



3. Administrative Record



The Commission also has prepared new sections 9007.7 and 9038.7 to explain which documents constitute the administrative
record for purposes of judicial review of final determinations regarding candidate certification, eligibility,
ineligibility, and repayment. For example, the administrative record includes documents and other supporting
evidence on which the Commission's decision is based such as the candidate agreement, matching fund submissions,
Interim Audit Report, NOCO statement, the Final Audit Report, transcript of the committee's oral presentation,
the final repayment determination, statements of reasons, and the certifications of Commission votes. On the other
hand, the Commission has never considered the administrative record to include documents in the files of individual
Commissioners, or documents in FEC employees' files which do not constitute a basis for the Commission's decisions.
It would also not be appropriate to include in the administrative record transcripts or tapes of Commission discussions
of audit or repayment matters. Although these materials may sometimes be made available under the Freedom of Information
and Government in the Sunshine Acts, they do not provide an adequate explanation of the reasons for the Commission's
decisions because they represent pre-decisional discussions. Documents properly subject to privileges such as
an attorney-client privilege, or items constituting attorney work product, would also not be made part of the administrative
record. The Commission welcomes comments regarding the types of documents and materials that should or should not
be considered part of the administrative record.



D. Applicability of the Debt Collection Act to the Certification Process



The Debt Collection Act, 31 U.S.C. 3701 

et seq.

 [``DCA''], at section 3716, authorizes the practice of administrative offset, whereby amounts owed to the Government
may be deducted from amounts due from the Government to a debtor if certain requirements are met. This means, for example,
that the Commission could obtain repayments from certain publicly funded campaigns that have failed to make timely
restitution of improperly-utilized public funds, if that candidate qualified for public funding in a future election
cycle.

One of the DCA's requirements is that, before an agency can utilize this procedure, it must have prescribed regulations
describing how this will be done. However, the DCA has other ramifications both for public funding, and for the Commission's
enforcement process under the FECA. For example, in some situations, section 3717 of the DCA would require charging
interest, penalties and processing and handling costs on overdue debts. This could include both overdue repayments
and overdue civil penalties.

The Commission has an ongoing rulemaking that would revise various FECA enforcement procedures, and is planning
to publish an additional Notice in connection with that rulemaking to seek comments on how the DCA might be utilized
in both the FECA and the public funding context. Comments received in response to that Notice will serve as the basis
for deciding whether to amend the public funding rules to provide for administrative offset, interest and other charges.

The Commission is also seeking comment on the related question of whether, absent implementation of the DCA, it would
be appropriate to assess interest on late repayments (those made after 90 days following notice of the Commission's
repayment determination) and during extensions of time on repayment determinations, especially those that exceed
the 90-day period established at 11 CFR 9007.2(d)(1) and 9038.2(d)(1).

While the presidential fund Acts contain no language on interest assessment, federal common law holds that interest
may be assessed on debts owed the government, even without a statutory provision granting that power. 

Robinson

 v. 

Watts Detective Agency,

 685 F.2d 729, 741 (1st Cir. 1982). In particular, a statute is not necessary to compel payment of interest where equitable
principles allow this. 

Young

 v. 

Godbe,

 82 U.S. 562, 565 (1872).

In the absence of charges for delinquent payments, debtors have little or no incentive to make timely payments. Without
this requirement, debtors may be more likely to pay their private sector debts first, as these generally accrue interest,
and their government debts last.

The Commission has already established the precedent that it may assess interest when a presidential committee seeks
a stay of a repayment determination pending appeal. 11 CFR 9007.5(c)(4), 9038.5(c)(4). One reason cited by the Commission
for taking this action was to protect the Treasury ``by helping to ensure that the repayment challenge is a serious
one and not a dilatory tactic.'' Agenda Document




#

86-118, Proposed Revision of Title 26 Regulations (Nov. 26, 1986). Another was that, if the candidate is earning
interest on the disputed repayment amount, the Treasury and not the candidate should receive the benefit if the Commission's
repayment determination is upheld. 

Id.

 Both reasons are equally applicable to this discussion.



Another argument in support of collecting interest is that, by agreeing to certain conditions, including an audit
and appropriate repayment, the presidential committees have established a contractual relationship with the Commission
under which interest assessment becomes appropriate. 

See West Virginia

 v. 

United States,

 479 U.S. 305, 310 (1987). Also, if a debtor-creditor relationship is established, ``interest is allowed as a means
of compensating a creditor for loss of use of his money.'' 

United States

 v. 

United Drill and Tool Corporation,

 183 F.2d 998, 999 (D.C. Cir. 1950). Such a relationship exists in this context in that, prior to the receipt of public
funds, the candidate must agree to repay unexpended funds, money determined to be spent in an unqualified manner,
and amounts received in excess of entitlement. 11 CFR 9003.1(b)(6), 9033.1(b)(7).

If the Commission decides to expand the current interest assessment policy, it would seem appropriate that the same
interest computation formula be utilized across the board. Under current 11 CFR 9007.5(c)(4) and 9038.5(c)(4),
the interest assessed is the greater of that calculated using the formula set forth at 28 U.S.C. 1961 (a) and (b) for
computing interest on money judgments in federal civil cases, or the amount actually earned on the set-aside funds
in controversy. The Commission welcomes comments on whether this or some other approach should be taken, should additional
regulations be promulgated.

Please note that there is no specific language in the regulatory text that addresses this situation. The Commission
welcomes comments on any aspect of this proposal.

Primary elections



A. Eligibility for Matching Payments; Amount of Entitlement



1. Complete Contributor Identifications



Treasurers of political committees, including authorized committees of Presidential candidates, are required
by 2 U.S.C. 432(i) and 434(b) to use their best efforts to obtain, maintain and report the name, address, occupation
and employer of all contributors who give over $200 per calendar year. The Commission recently issued revised rules
regarding this reporting obligation. See 58 FR 57725 (Oct. 27, 1993). During that rulemaking, two commenters suggested
revising 11 CFR 9036.2 so that Presidential primary candidates would only receive matching funds for contributions
exceeding $200 containing complete contributor information. While full contributor identifications are required
for such contributions in threshold submissions under 11 CFR 9036.1(b), they are not currently required under 11
CFR 9036.2(b)(1)(v) for additional submissions for matching funds. Accordingly, comments are requested on whether
to delete section 9036.2(b)(1)(v), thereby requiring complete contributor information for all matchable contributions
exceeding $200. In the alternative, comments are sought on only matching these contributions if committees can provide
evidence demonstrating they made their best efforts to obtain the information. Please note that neither of these
alternatives is included in the proposed regulations which follow.



2. NOCO Statements



Section 9034.5(a) of the regulations requires the candidate to submit a statement of net outstanding campaign obligations
[``NOCO''] within 15 days of his or her date of ineligibility. Section 9034.5(f)(1) also requires the candidate to
submit a revised statement of net outstanding campaign obligations with each subsequent matching payment request.
These NOCO statements provide the Commission with an indication of the campaign's financial status. The Commission
uses these statements to determine whether the candidate is entitled to receive any additional matching funds.

In some circumstances, the NOCO statements do not provide adequate information about the candidate's remaining
obligations. For example, many NOCO statements list the candidate's estimated necessary winding down costs as a
single lump sum, making it difficult for the Commission to review the cost estimate to determine whether the candidate
is entitled to receive the entire estimated amount. In addition, because several weeks now elapse between submission
of the NOCO statement and certification of the matching payments due to changes in the Treasury Department's payment
policy, the certification often does not reflect the true financial status of the committee at the time of certification.
The candidate's financial situation invariably changes during this period, and any change in the committee's net
outstanding campaign obligations should result in a change in the committee's entitlement.

The proposed rule seeks to address these problems. Section 9034.5(b) would be amended to require a breakdown of the
estimated winding down costs listed on the NOCO statement by category and time period. This breakdown would include
estimates of quarterly or monthly costs for office space rental, staff salaries, office supplies, equipment rental,
telephone expenses, postage and other mailing costs, printing, and storage from the date of the NOCO statement until
the expected termination of the committee's political activity.

The proposed rule would also require a candidate who submits a matching payment request and accompanying NOCO statement
after his or her date of ineligibility to submit an additional revised NOCO statement. This statement would be due
just before the certification date, on a date that would be published by the Commission with the dates for matching
fund submissions and matching payment certifications. The candidate would be required to prepare the statement
so that it reflects the financial status of the campaign three business days before the statement's due date. The Commission
would then use this statement to determine whether the amount of matching payments to be certified should be adjusted
to reflect a committee's changed financial situation. This would ensure that the amount certified accurately reflects
the committee's financial situation at the time of certification. The Commission welcomes comments on these proposed
rules.

B. Qualified Campaign Expenses


1. Funding General Election Expenses with Primary Funds


The Presidential Election Campaign Fund Act, the Presidential Primary Matching Payment Account Act, and Commission
regulations require that publicly funded presidential candidates use primary election funds only for expenses
incurred in connection with primary elections, and that they use general election funds only for general election
expenses. 26 U.S.C. 9002(11), 9032(9); 11 CFR 9002.11, 9032.9. These requirements are tied to the overall primary
and general election expenditure limits set forth at 2 U.S.C. 441a (b) and (c), and at 26 U.S.C. 9004(b) and 9034(b).
See also 11 CFR 9004.1, 9004.3(b), 9034.1(d). Therefore, once a primary candidate is the clear and projected winner
of the primary election process and begins to campaign by addressing issues and comparability with other projected
general election candidates, certain costs incurred prior to the candidate's primary election date of ineligibility
are considered general election expenses that are reimbursable by the general election committee.
The Commission is seeking comments on whether the pertinent rules should provide more specific guidance on how certain
expenditures might be characterized. Questions have arisen in recent election cycles as to whether certain primary
funding was in fact used to benefit the general election. As additional states choose to hold their state nominating
conventions or primary elections early in the election cycle, the major parties' selection of a nominee is increasingly
likely to be decided long before the convention. Once a candidate has secured enough delegates to win the nomination,
the focus of the campaign may turn in large part to the general election. However, the Commission realizes that it can
be difficult to distinguish between legitimate primary campaign activity, such as that which is designed to lock
up delegates, or is related to the primary outcomes or pre-convention preparation, from activity that is geared towards
the general election.
The Commission is considering several alternatives that would provide additional guidance to presidential campaign
committees on how such expenditures are treated. The Commission welcomes comments on any of these approaches, as
well as suggestions on other ways available to deal with this situation.
One question concerns depreciation of primary committee assets in this situation. Section 9034.5(c)(1) currently
permits a standard 40% depreciation of capital assets held by a primary campaign committee, except for items acquired
after the committee's DOI. A higher depreciation is allowed for a particular item if the committee demonstrates through
documentation that the asset's fair market value is lower.
Under certain circumstances, however, the 40% figure may be overly generous. For example, if the primary committee
purchases a $20,000 computer system shortly before the primary election DOI and then sells it to the general election
committee, allowing the primary campaign to assume a 40% depreciation would result in a nearly $8,000 subsidy from
the primary to the general election committee. The Commission is therefore proposing that paragraph 9034.5(c)(1)
be amended to clarify that a higher, lower, or no depreciation may be claimed in appropriate cases.

Current 11 CFR 9034.4(b)(3) states that expenses incurred after a candidate's primary election DOI are not considered
qualified campaign expenses, except for certain winding down costs and costs incurred in continuing to campaign.
See 11 CFR 9034.4(a)(3). The Commission is considering whether this language should be expanded to clarify that,
consistent with 26 U.S.C. 9002(11)(B) and 11 CFR 9002.11(b), goods received prior to the DOI that are used for the general
election, and pre-DOI services that provide a benefit to the general election campaign, are considered qualified
campaign expenses for the general election and not for the primary election.

One approach would be to allocate the cost of each capital asset between the primary and the general election, based
on when the asset was acquired and the time the committee began to focus on the general election. This could be difficult
to administer, however, requiring as it would an asset-by-asset determination.

Another approach would be to include a presumption in section 9034.4(b)(3) that capital assets purchased during
a certain period before the first day of the candidate's party's national nominating convention are general election
assets. Section 9034.4(b)(3) of the proposed rules would set a presumed cutoff date of 60 days before the start of the
candidate's party's national nominating convention. However, the Commission is requesting comments on whether
some other cutoff point would better serve this purpose, as well as whether a uniform cutoff date, such as June 15 preceding
the national nominating convention, would be more appropriate. If so, what date should be selected? If a more flexible
approach is desirable, how should the applicable timeframe be computed? Should it be the date of the candidate's party's
last state primary election?

Whatever approach is adopted, the presumption would be rebuttable based on each candidate's particular circumstances.
If a candidate could demonstrate that he or she was still largely involved in campaigning for the nomination after
the presumptive cutoff date, that date could be moved back. In the case of a brokered convention, several candidates
might be found to have focused nearly exclusively on securing the nomination until the date during the convention
on which one in fact did so. Conversely, a candidate who became the clear and projected nominee of a party early in the
presidential election year might be found to have made expenditures in connection with the general election well
in advance of the designated cutoff date.

<PARENT> FR941006-1-00015 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In determining how expenditures made as of a certain date should be characterized, the Commission might consider
such information as how many delegates the candidate has, the number of candidates who received votes in each of the
candidate's party's most recent state primary elections or other state nominating procedures, the relative percentages
received by each candidate in these proceedings, and whether the candidate had begun to focus on issues raised by other
projected general election candidates and his or her comparability with such candidates. The Commission welcomes
suggestions of other factors that could prove helpful in making this determination.
Another question involves local campaign offices that continue to operate after a state's primary election or other
nominating procedure is over, when the office is no longer focused on securing the nomination in that state. The Commission
is proposing a rebuttable presumption that a local campaign office that remains open more than 30 days after a state's
primary election, or the close of any other nomination process in that state, is operating in support of the general
election campaign. The Commission welcomes comments on this approach, as well as suggestions for others that would
result in a fair attribution of these expenditures.
This situation becomes more complicated when applied to supplies and materials. The Commission is therefore seeking
comments on how such items should be treated. One approach would be to require an inventory of everything on hand, including
campaign materials but perhaps excluding items below a certain threshold amount, as of the DOI. These items would
then be sold to the general election at cost. If there was no inventory, everything purchased or delivered in the last
60 days before the DOI would be presumed to be a general election expense. The Commission notes that this approach could
be difficult to verify, since the inventory would be at a point in time which could not be recreated. Nevertheless,
it is important that primary election funds not be used to subsidize the general election.
Finally, the Commission welcomes comments on how other foods and/or services, such as campaign-related travel and
media expenses, should be treated in this context. For example, if a candidate travels to a state where the primary
has already been held, some of the travel could be for fundraising to help obtain the nomination, but some or all might
be for general election purposes.
Nothing in this NPRM is intended to revise the Commission's ``continuing to campaign'' rules set forth at 11 CFR 9034.4(a)(3)(ii).
These rules allow a candidate who is no longer eligible for matching funds but is still seeking the nomination to use
post-DOI contributions to pursue his or her primary campaign_a different situation than that addressed in this proposal.
The Commission recognizes that, under unusual circumstances, a candidate who appears to have been eliminated early
in the election cycle may later secure the nomination. As is currently true, these special situations would be evaluated
on a case-by-case basis.
Conversely, a candidate who appears to have secured the nomination early in the campaign may in fact fail to obtain
it, and thus not qualify for general election funding. The Commission is less concerned with this possibility, as
the focus of this portion of the rulemaking is on how certain expenditures should be treated by those candidates who
go on to become the convention's nominee.


2. Convention Expenses of Ineligible Candidates


The Commission is seeking comments on whether expenses incurred by losing primary election candidates in attending
their party's national nominating convention should be considered a qualified campaign expense under 11 CFR 9032.9.
Such attendance could provide a defeated candidate the opportunity to continue to fundraise, perhaps to campaign
for the vice presidential nomination, and to maintain contact with his or her pledged convention delegates.
The Commission notes, however, that qualified campaign expenses are defined in the Presidential Primary Matching
Payment Account Act at 26 U.S.C. 9032(9)(A) as those ``incurred by a candidate, or by his authorized committee, in
connection with his campaign for nomination for election.'' This definition seemingly does not apply to those no
longer seeking the presidential nomination. Also, the term ``candidate'' is defined as ``an individual who seeks
nomination for election to be President of the United States,'' and thus does not on its face include those seeking
the vice presidential nomination. 26 U.S.C. 9032(2). Further, in recent years presidential candidates have increasingly
announced their vice presidential selections in advance (at times well in advance) of the national convention. Finally,
under 11 CFR 9034.1(b), candidates can already count fundraising expenses incurred following their Date of Ineligibility
(DOI), including those incurred at a national nominating convention, as qualified campaign expenses.

<PARENT> FR941006-1-00015 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Commission is also concerned about potential practical problems with this approach. For example, if a candidate's
DOI occurs early in the election cycle, there will be a substantial gap between the DOI and the date of the convention.
The purpose of the 10% rule (26 U.S.C. 9033(c)(1)(B); 11 CFR 9033.5(b)), under which a candidate becomes ineligible
for additional funding on the 30th day following the date of the second consecutive primary election in which he or
she receives less than 10% of the popular vote, is to discontinue funding of candidates who have not received substantial
support following their initial establishment of eligibility. See 122 Congressional Record S.3787 (daily ed. March
18, 1976) (remarks of Sen. Taft).

A related concern is that, under these circumstances, the Commission may be well along in the audit of a candidate's
campaign by the time the convention opens. Providing an additional matching fund period to such candidates could
substantially complicate the audit process.

If this approach were to be adopted, the Commission welcomes comments on who should be covered by the new provision,
and during what timeframe it should apply. Should this be limited to expenses incurred by the candidate, or the candidate
and his or her immediate family, or should it also include campaign staff? If the latter, should such staff be limited,
either by number or position held in the campaign? The Commission notes that, where a number of candidates sought the
nomination, the expenses of these candidates, their families, and accompanying campaign staff could be substantial.

Please note that the draft rules that follow do not include any specific regulatory language on this point.



C. Audits



1. Calculation of Repayment Ratio



Under section 9038.2(b)(2), committees are required to repay amounts received from the matching payment account
that are used for non-qualified campaign expenses. The amount of any repayment sought under section 9038.2(b)(2)
bears the same ratio to the total amount of non-qualified campaign expenses as the amount of matching funds certified
to the candidate bears to the candidate's total deposits, as of the candidate's date of ineligibility. Repayment
determinations under this section include all non-qualified campaign expenses paid between the committee's date
of inception and the point when committee accounts no longer contain matching funds. Thus, the repayment amount is
calculated by multiplying the total non-qualified campaign expenses by the repayment ratio, as determined on the
candidate's date of ineligibility.

However, this section does not serve its intended purpose when applied to a candidate that receives a significant
amount of matching payments after his or her date of ineligibility. Section 9038.2(b)(2) does not take into account
private contributions received by the candidate after his or her date of ineligibility. Consequently, when this
section is applied to a candidate that receives a significant amount of private contributions after that date, it
generates a repayment amount that does not accurately reflect the ratio of matching payments to private contributions
actually received by that candidate during the courts of the campaign.

Similarly, section 9038.2(b)(2) is inconsistent with the statute when applied to a candidate who does not receive
matching payments until after his or her date of ineligibility. Section 9038(b)(2) of the Matching Payment Account
Act requires a candidate who uses public funds for non-qualified campaign expenses to repay a portion of the public
funds he or she received to the Treasury. However, when section 9038.2(b)(2) of the regulations is applied to a candidate
who does not receive matching payments until after his or her date of ineligibility, the rule arguably generates a
repayment ratio of zero even if the candidate incurred numerous non-qualified campaign expenses. Thus, under the
regulations, the candidate would not be required to repay any of those funds, even though the statute specifically
requires repayment in this situation.

Section 9038.2(b)(2)(iii) of the proposed rules contains two proposed revisions that would address these situations.
The first proposal would change the date for determining the candidate's repayment ratio from the date of ineligibility
to 90 days after the date of ineligibility. A ratio determined on the later date would take into account most of the post-DOI
private contributions received by the candidate. As a result, the ratio will more accurately reflect the amount of
matching payments and private contributions actually received. This approach would also produce an accurate repayment
ratio and repayment amount for those candidates that do not receive any matching payments until after their date of
ineligibility. As a result, this proposed revision would address both of the situations described above.

The second proposal, which is set out in paragraph (A) of this section, would take a narrower approach. Under this proposal,
the Commission would treat all matching funds certified in response to matching payment submissions received as
of the candidate's date of ineligibility as though they were certified as of the candidate's date of ineligibility.
Treating these funds as though they were certified pre-DOI would allow the Commission to use these funds to calculate
the repayment ratio, resulting in a ratio of an amount greater than zero that reflects the mix of public funds and private
contributions actually received. The Commission could then use this ratio to determine the amount that the candidate
is required to repay under section 9038(b)(2) of the statute.

<PARENT> FR941006-1-00015 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Commission welcomes comments on which approach would be preferable. Please note that, if the first approach is
adopted, paragraph (A) will be unnecessary, and therefore will not be included in the final rules. If paragraph (A)
is adopted, the candidate's repayment ratio will continue to be determined as of the candidate's date of ineligibility,
as it is under the current rules.

In an effort to improve clarity, the proposed rules would also break this section down in to separate paragraphs. The
Commission welcomes comments on the proposed changes to section 9038.2(b)(2).



D. Part 9039 Investigations



1. Commission Actions Following Part 9039 Investigations



The Commission's review and investigatory authority for administering the matching fund program is set forth at
26 U.S.C. 9039(b). In carrying out these responsibilities, the Commission must perform a continuing review of candidate
and committee reports and submissions, and other relevant information. The implementing regulations are found
at 11 CFR part 9039.

For the most part the Commission's review is routine, carried out in accordance with the eligibility, audit and repayment
procedures contained elsewhere in the regulations. 26 U.S.C. 9039(b) and its implementing regulations provide
authority to conduct audits and investigations outside of the audits required under 26 U.S.C. 9038 and 11 CFR part
9038. Most of these cases have involved issues relating to a candidate's continuing eligibility or the amount of his
or her entitlement during the course of the campaign, although they could also involve a post-election inquiry.

Section 9039.3 of the regulations describes how examinations, audits and investigations are conducted in these
inquiries. The Commission is considering whether to provide in the final rules a fuller explanation of actions that
may be taken at the conclusion of any such action. Please note that there is no specific language in the text of the proposed
rules on this point.

Under this approach, if the Commission decided to take no further action in a 9039 case, the candidate(s) and committee(s)
involved would be so notified. If the Commission decided that there was a sufficient basis to take further action,
such action would follow as closely as possible the procedures already in place for comparable situations. See e.g.,
11 CFR 9033.10. For example, a post election inquiry could lead to either an additional repayment determination,
in which case the procedures set forth at 11 CFR 9038.2 for making and challenging repayment determinations would
apply, or a 2 U.S.C. 437g enforcement action.

The Commission welcomes comments on these proposed amendments to 11 CFR part 9039.



General Elections



A. General Election Legal and Accounting Compliance Costs



On March 1, 1994, the Commission received a Petition for Rulemaking from the Center for Responsive Politics requesting
that the Commission repeal its rules providing for the use of privately-financed general election legal and accounting
compliance funds [``GELAC''] in Presidential campaigns. Specifically, the petitioner seeks repeal of 11 CFR 100.8(b)(15)
(last two sentences), 106.2(b)(2)(iii) (last sentence), 9002.11(b)(5), 9003.3(a), and 9035.1(c)(1). The petition
argues that the Commission's rules undermine the ability of the public financing laws to achieve the objective of
reducing the influence of large contributions in Presidential elections. It charges that these regulations permit
evasion of the prohibition on accepting contributions to defray qualified campaign expenses established by the
Presidential Election Campaign Fund Act. 26 U.S.C. 9003(b). Furthermore, the petition claims that the Commission's
regulations violate the spending limits established by the FECA. 2 U.S.C. 441a.

On March 30, 1994, the Commission published a Notice of Availability seeking statements in support of or in opposition
to the petition. 59 FR 14794 (March 30, 1994). In response to the Notice, four statements have been received from the
Internal Revenue Service, Public Citizen, Common Cause, and a joint comment from the Democratic National Committee
and the Republican National Committee. Two were supportive while one opposed the reversal of the Commission's long
standing policies regarding legal and accounting costs. The Internal Revenue Service found no conflict with the
Internal Code or the Regulations thereunder.

The Commission is continuing to consider the petition as part of this rulemaking and seeks further comment on abolishing
the GELAC. The Commission is also seeking evidence either supporting or refuting the petitioner's claim that the
privately-funded GELAC undermines the public financing of general election campaigns by allowing the actuality
and the appearance of improper influence in Presidential elections. Absent evidence supporting the petitioner's
claim, the Commission would be reluctant to completely eliminate the GELAC because Presidential campaigns would
need to devote some of their public funds for compliance expenses, instead of using public moneys for campaign expenses.
The result could be significant difficulty in complying with the public financing statutes and the FECA. The GELAC
is also used to make repayments, which would need to be funded from other sources. Moreover, the elimination of monetary
contributions of $1000 or less for compliance purposes could force some committees to turn to much larger in-kind
donation of legal and accounting services to ensure that their compliance obligations are satisfied. See 2 U.S.C.
431(8)(B)(ix) and (9)(B)(vii).

Accordingly, comments are requested on several alternative revisions to the GELAC. For example, should the amount
raised and spent for compliance costs be limited to a fixed percentage of the general election spending limit? If so,
what amount or percentage would be sufficient to ensure that adequate amounts are available for meeting compliance
obligations? Please note that this approach is not included in the proposed rules which Follow.

The petitioners and one commenter also challenge the appropriateness of allowing fundraising costs for the GELAC
to be paid for by the GELAC on the ground these expenses are campaign expenses that should be subject to the spending
limits. The current rules permit fundraising costs to be paid by the GELAC because it would not be appropriate to sue
public funds to solicit private contributions that are used solely for legal and accounting compliance purposes.
However, the Commission is concerned that fundraising activities for the GELAC could be used to generate electoral
support for the candidate's campaign, and if so, should be treated as qualified campaign expenses. Accordingly,
comments are sought on whether to continue to permit the GELAC to pay the entire amount of these costs, or whether a fixed
percentage of GELAC fundraising costs should be paid by the general election campaign committee. Splitting the costs
would recognize that solicitations and other activities conducted to raised GELAC funds have a campaign-related
component. Comments are sought as to the appropriate percentage that should be paid from general election funds.
Please note that this approach is not included in the proposed rules which follow.

The Commission is also considering modifying section 9003.3(a)(1)(i)(A), which currently requires solicitations
to clearly state that the contributions are solicited for the GELAC. A new sentence would also require solicitations
to state that contributions to the GELAC may not be used for campaign purposes.

Please note that the provisions regarding predesignations and transfer of primary funds to the GELAC in paragraphs
(a)(1) (ii)-(iv) would be reorganized.

Current paragraphs (a)(2)(i) (A) through (H) of section 9003.3 set forth the permissible sues of GELAC funds. The
Petition for Rulemaking urged the Commission to delete current paragraph (H) allowing GELAC funds to be used to pay
unreimbursed costs of providing transportation for the Secret Service and national security staff. Although this
provisions is included in the attached proposed rules, the Commission seeks further comment on whether it is appropriate
to use GELAC funds for this purpose. Please note that GELAC funds may not be used to pay transition costs (

cf.

 AO 1980-97); legal defense fund expenses (

cf.

 AO 1979-37); legal expenses not related to ensuring compliance, such as contract litigation or electoral college
expenses; and winding down expenses that are not for legal and accounting compliance purposes.

In addition, the Commission proposes reducing from 70% to 50% the standard amount that the GELAC may pay for computer-related
costs, and the corresponding exclusion from the spending limits. See 11 CFR 9003.3 (a)(2)(ii)(A), (b)(6) and (c)(6).
The GELAC is relatively small in comparison to the publicly funded general election account. Much of the computer
costs are for basic accounting purposes, which the campaign committee would need to perform regardless of the need
to comply with the campaign financing laws. Please note, however, that committees would still be able to deduct a higher
amount if they can show that their computer-related compliance costs are higher.

Section 9003.3(a)(2)(iv) would be modified slightly to clarify that funds remaining in the GELAC may only be used
to pay debts remaining from the primary or for other lawful purposes if all GELAC expenses have been paid. Finally the
Commission is proposing to revise two citations contained in 11 CFR 9003.3(a)(2)(iii). The first sentence of this
paragraph currently refers to paragraphs 9003.3(a)(2)(i) (A) through (E). This would be updated to read, ``11 CFR
9003.3(a)(2)(i) (A) through (F) and (H).'' Also, the citation to paragraph 9003.3(a)(2)(i)(F) in the second sentence
should instead refer paragraph 9003.3(a)(2)(i)(G).



B. Gains on the Use of Public Funds



Section 9004.5 of the Commission's regulations allows a committee to invest public funds or use them in other ways
to generate income, provided that an amount equal to the net income derived from those investments, minus any taxes
paid, is repaid to the Treasury. Section 9007.2(b)(4) also lists the receipt of any income as a result of investment
or other use of payments from the fund pursuant to 11 CFR 9004.5 as one of the basis for requiring repayment. These provisions
seek to ensure that any income received through these use of public funds benefits the public financing system.

The proposed rules would indicate that section 9004.5 applies to any use of public funds that results in come to the
committee, regardless of whether the committee engaged in that use with the intention of generating income. The proposed
rules also contain a conforming amendment to section 9007.2(b)(4), which would indicate that income on investment
or other use of payments from the Fund must be repaid to the Treasury. The Comission notes that if a committee loses an
item that is insured, and the insurance proceeds exceeds the cost of replacing the item, such excess would be considered
income for the purposes of proposed sections 9004.5 and 9007.2(b)(4).

These provisions are not meant to require repayment of income that qualifies as exempt function income under section
527(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. 527(c)(3), such as receipts from fundraising activities. The Commission
welcomes comments on these proposed revisions.



Miscellaneous and Technical Amendments



In the interests of clarity, the Commission is proposing to add a comma in the last sentence of 11 CFR 9003.1(b)(4),
and in the second sentence of 11 CFR 9033.1(b)(5). Both paragraphs concern candidate and committee agreements to
furnish certain documentation to the Commission.

Current 11 CFR 9033.4(b) states that, in evaluating a candidate's matching funds submission, the Commission may
consider other relevant information in its possession, including but not limited to past actions of the candidate
in an earlier campaign. This provision was held to exceed the Commission's statutory authority in 

LaRouche

 v. 

FEC,

 996 F.2d 1263 (D.C. Cir. 1993), 

cert. denied

 114 S. Ct. 550. The Commission is therefore proposing to delete this paragraph from the rule.



Conclusion



The Commission welcomes comments on the foregoing proposed amendments to the public financing regulations, the
issues raised in this notice, and on other aspects of the public financing process that could be addressed in these
regulations. No final decision has been made by the Commission concerning any of the proposals contained in this Notice.



Certification of No Effect Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. Section 605(b) (Regulatory Flexibility Act)



The attached proposed rules, if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities. The basis for this certification is that few, if any, small entities will be affected by these proposed
rules. Further, any small entities affected are already required to comply with the requirements of the Presidential
Election Campaign Fund Act and the Presidential Primary Matching Payment Account Act in these areas.

(F) To defray the cost of producing, delivering and explaining the computerized information and materials provided
pursuant to 11 CFR 9003.6 and explaining the operation of the computer system's software; 

(G) To make a loan to an account established pursuant to 11 CFR 9003.4 to defray qualified campaign expenses incurred
prior to the expenditure report period or prior to receipt of federal funds, provided that the amounts so loaned are
restored to the legal and accounting compliance fund; and 

(H) To defray unreimbursed costs incurred in providing transportation and services for the Secret Service and national
security staff pursuant to 11 CFR 9004.6. 

(ii) (A) Expenditures for payroll (including payroll taxes), overhead and computer services, a portion of which
are related to ensuring compliance with title 2 of the United States Code and chapter 95 of title 26 of the United States
Code, shall be initially paid from the candidate's federal fund account under 11 CFR 9005.2 and may be later reimbursed
by the compliance fund. For purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(i)(B) of this section, a candidate may use contributions
to the compliance fund to reimburse his or her federal fund account an amount equal to 10% of the payroll and overhead
expenditures of his or her national campaign headquarters and state offices. Overhead expenditures include, but
are not limited to rent, utilities, office equipment, furniture, supplies and all telephone charges except for telephone
charges related to a special use such as voter registration and get out the vote efforts. In addition, a candidate may
use contributions to the compliance fund to reimburse his or her federal fund account an amount equal to 50% of the costs
(other than payroll) associated with computer services. Such costs include but are not limited to rental and maintenance
of computer equipment, data entry services not performed by committee personnel, and related supplies. If the candidate
wishes to claim a larger compliance exemption for payroll or overhead expenditures, the candidate shall establish
allocation percentages for each individual who spends all or a portion of his or her time to perform duties which are
considered necessary to ensure compliance with title 2 of the United States Code or chapter 95 of title 26 of the United
States Code. The candidate shall keep detailed records to support the derivation of each percentage. Such records
shall indicate which duties are considered compliance and the percentage of time each person spends on such activity.
If the candidate wishes to claim a larger compliance exemption for costs associated with computer services, the candidates
shall establish allocation percentages for each computer function that is considered necessary, in whole or in part,
to ensure compliance within 2 U.S.C. 431 

et seq

., and 26 U.S.C. 9001 

et seq

. The allocation shall be based on a reasonable estimate of the costs associated with each computer function, such
as the costs for data entry services performed by persons other than committee personnel and processing time. The
candidate shall keep detailed records to support such calculations. The records shall indicate which computer functions
are considered compliance-related and shall reflect which costs are associated with each computer function. The
Commission's Financial Control and Compliance Manual for General Election Candidates Receiving Public Funding
contains some accepted alternative allocation methods for determining the amount of salaries and overhead expenditures
that may be considered exempt compliance costs. 

(B) Reimbursement from the compliance fund may be made to the separate account maintained for federal funds under
11 CFR 9005.2 for legal and accounting compliance services disbursements that are initially paid from the separate
federal funds account. Such reimbursement must be made prior to any final repayment determination by the Commission
pursuant to 11 CFR 9007.2. Any amounts so reimbursed to the federal fund account may not subsequently be transferred
back to the legal and accounting compliance fund. 

(iii) Amounts paid from this account for the purposes permitted by paragraphs (a)(2)(i) (A) through (F) and (H) of
this section shall not be subject to the expenditure limits of 2 U.S.C. 221a(b) and 11 CFR 110.8. (See also 11 CFR 100.8(b)(15).)
When the proceeds of loans made in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(i)(G) of this section are expended on qualified
campaign expenses, such expenditures shall count against the candidate's expenditure limit.

(iv) Contributions to or funds deposited in the legal and accounting compliance fund may not be used to retire debts
remaining from the Presidential primaries, except that, if after payment of all expenses set out in paragraph (a)(2)(i)
of this section, there are excess campaign funds, such funds may be used for any purpose permitted under 2 U.S.C. 439a
and 11 CFR Part 113, including payment of primary election debts.
(3) 

Deposit and disclosure.
(i) Amounts received pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be deposited and maintained in an account
separate from that described in 11 CFR 9005.2 and shall not be commingled with any money paid to the candidate by the
Secretary pursuant to 11 CFR 9005.2.
(ii) The receipts to and disbursements from this account shall be reported in a separate report in accordance with
11 CFR 9006.1(b)(2). All contributions made to this account shall be recorded in accordance with 11 CFR 102.9. Disbursements
made from this account shall be documented in the same manner provided in 11 CFR 9003.5.
(b) Contributions to defray qualified campaign expenses_major party candidates.

expenses to the extent necessary to make up any deficiency in payments received from the Fund due to the application
of 11 CFR 9005.2(b).

under 11 CFR 9005.2. Disbursements from this account shall be made only to defray qualified campaign expenses and
to defray the cost of soliciting contributions to such account. All disbursements from this account shall be documented
in accordance with 11 CFR 9003.5 and shall be reported in accordance with 11 CFR 9006.1.
(3) A candidate may make transfers to this account from his or her legal and accounting compliance fund.
(4) The contributions received under this section shall be subject to the limitations and prohibitions of 11 CFR Parts
110, 114 and 115 and shall be aggregated with all contributions made by the same persons to the candidate's legal and
accounting compliance fund under paragraph (a) of this section for the purposes of such limitations.
(5) Any costs incurred for soliciting contributions to this account shall not be considered expenditures to the extent
that the aggregate of such costs does not exceed 20 percent of the expenditure limitation under 11 CFR 9003.2(a)(1).
These costs shall, however, be reported as disbursements in accordance with 11 CFR Part 104 and 11 CFR 9006.1. For purposes
of this section, a candidate may exclude from the expenditure limitation an amount equal to 10% of the payroll (including
payroll taxes) and overhead expenditures of his or her national campaign headquarters and state offices as exempt
fundraising costs.

431 et seq. 

and 26 U.S.C. 9001 

et seq. 

shall not count against the candidate's expenditure limitation. Such costs include the cost of producing, delivering
and explaining the computerized information and materials provided pursuant to 11 CFR 9003.6 and explaining the
operation of the computer system's software. For purposes of this section, a candidate may exclude from the expenditure
limitation an amount equal to 10% of the employee payroll (including payroll taxes) and overhead expenditures of
his or her national campaign headquarters and state offices. In addition, a candidate may exclude from the expenditure
limitation an amount equal to 50% of the costs (other than payroll) associated with computer services.
(i) For purposes of this paragraph, overhead costs include, but are not limited to, rent, utilities, office equipment,
furniture, supplies and all telephone charges except for telephone charges related to a special use such as voter
registration and get out the vote efforts.
(ii) For purposes of this paragraph, costs associated with computer services include, but are not limited to, rental
and maintenance of computer equipment, data entry services not performed by committee personnel, and related supplies.
(7) If the candidate wishes to claim a larger compliance or fundraising exemption under paragraph (b)(5) or (b)(6)
of this section for employee payroll and overhead expenditures, the candidate shall establish allocation percentages
for each individual who spends all or a portion of his or her time to perform duties which are considered compliance
or fundraising. The candidate shall keep detailed records to support the derivation of each percentage. Such records
shall indicate which duties are considered compliance or fundraising and the percentage of time each person spends
on such activity.

(2) For a trip which includes campaign-related and non-campaign related stops, that portion of the cost of the trip
allocable to campaign activity shall be a qualified campaign expense and a reportable expenditure. Such portion
shall be determined by calculating what the trip would have cost from the point of origin of the trip to the first campaign-related
stop and from the stop through each subsequent campaign-related stop to the point of origin. If any campaign activity,
other than incidental contacts, is conducted at a stop, that stop shall be considered campaign-related. Campaign
activity includes soliciting, making, or accepting contributions, and expressly advocating the election or defeat
of any candidate. Other factors, including the setting, timing and statements or expressions of the purpose of an
event, the substance of the remarks or speech made, and the audience, will also be considered in determining whether
a stop is campaign-related.
(3) For each trip, an itinerary shall be prepared and such itinerary shall be made available for Commission inspection.

case of travel to a city served by regularly scheduled coach airline service, but not regularly scheduled first class
airline service; or
(C) The commercial charter rate for a comparable airplane (in terms of size, model and make), in the case of travel to
a city not served by a regularly scheduled commercial airline service.
(ii) If a government airplane is flown to a campaign-related stop where it will pick up passengers, or from a campaign-related
stop where it left off passengers, the candidate's authorized committee shall pay the appropriate government entity
an amount equal to the amount required under paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section for one passenger plus costs for fuel
and crew.
(iii) If any individual, including a candidate, uses a government conveyance, other than an airplane, for campaign-related
travel, the candidate's authorized committee shall pay the appropriate government entity an amount equal to the
commercial rental rate for a comparable conveyance, in terms of size, model and make.
(iv) If any individual, including a candidate, uses accommodations, including lodging and meeting rooms, during
campaign-related travel, and the accommodations are paid for by a government entity, the candidate's authorized
committee shall pay the appropriate government entity an amount equal to the usual and normal charge for the accommodations,
and shall maintain documentation supporting the amount paid.

paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section, the committee shall maintain documentation of fuel and crew costs.

(6) Travel expenses of a candidate's spouse and family when accompanying the candidate on campaign-related travel
may be treated as qualified campaign expenses and reportable expenditures. If the spouse or family members conduct
campaign-related activities, their travel expenses shall be qualified campaign expenses and reportable expenditures.

(7) If any individual, including a candidate, incurs expenses for campaign-related travel, other than by use of government
conveyance or accommodations, an amount equal to that portion of the actual cost of the conveyance or accommodations
which is allocable to all passengers, including the candidate, who are traveling for campaign purposes shall be a
qualified campaign expense and shall be reported by the committee as an expenditure.

(i) If the trip is by charter, the actual cost for each passenger shall be determined by dividing the total operating
cost for the charter by the total number of passengers transported. The amount which is a qualified campaign expense
and a reportable expenditure shall be calculated in accordance with the formula set forth at 11 CFR 9004.7(b)(2) on
the basis of the actual cost per passenger multiplied by the number of passengers traveling for campaign purposes.

(ii) If the trip is by non-charter commercial transportation, the actual cost shall be calculated in accordance with
the formula set forth at 11 CFR 9004.7(b)(2) on the basis of the commercial fare. Such actual cost shall be a qualified
campaign expense and a reportable expenditure.

 9034.4 

Use of contributions and matching payments.



(a) 

Qualified campaign expenses

_

(1) 

General.

 Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, all contributions received by an individual from the date
he or she becomes a candidate and all matching payments received by the candidate shall be used only to defray qualified
campaign expenses or to repay loans or otherwise restore funds (other than contributions which were received and
expended to defray qualified campaign expenses), which were used to defray qualified campaign expenses.

(2) 

Testing the waters.

 Even though incurred prior to the date an individual becomes a candidate, payments made in accordance with 11 CFR 100.8(b)(1)
for the purpose of determining whether an individual should become a candidate shall be considered qualified campaign
expenses if the individual subsequently becomes a candidate and shall count against that candidate's limits under
2 U.S.C. 441a(b).

(3) 

Winding down costs.

(i) Costs associated with the termination of political activity, such as the costs of complying with the post election
requirements of the Act and other necessary administrative costs associated with winding down the campaign, including
office space rental, staff salaries, and office supplies shall be considered qualified campaign expenses. A candidate
may receive and use matching funds for these purposes either after he or she has notified the Commission in writing
of his or her withdrawal from the campaign for nomination or after the date of the party's nominating convention, if
he or she has not withdrawn before the convention.

(ii) If the candidate has become ineligible due to the operation of 11 CFR 9033.5(b),he or she may only receive matching
funds to defray costs incurred before the candidate's date of ineligibility, for goods and services to be received
before the date of ineligibility and for which written arrangement or commitment was made on or before the candidate's
date of ineligibility, until the candidate is eligible to receive winding down costs under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of
this section.

(iii) For purposes of the expenditure limitations set forth in 11 CFR 9035.1, 100% of salary, overhead and computer
expenses incurred after a candidate's date of ineligibility may be treated as exempt legal and accounting compliance
expenses beginning with the first full reporting period after the candidate's date of ineligibility. For candidates
who continue to campaign or re-establish eligibility, this paragraph shall not apply to expenses incurred during
the period between the date of ineligibility and the date on which the candidate either re-establishes eligibility
or ceases to continue to campaign.

(4) Taxes.

 Federal income taxes paid by the committee on non-exempt function income, such as interest, dividends and sale of
property, shall be considered qualified campaign expenses. These expenses shall not, however, count against the
state or overall expenditure limits of 11 CFR 9035.1(a).

(5) 

Gifts and monetary bonuses.

 Gifts and monetary bonuses for committee employees, consultants and volunteers in recognition for campaign-related
activities or services shall be considered qualified campaign expenses, provided that the gifts do not exceed $150
total per individual, and provided that the total for all gifts and monetary bonuses (except bonus arrangements provided
for in advance in an employment or consulting contract) does not exceed $20,000.

(b) 

Non-qualified campaign expenses

_

(1) 

General.

 The following are examples of disbursements that are not qualified campaign expenses.



* * * * *



(3) 

Post-ineligibility expenditures.

 Any expenses incurred after a candidate's date of ineligibility, as determined under 11 CFR 9033.5, are not qualified
campaign expenses except to the extent permitted under 11 CFR 9034.4(a)(3). Any expenses incurred before the candidate's
date of ineligibility for goods and services to be received after the candidate's date of ineligibility are not qualified
campaign expenses. In addition, any expenses incurred before the candidate's date of ineligibility for goods and
services to be received after the candidate's date of ineligibility, or for property, services, or facilities used
to benefit the candidate's general election campaign, are not qualified campaign expenses. For purposes of this
paragraph, it is presumed that capital assets delivered within 60 days of the first day of the candidate's party's
national nominating convention are general election assets; and that a local campaign office that remains open more
than 30 days after a state's primary election or the close of any other nomination process in that state is operating
in support of the general election campaign.



* * * * *



(8) 

Negligent Handling of Public Funds.

 The cost of items that are lost or misplaced due to negligence shall not be considered a qualified campaign expense.
Factors in making this determination shall include, but not be limited to, whether the committee demonstrates that
it made conscientious efforts to safeguard the missing equipment; the type of equipment involved; the number of items
that were lost; and the value of the lost equipment as a percentage of the total value of the equipment leased or owned
by the committee.

22. Section 9034.5 would be amended by revising paragraphs (b), (c)(1), and (f) to read as follows:



 9034.5 

Net outstanding campaign obligations.



* * * * *



(b) 

Liabilities.



(1) The amount submitted as the total of outstanding campaign obligations under paragraph (a)(1) of this section
shall not include any accounts payable for nonqualified campaign expenses nor any amounts determined or anticipated
to be required a repayment under 11 CFR part 9038 or any amounts paid to secure a surety bond under 11 CFR 9038.5.

(2) The amount submitted as estimated necessary winding down costs under paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be
broken down by expenses category and quarterly or monthly time period. This breakdown shall include estimated costs
for office space rental, staff salaries, office supplies, equipment rental, telephone expenses, postage and other
mailing costs, printing and storage. The breakdown shall estimate the costs that will be incurred in each category
from the time the statement is submitted until the expected termination of the committee's political activity.

(c)(1) 

Capital assets,

 For purposes of this section, the term 

capital asset

 means any property used in the operation of the campaign whose purchase price exceeded $2000 when acquired by the committee.
Property that must be valued as capital assets under this section includes, but is not limited to, office equipment,
furniture, vehicles and fixtures acquired for use in the operation of the candidate's campaign, but does not include
property defined as ``other assets'' under 11 CFR 9034.5(c)(2). A list of all capital assets shall be maintained by
the Committee in accordance with 11 CFR 9033.11(d). The fair market value of capital assets may be considered to be
the total original cost of such items when acquired less than 40%, to account for depreciation, except that items acquired
after the date of ineligibility must be valued at their fair market value on the date acquired. If the candidate wishes
to claim a higher depreciation percentage for an item, he or she must list that capital asset on the statement separately
and demonstrate, through documentation, the fair market value of each such asset. The Commission may disallow all
or some portion of the 40% depreciation if the asset was obtained by the primary committee for use in the general election,
or falls within a presumption stated in 11 CFR 9034.4(b)(3).



* * * * *



(f)(1) The candidate shall submit a revised statement of net outstanding campaign obligations with each submission
for matching fund payments filed after the candidate's date of ineligibility. the revised statement shall reflect
the financial status of the campaign as of the close of business on the last business day preceding the date of submission
for matching funds. The revised statement shall also contain a brief explanation of each change in the committee's
assets and obligations from the previous statement.

(2) A candidate who makes a submission described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section shall also submit an additional
revised statement of net outstanding campaign obligations. This additional statement shall be due on a date to be
determined and published by the Commission, which will be before the next regularly scheduled payment date. This
statement shall reflect the financial status of the campaign as of the close of business three business days before
the due date of the statement. The revised statement shall also contain a brief explanation of each change in the committee's
assets and obligations from the previous statement.

(3) After a candidate's date of ineligibility, if the candidate does not receive the entire amount of matching funds
on a regularly scheduled payment date due to a shortfall in the matching payment account, the candidate shall also
submit a revised statement of net outstanding campaign obligations. The revised statement shall be filed on a date
to be determined and published by the Commission, which will be before the next regularly scheduled payment date.

 9034.6

Expenditures for transportation and services made available to media personnel; Reimbursements.



(a) 

General.

(1) Expenditures by an authorized committee for transportation, ground services or facilities (including air travel,
ground transportation, housing, meals, telephone service, typewriters) made available to media personnel, Secret
Service personnel or national security staff will be considered qualified campaign expenses, and, except for costs
relating to Secret Service personnel or national security staff, will be subject to the overall expenditure limitation
of 11 CFR 9035.1(a).

(2) Subject to the limitations in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, committees may seek reimbursement for these
expenses and may deduct any amounts received as reimbursements from the amount of expenditures subject to the overall
expenditure limitation of 11 CFR 9035.1(a). Expenses for which the committee receives no reimbursement will be considered
qualified campaign expenses, and, with the exception of those expenses relating to Secret Service personnel and
national security staff, will be subject to the overall expenditure limitation.

(b) Reimbursement limits.

(1) The committee may seek reimbursement of the expenses described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section from the media
representatives to whom those services were provided. The amount sought shall not exceed the media representative's
pro rata share, or a reasonable estimate of the media representative's pro rata share, of the actual cost of the transportation
and services made available by more than 10%. Any reimbursement received in excess of 110% of the actual pro rata cost
of the transportation and services made available shall be disposed of in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.
For the purposes of this section: 

(i) A media representative's pro rata share shall be calculated by dividing the total actual cost of the transportation
and services by the total number of individuals to whom such transportation and services are made available. For purposes
of this calculation, the total number of individuals shall include committee staff, media personnel, Secret Service
personnel, national security staff and any other individuals to whom such transportation and services are made available;
and 

(ii) ``Administrative costs'' shall include all costs incurred by the committee for making travel arrangements
and for seeking reimbursement, whether performed by committee staff or independent contractors.

(c) Deduction of reimbursements from expenditures subject to the overall expenditure limitation

. The committee may deduct from the amount of expenditures subject to the overall expenditure limitation of 11 CFR
9035.1(a):

(1) The amount of reimbursements received in payment for the transportation and services described in paragraph
(a) of this section, up to the actual cost of transportation and services provided; and

(2) An amount of reimbursements received representing the administrative costs incurred by the committee in providing
these services and seeking reimbursement for them, equal to:

(i) Three percent of the actual cost of transportation and services provided under this section; or

(ii) An amount in excess of 3% representing the administrative costs actually incurred by the committee, provided
that the committee is able to document that it incurred these higher administrative costs.

(d) 

Disposal of excess reimbursements

. If the committee receives reimbursements in excess of the amount deductible under paragraph (c) of this section,
it shall dispose of the excess amount in the following manner:

(1) Any reimbursement received in excess of 110% of the actual pro rata cost of the transportation and services made
available to a media representative shall be returned to the media representative.

(2) Any amount in excess of the amount deductible under paragraph (c) of this section that is not required to be returned
to the media representative under paragraph (d)(1) shall be repaid to the Treasury.

(e) 

Reporting.

 The total amount paid by an authorized committee for the cost of transportation or for ground services and facilities
shall be reported as an expenditure in accordance with 11 CFR 104.3(b)(2)(i). Any reimbursement received by such
committee for transportation or ground services and facilities shall be reported in accordance with 11 CFR 104.3(a)(3)(ix).

24. Section 9034.7 would be revised to read as follows:



 9034.7 

Allocation of Travel Expenditures.



(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of 11 CFR 106.3, expenditures for travel relating to the office of President by
any individual, including a candidate, shall, pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, be qualified
campaign expenses and be reported by the candidate's authorized committee(s) as expenditures.

(b) (1) For a trip which is entirely campaign-related, the total cost of the trip shall be a qualified campaign expense
and a reportable expenditure.

(2) For a trip which includes campaign-related and non-campaign related stops, that portion of the cost of the trip
allocable to campaign activity shall be a qualified campaign expense and a reportable expenditure. Such portion
shall be determined by calculating what the trip would have cost from the point of origin of the trip to the first campaign-related
stop and from that stop through each subsequent campaign-related stop, back to the point of origin. If any campaign
activity, other than incidental contacts, is conducted at a stop, that stop shall be considered campaign-related.
Campaign activity includes soliciting, making, or accepting contributions, and expressly advocating the election
or defeat of any candidate. Other factors, including the setting, timing and statements or expressions of the purpose
of an event, the substance of the remarks or speech made, and the audience, will also be considered in determining whether
a stop is campaign-related.

(3) For each trip, an itinerary shall be prepared and such itinerary shall be made available for Commission inspection.

(4) For trips by government conveyance or by charter, a list of all passengers on such trip, along with a designation
of which passengers are and which are not campaign-related, shall be made available for Commission inspection.

(5) (i) If any individual, including a candidate, uses a government airplane for campaign-related travel, the candidate's
authorized committee shall pay the appropriate government entity an amount equal to:

(A) The lowest unrestricted and non-discounted first class commercial air fare available for the time traveled,
in the case of travel to a city served by a regularly scheduled commercial airline service; or 

(B) The lowest unrestricted and non-discounted coach commercial air fare available for the time traveled, in the
case of travel to a city served by regularly scheduled coach airline service, but not regularly scheduled first class
airline service; or 

(C) The commercial charter rate for a comparable airplane (in terms of size, model and make), in the case of travel to
a city not served by a regularly scheduled commercial airline service.

(ii) If a government airplane is flown to a campaign-related stop where it will pick up passengers, or from a campaign-related
stop where it left off passengers, the candidates's authorized committee shall pay the appropriate government entity
an amount equal to the amount required under paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section for one passenger plus costs for fuel
and crew.

(iii) If any individual, including a candidate, uses a government conveyance, other than an airplane, for campaign-related
travel, the candidate's authorized committee shall pay the appropriate government entity an amount equal to the
commercial rental rate for a comparable conveyance, in terms of size, model and make.

(iv) If any individual, including a candidate, uses accommodations, including lodging and meeting rooms, during
campaign-related travel, and the accommodations are paid for by a government entity, the candidate's authorized
committee shall pay the appropriate government entity an amount equal to the usual and normal charge for the accommodations,
and shall maintain documentation supporting the amount paid.
(v) For travel by airplane, the committee shall maintain documentation for the lowest unrestricted nondiscounted
air fare available for the time traveled, including the airline or travel service providing that fare. For travel
by other conveyances, the committee shall maintain documentation of the commercial rental rate for a comparable
conveyance, including the provider of the conveyance and the size, model and make of the conveyance. For travel under
paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section, the committee shall maintain documentation of fuel and crew costs.
(6) Travel expenses of a candidate's spouse and family when accompanying the candidate on campaign-related travel
may be treated as qualified campaign expenses and reportable expenditures. If the spouse or family members conduct
campaign-related activities, their travel expenses will be treated as qualified campaign expenses and reportable
expenditures.
(7) If any individual, including a candidate, incurs expenses for campaign-related travel, other than by use of government
conveyance or accommodations, an amount equal to that portion of the actual cost of the conveyance or accommodations
which is allocable to all passengers, including the candidate, who are traveling for campaign purposes will be a qualified
campaign expense and shall be reported by the committee as an expenditure.
(i) If the trip is by charter, the actual cost for each passenger shall be determined by dividing the total operating
cost for the charter by the total number of passengers transported. The amount which is a qualified campaign expense
and a reportable expenditure shall be calculated in accordance with the formula set forth at 11 CFR 9034.7(b)(2) on
the basis of the actual cost per passenger multiplied by the number of passengers traveling for campaign purposes.
(ii) If the trip is by non-charter commercial transportation, the actual cost shall be calculated in accordance with
the formula set forth at 11 CFR 9034.7(b)(2) on the basis of the commercial fare. Such actual cost shall be a qualified
campaign expense and a reportable expenditure.
(8) Travel on corporate airplanes and other corporate conveyances is governed by 11 CFR 114.9(e).

Audit.



* * * * *



(f)(1) 

Sampling. 

In conducting an audit of contributions pursuant to this section, the Commission may utilize generally accepted
sampling techniques to quantify, in whole or in part, the dollar value of related audit findings. A projection of the
total amount of violations based on apparent violations identified in such a sample may become the basis, in whole
or in part, or any audit finding.

(2) A committee in responding to a sample-based finding concerning excessive or prohibited contributions shall
respond only to the specific sample items used to make the projection. If the committee demonstrates that any errors
found among the sample items were not excessive or prohibited contributions; were timely refunded, reattributed
or redesignated pursuant to 11 CFR 103.3(b) (1), (2) and (3); or for some other reason were not errors; the Commission
shall make a new projection based on the reduced number of errors in the sample.

(3) The committee shall submit a check to the United States Treasury for the total amount of any contributions not refunded,
reattributed or redesignated in a timely manner in accordance with 11 CFR 103.3(b) (1), (2) or (3).

29. In section 9038.2, the introductory language of paragraph (b)(2) would be republished, and paragraph (b)(2)(iii)

Repayments.



* * * * *



(b) 

Bases for repayment 

* * *

(2) 

Use of funds for non-qualified campaign expenses. * * *

(iii) The amount of any repayment sought under this section shall bear the same ratio to the total amount determined
to have been used for non-qualified campaign expenses as the amount of matching funds certified to the candidate bears
to the candidate's total deposits, as of 90 days after the candidate's date of ineligibility. For the purposes of this
paragraph_

(A) All matching funds certified in response to matching payment submissions received by the Commission as of the
candidate's date of ineligibility will be treated as though they were certified as of the date of ineligibility;

(B) Total deposits is defined in accordance with 11 CFR 9038.3(c)(2); and

(C) In seeking repayment for non-qualified campaign expenses from committees that have received matching fund payments
after the candidate's date of ineligibility, the Commission will review committee expenditures to determine at
what point committee accounts no longer contain matching funds. In doing this, the Commission will review committee
expenditures from the date of the last matching fund payment to the candidate, using the assumption that the last payment
has been expended on a last-in, first-out basis.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing 
regulations to require label warning statements for products 
taken in solid oral dosage form to supplement the dietary intake 
of iron or to provide iron for therapeutic purposes. FDA is also 
proposing regulations to require unit-dose packaging
 for iron-containing products that contain 30 milligrams (mg) or more of 
iron per dosage unit.
 FDA is proposing these regulations 
because of the acute iron poisonings, including deaths in 
children less than 6 years of age, attributable to accidental 
overdoses of iron-containing products. The intent of these 
proposed regulations is to reduce the risk of accidental iron poisonings of young children by utilizing FDA's authority
in 
conjunction with the existing requirements of the U.S. Consumer 
Product Safety Commission (CPSC) for child-resistant packaging 
for household substances. This proposal responds to three 
citizen petitions (Docket Nos. 91P-0186/CP1, 93P-0306/CP1, and 
93-0306/CP2) that requested that FDA take action to ensure that 
products containing iron or iron salts do not pose a health 
hazard to young children and infants.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Background


Iron is an essential nutrient that, in certain 
circumstances, can be toxic. For some women of child-bearing age 
and for some young children, iron from dietary sources alone may 
be insufficient to meet their metabolic iron requirements. 
Access to products that provide iron is useful for these groups 
to ensure that their iron requirements are met. However, when 
consumed acutely in large quantities by young children, iron is 
toxic and can, in some cases, lead to death. 
Since the mid 1980's, an upsurge in reported accidental 
pediatric ingestion of iron-containing products has occurred 
(Ref.1). This fact, and the many resultant injuries and deaths 
of children, have created a dilemma with respect to how to ensure 
that iron sources are available while still minimizing the risks 
to children. In response, FDA is proposing regulations that 
require that a warning be placed on labeling about the adverse 
effects of acute, high dose iron ingestion by children and that 
unit-dose packaging be used for certain iron-containing products. 
These requirements, if adopted, will apply to iron-containing 
products in addition to the existing requirements of CPSC, which 
provide that child-resistant packaging must be used for most 
iron-containing products available (see section II.B. of this 
document). The agency tentatively finds that the effect of these 
new requirements, in conjunction with those of CPSC, will be to 
significantly reduce the risk of accidental pediatric iron 
poisoning. 
The types of iron-containing products that have been 
associated with poisonings of young children are those offered in 
solid oral dosage form (e.g., capsules and tablets) as: (1) 
Children's and adult's multi-vitamin/mineral supplements that 
contain iron or iron salts (these products typically provide less 
than 30 mg of iron per dosage unit), (2) products intended for 
use as iron supplements (these products typically contain 30 mg 
or more of iron per dosage unit), and (3) drug products that 
contain iron or iron salts (these products typically contain 30 
mg or more of iron per dosage unit). In this document, the term 
``iron-containing products'' refers to all of these types of 
products. 
The agency is not aware of incidents of poisoning being 
caused by iron-containing products in liquid or powder form. 
Therefore, these products are not subject to this proposal. The 
agency will consider what regulatory action is appropriate to 
take with regard to iron-containing products in liquid or powder 
form if it becomes aware of information indicating that these 
products have caused or can cause poisonings in children. 
This document also does not bear in any way on conventional 
foods containing naturally occurring or added iron. Pediatric 
iron poisoning from consumption of iron-containing foods in 
conventional food form is unlikely because of limitations 
inherent in the large quantity of food that would have to be 
ingested to cause an adverse effect in young children. For 
example, a serving of a highly fortified breakfast cereal that 
contains 100 percent of the recommended daily intake for iron of 
18 mg, would provide only 7 percent of the amount of iron that is 
considered necessary to produce symptoms of iron poisoning in a 
10 kilograms (kg) (22 pounds (lb)) child (i.e., 25 milligrams 
(mg) per (/) kg of iron, which equates to 250 mg total iron for a 
10 kg (22 lb) child. (See section I.B. of this document.) 
Moreover, the agency is not aware of any pediatric iron 
poisonings that have resulted from ingestion of iron-containing 
foods in conventional food form. 


A. The Iron Requirements of Children and Women of Childbearing Age 


Iron is an essential nutrient because it is a component of 
blood and muscle tissue and because of its role in metabolic 
reactions. Iron-containing compounds in the body may be grouped 
into two categories: (1) Those that serve metabolic functions, 
and (2) those associated with iron storage. The compounds in 
the first category include hemoglobin (a component of red blood 
cells), myoglobin (a muscle protein), and iron-containing 
enzymes. They account for approximately 80 percent of body iron. 
Compounds in the second category are involved in the maintenance 
of iron homeostasis and include the storage compounds ferritin 
and hemosiderin. 
When the supply of dietary iron becomes inadequate to meet 
the body's needs, iron is mobilized from iron stores to maintain 
the production of red blood cells and to perform other essential 
iron-dependent functions. When body iron stores are low or 
depleted, as often occurs in women of child-bearing age and in 
very young children, a person is vulnerable to adverse effects 
associated with iron deficiency anemia and with a reduction in 
metabolic and body functions.

Although the prevalence of iron deficiency in the U.S. 
population is low (Ref. 2), maintenance of adequate iron stores 
in women of childbearing age and in young children is an 
important public health issue. A woman's recommended daily 
allowance (RDA) for iron during pregnancy doubles from 15 to 30 
mg/day (Ref. 3). The importance of prenatal iron supplementation 
in preventing depletion of iron stores in pregnant women has been 
shown in several clinical trials (Ref. 4). Thus, pregnant women 
are often counseled to increase their iron intake through dietary 
changes and the use of iron-containing supplements or drugs.
A committee of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) has 
recommended that all pregnant women should be screened for iron 
deficiency anemia at the first prenatal visit and at least once 
during each subsequent trimester (Ref. 5). The NAS committee 
recommended, however, that iron supplementation should only be 
given when iron status is low or marginal, as indicated by 
hemoglobin and serum ferritin, in comparison with standard values 
recommended by NAS for the specific trimester of pregnancy. When 
these clinical indicators reveal deficient iron status, the NAS 
committee recommended that the clinician prescribe 60 to 120 mg of supplemental iron per day. If iron status is marginal,
the 
NAS committee recommended that the clinician prescribe 30 mg of 
supplemental iron per day. If iron status is normal, the NAS 
committee recommended that these be no iron supplementation. 
 Aside from the iron needs that arise during pregnancy, women 
of child-bearing age have a higher requirement for iron than 
other adults. (The RDA for women of child-bearing age is 15 
mg/day because of the depletion of iron through menstrual blood 
loss. It is 10 mg/day for adult males and older adult women 
(Ref. 3).) The difficulty of obtaining dietary intakes high 
enough to replace those losses through consumption of a normal 
diet is responsible for iron deficiency in some women of child-bearing age. For these women also, the use of iron-containing

products may be prudent. 
 Iron deficiency also affects young children (the RDA for 
iron for children is 10 mg/day), particularly during the rapid 
growth period from 6 months to 4 years of age. Some young 
children fail to develop adequate iron stores to supply the iron 
needed for their metabolic functions during this early growth 
period. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination 
Survey (NHANES II) for children show that the prevalence of 
impaired iron status ranges from an estimated 3 to 12 percent 
(Ref. 2). Thus, iron supplementation may also be indicated in 
children whose iron needs are not met through dietary intake.

B. Iron Toxicity in Young Children 
 

Although the minimal toxic and lethal doses for iron have 
not been clearly established (Ref. 6), the severity of iron 
poisoning when an overdose has been ingested is related to the 
amount of iron absorbed into the circulatory system. Experts 
have stated that ingestion of 25 mg/kg of iron (250 mg total iron 
for a 10 kg child) may produce symptoms of poisoning, and that 
ingestion of 60 mg/kg total iron for a 10 kg child is the minimum 
intake for the development of significant iron poisoning (Refs. 6 
and 7). One source recommends emergency room evaluation when 
ingestion of iron exceeds 50 mg/kg (Ref. 6). An acute ingestion 
of more than 250 mg/kg for a 10 kg child is typically considered 
a lethal dose for iron (Ref. 8). However, it has been reported 
that ingestion of 100 to 200 mg/kg for a 10 kg child can be fatal 
(Ref. 9), and that ingestion of as little as 650 mg of iron (65 
mg/kg for a 10 kg child) has resulted in death (Ref. 7). Based 
upon these reported values, acute ingestions of less than 1,000 
mg of iron appear to be likely to cause nonfatal injuries of 
varying severity, depending on the amount of ingested iron. 
 Iron overdose results in both local and systemic effects 
(Ref 10). Toxicity is caused by both a direct corrosive effect 
on the gastrointestinal mucosa and the presence of unbound iron 
in the circulatory system. Locally in the stomach and intestine, ingested iron is corrosive and produces death of
cells in the 
mucosa lining the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in ulceration 
and hemorrhage. While intact mucosa limits the absorption of 
iron, eroded mucosa permits absorption of relatively huge amounts 
of iron into the portal circulation that goes immediately to the 
liver, causing damage to liver cells. Overload of the liver 
cells, which normally remove iron from the circulation, allows 
iron to enter the general circulation. 
 When the circulating iron exceeds the capacity of certain 
proteins to bind it, free iron reaches other tissues, such as 
kidneys, lungs, heart and blood vessels, and the brain. The 
resultant death of cells in these tissues produces the following 
wide-spread symptoms and signs of iron poisoning: Kidney 
failure, edema in the lung, hemorrhage, hypotension from damage 
to the heart and blood vessels, coma from damage to the brain, 
and acidosis from release of organic acids. 
 Severe iron poisoning is characterized by four clinical 
stages (Refs. 6 and 9): 
 (1) Stage one, which may occur within 30 minutes (min) of 
ingestion, is characterized primarily by signs and symptoms of 
hemorrhagic gastroenteritis (i.e., nausea, vomiting, abdominal 
pain, hematemesis (vomiting blood), and bloody diarrhea) that may 
progress to shock, coma, seizures, and death. 
 (2) During stage two, which occurs from 2 to 12 hours (hr) 
after ingestion, patients may be without symptoms and may appear 
to have recovered. Some children will recover, but some may 
progress to stage three. The appearance of recovery should not 
delay evaluation and treatment for iron poisoning because 
successful treatment is difficult once the iron is absorbed from 
the small intestine into the blood. 
 (3) During stage three, from 12 to 48 hr after ingestion, 
there is a recurrence of gastrointestinal hemorrhage with severe 
lethargy or coma, and there may be liver and kidney failure and 
collapse of the heart and blood vessels. 
 (4) Stage four, 3 to 4 weeks after survivors of poisonings 
ingested the iron, may include gastrointestinal obstruction and 
cirrhosis of the liver. 
 In evaluating a child who is thought to have ingested an 
overdose of iron, an abdominal x-ray looking for iron-containing 
tablets, a qualitative color test for iron in the stomach 
contents, and an emergency determination of the concentration of 
iron in blood plasma may be performed. 
 If an overdose of iron is indicated, an emetic agent may be 
administered to cause regurgitation of the iron if the patient is 
fully awake and alert. In addition to emesis, catharsis with 
saline or sorbitol may be used to induce gastric emptying. 
However, neither emesis nor catharsis is advised if hemorrhagic 
gastroenteritis is present. Gastric lavage, i.e., washing out of 
the stomach, with saline or sodium bicarbonate or whole bowel 
irrigation with a balanced polyethylene glycol-electrolyte 
solution by gastric tube have been used to remove undissolved 
tablets (Ref. 11).

Treatment for an iron overdose frequently includes 
parenteral administration of deferoxamine (also referred to as 
desferrioxamine), a drug which chelates (i.e., binds) iron in the 
intracellular fluid and causes its excretion in urine (Ref. 6). 
Given that 1 g deferoxamine can bind 93 mg of iron, and that, to 
avoid hypotension, infusion is generally recommended at 15 
mg/kg/hr, there is a limit to the amount of iron deferoxamine can 
bind. For example, safe administration of deferoxamine to a 10 
kg child over a 24 hr period is capable of binding only 324 mg of 
iron (Refs. 11 and 12). 
 Therefore, if very high levels of iron are absorbed, even 
prompt treatment with deferoxamine or another agent may not 
prevent a fatal outcome if chelation at the maximum safe rate 
cannot reduce the iron burden to levels below those that cause 
death. 
 Speed of diagnosis and therapy are important. With earlier 
and more effective treatment, the mortality rate from iron 
poisoning has been reduced from as high as 45 percent to about 1 
percent (Ref. 9). 
 

C. Summary of Information on Pediatric Deaths and Injuries 


1. Citizen Petitions 
 

Data have been submitted to or obtained by FDA on reports of 
deaths attributable to accidental pediatric iron poisoning that 
were made between 1983 and 1993 to the American Association of 
Poison Control Centers and between 1986 and 1993 to CPSC (Table 
1). Although these two sets of data are not identical, they do 
have extensive overlap (cases included in both databases). They 
both point to an increase in reported fatalities from accidental 
iron poisonings of children in the early 1990's. 
 The number or rate of fatalities does not represent the 
totality of the health hazard, however. Data obtained by FDA 
from the American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC) 
show that from 1986 through 1992 there were nearly 63,000 reports 
to poison control centers involving ingestion of adult iron- 
containing products, with over 47,000 of these reports involving 
children under 6 years of age (Refs. 14 through 20). Many of 
these victims required hospitalization, and many others required 
some medical treatment. For example, Table 2 shows that over 
1,500 of these cases were classified as having ``moderate 
outcomes,'' i.e., the patient had symptoms that, while not life 
threatening, usually required some form of treatment. One 
hundred fifty-nine cases were classified as ``major outcomes,'' 
i.e., they were life threatening or resulted in permanent injury. 
Except for 1992, AAPCC data do not indicate how many of the 
moderate and major outcomes involved children under 6 years of 
age. However, for 1992, 55 percent (17/31) of the major 
outcomes, and 51 percent (141/278) of the moderate outcomes, 
involved children under 6 years of age.

In addition, AAPCC data show that during the same 7-year 
period, there were over 76,000 reports to poison control centers 
involving ingestion of pediatric iron-containing products with 
over 69,000 of these reports involving children under 6 years of 
age (Refs. 14 through 20). Table 3 shows that over 495 of these 
cases were classified as having ``moderate outcomes,'' and 29 cases 
were classified as ``major outcomes.'' Again, except for 1992, 
AAPCC data do not indicate how many of the moderate and major 
outcomes involved children under 6 years of age. However, for 
1992, the single major outcome, and 91 percent (52/57) of the 
moderate outcomes, involved children under 6 years of age.

Likewise, CPSC reports that, based upon data from its 
National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) (NEISS is 
a probability sample of hospital emergency rooms in the United 
States that is used by the CPSC to measure the magnitude of the 
injury problem associated with consumer products and to provide a 
source for followup investigations of selected cases), there was 
a significant upward trend in the estimated number of hospital 
emergency room-treated iron ingestion cases involving children 
under 5 years of age in the 1980 to 1993 period. Every annual 
estimate in the 1980 to 1985 period was smaller than every annual 
estimate in the 1986 to 1993 period. The estimated average 
number of cases annually was 1,240 for the 1980 to 1985 period 
and 3,170 for the 1986 to 1993 period (Ref. 1).


2. CPSC Case Reports 


CPSC considers iron-containing products to be potentially 
hazardous to children and, thus, has taken a number of 
significant steps designed to reduce the risk from these 
products. As part of its efforts, CPSC has collected detailed 
information on pediatric iron poisoning fatalities and has also 
conducted followup (from NEISS data) investigations of incidents 
of nonfatal pediatric iron ingestion where the victim was taken 
to a hospital emergency room. In order to evaluate the available 
data on specific occurrences of iron poisoning as fully as 
possible, FDA obtained from CPSC the case reports on 37 fatal 
pediatric poisonings (Ref. 21) and on 70 NEISS followup 
investigations of nonfatal pediatric iron ingestions for the 
years 1986 to 1993 (Ref. 22). These data are described below and 
are summarized in Tables 4 and 5. 
Table 4 summarizes the data obtained from CPSC on 37 iron 
poisoning fatalities of young children since 1986. Among these 
fatalities, the average age of the victim was 16.8 months. In 25 
of these 37 deaths, the iron potency of the implicated product 
was reported. These 25 products contained, on average, 63 mg 
iron per dosage unit. The lowest reported potency of an iron-containing product involved in these pediatric deaths
was 40 mg 
iron per dosage unit. The potency of the iron-containing product 
involved in the 12 other deaths was not reported. 
Table 4 shows that, in 21 of the 37 fatalities, information 
on the number of tablets or capsules consumed by the victim was 
reported. Among these 21 reports, the average number of iron 
tablets or capsules consumed by the victim was 39. 
Table 4 also shows that in 56 percent of these 37 pediatric 
deaths (21/37), the iron-containing product visually appeared to 
be packaged in child-resistant packaging (CRP), and more 
specifically, in containers with apparently child-resistant 
closures (CRC). In 16 percent of the deaths (6/37), the iron-containing supplement was not packaged in CRP. Among
the 
remaining deaths (10/37), the type of packaging was not reported.

Among the 21 reported pediatric poisoning deaths that 
involved iron-containing products packaged in CRP, Table 4 shows 
that 29 percent (6/21) of these deaths resulted from iron- 
containing products whose child-resistant package was reportedly 
opened (actually or possibly) by the victim. In 14 percent 
(3/21) of these deaths, the CRP was reported to have been opened 
(actually or possibly) by another child. An adult was reported 
to have opened the CRP in 19 percent (4/21) of the pediatric iron 
poisoning deaths. Among the remaining reports of pediatric iron 
deaths in which the iron-containing product was packaged in 
child-resistant containers, the means of opening the container 
were not identified in 24 percent (5/21). The CRP was reported 
to be defective in 14 percent (3/21) of these deaths. 
Table 5 shows the total amount of iron ingested in the fatal 
poisoning incidents in which both the amount of tablets ingested 
and the iron potency of these tablets were reported. Among 17 
fatalities, in all but 1 case, the iron potency of the tablets 
was 60 to 65 mg, and with 1 exception (the same reported case), 
the calculated amount of iron ingested was at least 900 mg. 
The 70 case reports of NEISS followup investigations of 
nonfatal pediatric iron ingestions involved 80 children. The 80 
children were either treated in the emergency room and released 
or hospitalized for a period of time. Table 6 summarizes these 
case reports. The average age of the children was about 31 
months.

The types of products ingested were described as iron 
tablets, iron pills, prenatal vitamins, vitamins for anemia, 
multivitamins, and children's vitamins. Children's vitamins were 
the most numerous and were involved in 56 percent (45/80) of the 
cases, followed by prenatal vitamins in 23 percent (18/80). 
Sixty percent (48/80) of the iron products were nonprescription 
items, and 25 percent (20/80) were prescription items. (The 
remainder were not described.) 
The average number of tablets ingested by the children was 
about 20 tablets, and the greatest number was 80 tablets. One 
child was taken to the emergency room as a precaution, but it was 
discovered that the child had not actually swallowed any tablets. 
The iron potency of the product was documented only in 13 case 
reports and in those, it ranged from 15 to 65 mg. 
Most of the iron products (80 percent, 64/80) were 
reportedly packaged in CRP, whereas 10 percent (8/80) of the 
products were reportedly not packaged in CRP. In the remainder 
of the cases, the iron products were in packages with lost lids, 
the product had been removed from the original container, or no 
details were reported. The victims opened the CRP in 45 percent 
(36/80) of the cases. In 16 percent (13/80) of the cases, the 
victim was able to open the CRP because the lid was not secured tightly, whether by intent or accidentally, by an adult.
A 
family member such as a sibling, cousin, or mother opened the CRP 
in 18 percent (15/80) of the incidents, allowing the victim 
access to the iron product. 
Elevated iron serum levels were reported in 18 percent 
(14/80) of the reports, and normal levels were reported in 3 of 
the cases. However, most of the cases (79 percent, 63/80) did 
not report test results for serum iron. Eighty-six percent 
(69/80) of the cases were treated and released from the hospital, 
while 14 percent (11/80) were admitted to the hospital. 
Symptoms, or lack of symptoms, were reported for 34 of the 
80 children. The symptoms included diarrhea, vomiting, and 
lethargy. Gastrointestinal symptoms were the most common, 
vomiting occurred 18 times, diarrhea occurred 8 times, and 2 
children suffered both vomiting and diarrhea. Fever and 
constipation were reported only for the 3-month old victim. 
Cramps, nausea, drowsiness, dizziness, hyperactivity, and profuse 
sweating were other symptoms that were documented only once each. 
A combination of at least two symptoms were documented for eight 
children. 
Two of the pediatric iron poisoning incidents, including one 
fatality, occurred after an adult removed several dosage units 
from their original container and stored them in nonchild-
resistant containers, as follows: (1) ``The aunt took the 
prenatal vitamin pills out of their original container and placed them in a tin can that was half full of pennies.''
(Ref. 22, case 
report No. 23.) 
(2) ``For reasons as yet unknown, she (the mother) took them 
from the original container believed to be equipped with a child-
resistant closure, and put them in a container that was not 
equipped with a child-resistant closure, possibly a vitamin 
bottle.'' (Ref. 21, case report No. 21.) 


D. Response to the Epidemic 


1. Petitions Submitted to FDA 


FDA has received three citizen petitions requesting that the 
agency take various actions concerning labeling, packaging, and 
formulation for iron-containing products. One of the petitions 
suggested that the agency undertake efforts to educate the public 
about the danger of pediatric iron poisoning. The petitions were 
submitted by the American Association of Poison Control Centers 
(the AAPCC petition) (Docket No. 91P-0186/CP1) (Ref. 12); the 
Attorneys General of 34 States, Commonwealths, and Territories 
(the AG petition) (Docket No. 93P-0306/CP1) (Ref. 13); and the 
Nonprescription Drug Manufacturers Association (the NDMA 
petition) (Docket No. 93P-0306/CP2) (Ref. 23). The principal 
issues in these petitions are summarized in Table 7 and discussed 
in this section.

a. 

The AAPCC petition.

 The AAPCC petition was submitted on 
April 30, 1991, and was supplemented by an additional submission 
by AAPCC on February 28, 1992. It was based upon pediatric 
poisoning data collected by the AAPCC National Data Collection 
System from 1983 through 1991. The petition stated that iron 
products are the leading cause of poisoning deaths in children 
under age six. A letter was submitted to the agency in support 
of the AAPCC petition by the American Academy of Pediatrics on 
February 17, 1993. The AAPCC petition requested that the agency 
take the following actions concerning the labeling and 
formulation of iron-containing products: 

(1) 

Labeling.

 The petition requested that FDA declare 
labels on drug products and food supplements containing 30 mg or 
more of iron per dosage unit as misleading if the label does not 
clearly state that accidental pediatric ingestion of these 
products can be lethal. 

(2) 

Formulation.

 The petition requested that the agency 
urge the industry to voluntarily reformulate iron-containing 
products containing 30 mg or more of iron per dosage unit in less 
attractive dosage units, specifically avoiding resemblance to 
popular candies. 

The AAPCC petition also requested that the agency initiate 
an educational effort to alert the public and health 
professionals to the dangers of accidental pediatric ingestion of 
iron-containing products. The AAPCC stated that efforts need to be directed especially to parents, babysitters,
daycare 
providers, and other consumers; to pediatricians, urging these 
health professionals to target parents at the 6-month visit; to 
obstetricians, urging these health professionals to educate 
mothers at the final postpartum visit; to other health 
professionals who prescribe iron-containing products; and to 
pharmacists who dispense them. 

b. 

The AG petition.

 The AG petition, submitted on August 
16, 1993, cited data on injuries and deaths attributable to 
accidental iron poisoning in children reported to the AAPCC 
National Data Collection System and reported to CPSC through 
1992. It requested that the agency take the following actions 
concerning the labeling, formulation, and packaging of iron- 
containing products: 

(1) 

Labeling.

 For iron-containing products containing 30 
mg iron or more per tablet or capsule, the petition requested 
that the agency promulgate a regulation requiring that the label 
bear a conspicuous boxed warning that states: 

 




Warning

_Keep away from children. 
Contains iron which can be harmful or fatal 
if swallowed by a child. 

 


The petition recommended that this warning be in bold face type 
and in a color that contrasts with the background and with other 
printed material on the label and labeling. 



The petition also recommended that immediately following the 
above boxed warning, the following information appear: 

 


Acute overdosage of iron may cause nausea and 
vomiting and, in severe cases, cardiovascular 
collapse and death. 

 


For iron-containing products containing less than 30 mg iron 
per tablet or capsule, the petition recommended that the agency 
promulgate a regulation requiring that the label contain a 
conspicuous boxed warning that states: 

 




Warning

_Keep away from children. Contains 
iron which can be harmful or fatal in large 
doses if swallowed by a child. 

 


The petition recommended that this warning also be in boldface 
type and in a color that contrasts with the background and with 
other printed material on the label and labeling. 



(2) 

Packaging

_The petition recommended that FDA require 
that iron-containing products containing 30 mg or more of iron 
per tablet or capsule be packaged in child-resistant individual 
blister packs. 

(3) 

Formulation

_The petition recommended that FDA prohibit 
the manufacture and sale of adult formulations of iron-containing 
products that look like candy or contain a sweet outer coating. 



c. Nonprescription Drug Manufacturers Association petition. 



The Nonprescription Drug Manufacturers Association (NDMA), a 
trade association that represents U.S. manufacturers and 
distributors of nonprescription medicines and vitamin and mineral 
products, submitted a citizen petition to FDA on October 15, 
1993, in response to the AG petition. The NDMA petition 
requested that FDA adopt into regulation the newly initiated voluntary NDMA program on the labeling, packaging,
and 
formulation of iron-containing products. NDMA stated that it 
submitted a similar petition to CPSC requesting that CPSC adopt 
into regulation the elements of the voluntary industry program 
that are under the regulatory jurisdiction of CPSC. The petition 
also requested that FDA deny the other citizen petitions 
submitted on iron-containing products and pediatric poisoning 
insofar as they would contradict, add to, or subtract from the 
NDMA program. 

The NDMA petition requested that FDA adopt the following 
labeling, formulation, and packaging provisions: 

(1) 

Labeling.

 Iron-containing products must bear on the 
primary container (or box for blister packaging, glassine 
envelope, etc.), conspicuously, prominently, and clearly 
distinguished from other labeling by type, color, or contrast, 
the following warning statement: 

 




Warning: 

Close tightly and keep out of reach 
of children. Contains iron, which can be 
harmful or fatal to children in large doses. 
In case of accidental overdose, seek 
professional assistance or contact a Poison 
Control Center immediately. 

 


The petition stated that in circumstances in which the packaging 
did not involve a reclosable CRP element (e.g., cap to a bottle), 
the term ``close tightly'' would not need to appear in the warning 
statement.

(2) 

Packaging. 

The NDMA specifically requested that FDA 
deny the request made by the AG petition to require that iron- 
containing products containing 30 mg or more of iron per tablet 
be packaged in child-resistant individual blister packs. In 
support of this request, NDMA pointed out that its voluntary 
program calls for the packaging of all iron-containing products 
with 30 mg or more iron per dose in complying CRP (i.e., there 
will be no CRP-exempt sizes for this type of product). (See 
discussion on CRP requirements of CPSC in section II.B. of this 
document.) NDMA noted that its voluntary program is being 
carried out in conjunction with a national consumer education 
campaign that it launched with CPSC on September 27, 1993, in 
conjunction with CPSC's Conference on Pediatric Iron Poisonings 
and Fatalities, which was held on September 28, 1993, in 
Washington, DC. 



(3) 

Formulation. 

The NDMA stated that iron-containing 
products with greater than or equal to 30 mg iron per solid 
dosage form will not be formulated with sweet outer coatings. 




2. The Consumer Product Safety Commission Conference 





CPSC held this conference because of the increase in iron 
poisonings of children. The objective of the conference was to 
provide a forum for health care professionals and representatives 
of government and industry to identify solutions to this problem. 
The conference included invited speakers from CPSC, AAPCC, 
Georgetown University, FDA, NDMA, the National Nutritional Foods 
Association (NNFA), and the Office of the New York State Attorney General. This conference highlighted the seriousness
of 
the pediatric iron poisoning problem and the steps that were 
being taken to address the problem. 



Factors that may have contributed to the increased incidence 
of pediatric iron poisonings were discussed, including the 
requirement by many women for iron supplementation during 
pregnancy; the use of iron-containing products in homes where 
small children are present; the ability of older siblings of 
potential victims to open CRP; the misconception that vitamin and 
mineral products are inherently safe; improper use or failure to 
properly close child-resistant closures; and the formulation of 
some iron-containing products to appear like candy, potentially 
explaining why some children consumed large quantities of tablets 
(30 to 100 tablets). 



CPSC described the regulations that it issued in 1978 under 
the Poison Prevention Packaging Act, which require CRP on most 
drugs and food supplements with more than 250 mg of iron per 
container (see section II.B. of this document). CPSC noted that 
its Office of Compliance and Enforcement recently discovered that 
several manufacturers of iron-containing products were not using 
CRP, and that some of these manufacturers had voluntarily agreed 
to recall these products. 



At this conference, FDA explained that most iron-containing 
products are regulated as dietary supplements under the food 
provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act). 
FDA noted that, although there are currently no specific regulations for iron-containing supplements, the general
food 
safety and food labeling provisions of the act require that all 
foods, including iron-containing supplements, be safe under their 
intended conditions of use, and that their labeling be truthful 
and nonmisleading. FDA also noted that iron-containing products 
that are regulated as drugs under the drug provisions of the act 
must be approved before marketing as safe and effective for their 
intended conditions of use and are subject to labeling and good 
manufacturing practice requirements. 



The industry's voluntary efforts in response to the iron 
poisoning problem were described by representatives of NDMA and 
NNFA. NDMA described its newly initiated voluntary program of 
packaging, labeling, and formulation changes which it had 
petitioned FDA to adopt into regulation. NDMA also described the 
newly launched joint consumer education campaign that it had 
developed in cooperation with CPSC to inform adults how to 
protect children from accidental iron poisoning. (See section 
IV.B. of this document.) 



NNFA stated that its members were adopting a voluntary 
program similar to NDMA's, with the added provision that iron 
will be limited to a maximum of 30 mg per dosage unit and 30 mg 
per recommended dose. 



In an open discussion of possible solutions, several ways to 
address the problem of pediatric iron poisoning were suggested. 
These suggestions included:

(1) Labeling iron-containing products with statements warning that accidental ingestion by children can be lethal.


(2) Packaging changes for iron-containing products with 30 mg or more iron per dosage unit, including packaging these
products in child-resistant unit-dose (e.g., blister) packages and not offering such products in packaging that
is not child- resistant (no exempt sizes). 

(3) Reformulating iron-containing products that resemble candy and that have a sweet outer coating to discourage
consumption of large amounts by small children. 

(4) Requiring prescription status for iron products, reducing the number of units per package, and closer monitoring
of the iron status of pregnant women to determine whether iron supplementation is really needed. 

(5) Multi-ethnic educational efforts to increase public awareness of the dangers associated with iron and patient
counseling by obstetricians, gynecologists, and pharmacists, because many poisonings involve iron-containing
drug products. 

Several participants at the conference commended the trade associations for their voluntary programs. However,
some participants urged that child-resistant unit-dose blister packaging, an element not included in the voluntary
industry programs, be implemented as a significant measure to reduce the incidence of iron poisonings. The participants
in the conference called upon industry, government, and the healthcare community to undertake efforts, including
cooperative efforts, to address this problem. 



E. The Scope and Purpose of this Document 



The purpose of this document is to: (1) Propose requirements designed to reduce the risk of pediatric poisonings from
the accidental ingestion of iron-containing products, (2) solicit additional information concerning the issue,
raised in the petitions, of reformulating iron-containing products to avoid the resemblance to candy and to avoid
use of a sweet outer coating, and (3) describe the efforts that FDA intends to undertake to respond to the need for public
education concerning iron poisonings, reinforcing the NDMA/CPSC education campaign. 

As stated above, the agency believes that the new requirements that it is proposing, in conjunction with CPSC's existing
requirements for CRP for iron-containing products (see section II.B. of this document), will significantly reduce
the risk of accidental pediatric iron poisoning. FDA and CPSC have worked together closely in coordinating their
respective efforts toward this goal, and the two agencies intend to continue to work in close cooperation. 



II. Regulation of Iron-Containing Products



A. Regulation by FDA 



1. Types of Iron-Containing Products Addressed in this Proposal 



This proposal addresses iron-containing products available as dietary supplements and as prescription drug products.


FDA defined ``dietary supplement'' as a food, not in conventional food form, that supplies a component to supplement
the diet by increasing the total dietary intake of that component (59 FR 425, January 4, 1994). 

Section 201(f) of the act (21 U.S.C. 321(f)) defines ``food'' as: (1) Articles used for food or drink for man or other
animals; (2) chewing gum, and (3) articles used for components of any such article. In 

Nutrilab Inc. 

v. 

Schweiker, 

713 F.2d 335, 338 (7th Cir. 1983), the court noted that taste, aroma, or nutritive value were the primary reasons why
people consume food. The 

Nutrilab 

court said that in section 201(f)(1) of the act, the statutory definition of ``food'' includes the common sense definition
of food: ``When the statue defines `food' as `articles used for food, it means that the statutory definition of food'
includes articles used by people in the ordinary way most people use food_primarily for taste, aroma, or nutritive
value.'' Other courts have followed suit. (See 

United States 

v. 

Undetermined Quantities of Cal-Ban 3000, 

776 F. Supp. 249, 254-255 (E.D.N.C.1991); 

American Health Products Co. 

v. 

Hayes, 

574 F. Supp. 1498, 1508-1509 (S.D.N.Y. 1983), aff'd 744 F.2d 912 (2d Cir. 1984).) 

Types of iron-containing products that meet the definition of a dietary supplement and are regulated as foods include
products intended for use primarily to supplement the dietary intake of iron (iron supplements) and multi-vitamin/mineral
supplements that contain iron. Products intended for use as iron supplements generally contain 30 mg or more or iron
per dosage unit, while multi-vitamin/mineral supplements generally contain 18 mg or less of iron per dosage unit.


Under section 201(g)(1) of the act, drugs are defined as: 




(A) Articles recognized in the official United States Pharmacopeia, official Homeopathic Pharmacopeia of the United
States, or official National Formulary, or any supplement to any of them; and (B) articles intended for use in the diagnosis,
cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in man or other animals; and (C) articles (other than food)
intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals; and (D) articles intended for use
as a component of any articles specified in clause (A), (B), or (C).

Iron-containing products that are regulated as prescription drugs include iron preparations that also contain
folic acid and that are prescribed to meet requirements during pregnancy. These products are regulated as drugs because
of the amount of folic acid that they contain. These products generally contain 30 mg or more of iron per dosage unit.

Thus, how an iron-containing product is regulated turns on its intended use.



2. Legal Authority for FDA Regulation of Iron-Containing Products



a. 

Safety of iron and iron salts added to dietary supplements. 

The act is intended to ensure that all food, including dietary supplements, is safe. The act does so, in part, by stipulating
that no substances may be added to food unless they are safe. FDA has defined ``safe'' as meaning there is a reasonable
certainty that no harm will result from the use of an ingredient in food ( 170.3(i)(21 CFR 170.3(i)). The determination
as to whether there is a ``reasonable certainty of no harm'' can be made in a number of ways. The two most common are the
existence of general recognition among qualified experts that the substance will be safe for its intended use (GRAS)
(see  170.3) or a determination by FDA that the use of the substance is safe (see sections 201(s), 402(a)(2)(C),
and 409 of the act (21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C) and 348)). 

Under section 201(s) of the act, for a substance to be GRAS, general recognition of its safety must exist among experts
qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety of substances directly or indirectly added
to food. The experts' conclusion as to the safety of the substance for its intended use may be based on either: (1) Scientific
procedures, that is, published scientific evidence that provides the quantity and quality of scientific evidence
that would justify listing the use of the substance as a food additive; or (2) in the case of a substance used in food prior
to January 1, 1958, evidence derived from common use of the substance in food.

Under section 409(c)(1)(A) of the act, the agency is authorized to prescribe the conditions of safe use of the substance,
including, but not limited to: ``* * * specifications as to the particular food or classes of food in
or on which such additive may be used, the maximum quantity which may be used or permitted to remain in or on such food,
the manner in which such additive may be added to or used in or on such food, and any directions or other labeling or packaging
requirements for such additive deemed necessary by [the Secretary of Health and Human Services] to assure the safety
of such use.''

Section 402(a)(1) of the act also provides authority to take action to ensure that food is not harmful. It states:






A food shall be deemed to be adulterated_(a)(1) If it bears or contains any poisonous or deleterious substance which
may render it injurious to health; but in case the substance is not an added substance such food shall not be considered
adulterated under this clause if the quantity of such substance in such food does not ordinarily render it injurious
to health. 






Using its authority under these sections of the act, FDA has reviewed the safety of various iron salts that are used
in food. FDA listed reduced iron, ferrous gluconate, ferrous lactate, ferrous sulfate, ferric phosphate, ferric
pyrophosphate, and ferric sodium pyrophosphate as GRAS nutrients in a regulation published in the 

Federal Register

 of November 20, 1959 (24 FR 9368). Subsequently, FDA listed iron and these compounds as GRAS ``nutrients and/or dietary
supplements'' in a regulation published in the 

Federal Register

 of January 31, 1961 (26 FR 938). In addition, the ferrous salt of fumaric acid ( 172.350 (21 CFR 172.350)) (originally
promulgated as 21 CFR 121.1130 (29 FR 559, January 23, 1964) and iron-choline citrate complex ( 172.350 (21
CFR 172.370)) (originally promulgated as 21 CFR 121.247 (28 FR 4509, May 4, 1963)) have been listed by the agency as
food additives for use in foods for special dietary use.

In a final rule published in the 

Federal Register

 of September 5, 1980 (45 FR 58837), the agency divided the ``nutrients and/or dietary supplements'' category into
separate listings for ingredients whose intended use was as a dietary supplement (part 182 (21 CFR part 182), subpart
F) and for ingredients whose intended use was as a nutrient supplement in foods in conventional food form (part 182,
subpart I). For example, reduced iron is listed as GRAS in  182.5375 for use as a dietary supplement ingredient
and in  182.8375 for use in food in conventional form as a nutrient. Similarly, ferric phosphate ( 182.5301),
ferric pyrophosphate ( 182.5304), ferric sodium pyrophosphate ( 182.5306), ferrous gluconate ( 182.5308),
ferrous lactate ( 182.5311), and ferrous sulfate ( 182.5315) are listed as GRAS for use as dietary supplement
ingredients and are listed in  182.8301, 182.8304, 182.8308, 182.8311, and 182.8315, respectively, as GRAS
for use as nutrients in food in conventional food form.

In a regulation published on May 12, 1988 (53 FR 16862), the agency affirmed that elemental iron (21 CFR 184.1375),
ferrous ascorbate (21 CFR 184.1307a), ferrous carbonate (21 CFR 184.1307b), ferrous citrate (21 CFR 184.1307c),
ferrous fumarate (21 CFR 184.1307d), ferrous gluconate (21 CFR 184.1308), ferrous lactate (21 CFR 184.1311), ferrous
sulfate (21 CFR 184.1315), ferric ammonium citrate (21 CFR 184.1296), ferric citrate (21 CFR 184.1298), ferric phosphate
(21 CFR 184.1301), and ferric pyrophosphate (21 CFR 184.1304) are GRAS for use as nutrient supplements, as that use
is defined in 21 CFR 170.3(o)(20), and removed their listing from part 182, subpart I. However, in the final rule, FDA
did not affirm that these iron salts are GRAS for use in dietary supplements (i.e., in forms such as capsules, tablets,
or liquids) because there were insufficient data on their consumption as dietary supplement ingredients. However,
these ingredients continue to be listed as GRAS for use in dietary supplements under part 182, subpart F.

Even though FDA has affirmed as GRAS the use of numerous iron salts in foods, there are differences in the toxicity of
these various salts.

b. 

Safety and efficacy of iron-containing drugs. 

The act 
also authorizes FDA to regulate the marketing of any products to 
help ensure that the products are safe and effective for their 
intended uses. ``New drugs'' may not be introduced into interstate 
commerce unless they are the subject of approved new drug 
applications (NDA's)(25 U.S.C. 355(a)). The act defines a ``new 
drug'' as: (1) Any drug (except a new animal drug or an animal 
feed bearing or containing a new animal drug) the composition of 
which is such that such drug is not generally recognized among 
experts qualified by scientific training and experience to 
evaluate the safety and effectiveness of drugs, as safe and 
effective for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, 
or suggested in the labeling thereof; or (2) any drug the 
composition of which is such that such drug, as a result of 
investigations to determine its safety and effectiveness for use 
under such conditions, has become so recognized, but which has 
not, otherwise than in such investigations, been used to a 
material extent or for a material time under such conditions (21 
U.S.C. 321(b)). In order to be approved, an NDA must contain 
adequate data to demonstrate that the drug product is safe and 
effective for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, 
or suggested in the labeling (21 U.S.C. 355(d)). In addition, 
for NDA approval, the product must be manufactured using current 
good manufacturing practice and the product labeling must not be 
false or misleading (21 U.S.C. 355(d)).

Section 411 of the act (21 U.S.C. 350) provides that the 
Secretary of Health and Human Services may not classify any 
natural or synthetic vitamin or mineral (or combination thereof) 
as a drug solely because it exceeds the level of potency which 
the Secretary determines is nutritionally rational or useful 
except in the case of a vitamin, mineral, other ingredient of 
food, or food, which is represented for use by individuals in the 
treatment or management of specific diseases or disorders, by 
children (individuals under the age of 12 years), or by pregnant 
or lactating women. 

Most of the iron-containing products that FDA regulates are 
considered dietary supplements. The iron-containing products 
that FDA currently regulates as drug products are generally 
prescription products and are so designated, in most cases, 
because they contain an amount of folic acid that exceeds the 
amount in which folic acid may be used as a food additive (see 21 
CFR 172.345).

<PARENT> FR941006-1-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

FDA currently has no packaging or labeling requirements specifically for iron-containing drug products. As prescription
drug products, these iron-containing products must comply with the labeling requirements of section 503(b)(2)
of the act (21 U.S.C. 353(b)(2)) and 21 CFR part 201, as well as other applicable provisions. 



B. CPSC Regulations 




CPSC, under authority of the Poison Prevention Packaging Act of 1970 (PPPA) (15 U.S.C 1471-1475), regulates
the packaging of household substances, including food, drugs, and cosmetics, as these terms are defined under the
PPPA. Under this authority, CPSC has promulgated regulations establishing special packaging
 standards for several household substances, including noninjectable animal and human iron-containing drugs (16
CFR 1700.14(a)(12)) and dietary supplements (16 CFR 1700.14(a)(13)) containing a total amount of iron in a single
package
 equivalent to 250 mg or more per container. 





For nonprescription covered products, the PPPA permits one type of package for each product to be sold without special
packaging if all other package types of the product comply with the requirements. However, exempt packages must bear
a conspicuous label stating: ``This package for households without young children.'' CPSC may, by regulation, prescribe
a substitute statement to the same effect for packaging too small to accommodate this statement. 


In the case of prescription drugs, the PPPA allows for an exemption to such packaging requirements only when directed
in the prescription or when requested by the purchaser.

CPSC provides for testing for special packaging in 16 CFR 1700.20. This regulation establishes test protocols to
evaluate child-resistant effectiveness and adult accessibility to such packaging. Recently, CPSC proposed to
amend 16 CFR 1700.20 to establish new test protocols under which CRP is evaluated (55 FR 40856, October 5, 1990, and
59 FR 13264, March 21, 1994). 

In establishing these regulations, CPSC considered the degree and nature of the hazard to children from accidental
acute overdose of dietary supplements and drugs containing iron. It found that special packaging is required to protect
children from serious injury from ingesting iron-containing drugs and dietary supplements. This finding was based
on: (1) Data from FDA's National Clearing House for Poison Control Centers (no longer in operation) and NEISS, which
showed that products containing iron are frequently ingested by children under the age of 5 years; (2) published human
experience data, symptomatology associated with many of the National Clearinghouse for Poison Control Centers
ingestion reports, and data from death certificates, which showed that the accidental ingestion of 250 mg or more
of iron has caused death or serious illness; and (3) the fact that iron-containing drugs and dietary supplements are
normally stored in their original containers, and that many accidental ingestions of these products result from
children gaining access to the contents of the original container (43 FR 17335, April 21, 1978). 



III. Proposed Regulation



A. Labeling 



1. Review of Labeling Issues in Citizen Petitions 



As noted in section I.D.1. of this document, the AG and NDMA petitions agreed that iron-containing products should
bear label warning statements. However, these petitions did not agree on what the warning should state, or on how it
should appear on the label. 

In requesting the labeling provisions described in section I.D.1. of this document, the AG petition stated that the
hazard presented by iron-containing products is the result, in part, of the perception that they are nontoxic household
products. Thus, according to this petition, they are likely to be left within easy reach of children and not kept properly
secured. The petition also noted that these products are extremely attractive to children because of their typical
candy-like appearance and sweet outer coating and pointed to case reports that illustrate how children ingest iron
tablets in large quantities (see Table 4). 

The AG petition stated that the recent increase in iron poisoning deaths among children might reflect an increase
in the extension of primary health care, especially prenatal care. It noted: ``While more doctors are prescribing
prenatal iron supplementation to more women, there has been no concomitant increase in warnings regarding their
potentially lethal effects.'' 

The AG petition also noted that, while more women were using iron-containing products, the labeling of these products
does not reflect the dangers inherent in their misuse: 





While labeling for a few multi-vitamins containing iron bears the statement that iron can be harmful in large doses,
most iron supplements bear only the non-specific phrase, ``Keep out of reach of children.'' Few, if any, packages
of iron supplements contain the word ``WARNING'' or ``CAUTION,'' words universally accepted as denoting danger,
to alert the user to the dangers of iron overdose. Further, the meager statements that do exist are, for the most part,
printed in the same color and type size as other material on the label and therefore fail to catch anyone's attention.
The statements are often obscured within other small print on the labeling and are neither prominent nor specific
enough to reach parents with a warning about these pills' potential fatal effect on children. Consumers who have no
knowledge of iron's hazards before purchasing iron supplements will not gain that knowledge by purchasing the product
and examining the label. 





The AG petition presented data showing that many iron-containing products commonly available do not carry any label
information conveying the need to keep the product out of the reach of children or conveying any message specific to
iron poisoning. A summary, which was included as part of the AG petition, of the label information found on 25 commonly
available iron-containing products revealed that 10 of the 25 did not include information on the label that the product
should be kept away from children, and that 17 did not contain information stating that iron could be harmful. Six of
the products had no cautionary information at all, and none of the products that did have cautionary information used
the terms ``WARNING'' or ``CAUTION,'' to accompany the statements on the label. 

NDMA, in its petition, stated that its proposed warning label was more appropriate than that proposed in the AG petition
because its warning goes beyond awareness in its focus and extends its message to include information that is preventive
in nature, i.e., ``Close tightly,'' and treatment oriented, i.e., ``In case of accidental overdose seek professional
assistance immediately.'' 

NDMA also argued for allowing for flexibility in the manner in which the warning statement is to be applied to the label.
The petition stated:




It has been the experience of NDMA members in implementing the Association's Label Readability Guidelines that such
factors as contrast, color, type size, substrate, paragraphing, etc. are inter-related in a complex way on labeling,
such that goal- oriented flexibility is perhaps the most important principle in assuring prominence to special label
language. That is to say, specifying a box, when boxed labeling may already be stipulated under NLEA regulations,
is not necessarily as good a way to ensure prominence to label language as is a more flexible approach whose goal is to
ensure that the language is conspicuous, prominent and clearly distinguishable from other labeling. 




2. Agency Response 



FDA considered the following questions in evaluating and responding to the labeling issues raised in the citizen
petitions: (1) Should label warning statements that alert users to the potential dangers that iron-containing products
pose to young children be required on these products? (2) If so, what legal authority does the agency have to require
such statements on food and drug products? (3) What should the warning be required to state? and (4) How should the warning
appear on the label?

a. 

Should label warning statements be required for iron-containing products?

 Based on the data in the AAPCC and AG 
petitions and in the CPSC case reports, iron-containing products 
can cause injury, including serious injury, and death when 
children gain access to these products. FDA finds from these 
data that the potential for harm exists for all three types of 
iron-containing products available, i.e., multi-vitamin/mineral 
supplements that contain iron, iron supplements, and iron-containing drugs. 


 Supporting this finding are the data cited in Tables 1, 2, 
and 3 that show that, since 1983, at least 40 deaths have been 
attributed to the accidental ingestion of iron supplements and 
iron-containing drugs, and that, since 1986, nearly 190 
poisonings that were life threatening or that resulted in 
permanent injury, and over 2,000 poisonings requiring some form 
of treatment, have resulted from accidental ingestion of adult 
iron-containing products. 


 Further support is provided by the data in the CPSC case 
reports, which show 80 ingestions of iron leading to hospital 
emergency room visits with varying types of injury, including 
vomiting, lethargy, diarrhea, and elevated serum iron (see Table 
6). 


 The data in Tables 4 and 6 show that in several documented 
poisoning incidents, children have ingested 30, 40, 50, or more 
tablets of iron-containing products when these amounts of tablets 
were accessible. Aside from the potential for such ingestion of 
iron-containing supplements and drugs to be fatal, the 
consequences of ingesting even multi-vitamin/mineral type 
products in these amounts is evident from Table 8. This table 
shows that an amount of iron that may produce symptoms of iron 
poisoning (i.e., 25 mg/kg) can be ingested by a 10 kg child if 
the child consumes 25 tablets containing 10 mg of iron each or 
approximately 14 tablets containing 18 mg each. (Ten mg and 18 
mg of iron are the amounts typically contained in multi-vitamin/mineral supplements with iron including children's

vitamins.) Based upon the data in Tables 4 and 6, ingestion of 
this many tablets is not atypical. Thus, FDA finds that injury 
can result anytime a small child is able to gain access to even 
the lowest potency iron-containing products available. 


 Further, the fact that over 2,000 reported poisoning 
incidents of varying severity have been recorded in recent years 
(Tables 2 and 3), and the fact that AAPCC reports that accidental 
iron poisoning is presently the leading cause of pediatric 
poisoning deaths, lead FDA to find that pediatric iron poisonings 
have occurred, and continue to occur, with significant frequency. 
Further, FDA finds that the fact that these poisonings continue 
to occur, even though there have been over 40 deaths from 
accidental iron ingestion (See Table 1), strongly suggests that 
many adults are not aware of the potential for serious harm or 
death in young children from accidental ingestion of iron-containing products. Support for this finding is provided
by 
statements made by the parents of the victims in several of the 
poisoning incidents, described in the case reports obtained from 
CPSC as follows: 


 (1) ``The mother stated that she thought the pills (prenatal 
iron pills) were just vitamins and would not harm the victim'' 
(Ref. 21, case report No. 10).

(2) ``She (the mother) said that she did not think he (the 
victim) had taken very many pills at the time, and that she was 
unaware of the danger of iron overdose'' (Ref. 21, case report No. 
20). 
(3) ``The mother stated that she called her sister and asked 
if iron tablets could hurt the victim. The mother stated, that 
her sister told her that the tablets were just vitamins and would 
not hurt the victim'' (Ref. 21, case report No. 37). 
(4) ``The mother thought at the most if her son had taken 
more than a couple of the vitamins he would simply throw up and 
that would be the end of it. She had no idea what a dangerous 
situation her child was in'' (Ref. 22, case report No. 62). 
(5) ``Later in the day (after child had ingested 30-40 iron 
tablets) the mother went to the pharmacy to get a prescription 
for the daughter's ear infection and she asked the pharmacist 
about the possible ingestion of iron tablets'' (Ref. 22, case 
report No. 73). 
In addition, as stated above, the data presented by the AG 
petition show that few, if any, of the commonly available iron-containing products have carried label statements
using terms 
such as ``WARNING'' or ``CAUTION.'' Because these terms are 
universally accepted as connoting danger, they could be expected 
to promote awareness among adults of the danger that these 
products pose to young children and of the importance of 
preventing children from gaining access to these products. 
Therefore, because the data demonstrate that: (1) Iron-containing products of all types can cause injury or death
when 
small children gain access to them, (2) more than 2,000 
poisonings have occurred over approximately 7 years and continue 
to occur, (3) a small child is at risk of injury any time he or 
she gains unlimited access to any iron-containing product, and 
(4) many adults are not aware of the potential for serious harm 
posed by iron-containing products, FDA tentatively concludes that 
it should require label warning statements for iron-containing 
products to ensure that adults are fully informed as to the 
potential of these products to cause devastating outcomes and, 
thus, to promote the safe handling and storage of these products. 
b. 

FDA's legal authority to require label warning 
statements on foods.

 FDA's authority to require label warning 
statements on food products derives from sections 201(n), 
403(a)(1), and 701(a) of the act (21 U.S.C. 321(n), 343(a)(1), 
and 371(a)). Under section 403(a)(1) of the act, a food is 
misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading in any 
particular. Section 201(n) of the act states, ``If an article 
(e.g., a food product) is alleged to be misbranded because the 
labeling or advertising is misleading, then in determining 
whether the labeling or advertising is misleading there shall be 
taken into account (among other things) not only representations 
made or suggested by statement, word, design, device, or any 
combination thereof, but also the extent to which the labeling or 
advertising fails to reveal facts material in the light of such 
representations or material with respect to consequences which 
may result from the use of the article to which the labeling or 
advertising relates under the conditions of use prescribed in the 
labeling or advertising thereof or under such conditions of use 
as are customary or usual.'' These statutory provisions, combined 
with section 701(a) of the act, which grants the agency authority 
to promulgate regulations for the efficient enforcement of the 
act, clearly authorize FDA to promulgate a regulation designed to 
ensure that persons using iron-containing multi-vitamin/mineral 
products and iron supplements will receive information that is 
material with respect to consequences that may result from the 
use of the product under its labeled conditions or under 
conditions that are customary or usual. 
FDA requires label warning statements on certain types of 
protein products represented for use in reducing weight. The 
agency adopted this requirement in response to a series of sudden 
deaths of individuals, mostly young women, who consumed high 
protein, very low calorie diets ( 101.70(d)(21 CFR 101.17(d)). 
Use of such diets was intended to achieve rapid weight loss. As 
a result of these deaths, which occurred in the late 1970's, FDA 
promulgated the warning requirement for such products to ensure 
that users of these products are aware of the potential adverse 
consequences of very low calorie protein diets, to indicate the 
necessity for appropriate medical supervision for persons on such 
diets, and to identify individuals, i.e., infants, children, or 
pregnant or nursing women, who should not use these products (49 
FR 13679, April 6, 1984).

FDA's legal authority under sections 201(n), 403(a)(1), and 701(a) of the act to require a warning statement on dry,
whole protein products was upheld in 

Council for Responsible Nutrition 

v. 

Goyan

, Food Drug Cosm. L. Rep. (CCH)   38,057 (D.D.C. 1980). In that case, the plaintiff asserted that the fatal consequences
arising from the use of dry, whole protein products while dieting were not the result of the customary or usual use of
these products, but rather, the result of unusual misuse of such products. Based on FDA's showing that the consumption
of dry protein products could occur in the course of a diet, and that, under certain circumstances in dieting, serious
adverse effects could arise from such use of these products, the court found that FDA properly invoked sections 201(n),
403(a)(1), and 701(a) of the act to impose a requirement that manufacturers warn consumers of the consequences that
could result from the use of such products.
The facts presented by the evidence on iron poisonings parallel those that led the agency to require a warning on protein
products. The use of iron-containing products in households where children are present is in no way an unusual practice.
Multi-vitamin/mineral supplements with iron are routinely taken by children, and products of this type specifically
intended for use by children are widely available and commonly sold. Iron supplements and adult vitamin/mineral
supplements with iron are frequently taken by pregnant women (often with a prescription) and other women of child-bearing
age because they require more iron than other adults (see discussion in section I.A. of this document). Yet, the evidence
on poisonings and deaths shows that the use of any type of iron-containing product in such households can readily lead
to accidental injury or death if children gain access to the products, even though the products are not intended to
be used by children or to be taken in the numbers in which iron-containing tablets or capsules are consumed when poisonings
occur. Thus, 

Council for Responsible Nutrition 

v. 

Goyan

 provides strong support for the agency's authority to require label warning statements concerning the risk of accidental
poisoning from iron-containing food products.
Based upon FDA's authority under sections 201(n), 403(a)(1), and 701(a) of the act, the agency proposes to require
that manufacturers of iron-containing dietary supplements (i.e., children's and adult's multi-vitamin/mineral
supplements that contain iron and products intended for use as iron supplements) disclose information about their
products in the form of a label warning statement that would appear on such products in the manner described below.



c. FDA's legal authority to require label warning statements for drugs

. The act authorizes FDA to regulate the marketing of drug products to ensure that such products are properly labeled.
To carry out the public health protection purposes of the act, FDA, among other things, monitors drug labeling to ensure
that it provides accurate information about drug products.
Under section 502(a) of the act (21 U.S.C. 352), a drug product is misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading
in any particular. The provisions of section 201(n) of the act concerning failure of the labeling to reveal material
facts are applicable to drugs as well as to foods in determining whether labeling is misleading. In addition, under
sections 505(d) and (e) of the act (21 U.S.C. 355(d) and (e)), FDA must refuse to approve a new drug application, and
may withdraw approval for a product, if the product's labeling is false or misleading in any particular.
These statutory provisions, together with section 701(a) of the act, clearly authorize FDA to promulgate a regulation
designed to ensure that patients using drugs will receive information that is material with respect to consequences
that may result from the use of a product. (See 

Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association 

v. 

Food and Drug Administration

, 484 F. Supp. 1179 (D. Del. 1980), aff'd per curiam, 634 F.2d 106 (3d Cir. 1980).)
The act also authorizes FDA to regulate the marketing of drug products to ensure that such products are safe and effective
for their intended uses. Iron-containing drug products are not safe for their intended use as currently labeled,
in part because the labeling fails to warn of iron-containing products' toxic effects in children. Adults are, therefore,
not aware of the need to prevent children from ingesting these products. Because the labeling fails to warn adequately
that these products may produce toxic effects in children, iron-containing products are not being used as intended;
that is, even though they are not intended for children, they are handled in a way that permits their ingestion by children.

The act anticipates that new information about the safety or effectiveness of marketed drugs may require changes
in labeling to reflect necessary limitations on use or to warn of previously unanticipated hazards (see e.g., 21 U.S.C.
355(e)). FDA has required by regulation that manufacturers provide warning statements for specific drug products
(e.g., drugs for internal use which contain mineral oil, 21 CFR 201.302; isoproterenol inhalation preparations,
21 CFR 201.305; acetophenetidin (phenacetin)-containing preparations, 21 CFR 201.309). The impetus for requiring
warnings for each of these products or product classes was evidence of risk in a specific patient population or from
a specific use of the product. FDA responded to these risks by requiring warnings to help patients use prescription
drug products more safely and effectively. For example, given the particular risk of severe paradoxical bronchoconstriction
associated with repeated, excessive use of isoproterenol inhalation preparations, FDA requires that warning information
to patients be included as part of the label and as part of the instructions included in the package dispensed to patients
(See 21 CFR 201.305). The specified warning statement may be placed on the immediate container with a statement to
the pharmacist not to remove it or may be included in a package with instructions to pharmacists to place the warning
on the container prior to dispensing (see 21 CFR 201.305(c)(2)).
Based upon FDA's authority under sections 201(n), 502(a), 505 and 701(a) of the act, the agency is proposing to require
that manufacturers of prescription iron-containing products disclose information about the risks presented by
their products in the form of a warning statement that would appear on such products in the manner described below.
d. 

What should the label warning be required to state? 

FDA has considered what information should be required in the warning statement to ensure that, as required by sections
201(n), 403(a)(1), 502(a), and 505 of the act, users of iron-containing products are made aware of the potential consequences
of their use, i.e., that the labeling of iron-containing products states the facts that are material with respect
to the consequences that may result from the use of these products. The proposed warning statements in the AG and NDMA
petitions contained the various information elements as shown in Table 9. FDA tentatively concludes that to fulfill
the requirements of the act, the warning statement should incorporate some elements from both of these petitions,
as well as other elements that are designed to ensure that the statement performs its function. In reaching this tentative
conclusion, FDA considered several factors.
FDA agrees with the AG petition that the term ``Warning'' is necessary to alert the user to the potential consequences
of the use of the product, that is, to the dangers of iron overdose. This term is universally accepted as denoting danger.
FDA tentatively concludes that the potential for iron-containing products to cause death or serious injury any time
a small child gains access to the product warrants the use of this term. 
FDA tentatively concludes that the statement must bear the instruction to ``Keep away from children.'' Because a
child is at risk of serious injury or death any time he or she gains access to iron-containing products, this statement
is a material fact about the consequences of use of the product and is also necessary to ensure the safe use of the product.

<TEXT>
 

FDA also recognizes that the warning needs to be crafted to 
reflect the type of packaging used. Iron-containing products may 
be packaged in unit-dose packages, e.g., blister packs, or in 
containers with closures, e.g., a bottle with a cap. FDA 
tentatively concludes that for iron-containing products packaged 
in unit-dose packages, the warning statement should include the 
instruction ``Keep in original package until each use.'' This 
statement instructs the user not to misuse the product by 
removing more dosage units from their individual packs than will 
be ingested at one time. This instruction is important because 
such misuse can result in poisoning if children gain access to 
the dosage units that have been removed from their original 
packaging. This instruction was not specifically requested by 
any of the petitions. Because some incidents of pediatric iron 
poisoning have occurred after adults removed multiple dosage 
units from their original containers and stored them in nonchild-resistant vessels (see section I.C. of this document),
however, 
the agency tentatively concludes that this statement is necessary 
to ensure that the product is properly used. 

The agency concurs with the NDMA petition that the statement 
``Close Tightly'' should be included in the warning statement for 
containers with closures. Such a statement provides information 
on how to maintain the child-resistance of the container. FDA 
finds that this message is a material fact. FDA bases this 
finding, in part, on the fact that some incidents of iron 
poisoning have occurred even though the product was in child-resistant packaging. Children were able to gain access
to 
iron products because the child-resistant closure was not 
properly secured (See section I.C. of this document). Thus, to 
ensure that iron-containing products are used safely, the child-resistance of the packaging must be maintained,
and FDA 
tentatively concludes that inclusion of the statement ``Close 
Tightly'' is necessary to ensure that condition of use is 
maintained. 

FDA also tentatively concludes that the label must include the information ``Contains iron, which can harm or cause
death to a child.'' This statement informs the user or the serious and potentially life-threatening nature of the
consequences that can occur when a child ingests an uncontrolled amount of these products.

<DOCNO> FR941006-1-00133 </DOCNO>

<TEXT>
 

FDA also tentatively concludes that the label must state: 
``If a child accidentally swallows this product, call a doctor or 
a poison control center immediately.'' FDA agrees with the NDMA 
petition that treatment-oriented information should be included 
on the label because it informs attending persons in a poisoning 
incident of the need to take immediate action that could save the 
child's life and about what that action should be. Thus, it 
relates directly to the consequences of use of the product. 


FDA does not believe that the warning statement should be 
based upon or contain information relating to the potency of the 
iron product (i.e., different statements for products above and 
below 30 mg per dosage unit as requested by the AG petition, or 
reference to ``large doses'' of iron as a factor in determining 
whether poisoning may occur). The agency tentatively finds that 
such statements could cause members of the public to attempt to 
determine whether a large dose has been taken in a possible 
poisoning incident. Because most people are not capable of 
determining what dosage of iron may be nontoxic, toxic, or 
capable of causing serious harm or death, qualified medical or 
poison control personnel should determine the significance of the 
dose a child has ingested. 


Nor does there appear to be any reason to require that the 
statement include reference to the specific types of consequences 
that may arise from acute overdosage, i.e., nausea, vomiting, 
cardiovascular collapse, as requested by the AG petition. FDA does not believe that this information would materially
add to 
the label statement that overdose can cause harm or death, and 
fears that it may lead to the erroneous conclusion that, because 
a child does not exhibit one of the listed symptoms, the child is 
not in danger. 
e. 

How should the warning appear on the label? 

FDA agrees 
with the AGs' contention that the warning statement should appear 
prominently on the label of iron-containing products to 
effectively convey its message. Further, the act specifically 
requires, in sections 403(f) and 502(c), that information 
required to appear on the label of a food or a drug be 
prominently placed and appear with such conspicuousness, as 
compared with other printed matter, as to render it likely to be 
read by the ordinary individual under customary conditions of 
use. 


However, the AG petition provided no evidence to support the 
specific presentation elements that it requested for the warning 
statement, i.e., that it be boxed, in boldface type, and in a 
color that contrasts with the background and with other printed 
material on the label or labeling. The agency is not aware of 
any basis on which it can conclude that any of these specific 
elements are necessary to ensure that the statement appears on 
the label in a prominent and conspicuous manner. 

Further, in the agency's rulemaking that mandated warning 
statements on certain protein products, the agency decided not to 
mandate specific requirements for letter size and other format 
elements. However, the agency did require that the warning 
statement appear ``prominently and conspicuously on the principal 
display panel of the package label'' (21 CFR 101.17). FDA made a 
determination to give manufacturers flexibility to design their 
own label warning formats, while ensuring that the statement is 
prominent and conspicuous, so that consumers are given adequate 
notice of the information contained in the warning (47 FR 25379 
at 25382, June 11, 1982). In addressing the placement of the 
label warning, the agency noted that the seriousness and nature 
of the risk associated with the use of protein products in very 
low calorie diets was sufficient to require placement of the 
warning statement on the principal display panel (49 FR 13679 at 
13689). 

Section 201(k) of the act defines the term ``label'' as ``a 
display of written, printed, or graphic matter upon the immediate 
container of any article'' and further states that a requirement 
``that any word, statement, or other information appear on the 
label shall not be considered to be complied with unless such 
word, statement, or other information also appears on the outside 
container or wrapper if any there be, of the retail package of 
such article * * *.'' Thus, if FDA requires a label warning 
statement to appear on the immediate container of iron-containing 
products, it would also have to appear on the retail package of such a product if that package is not the immediate container.


As stated above, the fact that iron-containing products have 
resulted in reports of 2,000 poisonings in children over 
approximately 7 years provides evidence that many adults are not 
aware of the potential for serious harm posed by iron-containing 
products. Based on this fact, FDA tentatively finds that there 
are sufficient grounds to require that the label warning 
statement be printed directly on the immediate container of the 
product, i.e., the container that holds the tablet or capsule, 
and on the principal display panel of the retail package, i.e., 
an outer box, if such package is not the immediate container 
(many iron-containing products are packaged in this manner). If 
a product is sold in unit-dose packaging, this requirement will 
mean that the product will have to bear the warning directly on 
each unit-dose package or on a strip of unit-dose packages in 
such a way that separating the unit dose packages would not 
destroy the warning labeling.

The placement of the warning statement on the principal 
display panel of the retail package will make it likely that the 
warning statement will be seen at the time the product is 
purchased. The statement will inform the purchaser of the 
product's potential to cause poisoning and of the need to keep 
the product away from children when it is brought into the house. 
FDA tentatively concludes that placement of the warning statement 
on the principal display panel is necessary to fulfill the 
requirement of sections 403(f) and 502(c) of the act, that 
information required to appear on the label of a food or a drug be placed with conspicuousness (as compared with other
printed 
matter) as to render it likely to be read by the ordinary 
individual under customary conditions of use. Moreover, 
placement of the warning statement on the principal display panel 
is consistent with the requirement that FDA established for 
protein product warning statements discussed previously. In both 
cases, the products in question could cause serious, even life-threatening, problems if misused. Thus, FDA tentatively

concludes that the standard of conspicuousness established in the 
protein products case should also be adopted for iron-containing 
products. 

The agency tentatively concludes that placement of the 
warning statement on the immediate container is also necessary to 
fulfill the requirement of sections 403(f) and 502(c) of the act 
because, under customary conditions of use, the retail container 
is frequently disposed of, and individuals other than the 
purchaser may use the product. Therefore, the warning statement 
must be printed on the immediate container if this statement is 
to perform its function throughout the life of the product. 


Regulating the placement of the warning is consistent with 
other labeling requirements that the agency has imposed. In 21 
CFR 201.314(h)(1) and (h)(2), FDA has required that the labeling 
of orally or rectally administered aspirin and aspirin-containing 
drug products intended for sale without prescription bear a 
warning that reads: ``WARNING: Children and teenagers should not 
use this medicine for chicken pox or flu symptoms before a doctor is consulted about Reye syndrome, a rare but serious
illness 
reported to be associated with aspirin.'' The warning must appear 
on the immediate container labeling. In cases where the 
immediate container is not the retail package, the retail package 
must also bear the warning statement. (see 51 FR 8180, March 7, 
1986).

<PARENT> FR941006-1-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

FDA tentatively concludes that the objectives of the 
proposed regulation regarding the packaging and labeling of iron-containing products will be best met if the agency
requires that 
the proposed warnings appear on the immediate container. In case 
the strip packaging or individual unit-dose packages are removed 
from the box in which they are sold to the consumer, or in case a 
strip of unit-dose packages is transferred by a pharmacist to a 
vial, each unit-dose package, or strip of unit dose packages, 
would bear the warning that FDA considers essential to the safe 
use of these products. The warning would remind adults not to 
remove the iron-containing products from the unit-dose package. In addition, it would ensure that each time an adult
takes one of 
these products, he or she is reminded of the danger that the 
product poses to children. 




In addition, if the warning accompanies each tablet or group 
of tablets, an adult who finds a child eating the product will 
know to call for help immediately and will know, when asked by a 
health care professional, that the ingested tablets contain iron. 




FDA is not proposing specific requirements for the graphics 
(e.g., type size, bold type) of the warning statement but is 
proposing to require that the label warning appear prominently 
and conspicuously on the immediate container of the product and on the principal display panel of the retail package,
so that 
consumers are given adequate notice of the information contained 
in the warning. These proposed requirements for the warning 
statement are consistent with the requirement FDA established for 
protein products. FDA tentatively concludes that they will 
effectively achieve, through placement rather than graphical 
requirements, the objective sought by the AG petition of reaching 
consumers who have no knowledge of iron's hazards. 




If FDA adopts the regulations that it is proposing, 
manufacturers will have the flexibility, as requested in the NDMA 
petition, to design their own label and warning notice formats. 
The agency is requesting comments on the most efficient way to 
ensure that warnings on the immediate container will accompany 
every tablet until the time it is used. Suggestions about the 
placement and design of unit-dose packaging that can best 
accommodate the required warnings are invited. 




FDA also specifically solicits comments on whether the 
general requirement that the label warning appear prominently and 
conspicuously on the label is adequate. Should the agency more 
explicitly define in its regulation the level of prominence and 
conspicuousness that it expects? If so, what should the agency 
require? The agency notes, for example, that in a final rule 
that required a new warning on Reye syndrome for aspirin, it 
specifically stated that the requirement of ``prominence'' in its 
regulations meant that manufacturers of aspirin and aspirin-containing drug products had to use an attention-getting

statement, such as ``see new warning'' on the label for at least 1 
year (53 FR 21633, 21635, June 9, 1988). Similarly, in the final 
rule on nutrition labeling that FDA adopted in response to the 
Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990, FDA specified a 
number of format elements to ensure that the nutrition facts 
label would be readily observable and comprehensible (see 58 FR 
2079, January 6, 1993). FDA requests comments on whether, to 
ensure that the warning statement will have its intended effect, 
the agency should specify more completely how the warning should 
be presented on iron-containing products. 


3. Proposed Labeling Requirements 


Having tentatively concluded that label warning statements 
should be required on iron-containing products, and having 
evaluated the information that the warning statement should 
include, FDA is proposing to amend its regulations by 
adding new  101.17(e) for foods, and new  310.55 for drugs, to 
require label warning statements for iron-containing 
products offered in solid oral dosage form. As noted above, 
under these proposed regulations, the warning 
statement that must be used will depend upon how the product 
is packaged. For products that are packaged in unit-dose packaging (e.g., blister packs) the agency is proposing
to 
require the following warning: 



WARNING_Keep away from children. Keep in 
original package until each use. Contains 
iron, which can harm or cause death to a 
child. If a child accidentally swallows this 
product, call a doctor or poison control 
center immediately.

 

Under this proposal, this warning statement will be required 
for all iron-containing products packaged in unit-dose packaging. 
Therefore, it would be required to appear: (1) On the labeling 
of products containing 30 mg or more iron per dosage unit, which 
are subject to the proposed requirement for unit-dose packaging 
described below (see section III.B. of this document); and (2) 
on the labeling of products that contain less than 30 mg iron per 
dosage unit but that are packaged voluntarily in unit-dose 
packaging. 
For products that contain less than 30 mg iron per dosage 
unit and that are packaged in any form of packaging other than 
unit-dose packaging, e.g., containers with child-resistant 
closures, the agency is proposing to require the following 
warning:

 

WARNING_Close tightly and keep away from 
children. Contains iron, which can harm or 
cause death to a child. If a child 
accidentally swallows this product, call a 
doctor or poison control center immediately.

<TEXT>
 

The agency may conduct focus group research to evaluate 
consumer understanding of the proposed warning messages and to 
ensure that the messages are not misleading. Focus group 
research involves gathering small, representative groups of 
consumers (no more than nine consumers per group) and leading 
then in a directed discussion of the research topic. For the 
present research, consumers will provide feedback as to their 
level of understanding of the warnings and the degree to which 
the specific wording of the messages is believable, relevant, 
confusing, or irritating. The agency intends to consider the 
results of the focus group research in arriving at any warning 
statement that is included in the final regulations. FDA will 
make a report on the results of its research available for public 
comment before it issues the final regulations.



B. Packaging 


1. Review of Packaging Issues in Citizen Petitions 


Two of the citizen petitions suggested that FDA take action 
with respect to the packaging of iron-containing drugs and 
dietary supplements. Both petitions recommended packaging 
requirements as a means of reducing pediatric poisonings from 
ingestion of multiple doses of drugs and dietary supplements 
containing 30 mg or more iron per dosage unit. 
The AG citizen petition requested that FDA use its authority 
under the act to require that all iron-containing drugs and 
dietary supplements containing 30 mg or more iron per dosage unit 
be packaged in child-resistant blister packs. 
The NDMA petition recommended that FDA incorporate into its 
regulations the NDMA-initiated voluntary program to address 
pediatric poisonings by such iron-containing products. This 
voluntary program includes, in part, a proviso that all iron-containing products currently subject to CPSC's special
packaging 
regulations that contain 30 mg or more of iron per dosage unit be 
packaged in CRP's, and that there be no exemption to CPSC's 
child-resistant special packaging requirements for these types of 
products. As discussed previously, NDMA's voluntary program also 
specifies labeling statements and includes an educational 
program. Implicit in NDMA's recommendation is the view that 
CRC's, labeling warning statements, and consumer education 
programs are sufficient to ensure the safe use of iron-containing 
products. 


2. Agency Response 


FDA considered the following questions in evaluating and 
responding to the packaging issues raised in the citizen

statements alone sufficiently reduce pediatric iron poisonings?

of iron poisoning deaths? (3) Are additional packaging 
requirements necessary to ensure the safe use of certain iron-containing products? (4) What is FDA's legal authority

a. 

Can educational efforts and label warning statements 
significantly reduce pediatric iron poisonings? 

FDA agrees with 
NDMA that educating consumers on the proper use of CRC's and on 
the hazards posed by iron-containing drugs and supplements is 
very important. However, based on the available evidence, even 
if all CRC's were properly used, these closures could not have 
prevented the majority of the 37 reported fatalities. Improper 
use of CRC's was reported in only 4 of the 21 (19 percent) 
pediatric iron fatalities known to involve child-resistant 
packaging (Table 2). Educational programs and label warning 
statements should help to increase proper use of reclosable 
CRC's, and thereby help to prevent some pediatric iron-poisonings. However, FDA knows of no information showing
that a consumer education program, either that recommended by NDMA or 
any other such program, will be adequate to ensure that children 
will not be able to defeat even properly closed CRC's, or that 
improper use of such closures will cease. In the absence of such 
information, FDA believes that measures beyond consumer education 
programs are necessary to ensure that the use of certain iron-containing products is safe. 
FDA also tentatively finds that label warning statements 
will not be sufficient to ensure the safe use of these products. 
This tentative conclusion is based on the fact that label warning 
statements do not in any way bar access to the product. 
Label statements are an important educational tool for making 
adults aware of the significant consequences for young children 
if they gain access to the product. Young children, 
however, cannot read and have little judgment. Thus, a warning 
statement is likely to have little or no effect on their efforts 
to gain access.

The available data show that poisonings are occurring in 
large measure because of the efforts of children. Table 4 shows 
that in 9 of the 21 reported pediatric poisoning deaths that 
involved iron-containing products packaged in containers with 
CRC's, the victims gained access to multiple doses of iron-containing product by their own efforts or through the
efforts of 
another child. Most of these children were under 51 months of age. Thus, a label warning statement is unlikely to have
any 
meaning or significance to them. 



FDA requests comments on its tentative conclusion that label 
warning statements are not sufficient to ensure that the use of 
certain iron-containing products will be safe. Comments that 
bear on the effectiveness of labeling warning statements to deter 
young children from directly gaining access to these products 
will be most compelling if they contain supporting data and 
information. 



As stated above, FDA believes that label warning statements 
will help to reduce the incidence of pediatric poisoning because 
they will ensure that adults are aware of the pediatric toxicity 
of iron and will encourage responsible adults to properly reclose 
and store iron-containing products. However, FDA is concerned 
that warning statements alone will not prevent the misuse of 
CRP's that has contributed to the epidemic of iron poisonings of 
children. FDA notes that CRP's themselves are a de facto warning 
that the contents of the package present hazards for children. 
Yet, in 21 of the 26 pediatric poisoning deaths in which the type 
of packaging was reported, the product was packaged in containers 
with CRC's (Table 4). 



Furthermore, the effectiveness of label warning 
statements is generally considered to be dependent on 
several factors including, but not necessarily limited 
to: The personal relevance of the warning 
information; familiarity with the warning information; perceived hazard from the product; and desensitization
or 
habituation to warnings after repeated exposures (Ref. 24). 
Moreover, a report on the effectiveness of a labeling and 
educational program to prevent pediatric poisonings from 
accidental ingestion of prescription drugs shows that labeling 
and educational programs are not always sufficient to prevent 
pediatric poisonings, and that, in some instances, additional 
packaging safeguards are necessary to ensure the safe use of 
certain substances (Ref. 25). Therefore, FDA tentatively 
concludes that label warning statements will not be sufficient to 
ensure the safe use of certain iron-containing products. 



FDA finds that iron-containing drugs and dietary supplements 
pose a unique hazard to young children. The pediatric hazard 
presented by these products is directly related to their iron 
content. As discussed above in section I.B. of this 
document, ingestion of 25 mg or more iron per kg of body weight 
is considered a toxic dose, and ingestion of 100 to 200 mg iron 
per kg of body weight can be lethal. Once a potentially 
lethal dose of iron has been ingested and absorbed, medical 
intervention to halt the toxic progression of iron poisoning is 
difficult and often unsuccessful. Successful treatment for 
iron poisoning is determined primarily by the amount of iron 
ingested and how rapidly medical intervention occurs. 
In light of the risk of pediatric iron poisonings with 
irreversible and potentially fatal consequences that is 
presented by higher potency iron-containing products, and of the 
inherent limitations on the effectiveness of labeling and educational programs, FDA tentatively concludes that
it would be 
inappropriate to rely solely on these measures to ensure the safe 
use of these products. 



b. 

Are noncomplying CRP's a principal cause of iron 
poisoning deaths? 

The NDMA contends that new packaging 
requirements beyond those outlined in its petition are not 
necessary to reduce the incidence of pediatric iron poisonings. 
The NDMA petition asserts that the available data on pediatric 
iron-poisonings are deficient to the extent that it cannot be 
determined whether products associated with the poisonings were 
packaged in compliance with CPSC's packaging requirements, and it 
suggests that iron-containing products packaged in noncompliant 
CRP's are the principle cause of pediatric iron-poisonings. 
However, NDMA provided no information to support its view. 



FDA has carefully examined the available information on 
pediatric iron poisonings and could find no evidence to support 
the NDMA's contention that the iron-containing products 
associated with these poisonings were packaged in CRP's that did 
not comply with regulations established by CPSC. In the absence 
of such evidence, FDA can find no basis on which to conclude that 
noncompliant, child-resistant special packaging is the primary 
cause of pediatric iron-poisonings. 



c. 

Are additional packaging requirements appropriate? 

FDA 
tentatively concludes that full compliance with CPSC's CRP 
requirements, even if there are warning statements in labeling of iron-containing products and appropriate educational
programs, 
will not be adequate to ensure the safe use of certain iron-containing drugs and dietary supplements if bottle and
closure 
packaging were to continue as the predominant means of packaging 
such products. FDA recognizes that each of these measures either 
has been successful in limiting the number of poisonings or can 
be reasonably expected to be effective in reducing the number of 
poisonings. However, given the potentially fatal outcome that 
can result from pediatric iron-poisoning, FDA is not persuaded 
that these measures are adequate to ensure the safety of the use 
of certain iron-containing drugs and dietary supplements. FDA 
tentatively concludes that to reduce the incidence of pediatric 
iron poisonings to a level that would permit the agency to 
conclude that there is a reasonable certainty of no harm from the 
use of these products, it is necessary to require a specific type 
of physical barrier to access these products. Therefore, FDA 
tentatively concludes that additional packaging requirements are 
necessary. 



FDA requests comments on this tentative conclusion. The 
agency is particularly interested in receiving comments that bear 
on the effectiveness of different types of packaging to limit 
pediatric access to toxic amounts of iron. Comments will be most 
persuasive if they are supported by studies and other data and 
information.

d. 

Consideration of legal authority of FDA and other 
agencies to require specific packaging measures for foods and 
drugs. 

In its consideration of what action to take concerning 
the packaging of iron-containing drugs and dietary supplements to 
ensure their safe use, FDA recognized that it must act within the 
limits of its statutory authority and consider the statutory 
authority of other government agencies. As noted above, under 
the PPPA, CPSC has authority to regulate the packaging of 
household substances. Under the PPPA, CPSC can establish special 
packaging performance standards. Thus, by regulation, CPSC has 
established special packaging standards and performance criteria 
for special packaging, 16 CFR 1700.15 and 1700.20, respectively. 
However, the PPPA specifically limits CPSC from establishing 
regulations that require specific packaging designs, product 
content, and package quantity for household substances, including 
food and drugs. 



i. 

Packaging for iron-containing dietary supplements. 

The 
act provides FDA with broad authority to ensure that food is safe 
and wholesome. In particular, the act prohibits the adulteration 
of food in sections 301 and 402 (21 U.S.C. 331 and 342) and 
requires, in sections 409(a) (21 U.S.C. 348(a)) and 402(a)(2)(C), 
that all food additives be listed for use by FDA before they are 
added to food. 



In section 409(a), the act deems a food additive to be 
unsafe unless its use conforms to the conditions specified in the 
listing regulation. These conditions include, but are not 
limited to, specifications as to the particular food or classes 
of food to which the additive may be added, as to the manner in 
which the additive may be added to such food, and any directions 
or other labeling or packaging requirements for such additive 
deemed necessary to ensure the safety of such use (section 
409(c)(1)(A) of the act. Thus, under the act, the agency is 
authorized to specify packaging requirements for a food additive 
when it finds that use of such packaging is necessary to ensure 
the safe use of the additive. 



In section 201(s), the act provides an exemption to the food 
additive definition for substances that are generally recognized 
as safe (GRAS) under the conditions of their intended use. FDA 
has issued regulations delineating conditions under which use of 
certain substances is GRAS. If the conditions of a particular 
use of a substance are not those that are generally recognized as 
safe, the use is not GRAS, but subject to regulation under the 
food additives provisions of the act. 



Should FDA determine that a particular type of packaging is 
necessary to ensure the safe use of iron substances in dietary 
supplements, either as GRAS substances or as listed food additives, then any use of iron substances in dietary supplements

that does not involve use of that type of packaging would 
constitute a use of an unapproved food additive and render the 
dietary supplements adulterated under the act. 



ii. 

Packaging for iron-containing drug products. 

Section 
501(a)(2)(B) of the act (21 U.S.C. 351(a)(2)(B)) states that a 
drug shall be deemed to be adulterated if the methods used in, or 
the facilities or controls used for, its manufacture, processing, 
packing, or holding do not conform to, or are not operated or 
administered in conformity with, current good manufacturing 
practice to assure that such drug meets the requirements of the 
act as to safety and has the identity and strength, and meets the 
quality and purity characteristics, which it purports or is 
represented to possess. 



A drug product may be safe and effective as manufactured but 
used in an unsafe and ineffective manner. Current good 
manufacturing practice is, to some extent, an evolving standard. 
To remain ``current,'' a manufacturer must take into account 
advances in technology as well as new information about the use 
of the product including, but not limited to, information about 
any dangers associated with use of the drug product. 
Manufacturers must use this knowledge to alter, adapt, or change 
their manufacturing procedures to ensure that all possible 
measures have been implemented to eliminate known dangers. 
Therefore, advances in technology and new information about 
dangers associated with a drug product can mean that further 
steps by the manufacturer are necessary to guard against such 
foreseeable dangers, in order to hold the drug product in a 
manner that ensures its safety and, thus, comports with current 
good manufacturing practice.

FDA has promulgated regulations to ensure that, among other things, drug products are held, pending use by the intended
consumer, in a manner that ensures their safety (Parts 210 and 211 (21 CFR parts 210 and 211)). The term ``held'' includes
not only manufacturing and shipping time, but also the time from point of purchase to consumer use. Thus, manufacturers
are responsible for the manner in which their products are held pending actual consumer use, and they are responsible
if the packaging that they use is not adequate to prevent unintended ingestion of iron by children.

The regulations are replete with examples of FDA's authority to regulate the manufacturer beyond the point of shipping
the product from the manufacturing site. For example,  211.94(b) requires that container closure systems
``provide adequate protection against 

foreseeable external factors

 in storage and 

use

 that can cause deterioration or contamination of the drug product (emphasis added).'' This regulation requires
that manufacturers protect against deterioration or contamination occurring during storage of drug products throughout
the chain of distribution, up to the point of use by the consumer.

Under section 501(a)(2)(B) of the act, manufacturers also are responsible for preventing intentional misuse of
a drug product. In 1982, in response to a series of capsule tamperings, FDA promulgated a regulation ( 211.132)
that requires tamper-resistant packaging for all over-the-counter (OTC) human drug products except dermatologics,
dentifrices, and insulin (47 FR 50442). The agency's action assured greater package integrity and product security
beyond the point of manufacture. FDA's authority to require tamper-resistant packaging is found primarily in section
501(a)(2)(B) of the act.

Significantly, the health risk that prompted the tamper-resistant packaging regulation was not attributable directly
to manufacturing or packing practices that contravened the current good manufacturing practice regulations in
effect at that time. Rather, despite compliance with existing regulations, drug product quality was compromised
because of previously unforeseeable and unintended intervention by persons other than the consumer.

Because tamper resistant packaging was a means to obviate a newly apparent danger, and because tamper-resistant
packaging technology was available, current good manufacturing practice mandated that it be used.

Similarly, in 1989, recognizing the persistent vulnerability of the hard-capsule dosage form, FDA amended the tamper-resistant
regulation to require that OTC products marketed in two-piece, hard-gelatin capsules be packaged using at least
two tamper-resistant features (54 FR 5227, February 2, 1989). Likewise, in 1994, the agency proposed to amend the
tamper-resistant regulation to require that the packages for all OTC human drug products marketed in two-piece,
hard-gelatin capsules be sealed (59 FR 2542, January 18, 1994). The proposed amendment is part of ``the agency's continuing
review of the potential public health threat posed by product tampering,'' and was proposed to ``address specific
vulnerabilities in the OTC market and to improve consumer protection.'' (59 FR 2543). In the preamble to the proposed
rule, FDA recognized that, although the packaging used at the time of the latest poisoning incidents met FDA requirements
in effect at that time, the packaging was not designed to reveal visible evidence of tampering. The proposed rule would
change ``tamper-resistant'' to ``tamper-evident'' to underscore the fact that current packaging technology is
not invulnerable to tampering and would require packaging that not only erects barriers to tampering, but also alerts
the consumer to signs of tampering.

In addition, in September 1993, FDA published a regulation that requires the imprinting of solid oral dosage form
drug products for human use (See 58 FR 47948, September 13, 1993). The regulation requires that every such product
be imprinted with a code that allows identification of the drug product and its manufacturer or distributor. The regulation
will ensure, among other things, that consumers and health care professionals will have this information available
in the event of an emergency. The imprinting rule, like the proposed rule for iron-containing products, responds
to concerns that are related to consumer use of drug products rather than concerns focused on the integrity and composition
of such products.

The proposed rule, therefore, like those pertaining to tamper-evident packaging and drug imprinting, is intended
to enhance the safety of drug products, specifically iron-containing drug products. The recent statistical data
available to FDA demonstrate that the current manner of holding iron-containing drug products until their use by
the intended consumer fails to ensure that the drug products will be safe because large numbers of children are ingesting
such products and suffering serious injuries or death. Existing technology permits additional safeguards, such
as child-resistant blister packs, to be used for holding iron-containing drug products. Given the known dangers
and the ability to minimize or eliminate such dangers through the use of existing technology, FDA tentatively concludes
that current good manufacturing practice dictates that unit-dose packaging be used.

e. 

Should child-resistant blister packaging be required?

 Requiring child-resistant blister packaging of iron-containing drugs and supplements, as recommended by the AG
petition, is one packaging approach to reduce the incidence of pediatric iron-poisoning fatalities. This approach
can be viewed as embodying three distinct packaging components: (1) Require unit-dose packaging; (2) require a specific
type of unit-dose packaging (i.e., blister packs); and (3) require CRP's.

FDA recognizes that unit-dose packaging provides certain packaging features that reclosable containers do not
provide. Products packaged in unit-dose packaging require that the packaging be opened for each individual dosage
unit. The additional time and effort needed to open each unit restricts the number of doses available for ingestion
during the time that a child has access to the package. In contrast, a multi-dose reclosable package (i.e., a bottle
and closure) allows a child access to all of its contents once the closure is opened. In addition, the effectiveness
of child-resistant unit-dose packaging does not depend upon adults' properly resecuring a cap as is the case with
reclosable CRP's. Therefore, FDA tentatively concludes that unit-dose packaging of products will contribute in
a significant, over and above the protections provided by warning statements and CRP's, to reduce children's access
to potentially fatal doses of product.

This tentative conclusion is supported by studies of the pediatric accessibility of products in different types
of conventional (i.e., nonchild resistant) packaging. The results from these studies show that unit-dose packaging,
in comparison to snap type and screw cap closure packaging, will limit access to multiple doses of product by young
children. Studies of pediatric accessibility of product packaged in conventional unit-dose ``pouches,'' conventional
unit-dose ``blister cards,'' and containers with conventional ``snap type'' and ``screw cap'' closures have been
reported. Children, 42 to 51 months old, participated in each of these studies. Results from the study of conventional
pouch packaging show that 55.5 percent of the children (n = 200) were unable to access more than eight tablets in 10 min
(Ref. 26). In a similar study of conventional blister card packaging 64 percent of the children (n = 200) were unable
to access more than eight tablets in 10 min (Ref. 27). In contrast, studies of pediatric accessibility of conventional
``snap type'' and ``continuous threaded type'' packaging show that most young children are able to gain access to
products packaged in these types of conventional packaging in a relatively short period of time. Results from studies
of ``snap type'' packaging show that with upward opening forces of less than 3 lb (average 1.9 lb), 96 percent of the
children (n = 650) were able to open such packaging within 12 to 75 seconds (Ref. 28). Results from studies of pediatric
accessibility of conventional, 33 mm diameter, ``screw type'' packaging and having caps with 2, 4, 6, and 8, torque-inch-pounds
(TIP) rotational closing forces, show that approximately 100 percent of the children (n = 400) were able to open the
packaging within an average of 11 seconds. Fifty-four percent of the children were able to open ``screw type'' packaging
with rotational closing forces of 10 to 25 TIP within 71 seconds (Ref. 29).

As noted above, blister packaging is one type of unit-dose packaging. However, FDA does not agree with the AG petition's
contention that blister packaging is necessary to ensure the safe use of iron-containing drugs and supplements.
FDA tentatively finds that requiring a specific type of unit-dose packaging may be more restrictive than necessary
if other types of unit-dose packaging accomplish the same objective. As discussed above, other types of conventional
unit-dose packaging provide a comparable length of time for children to open as that required by conventional blister
packaging.

With regard to the child-resistant component of the AG petition's recommendation, FDA notes that CPSC has established
regulations that require CRP's for iron-containing drugs and dietary supplements in packages that contain 250 mg
or more total iron (16 CFR 1700.14(a)(12) and (13)). In addition, CPSC has promulgated regulations for performance
standards to establish the effectiveness of CRP's (16 CFR 1700.20). FDA finds that establishing CRP's standards
for iron-containing drugs and dietary supplements therefore would be redundant and could place an unnecessary regulatory
burden on manufacturers of such iron-containing products. Furthermore, requiring CRP's for all iron-containing
products with 30 mg or more iron per dosage unit would circumvent the intention of the PPPA to allow access by elderly
and handicapped persons who are unable to use such household substances when packaged in compliance with CRP's requirements.
Therefore, FDA is not proposing to separately require CRP's of iron-containing drugs and dietary supplements.

3. Proposed Packaging Requirements 




FDA is proposing to amend its regulations to establish safe 
conditions of use for iron-containing products by requiring that 
all such products that contain 30 mg or more iron per dosage unit 
be packaged in nonreusable, unit-dose packaging. FDA tentatively 
concludes that the use of iron and iron salts in products at 
potencies at or above 30 mg iron per dosage unit is not safe 
(and, therefore, is not GRAS) unless the food to which it is added, 
or the drug which contains it, is packaged in a manner that is 
adequate to prevent unintended ingestion by children. Thus, 
while iron and several of its salts will continue to be listed as 
GRAS under 21 CFR part 182 for use as dietary supplements and 
under part 184 (21 CFR part 184) for use as nutrient supplements, 
FDA is proposing to add  170.55, which will require unit-dose 
packaging when iron or iron salts are used at a level of 30 mg or 
more per dosage unit in dietary supplements. Section 170.55 will 
also apply to approved food additive uses of iron salts in foods 
for special dietary and nutritional uses. Unit-dose packaging of 
drug products that contain 30 mg or more of iron per dosage unit 
is required under proposed  310.518(a). 


a. 

Rationale for requiring unit-dose packaging for iron-containing products with 30 mg or more iron per dosage unit.


FDA 
is proposing to require unit-dose packaging for iron-containing 
drugs and supplements with 30 mg or more iron per dosage 
unit to ensure that the use of these products is safe. FDA's tentative conclusion to use 30 mg per unit-dose as the threshold

for requiring unit-dose packaging is based on its consideration 
of a number factors including: (1) The amount of ingested iron 
that can cause pediatric fatality; (2) the amount of ingested 
iron that can cause significant iron poisoning; (3) the average 
number of dosage units associated with pediatric fatalities; (4) 
the types and potency of iron-containing products associated with 
pediatric iron poisoning fatalities; (5) information on how 
iron products are sold; and (6) the citizen petitions that were 
submitted to FDA. These factors pointed to the use of 30 mg per 
unit-dose as a threshold. 


As discussed above, the toxicity of any iron ingestion is 
related to the total amount of iron ingested and absorbed 
(section I.B. of this document). Ingestion of 250 mg iron per kg 
of body weight (2.5 g total iron for a 10 kg child) is typically 
considered to be a lethal dose of iron. However, there have been 
reports of fatalities from ingestion of lesser amounts (less than 
2.5 g) of iron, and the available data bear this out. For 
example, Table 5 shows that several pediatric fatalities have 
been associated with ingestion of approximately 1 g of iron. 
Moreover, the amount of iron that can cause serious adverse 
effects is given as 60 mg/kg (section I.B. of this document). 
For a 10 kg child this translates to 600 mg of iron. 


FDA recognizes that there is variability among individuals 
with respect to the lethal dose of iron. Because of this 
variability, and because of the variable size and age of children 
at risk, FDA tentatively concludes that, to protect the wide 
range of susceptible children, it is necessary through packaging 
measures (unit-dose packaging) to limit pediatric access to iron-containing drugs and dietary supplements at potencies
that can be 
reasonably expected to provide 1 g of iron. Restricting 
pediatric access to this amount of iron by packaging measures 
will substantially reduce the potential for a fatal or 
significant iron poisoning outcome should an accidental pediatric 
ingestion of iron-containing products occur. As discussed above, 
because of the time and effort needed to access products 
contained in unit-door packaging, the likelihood that young 
children will be able to ingest a lethal amount of iron will be 
significantly reduced, thereby reducing the likelihood that they 
will be seriously injured or die. 


In the 37 case reports of iron poisoning fatalities 
available, the average number of dosage units ingested by the 
pediatric victim was 39 tablets or capsules, with a range of 5 to 
98 (Table 2). FDA notes that ingestion of 39 tablets or capsules 
at potencies of 25 to 30 mg iron per dosage unit is sufficient to 
provide a potentially lethal dose of iron (i.e., approximately 
1,000 mg) to a young child.

<TEXT>
 

As for the types of products that have been involved in 
pediatric iron poisonings, none of the 37 pediatric fatalities 
was reported to be associated with a multivitamin/mineral 
supplement product. All of the products reported to be involved 
in these fatalities were either single or double nutrient 
products that were provided for use as prenatal supplements. 
Single or double nutrient iron-containing products generally 
contain 30 mg or more iron per dosage unit. 


As for the potency of the products involved, all of the 
pediatric fatalities were reported to be associated with iron-containing products at potencies of 40 mg iron or more
per dosage 
unit. FDA is not aware of any pediatric iron poisoning 
fatalities associated with iron-containing products whose potency 
was less than 40 mg iron per dosage unit. Moreover, only 1 of 
the 37 pediatric fatalities was reported to be associated with an 
iron-containing product that contained less than 60 mg iron per 
dosage unit. Thus, FDA observed that requiring unit-dose 
packaging of products that contain 30 mg or more iron per dosage 
unit will provide about a two-fold margin of safety from the 
potency of products that have usually been associated with 
pediatric fatalities. 


The information available to the agency shows that products 
that contain 30 mg or more iron per dosage unit are primarily 
sold to women of childbearing age for prenatal 
use. Prenatal iron-containing products may be obtained 
as dietary supplements or prescription drug products. 
FDA notes that all of the iron-containing products 
associated with the 37 pediatric poisoning fatalities were apparently obtained as prenatal drugs or supplements.
FDA finds 
that prenatal iron-containing drugs and supplements present the 
greatest potential for pediatric iron poisonings and fatalities 
because of their iron content, and because they are likely to be 
available in households with young children. Prenatal iron-containing products are likely to be in households with
young 
children either because they remain in the household after 
childbirth, or because young children are present in the 
household during pregnancy. 


Fourth, FDA notes that both the AG and NDMA citizen 
petitions recommended 30 mg iron per dosage unit as an 
appropriate level to establish additional safeguards to reduce 
the incidence of pediatric iron poisonings. 


Therefore, FDA is proposing unit-dose packaging for all 
dietary supplements and drugs containing 30 mg or more iron per 
dosage unit. FDA tentatively concludes that unit-dose packaging 
will reduce the incidence of pediatric poisonings by providing 
the additional safeguards necessary to limit pediatric access to 
a potentially fatal amount of iron. 




b. Practical effect. 

As discussed above, CPSC's child-resistant packaging regulations require that any iron-containing 
drug or dietary supplement packaged in a container with 250 mg or 
more iron must be packaged in accordance with their child-resistant packaging regulations (16 CFR 1700.14(a)(12)
and 
(a)(13)). Therefore, FDA anticipates that manufacturers and 
distributors of drugs and dietary supplements containing 30 mg or more iron per dosage unit, and containing 250 mg
or more total 
iron per package, under this proposed action and CPSC's current 
regulations (16 CFR 1700.14(a)(12) and (a)(13)), a manufacturer 
or packer will have the option of packaging the product in child-resistant unit-dose packaging (e.g., child-resistant
blisters, 
child-resistant pouches), or of exercising its right to an 
exemption to CPSC's special packaging requirements to allow 
access by elderly or handicapped persons. However, under this 
proposed rule, in the latter case, the products will have to be 
packaged in conventional unit-dose packaging and will be subject 
to CPSC's requirements for exempt packaged products (16 CFR 
1700.5). 


FDA tentatively concludes that, regardless of which 
packaging option a manufacturer or packer uses, unit-dose 
packaging of all iron-containing drugs and supplements that 
contain 30 mg or more per dosage unit will ensure the safe use of 
such products by limiting unintended access to such products by 
young children.

In proposing this action, it is not FDA's intention to 
circumvent the aim of the PPPA to allow access by elderly and 
handicapped persons who may be unable to use such household 
substances when packaged in CRP's. The agency requests comments 
on the effect that this proposed packaging requirement will have 
on the accessibility of iron-containing drugs and dietary 
supplements to elderly and handicapped persons. 
c. 

Iron-containing drug products that are removed from and 
dispensed in other than unit-dose packaging are adulterated and 
misbranded.

 In order to be exempt from the requirement in 
section 502(f)(1) of the act that a drug bear adequate 
directions for use, a prescription drug product for 
human use must bear, among other things, a statement, 
directed to the pharmacist, specifying the type of container to 
be used in dispensing the drug product to maintain the 
product's identity, strength, quality, and purity (21 CFR 
201.100(b)(7)). However, directions for repackaging are ``not 
required for prescription drug products packaged in unit-dose, unit-of-use, or other packaging format in which
the 
manufacturer's original package is designed and intended to be 
dispensed to patients without repackaging.'' (Id.) If FDA 
ultimately determines that unit-dose packaging is necessary to 
ensure the identity, strength, quality, and purity of iron- 
containing drug products, the agency would consider such products 
that are dispensed to consumers in other than unit-dose packaging 
to be adulterated and misbranded. Products marketed by the 
manufacturer in unit-dose packaging would remain exempt from the 
requirement for repackaging instructions because FDA expects that 
pharmacists will not compromise such packaging systems.
FDA has, in certain cases in the past, prohibited 
pharmacists from repackaging products because the original 
manufacturer's packaging was necessary to ensure the product's 
identity, strength, quality, and purity. In 1972, FDA concluded 
that improper packaging of nitroglycerin preparations was causing 
substantial loss of potency of the drug. Commonly used plastic 
containers and strip packaging failed to prevent appreciable 
evaporation of nitroglycerin from nitroglycerin tablets. FDA 
determined that it was necessary to require that these products 
be packaged and dispensed in glass containers to ensure the 
potency of the product ((37 FR 15859, August 5, 1972); 21 CFR 
250.300 (1973)). In addition, manufacturers were required to 
include a statement directed to pharmacists that the product 
should be dispensed only in the original, unopened container (21 
CFR 250.300(b)(1973)).

FDA revoked the nitroglycerin packaging and labeling 
requirements in 1985 because action taken by FDA and the United 
States Pharmacopeial Convention, Inc., after publication of the 
requirements, had made them unnecessary and duplicative (50 FR 
7584, February 25, 1985). When it proposed to revoke the 
regulation, FDA observed that the U.S.P. monograph for sublingual 
nitroglycerin tablets duplicated most of the packaging and 
labeling requirements that initially had been set forth in the 
rule (49 FR 24031, June 11, 1984). In addition, FDA found that 
the suitability of any packaging not in conformance with the rule 
or the monograph under CGMP regulations would have to be shown to 
FDA by adequate data (id.). 
Like the nitroglycerin regulation, this proposed regulation 
regarding iron-containing products is intended to address a 
public health problem that, FDA has tentatively concluded, can be 
alleviated by requiring specific packaging. As was the case with 
nitroglycerin before FDA required specific packaging, iron- 
containing products are not safe as currently packaged. FDA has 
tentatively determined that it is necessary to prohibit 
repackaging by pharmacists in order to protect product integrity 
and to provide the greatest assurance that iron-containing 
products will be used safely and as intended. 
FDA recognizes that pregnant women can receive their iron 
supplements by way of third-party reimbursement, which generally 
requires that a health care professional prescribe the 
supplements. These women present their prescriptions to pharmacists who, often, repackage iron dietary supplements
in 
pharmacy vials. 
FDA recognizes the vital importance of iron supplements to 
prenatal health care and emphasizes that the proposed rule should 
not diminish the availability of iron tablets to pregnant women 
or to any other patient population. FDA expects that pharmacists 
will dispense the tablets in their original unit-dose packaging. 
Under the proposed rule, pharmacists would be free to dispense 
iron-containing products in the manufacturer's box, or in any 
other outer container, as long as the original unit-dose 
packaging remained intact. 
FDA does not believe that the proposed mandatory packaging 
and labeling regulation will encroach upon the practice of 
pharmacy. Under the proposed requirement, products will reach 
the pharmacy in unit-dose packaging with a warning statement 
printed directly on the immediate wrapping or container. FDA 
tentatively concludes that such a requirement, rather than 
representing an encroachment on the practice of pharmacy, is 
necessary to ensure that consumers receive adequate warning about 
the serious dangers associated with the use of iron-containing 
drugs. 



IV. Other Issues 



A. Formulation and Appearance of Iron-Containing Products 


The AG petition recommended that FDA prohibit the 
manufacture and sale of adult formulations of iron-containing products that look like candy or contain a sweet outer
coating. 
The AAPCC petition asked FDA to urge the industry to voluntarily 
reformulate iron-containing products containing 30 mg or more of 
iron per dosage unit to be in less attractive dosage units, 
specifically avoiding resemblance to popular candies. 
NDMA asked FDA to reject the recommendation from the AG 
petition for several reasons. First, NDMA stated that ``candy can 
be_and is_made to look like just about any other consumable 
product. Once a supplement manufacturer decides on a shape, 
size, color_of which there are limited selections_for a 
supplement product, a candy manufacturer could choose 
independently to introduce a candy that looks like that dietary 
supplement.'' Second, NDMA stated that it is not known what a 
pill looks like to a very young child. ``A very young child puts 
everything into his or her mouth, and in fact there are no hard 
data to say that candy-like appearance is why a very young child 
chooses to investigate a consumable consumer product. It is 
quite likely that it may be even more important that the very 
young child sees his or her mother take that pill every day.'' 
Third, NDMA asserted that candy-like appearance is in the eye of 
the beholder and is simply too subjective a standard. It would 
be impossible to have an objective measure of candy-like 
appearance. Thus, NDMA stated that any provision for ``no candy- 
like appearance'' would not be practical and would be difficult to 
administer because of the subjective nature of assessing candy-like appearance.

<TEXT>
 

The agency does not have data or other information specific 
to the question of how a candy-like appearance may contribute to 
the potential for an iron-containing supplement product to 
constitute a hazard to a young child. FDA's tentative view, 
however, is that it may not be possible to objectively measure 
the candy-like appearance of iron-containing products. 
Therefore, FDA requests comments on the use of ``candy'' and 
``colorful'' coatings on iron-containing drugs and dietary 
supplements and information on whether these types of coatings 
make iron-containing products hazardous to infants and young 
children because of their apparent attractiveness. If the 
information received presents an objective basis for additional 
steps that FDA could take to limit the appeal of iron-containing 
products to young children, FDA will consider action in this 
regard. 


B. Forms of Iron That May Be Less Toxic 


NAS has reported that, during the period from 1970 to 1987, 
food manufacturers increased their use of elemental iron (i.e., 
finely divided metallic iron) by 120-fold and decreased their use 
of ferrous sulfate by 30 percent (Ref. 30). The increase in the 
use of elemental iron in conventional food may be attributed to 
its low cost and minimal reactivity in food. FDA is not aware of 
any reports of accidental ingestions or adverse reactions 
associated with the few commercially available iron-containing 
dietary supplements and drug products that incorporate elemental 
iron instead of an iron salt. 
Three basic types of elemental iron powders are marketed for 
use in foods. The three types are reduced iron, electrolytic 
iron, and carbonyl iron. The term ``carbonyl'' refers to the 
production process, not the composition of the product. The 
bioavailability of these various elemental iron sources is 
dependent primarily on their physical characteristics, which in 
turn depend on the manufacturing method. For example, higher 
relative bioavailabilities of elemental iron are obtained with 
smaller particle sizes. 
Some evidence suggests that carbonyl iron may be a useful 
substitute for the more commonly used chemical compounds of iron 
in reducing risk of accidental iron poisonings. Data from 
studies in animals suggest that carbonyl iron may be only 1/100th 
as toxic as ferrous sulfate in single doses, i.e., the LD

50

 
(lethal dose for 50 percent of the test group) of ferrous sulfate 
is approximately 0.30 g Fe/kg (Ref. 32) and the LD

50

 for carbonyl 
iron is approximately 30.0 g Fe/kg body weight (Ref. 31). Thus, 
carbonyl iron, in comparison with ferrous sulfate, appears to 
have a much larger margin of safety between the level that would provide adequate iron nutrition and the level that
causes acute 
toxicity. Consequently, carbonyl iron may be inherently safer to 
use. At the same time, data from human subjects indicates that 
the overall bioavailability of carbonyl iron in supporting the 
nutritional functions of iron is about 70 percent that of ferrous 
sulfate (Ref. 31). Thus carbonyl iron is reasonably as effective 
in providing iron in the amounts needed to achieve the nutritive 
effects of iron. Its use may help to reduce the risk of iron 
poisoning in children. 
FDA specifically requests comments on the appropriateness of 
elemental iron as a source of iron in drugs and dietary 
supplements, focusing on whether its use in iron-containing 
products would decrease the risk of pediatric poisonings while 
providing desirable iron nutrition to those who need iron 
supplementation. The agency is interested in receiving data on 
the potential of elemental iron for acute toxicity in humans and 
particularly in children. 
FDA will carefully consider any information it receives on 
this subject. If the information is persuasive in establishing 
that the use of elemental iron would substantially decrease the 
risk of pediatric poisoning while allowing for effective dietary 
iron supplementation, FDA will consider exempting iron-containing 
products that incorporate elemental iron from any regulations 
that result from this rulemaking.

C. Educational Efforts 


1. Review of Consumer Education Issues in Citizen Petitions 


Two of the three petitions submitted discussed the benefits 
of educational efforts for the public and health professionals, 
focusing on the prevention of accidental pediatric iron 
poisoning. The AAPCC petition and the NDMA petition advocated 
educational efforts and outlined specific actions as described 
herein. 
a. 

The AAPCC petition. 

The AAPCC petition called for the 
initiation of an FDA educational campaign for four different 
segments of the population. The four target segments are: (1) 
Parents, babysitters, daycare providers, and other consumers; (2) 
pediatricians; (3) obstetricians; and (4) other health 
professionals such as physicians, others who can prescribe iron, 
and pharmacists. The petition suggested that pediatricians 
discuss the dangers of an iron overdose with parents at the 6-month checkup, and that obstetricians inform mothers
at the final 
postpartum checkup. 
b. 

The NDMA petition. 

In the fall of 1993, NDMA in 
cooperation with CPSC, developed and launched a national consumer 
education campaign to be carried out in conjunction with the 
voluntary labeling and packaging measures (described above in 
section I.D. of this document) that were undertaken by the 
members of NDMA and NNFA. The purpose of the campaign, as stated 
in the petition, is to inform adults about how to protect children from accidental iron poisoning. The three major
themes 
of the educational campaign mirror some of the messages in NDMA's 
and NNFA's voluntary warning statements for iron-containing 
products and are as follows: 
(1) Adult awareness of the dangers to children if iron is 
accidentally swallowed in excess, 
(2) Reclose the child-resistant package after every use, 
and, 
(3) Keep iron-containing products out of the reach of 
children. 
NDMA and CPSC began the educational campaign by distributing 
video and print news releases, radio news releases in English and 
Spanish, and public service announcements emphasizing the three-pronged message. The public service announcements
are also being 
sent to consumer, health, and women's magazines. 


2. Agency Response 


FDA agrees with the petitioners that the public needs to be 
informed of the dangers of pediatric iron poisoning through 
public education efforts. Such efforts can be one important 
element in combating a cause of injury and deaths that has 
affected thousands of children over the last approximately 10 
years. Thus, FDA commends NDMA and CPSC for their joint efforts 
in developing and distributing a national educational campaign 
targeting accidental iron poisoning, to coincide with the 
voluntary packaging and labeling measures for iron-containing 
products that have been undertaken by the members of NDMA and NNFA. FDA believes that the themes of this campaign are

appropriate and are responsive to a fundamental need that exists 
for more awareness among adults of the dangers of pediatric iron 
poisoning and of the means to prevent these poisonings. Because 
of the seriousness of the problem, i.e., accidental iron 
ingestion is the leading cause of poisoning deaths among 
children, FDA intends to contribute to educating the public. 
Accordingly, FDA is developing materials for a public 
information campaign that would address AAPCC's request and 
complement NDMA and CPSC's educational efforts by emphasizing the 
same awareness and prevention elements as the NDMA/CPSC campaign, 
as follows: 
(1) Iron-containing products can seriously injure or even 
kill young children who accidentally swallow them. 
(2) Reclose the child-resistant package completely and 
every time iron-containing products are opened. 
(3) Keep all containers of iron-containing products out of 
reach of children 

all the time. 
FDA's campaign will also address steps that should be taken 
by adults if an accidental ingestion of iron occurs: 
(4) When children accidentally ingest iron-containing 
products, the attending person should quickly call a poison control center and follow their instructions, or take
the child 
to an emergency room. 
(5) Although the first symptoms, vomiting and diarrhea, may 
occur within 30 minutes, and these symptoms may be followed by an 
appearance of recovery, the child may still be in danger. 
Therefore, immediate professional consultation is critical. 
The FDA materials will include print pieces available for 
distribution to different audiences, such as a backgrounder, a 
flyer, an FDA Consumer 

magazine article, and camera-ready 
newspaper columns. The 

FDA Medical Bulletin, 

which has 1,000,000 
physician subscribers, is another vehicle that can be used to 
publicize this message. 
The diversity of the audiences to be targeted by FDA's 
information campaign will include the AAPCC's suggested target 
populations. The FDA backgrounder will be a detailed handout for 
health professionals and consumer organizations. The flyer will 
be a short piece conveying the elements of FDA's message in a 
simple and concise manner for use in the home by parents, 
grandparents, and babysitters. The 

FDA Consumer 

article will 
reach the 23,000 subscribers to the magazine, a group that 
includes physicians and other health professionals, educators, 
reporters, and consumers. The camera-ready newspaper columns 
will be distributed to 10,000 smaller-circulation newspapers 
nationwide. In addition, FDA intends to provide information to 
consumer newsletter editors and consumers through ``Dear Editor'' letters and ``Dear Consumer'' letters about
the efforts to prevent 
accidental pediatric iron poisoning. 
Different offices in FDA, such as the Office of Public 
Affairs and the Office of Consumer Affairs, and offices of the 
Department of Health and Human Services will assist with the 
distribution of these materials. FDA intends to utilize its 
staff of public affairs specialists to distribute these materials 
to the widely varied constituencies with whom these specialists 
frequently interact, such as other government agencies at the 
Federal, State, and local levels, advocacy organizations, trade 
associations, consumer groups, health professional organizations, 
and other interested groups. 


V. Environmental Impact 


The agency has carefully considered the potential 
environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the 
action will not have a significant impact on the human 
environment, and that an environmental impact statement is not 
required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the 
evidence supporting that finding, contained in an environmental 
assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address 
above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

VI. Analysis of Impacts





FDA has examined the impacts of the proposed rule under 
Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 
96-354). Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all 
costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, when 
regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that 
maximize net benefits (including potential economic, 
environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages; 
distributive impacts; and equity). The agency believes that this 
proposed rule is consistent with the regulatory philosophy and 
principles identified in the Executive Order. In addition, the 
proposed rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined 
by the Executive Order and so is not subject to review under the 
Executive Order. 



A. Description of the Industry 





There are approximately 300 iron-containing products that 
may be affected by these proposed actions, of which approximately 
one-half contain 30 mg or more iron per dosage unit. The types 
of iron-containing products that have been associated with 
poisonings of young children are products offered in solid oral 
dosage form as multi-vitamin/mineral supplements, products 
intended for use as iron supplements, and drug products. 
Typically, multi-vitamin/mineral supplements provide less than 30 
mg of iron per dosage unit. Iron supplements and drug products 
typically contain 30 mg or more iron per dosage unit. The 
proposed action to require warning statements would affect all iron-containing products. On the other hand, FDA
is proposing 
to require unit-dose packaging for products containing 30 mg or 
more iron per dosage unit. Therefore, most multi-vitamin/mineral 
supplements would be subject to the warning statement 
requirements but not to the packaging requirements. Most iron 
supplements and iron-containing drug products would be subject to 
both proposed requirements. 



Iron-containing products may be purchased by consumers on 
their own initiative as dietary supplements, or they may be 
prescribed by physicians. The information available to the 
industry suggests that the overwhelming majority of iron- 
containing products are currently packaged in bottles (Ref. 33). 
Additional information suggests that iron-containing products 
administered in hospitals are commonly packaged in unit-dose 
packaging (Ref. 34). Unit-dose packaging is preferred by 
hospitals because with this type of packaging, each dosage unit 
has an identification and an expiration date, and the hospital 
can continue to use unit-dose packaged drugs rather than having 
to discard a bottle opened for a specific patient after that 
patient is discharged. Based on this information, FDA assumes 
that iron-containing products dispensed in hospitals are 
currently packaged in unit-dose packaging. 



According to the National Center for Health Statistics, of 
the approximately 169 million persons of age 18 or older, 19.7 
percent consume iron-containing products (Ref. 35). If it is 
assumed that each individual consumes one dosage unit per day,there are approximately 12 billion dosage units of
iron- 
containing products consumed annually in the United States. The 
agency does not have complete information on the number of dosage 
units of iron-containing products that contain 30 mg or more 
iron. However, because only pregnant women require 30 mg/day, 
FDA assumes that the portion of higher-dosage iron-containing 
products can be estimated by the number of pregnant women in the 
United States. In 1991, the most recent year for which data are 
available, there were 4.1 million live births (Ref. 36). FDA is 
assuming a one-to-one correspondence between the number of live 
births and the number of pregnancies in concluding that there are 
about 4.1 million pregnant women on any one day in the United 
States. The number of live births may overestimate the number of 
pregnant women because multiple births by one woman are ignored. 
Also, the number of live births ignores pregnancies not resulting 
in a live birth, which may result in an underestimate of the 
number of pregnant women. If it is assumed that the number of 
live births is an estimate of the number of dosage units of 
products containing 30 mg or more iron, then the number of dosage 
units per year can be estimated at 4.1 million times 365 days per 
year or about 1.5 billion.

B. Regulatory Options 




There are many possible regulatory alternatives available 
that may reduce the number of cases of pediatric poisonings from 
the accidental ingestion of iron-containing products. The options include packaging, warning statements, product

reformulation, and educational efforts. 


1. Packaging 





One regulatory option available to FDA is to require that 
products containing iron be packaged in unit-dose containers. 
Because of the CPSC regulations, most iron-containing products 
currently must be packaged in CRC's. Therefore, the effect of 
this option would be to require child resistant unit-dose 
packaging for most of these products. FDA could require unit- 
dose packaging for all products or for only higher dosage 
products. For comparison, FDA will consider potencies of 30 mg, 
40 mg, and 60 mg as the minimum potencies per dosage unit of iron 
that would trigger unit-dosage packaging. 



a. 

Costs. 

There are four types of costs associated with a 
mandated packaging change: Equipment, materials, transportation, 
and administrative costs. If this option is selected, many 
packagers of iron-containing products will be required to 
purchase new packaging equipment. The cost of equipment used in 
packaging blisters, one common form of unit-dose packaging, is 
between $50,000 and $250,000, or on average $132,500. New 
equipment will not be purchased for each product sold because 
some manufacturers already possess unit-dose packaging equipment.
The cost of child-resistant bottles, currently the most 
common form of packaging, is approximately $7 per 1,000 dosage units. Child-resistant blisters cost approximately
$9 per 1,000 
dosage units, a difference of $2 per 1,000 dosage units. 



FDA does not have information to estimate additional 
transportation costs caused by unit-dose packaging requirements 
and requests comments on increased transportation costs. 



Additionally, firms are expected to incur administrative 
costs of approximately $500 per product in the first year. 
Administrative costs are the dollar value of the incremental 
administrative effort expended in order to comply with a 
regulation. Administrative activities include, but are not 
limited to, identifying the underlying policy of the regulation, 
interpreting that policy relative to the firm's products, 
establishing a corporate position, formulating a method for 
compliance, and managing the compliance effort. 



If FDA were to require unit-dose packaging for all iron- 
containing products irrespective of their potency per dosage 
unit, the cost of equipment would be $39 million (300 products  x  
$132,500). The annual materials cost would be $24 million ((12 
billion dosage units/1,000)  x  $2.00), or $260 million over the 
next 20 years (discounted at 7 percent). Administrative costs 
would be $150,000. Total costs associated with requiring unit- 
dose packaging for all iron-containing products would be $299 
million over 20 years (discounted at seven percent). 



If FDA were to require unit-dose packaging for products with 
30 mg iron/dosage unit or higher, the cost of equipment would be 
$20 million (150 products  x  $132,500). The cost of materials would be $3 million per year or $32 million over
20 years 
(discounted at 7 percent). Administrative costs would be $75,000 
(150  x  $500). Total costs associated with requiring unit-dose 
packaging for products containing 30 mg or more per dosage unit 
would be $52 million over 20 years (discounted at 7 percent). 



If FDA were to require unit-dose packaging for products with 
40 mg iron/dosage unit or higher, the cost of equipment would be 
$13 million (100 products  x  $132,500). The cost of materials 
would be $2 million per year or $22 million over 20 years 
(discounted at 7 percent). Administrative costs would be $50,000 
(100  x  $500). Total costs associated with requiring unit-dose 
packaging for products containing 40 mg or more iron per dosage 
unit would be $35 million over 20 years (discounted at 7 
percent). 


If FDA were to require unit-dose packaging for products with 
60 mg iron/dosage unit or higher, the cost of equipment would be 
$5 million (37 products  x  $132,500). The cost of materials would 
be $0.8 million per year or $8 million over 20 years (discounted 
at 7 percent). Administrative costs would be $19,000 (37  x  
$500). Total costs associated with requiring unit-dose packaging 
for products containing 60 mg or more iron per dosage unit would 
be $6 million over 20 years (discounted at 7 percent).

b.

 Benefits.

 In the past 7 years, there have been at least 
37 cases of pediatric fatality from the accidental ingestion of 
iron-containing products, or a mean of 5.3 deaths per year. Data 
on the potency of the product consumed is available for 25 cases. 
In all cases for which information is available, the product 
consumed contained at least 40 mg of iron. In the same 7-year 
period, there were nearly 190 poisonings reported that were life 
threatening or that resulted in permanent injury, and over 2,000 
reported poisonings requiring some form of treatment. FDA 
believes that most, if not all, such deaths and some poisonings 
can be prevented by requiring that higher-potency iron-containing 
products be packaged in unit-dose packaging. Studies indicate 
that the child is less likely to consume the number of dosage 
units that may be fatal. 
Although no studies have attempted to directly estimate the 
value of reducing the risk of death and illness to children in 
particular, many studies have attempted to estimate the value of 
reducing these risks to adults. Most of these estimates are 
based on wage differences between high and low risk jobs and, 
thus, are derived from the labor market decisions of middle-aged 
adults. Although these estimates cluster around a fairly small 
range, $2 million to $10 million, it is not clear that these 
estimates are valid when applied to children. 
FDA has used estimates of the value of reducing risks to 
adults to a level that would avoid one statistical fatality 
between $1.5 million and $5 million in past rulemaking 
proceedings, including recent food labeling regulations and a 
current proposal to require domestic and foreign processors and 
importers of fish and fishery products to establish Hazard 
Analysis Critical Control Points (HAACP) controls to prevent the 
occurrence of hazards that could affect the safety of these 
seafood products (59 FR 4142, January 28, 1994). One method of 
estimating the value of reducing risks to children is to adjust 
the value of reducing risks to adults by accounting for the 
difference in the number of life-years saved. Under this 
approach, an often used estimate of the value of the risks to 
adults to a level that would avoid one statistical fatality is $5 
million for a middle-aged adult. If this value does not vary 
with life years remaining (that is, if we assume that an infant 
is willing to pay the same amount to avoid risk of death as a 40-
year old would be willing to pay and assuming the same 
distribution of wealth exists in both age groups), then $5 
million is a reasonable estimate. If, however, this value does 
vary with life years remaining, then the corresponding value for 
reducing the risks to small children would be $11 million. FDA 
will use these figures ($5 to 11 million) to provide a range of 
estimates. Although FDA is using these values in this analysis, 
FDA stresses the tentative nature of these estimates and requests 
comments on an appropriate method of estimating the value of 
reducing risks to children. 
The number of fatalities prevented by requiring unit-dose 
packaging for iron-containing products at any potency level less 
than 60 mg iron/dosage unit will not be significantly different. 
Because all fatalities for which FDA has information resulted 
from ingestion of dosage units of at least 40 mg iron potency, 
all three of these options (all products, 30 mg and above, and 40 mg and above) would result in benefits of reducing an
average of 
5.3 deaths per year, valued at between $280 million and $618 
million over 20 years (discounted at 7 percent). 
If, however, FDA were to select the option of requiring 
unit-dose packaging for all iron-containing products of potencies 
of 60 mg iron per dosage unit and above, an average of 5 deaths 
would be prevented per year leading to total discounted benefits 
of preventing fatalities over 20 years of between $265 million 
and $583 million. 
Requiring unit-dosage packaging for iron-containing products 
will also reduce the number of nonfatal cases of pediatric iron 
poisoning. FDA has obtained from CPSC case reports for 78 iron 
ingestions necessitating emergency room treatment reported over 7 
years, or an average of 11 illnesses per year. The potency of 
the product consumed was reported for 12 cases. In five of those 
cases, the potency reported was under 30 mg iron/dosage unit. In 
seven cases, the potency reported was over 60 mg iron/dosage 
unit. AAPCC data shows that from 1986 through 1992 there were 
nearly 190 reported poisonings that were life threatening or that 
resulted in permanent injury, and over 2,000 reported poisonings 
requiring some form of treatment as a result of accidental 
ingestion of adult and pediatric iron-containing products, or an 
average of 286 per year. FDA is unable to predict the percentage 
of these nonfatal poisonings which would be prevented by 
substituting unit-dose packaging for bottles. It is possible 
that not all nonfatal poisonings will be prevented because a 
child can still gain access to the product. However, he or she 
will gain access to fewer dosage units than if the product is in 
a bottle. FDA requests comments on this issue. 
Using a methodology developed previously for FDA to value 
morbidity risks, FDA is able to estimate the value of reduced 
risk of nonfatal poisoning. By comparing similar symptoms and 
medical interventions, the agency has derived an estimate of the 
value of preventing a nonfatal pediatric iron poisoning of 
$20,000 per case. (Ref. 37) As stated previously, 7 out of 12 
cases of nonfatal poisonings were a result of ingestion of 
products of potencies over 60 mg iron per dosage unit. If this 
proportion can be extrapolated to the remaining cases for which 
information is unknown, and if unit-dose packaging will prevent 
all nonfatal cases (at least 2,000 cases in 7 years), then 
requiring unit-dose packaging for products of 60 mg or more iron 
per dosage unit will add approximately $35 million to the 
benefits over the next 20 years (discounted at seven percent). 
Because no nonfatal cases for which information is known were a 
result of ingesting products with potencies between 30 mg and 60 
mg iron per dosage unit, the options of requiring unit-dose 
packaging for products with potencies of 40 mg and 30 mg iron per 
dosage unit will not add more to the benefits than the previous 
option. Still assuming that all nonfatal cases can be prevented 
by unit-dose packaging, requiring packaging changes for all 
products would result in reduced morbidity valued at $61 million 
over the next 20 years.

The total value of the benefits of unit-dose packaging 
options is the sum of the value of reducing both mortality and 
morbidity risks. The selected option, requiring unit-dose 
packaging for all products containing 30 mg or more iron per 
dosage unit, would result in benefits of reducing mortality risks 
of between $280 million and $618 million and reduced morbidity 
valued at $61 million. Therefore, total discounted benefits of 
this option are between $315 million and $618 million. Table 7 
summarizes the costs and benefits of the packaging options. 





2. Warning Labels 


a. 

Costs.

 Every petition submitted to FDA requested that 
the agency require that iron-containing product labels contain 
warning statements about the potentially fatal effects of 
pediatric poisonings from accidental ingestion of iron-containing 
products. The cost associated with warning statements are the 
cost of redesigning the label, disposing of old labels, and 
administrative costs. In January, 1994, FDA published final rules regarding nutrition labeling of dietary supplements
in 
accordance with the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 
(NLEA) and the Dietary Supplement Act of 1992. In its analysis 
of those rules (59 FR 352), FDA determined that the incremental 
cost of label changes for dietary supplement manufacturers is 
approximately $1,500 per label. FDA is proposing that the label 
warning statement be printed directly on the immediate container 
of the product, i.e., the container that holds the tablet or 
capsule, and on the principal display panel of the retail 
package, if such package is not the immediate container. If a 
product is sold in unit-dose packaging, the product would be 
required to bear the warning directly on each unit-dose package 
or on a strip of unit-dose packages in such a way that separating 
the unit-dose packages would not destroy the warning labeling. 
Manufacturers of all 300 iron-containing products will be 
required to change their labels on both the product container and 
the retail package to incorporate warning statements. However, 
because manufacturers of iron-containing products with 30 mg or 
more per dosage unit will also be required to change their 
packaging, they will not incur any incremental cost in adding a 
warning statement to the product container. Therefore, the 
labeling costs will be incurred by all 300 products for the 
retail package and for 150 products for the product container. 
The total cost would be a one-time cost of $675,000 (300  x  1.5  x  $1,500).

An additional cost of this regulation may be an increase in 
iron deficiency anemia if susceptible adults react 
inappropriately to a warning label targeted for children. 
According to NHANES II, approximately 7.2 percent of females age 
15 to 19 and 6.3 percent of females age 20 to 44 are iron-deficient but less than one-fourth of these women had anemia

associated with the deficiency. In addition, males had a 
prevalence of less than 1 percent. FDA requests comments on this 
issue. 




 b. Benefits. 

Warning statements will only prevent 
pediatric iron poisonings to the extent that they lead to changes 
in the behavior of the adult controlling the use of the product 
(presumably the parent). Whether the warning messages prescribed 
in this proposed rule will cause a change in behavior will depend 
on a number of factors, including the degree to which the 
statement is noticed, read, and understood. 


 There is some evidence that warning statements can change 
behavior. For example, research indicates that rate of increase 
of sales of diet soft drinks declined after saccharin warnings 
were put on the labels of these products (Ref. 38). FDA is 
unable to predict exactly how many cases of pediatric iron 
poisoning will be prevented as a result of warning statements. 
To the extent that warning statements will cause adults to take 
proper care in handling iron-containing products, and to the 
extent that such care is not taken in the absence of warning statements, some cases of pediatric iron poisoning will
be 
prevented. 


 If the agency requires unit-dose packaging, and this measure 
is 100 percent effective in preventing both fatal and nonfatal 
cases, then there are no benefits from warning labels on these 
products. However, for those products still packaged in bottles, 
warning labels may have an impact. If each nonfatal case of iron 
poisoning is valued at $20,000 and the one-time cost of warning 
statements is $675,000, then benefits of requiring warning 
statements will exceed costs if warning statements prevent at 
least three nonfatal cases every year for the next 20 years 
(discounted at 7 percent). 




3. Product Reformulation_Appearance 




Two petitions recommended product reformulation as a 
preventive measure. The petitions suggested that some adult 
formulations of iron-containing products look and taste like 
candy and thus are more appealing to children. The petitions 
stated that if the product were less appealing to children, the 
incidence of accidental ingestion would be reduced. The petition 
from NDMA urged FDA to reject reformulation for several reasons, 
including a lack of knowledge about what a pill looks like to a 
very young child, and about why the child is motivated to consume 
the product. The agency does not have information to determine 
either the costs or the benefits of reformulating the appearance 
of iron-containing products. Because reformulation costs are 
highly dependent on the individual decisions of firms, they are 
very difficult to estimate. Also, because there are currently no 
objective measures of the candy-like appearance of iron-containing products, the benefits are also difficult to

determine. 




4. Product Reformulation_Taste 




Another possibility is to add a bitter substance to products 
containing iron which would discourage multiple ingestions. Such 
substances have been used in the past on products which 
discourage thumbsucking and nailbiting. It is highly likely that 
such a substance will not add significantly to the cost of 
producing iron-containing products. FDA requests information on 
a policy option that would require altering the taste of iron-containing products. Such information would include
the 
potential substances that would make the pills bitter and data on 
their safety and whether this approach would be effective in 
preventing acute overdose of iron-containing products by 
children. FDA notes, however, that such an option may have the 
unintended side effect of causing persons who need iron 
supplementation to avoid the product. FDA requests information 
on both the costs and benefits of this option.

5. Forms of Iron that May be Less Toxic 




As previously discussed in this document, some evidence 
suggests that carbonyl iron, an elemental iron powder, seems to 
be effective in the prevention or treatment of iron deficiency, 
and that it might be significantly less toxic than other forms of 
iron commonly used in iron-containing products. The agency requested data on the acute toxicity in humans, and 
particularly in children, of elemental iron. FDA stated that, 
if information is received that is persuasive that the use of 
elemental iron will substantially decrease the risk of pediatric 
poisoning while allowing for effective dietary iron 
supplementation, it will consider exempting iron-containing 
products that incorporate reduced iron from any regulations that 
result from this rulemaking. FDA does not have any information 
regarding the availability of such forms of iron for use in iron-containing products. Nor does FDA possess any information
that 
would allow it to determine how many products would be 
reformulated with less toxic forms of iron in order to take 
advantage of such an exemption. FDA requests comment on the 
economic impact of exempting products containing less toxic forms 
of iron. 




6. Consumer Education Campaign 




Two of the three petitions that FDA received advocated 
educational efforts for the public and health professionals. FDA 
agrees that the public needs to be informed of the dangers of 
pediatric iron poisoning. The fact that in 7 years over 2,000 
poisonings have occurred that have required some kind of 
treatment indicates that the public is not aware of the potential 
for serious harm or death in young children from accidental 
ingestion of iron-containing products. FDA is developing 
materials for a public information campaign utilizing the 
channels available to the agency.

7. Effective Dates 




The agency is proposing to make any final rule that may issue based upon this proposal become effective 180 days after
its publication in the 

Federal Register

. FDA is requesting comments on this effective date. In general, costs of compliance for labeling and other requirements
are less if longer compliance periods are provided because firms can incorporate mandatory changes to product, labeling,
and packaging with regularly scheduled changes. FDA requests information on the ability of manufacturers of products
that contain 30 mg or more iron per dosage unit to convert their packaging within the suggested compliance period.





C. Regulatory Flexibility 




The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires analyzing options for regulatory relief for small businesses when possible.
FDA is not aware that any small businesses will be affected by this proposed rule. Therefore, FDA tentatively concludes
that this proposed rule will not result in a significant burden on small businesses. FDA requests comments on any potential
adverse effect on small businesses. 




D. Summary 




FDA has examined the impact of the proposed rule in accordance with Executive Order 12866 and has determined that it
is not an economically significant rule. The rule will result in total costs of approximately $53 million and discounted
benefits of between $315 million and $653 million over the next 20 years (discounted at 7 percent). 


FDA has also examined the impact of this proposed rule on small businesses in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility
Act. FDA is unaware of any iron-containing products manufactured by small businesses. Therefore, FDA has determined
that this rule will not result in a significant burden on small businesses. 




VII. Effective Date 




The agency is proposing to make any final rule that may issue based upon this proposal became effective 180 days after
its publication in the 

Federal Register

. The agency is requesting comments on the proposed effective date. All comments concerning the effective date should
be accompanied by data to support or justify any change in the proposed effective date. 




VIII. Comments 




The agency's intention in proposing this action is to reduce the incidence of pediatric iron poisonings from ingestion
of iron-containing supplements and drug products. FDA has examined all relevant information available to the agency.
The agency requests comments on this proposed action and is particularly interested in receiving comments that bear
on the effectiveness of the proposed action to reduce th
