Milk for Manufacturing Purposes and Its Production and Processing; Requirements Recommended for Adoption by State
Regulatory Agencies 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of intent to amend. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes to amend the recommended manufacturing milk requirements (Recommended Requirements) by
reducing the maximum allowable bacterial estimate and somatic cell count in producer herd milk, and by reducing the
maximum allowable bacterial estimate in commingled milk. In addition, 
this proposal would modify the follow-up procedures when producer herd milk exceeds the maximum allowable bacterial
estimate. 
The proposal to reduce somatic cell count and bacterial estimate was initiated at the request of the National Association
of State Departments of Agriculture (NASDA) and was developed in cooperation with NASDA, dairy trade associations,
and producer groups.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Under the authority of the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946, the U.S. Department of Agriculture maintains a set
of model regulations relating to quality and sanitation requirements for the production and processing of manufacturing
grade milk. These Recommended Requirements are available for adoption by the various States. The purpose of the model
requirements is to promote, through State adoption and enforcement, uniformity in State dairy laws and regulations
relating to manufacturing grade milk. 



In July 1992, the Dairy Division of NASDA passed a resolution recommending that certain milk quality requirements
be tightened. The Dairy Division of NASDA requested that the maximum allowable bacterial estimate in producer herd
milk be reduced from 1,000,000 per ml. to 500,000 per ml. and that the maximum allowable somatic cell count in producer
herd milk be reduced from 1,000,000 per ml. to 750,000 per ml. (The changes for somatic cell count only apply to milk
from cows, not milk from goats.) The Dairy Division of NASDA also requested that the maximum allowable bacterial estimate
in commingled milk be reduced from 3,000,000 per ml. to 1,000,000 per ml. 

Their desire to have these changes were further reinforced in a resolution passed in July 1994. In this resolution,
the Dairy Division of NASDA requested that USDA expedite the printing of this proposal.

In addition, certain State regulatory agencies have requested modifications to the follow-up procedures when producer
herd milk exceeds the maximum allowable bacterial estimate. Changes are being proposed that will provide uniformity
with producer herd milk bacteria and somatic cell follow-up procedures. The modified follow-up program is also more
adaptable to computer-based recordkeeping. 
In order to align the bacterial estimate and somatic cell count requirements contained in the Recommended Requirements
with the resolution passed by NASDA, this document proposes the following changes: 
1. Reduce the maximum somatic cell count in producer herd milk (no change for goat milk). 
The number of leukocytes (somatic cells) present in milk increases as a result of mammary gland infection (mastitis).
The number of somatic cells present in milk provides information regarding the health of the dairy herd. The National
Mastitis Council (NMC) is an organization that promotes research and provides education to help dairy producers
reduce the incidence of mastitis and thus enhance milk quality. In their publication entitled 

Current Concepts of Bovine Mastitis,

 the NMC states that ``Presence of more than 500,000 leukocytes per milliliter of mixed herd milk suggests a significant
incidence of mastitis in a given herd''. Changes in the Recommended Requirements are being proposed that would reduce
the maximum somatic cell count permitted in producer herd milk (cows milk only) from 1,000,000 to 750,000 per ml. Through
effective herd management, many dairy farmers have reduced the number of somatic cells well below the maximum limit
being considered. Since the number of somatic cells found in milk produced from healthy goats is normally higher than
the number found in cows milk, similar reductions are not being proposed for goat milk. 
2. Delete the laboratory screening tests for somatic cells in producer herd milk samples (no change for goat milk).

The California Mastitis Test (CMT) and the Wisconsin Mastitis Test (WMT) are used as screening tests for somatic cells.
These screening tests are accurate for samples containing 1,000,000 or more somatic cells per ml. When the maximum
somatic cell count is reduced to 750,000 per ml., the CMT and WMT screening tests are not accurate. Since the maximum
somatic cell count for goat milk remains at 1,000,000 per ml., the CMT and WMT tests can still be used to screen goat milk.
The proposal identifies those tests which may be used for cow milk somatic cell counting. The appropriate tests are
those listed in this document or other methods identified in the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination
of Dairy Products. 
3. Reduce the maximum bacterial estimate permitted in producer herd milk. 
The number of bacteria present in milk increases when the equipment and utensils used to collect and store the milk
is improperly cleaned and sanitized. This number increases rapidly in milk that is not cooled promptly or is not maintained
at refrigerated temperatures throughout storage. Enhanced milk quality can be attained when dairy equipment is
properly cleaned and sanitized, and when milk is promptly cooled and stored at refrigerated temperatures. Improvements
in sanitation practices and milk cooling equipment has resulted in enhanced milk quality. Changes in the Recommended
Requirements are being proposed that would reduce the maximum permissible bacteria count in producer herd milk from
1,000,000 to 500,000 per ml. 
4. Modify the follow-up procedures when producer herd milk exceeds the maximum allowable bacterial estimate. 
Changes are being proposed that will modify the follow-up procedures when producer herd milk exceeds the maximum
permitted bacteria estimate. These changes would require the dairy plant to notify the producer with a warning whenever
an excessive bacterial estimate is found. When two of the last four consecutive bacterial estimates exceed the maximum
permitted, the dairy plant would be required to notify the appropriate State regulatory authority. The State Regulatory
authority would then send a written warning letter to the producer. After 3 days, but within 21 days, an additional
sample of herd milk is tested. If this sample also exceeds the maximum permitted, that producer's herd milk is excluded
from the market until satisfactory compliance is obtained. 
These changes would provide uniformity with producer herd milk bacteria and somatic cell follow-up procedures.
The 
modified follow-up program is also more adaptable to computer-based recordkeeping. 
5. Reduce the maximum permitted bacterial estimate in commingled milk. 
Commingled milk is the combined milk from more than one producer. Proposed reductions in the maximum bacterial estimate
for producer herd milk should result in improved commingled milk quality. Changes in the Recommended Requirements
are being proposed that reduce the maximum permissible bacterial estimate in commingled milk from 3,000,000 to 1,000,000
per ml. 
6. In order to provide consistency throughout the Recommended Requirements, changes in terminology and formatting
are being proposed. 
The proposal would: (a) Amend the definitions for ``acceptable milk'' and ``probational milk'' by deleting the reference
to bacterial estimate; (b) amend the requirements for ``excluded milk'' by incorporating provisions for milk with
a history of excessive bacteria counts; (c) amend the bacterial requirements under the terms of quality testing of
milk from producers; and (d) instruct plants to provide field assistance to farmers concerning excessive bacteria
counts. 
For the reasons set forth in the preamble, the Recommended Requirements which were published in the 

Federal Register

 issued April 7, 1972 (37 FR 7046) and amended August 27, 1985 
(50 FR 34726) and May 6, 1993 (58 FR 86) are proposed to be amended as follows:

<DOCTITLE>Management of Vegetation Within Electric Utility Rights-of-Way on the Allegheny National Forest in Elk, Forest,
McKean and Warren Counties, PA</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Forest Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

A draft and a final environmental impact statement is being prepared for the management of vegetation on 776 acres
of land associated with 120 miles of electric utility rights-of-way on the Allegheny National Forest. Herbicide
application, mechanical clearing and manual cutting alone, and in combination, are alternatives that will be considered.



The herbicides being considered in the analysis include glyphosate (trade names are Roundup

R

 Rodeo

R,

 and Accord

R

), metsulfuron methyl (trade names is Escort

R

), triclopyr (trade names are Garlon 3A

R

 and Garlon 4

R

), picloram (trade names are Tordon K

R

 and Access

R

), imazapyr (trade name is Arsenal

R

), and fosamine (trade name is Krenite UT

R

). The herbicide would be applied in water or mineral oil, depending on the formulation used and the method of application.

Various manual and mechanical herbicide application methods are being considered. Manual ground level applications
include low volume basal, low volume foliar and stump treatment. Mechanical ground level applications include low
volume selective foliar and high volume foliar. The specific herbicide formulation (trade named product), carrier
and method of application will vary with the characteristics of the site, the components of the vegetation community
and other factors. Aerial application of herbicide is not being considered in this analysis.

The purpose of these treatments is to ensure safe and reliable transmission and distribution of electric power across
portions of the Allegheny National Forest. This environmental impact statement will amend the Allegheny National
Forest Land and Resource Management Plan completed in 1986.

The environmental impact statement will be site specific on approxiamtely 120 miles of electric utility rights-of-way
located on the Forest. The electric utility lines are owned and operated by the Pennsylvania Electric Company or West
Penn Power Company.

The environmental impact statement is being prepared by Environmental Consultants, Incorporated, jointly funded
by the Allegheny National Forest and the two electric utility companies. The decision that will be made in the EIS is
to determine the site specific treatments for vegetation management projects on the specific sites. The decision
will be made with full public participation and is appealable under 36 CFR part 217.

The Agency invites written comments and suggestions on the scope and substance of the analysis and the environmental
impact statement. In addition, the agency gives notice that the environmental impact statement preparation process
will be conducted so that interested and affected people are aware of how they may participate in and contribute to
the final decision.



<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Allegheny National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan completed in 1986, provides for management of electric
power transmission and distribution corridors on parts of the Forest. Management of vegetation that can interfere
with reliable and efficient transmission and distribution of electric power is needed for approximately 776 acres
of land under approximately 120 miles of power lines on the Allegheny National Forest. The purpose of this vegetation
management is to produce a plant community that is generally low growing, will stabilize the site against erosion,
will provide a diversity of wildlife habitat, and will minimize power outages and costs of management.


A range of alternatives will be considered, including herbicide application, mechanical clearing and manual cutting
alone, and a combination of these techniques. The ``no action alternative'' is the method of vegetation management
currently in use on a site-specific basis. Activities carried out on the ground under this alternative vary from site
to site, but will be described and analyzed in the draft and the final environmental impact statements.
The decision that will be made in the EIS is a site specific determination of the treatments the power companies may
use on each site. The decision is appealable under 36 CFR part 217. Federal, state and local agencies, and other individuals
and organizations who may be interested or affected by the decision are invited to participate in the scoping process.
This process will include (1) identification of potential issues; (2) identification of issues to be analyzed in
depth; and (3) elimination of insignificant issues or those which have been covered by a previous environmental review.
To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments
should be as specific as possible. Please include your name, address, and telephone number (organization represented
and your title, if applicable).
Preliminary issues that have been identified are: (1) What is the fate of herbicides, carriers and inert ingredients
in the environment; (2) what are the effects of herbicides, carriers and inert ingredients on human health; (3) what
are the effects on fish and wildlife; (3) what are the impacts on water quality; and, (4) what are the costs and effectiveness
of various vegetation management strategies that will ensure the reliability of electric power service.
The analysis is expected to take about 10 months. The draft environmental impact statement will be filed with the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) and will be available for public review in early July 1995. At that time EPA will publish a notice
of availability of the draft environmental impact statement in the 

Federal Register

. The comment period on the draft will be 45 days from the date the EPA notice appears in the 

Federal Register

. It is very important that those interested in the management of the Allegheny National Forest participate at that
time. To be most helpful, comments on the draft environmental impact statement should be as specific as possible,
and may address the adequacy of the statement or the merits of the alternatives discussed (see the Council on Environmental
Quality Regulations (CEQ) for implementing the procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act
at 40 CFR 1503.3).
The Forest Service believes it is important to give reviewers notice at this early stage of several court rulings related
to public participation in the environmental review process. First reviewers of draft environmental impact statements
must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposals so that it is meaningful and alerts
an agency to the reviewers position and contentions, 

Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp.

 v. 

NRDC, 45 U.S. 519, 553 (1978). 

Also, environmental objections that could be raised at the draft environmental impact statement stage may be waived
if not raised until after completion of the final environmental impact statement, 

City of Angoon

 v. 

Hodel, 803 F.2d 1016, 1022 (9th Cir. 1988)

, and 

Wisconsin Heritages, Inc.

 v. 

Harris, 490 F.supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980)

. Because of these court rulings, it is very important that those interested in this proposed action participate by
the close of the 45-day comment period so that substantive comments and objections are made available to the Forest
Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final environmental impact statement.
Comments on the draft environmental impact statement should be as specific as possible. It is also helpful if comments
refer to specific pages or chapters of the draft statement. Comments may also address the adequacy of the draft environmental
impact statement or the merits of the alternatives formulated and discussed in the statement (Reviewers may wish
to refer to CEQ Regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act
at 40 CFR 1503.3 is addressing these points).
After the comment period ends on the draft environmental impact statement, the comments received will be analyzed
and considered by the Forest Service in preparing the final environmental impact statement. The final environmental
impact statement is scheduled to be completed in December 1995. In the final EIS the Forest Service is required to respond
to the comments received (40 CFR 1503.4). The responsible official will consider the comments, responses, environmental
consequences discussed in the environmental impact statement, and applicable laws, regulations and policies in
making a decision regarding this proposal. The responsible official will document the decision and reasons for the
decision in a Record of Decision. That decision will be subject to appeal under 36 CFR part 217.
The responsible official is John E. Palmer, Forest Supervisor, Allegheny National Forest, 222 Liberty Street, P.O.
Box 847, Warren PA 16365.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS is announcing that the American Zoo and Aquarium Association (AZA) and the Alliance of Marine Mammal Parks and
Aquariums (Alliance) have submitted, for reference purposes, the professionally accepted standards on which their
members base their education and conservation programs. The Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (MMPA) (16 U.S.C.
1361 

et

 

seq

.) was amended substantially on April 30, 1994 (P.L. 103-238) (1994 Amendments). These 1994 Amendments require
that persons holding marine mammals for purposes of public display, or requesting issuance of a permit to capture
or import a marine mammal for purposes of public display, must offer a program for education or conservation purposes
that is based on professionally recognized standards of the public display community. The AZA and Alliance together
represent approximately 60 percent of U.S. facilities that currently hold marine mammals. Where applicable, the
AZA or Alliance standards may be referenced by public display permit applicants and holders of marine mammals when
exercising the rights established and submitting the documentation required under the MMPA. If alternative standards
are provided as a part of a permit application to capture or import marine mammals, such standards will be published
as part of the notice of receipt of the application that is published by NMFS in the 

Federal Register

. Other holders of marine mammals or organizations representing members of the public display community may submit,
for reference purposes, alternative standards on which education or conservation programs are based. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


Background


In 1988 the MMPA was amended to require, among other things, that a permit be issued for public display purposes only
to an applicant which offers a program for education or conservation that, based on professionally recognized standards
of the public display community, is acceptable to the Secretary (i.e., Secretary of Commerce or Interior, depending
upon the marine mammal species involved). In March 1989, NMFS initiated a comprehensive review of the permit program.
At the beginning of this permit program review, it became clear that the phrase ``based on professionally recognized
standards of the public display community'' did not refer to any existing standards already established by the public
display community. Therefore, on May 22, 1989, NMFS published in the 

Federal Register

 (54 FR 22001) a notice of interim policy regarding the education or conservation programs of applicants requesting
permits to take or import marine mammals for public display. This notice announced the criteria that NMFS would use
in determining the acceptability of education or conservation programs pending the promulgation of regulations
for this purpose. The notice stated that in order to be determined acceptable by NMFS, ``an applicant's education
or conservation program must include a program of formal or informal learning that conveys accurate information
about the marine mammals being displayed and communicates in an effective manner a message and purpose that are consistent
with the policies of the MMPA.''
After conducting a comprehensive review of the entire permit program, NMFS published a proposed rule on October 14,
1993 (58 FR 53320), to revise existing permit regulations for taking and importing marine mammals for purposes of
public display, scientific research, and enhancement under the MMPA and the Endangered Species Act. This proposed
rule included criteria for determining whether an applicant's education or conservation program is acceptable.
These standards were based on the interim policy previously published in the 

Federal Register

 and the numerous comments and recommendations on the subject received during the permit program review.
On April 30, 1994, the 1994 Amendments to the MMPA were enacted. Under the 1994 Amendments, the requirement that applicants
for a permit for purposes of public display must offer an education or conservation program acceptable to the Secretary
was eliminated and replaced by a requirement that, for purposes of public display, persons holding marine mammals
and those issued a permit to capture or import must ``offer a program for education or conservation purposes that is
based on professionally recognized standards of the public display community.'' Essentially, although the Secretary
is no longer required to determine whether education/conservation programs are acceptable, the Secretary must
still determine whether a person offers a program for education or conservation purposes based on professionally
recognized standards of the public display community. To ensure compliance with this requirement of the MMPA, applicants
for a public display permit to capture or import marine mammals and persons holding marine mammals for purposes of
public display must identify, by reference or description, the professionally recognized standards of the public
display community on which their education or conservation programs are based. 
Although there are no professionally recognized standards for education or conservation programs that are uniformly
accepted as such by the public display community, such standards are not required by the 1994 Amendments. The 1994
Amendments require only that for purposes of public display persons holding marine mammals or requesting a permit
to capture or import marine mammals must offer a program for education or conservation purposes that is based on professionally
recognized standards of the public display community. And, because any person holding marine mammals for purposes
of public display is a member of the public display community and, therefore, may identify the professionally recognized
standards on which their education or conservation program is based, for such persons this requirement is essentially
one that relies on self-regulation. NMFS, therefore, asked the AZA and Alliance, as organizations which together
represent approximately 60 percent of the public display facilities holding marine mammals, to identify the standards
on which their members base their education and conservation programs. In making this request, NMFS stated that the
standards identified by the AZA and Alliance would be published in the 

Federal Register

; thus, enabling persons who offer an education or conservation program based on either the AZA or Alliance standards
to use this notice as a reference instead of listing such standards repeatedly. 
NMFS recognizes that the AZA and Alliance do not represent the entire public display community and that some members
of that community may offer education or conservation programs based on professionally recognized standards of
the public display community that are different from those identified by either the AZA or Alliance. Consequently,
other members or representative organizations of the public display community may also submit, for reference purposes,
alternative standards on which education or conservation programs are based. NMFS may also publish in the 

Federal Register

 notice of such alternative standards for reference by the public display community. In addition, if alternative
standards are provided as a part of a permit application, such standards will be published as a part of the notice of
receipt of an application and opportunity for public comment that is published by NMFS in the 

Federal Register

. 


Standards


The Alliance and AZA identified the following as the professionally recognized standards of the public display community
on which their members have based their education and conservation programs:


Standards of the American Zoo and Aquarium Association


1. Education must be an element of the mission statement of the institution.
2. All institutions must have structured education programs, including a written education plan.
3. The education program should be under the direction of a paid professional trained in educational programming.
In those cases where employees have not yet been retained, someone should be assigned the responsibility to implement
and manage the programs.
4. Education programs should be evaluated on a regular basis for effectiveness and content and current scientific
information included.
5. Cooperative programs with institutions of higher learning should be developed.
6. If animal demonstrations are a part of the institution's programs, an educational/conservation message must
be incorporated.
7. A reference library appropriate to the size and complexity of the institution should be available to all staff members.
8. The graphics program must include information regarding the animal collection's conservation/ecology relation
to humans/natural history and other interpretive elements.
9. Exhibits in which endangered animals are displayed must include the designation as an endangered species and those
displaying Species Survival Plan (SSP) animals should include a statement that the animals are a part of AZA's SSP
program. It is recommended that the SSP program be highlighted by utilization of AZA's SSP logo and text.
10. Recruitment, interviewing, training, and evaluation programs should exist for all programs utilizing volunteers/
docents.


Standards of the Alliance of Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums


1. Education programs about marine mammals must promote an improved understanding of and an appreciation for these
animals and their ecosystems.
NOTE: In addition to direct observation, a variety of other techniques and stimuli may be used to effectively communicate
member programs' educational messages. These methods may include, but are not limited to, some of the following:

* Audio-visual materials
* Community outreach
* Formal education programs
* Guided tours
* Instructional guides/curricula
* Interactive exhibits/programs
* Interpretive graphics
* Narration at exhibits
* Off-site education programs
* Public presentations
* Public Shows
* Recreation programs
* Special needs programs (e.g., disabled, senior citizens)
* Species identification labels
* Teacher training
* Written materials/publications
2. Education programs about marine mammals must offer multiple levels of learning opportunities for visitors to
expand their knowledge about these animals.
NOTE: Multiple levels of learning opportunities refers to providing educational information for visitors who have
different levels of knowledge and interest. For example, basic introductory programming might offer viewing of
animals, species identification, and/or a public show or presentation. More advanced programming might include,
for example, formal education programs, guided tours, and/or written or audio-visual material designed to meet
the needs of individuals who which additional information.
3. Education programs about marine mammals must present information about these animals, their ecosystem, or marine
wildlife conservation that is based upon the best current scientific knowledge.
NOTE: The best current scientific knowledge refers to information based on the growing body of scientific research
about marine mammals science and the basic knowledge that is professionally recognized by relevant disciplines,
such as biology, physiology, anatomy, veterinary medicine, and/or animal behavior science.
4. A qualified individual must be designated and responsible for the development of, and administration of, education
programs about marine mammals.
NOTE: Qualified refers to having a bachelor's degree, education experience, administrative skills, and knowledge
about marine mammals.
5. Education programs about marine mammals must include a written education plan consisting of a mission statement,
goals, and an evaluation strategy.
NOTE: The education plan should reflect current facility programs. Evaluations are intended for internal program
review, and each facility will have discretion in determining the methods used and the scope and frequency of the evaluations.
6. Education programs about marine mammals must include availability of institution experts as a marine science
resource to professional groups and the education community when appropriate and practicable.
NOTE: Public display facilities employ and collaborate with many highly knowledgeable and experienced marine mammal
experts, such as animal behaviorists, veterinarians, research scientists, trainers, and marine education and
other specialists. When appropriate and practicable, facilities should encourage and facilitate opportunities
for these specialists to serve as marine science resources and share their expertise with interested professional
groups and the education community.

 Department of Education.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Proposed Information Collection Requests.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Acting Director, Information Resources Management Service, invites comments on proposed information collection
requests as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.



Dates:

 An expedited review has been requested in accordance with the Act, since allowing for the normal review period would
adversely affect the public interest. Approval by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has been requested by
October 31, 1994.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 3517 of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. Chapter 3517) requires that the Director of OMB provide
interested Federal agencies and persons an early opportunity to comment on information collection requests. OMB
may amend or waive the requirement for public consultation to the extent that public participation in the approval
process would defeat the purpose of the information collection, violate State or Federal law, or substantially interfere
with any agency's ability to perform its statutory obligations.



The Act Director, Information Resources Management Service, publishes this notice with the attached proposed information
collection request prior to submission of this request to OMB. This notice contains the following information: (1)
Type of review requested, e.g., expedited; (2) Title; (3) Abstract; (4) Additional Information; (5) Frequency of
collection; (6) Affected public; and (7) Reporting and/or Recordkeeping burden. Because an expedited review is
requested, a description of the information to be collected is also included as an attachment to this notice.

Type of Review:

 Expedited.



Title:

 Request for Designation as an Eligible Institution Under the Urban Community Service Program.



Abstract:

 This information is needed to designate eligible institutions separately from the solicitation of grants under
this program. In this way, institutions can be informed of their eligibility to participate in the program prior to
undertaking the burden of developing a grant application. Also, the Secretary identifies those institutions that
are eligible to join the legislatively mandated network of ``urban grant institutions''.



Additional Information:

 ED is requesting, from OMB, an expedited review and approval by October 31, 1994. An expedited review is requested
because ED will need time to conduct this review in addition to its review of project applications in FY 1995. It is estimated,
based on calls of inquiry received by the Department, that as many as 500 eligibility applications may be submitted.
The Department will need time to process these applications and notify respondents of the results before undertaking
the grant solicitation process. In addition, grant applicants will need adequate time to prepare their proposals
after being informed of their eligibility. If sufficient time is not allowed, the Department will not be able to conduct
both reviews effectively and the Secretary's statutory obligation to publish a list of urban grant institutions
will be further delayed.

 Annually.

because the consent to disclosure from must be available in order for these borrowers to choose to repay under the Income
Contingent Repayment Plan. Having the consent to disclosure form approved by October 31 will allow the Servicer to
pre-print forms for borrowers and allow borrowers to participate in the Income Contingent Repayment Plan which is
an important feature of the President's initiative to implement the Direct Loan Program.

<DOCTITLE>Michael P. O'Brien and Robert A. Davis, III; Notice of Availability of Draft Environmental Assessment</DOCTITLE>


September 30, 1994.



In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's
(Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 FR 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has reviewed
the application for a minor license for the existing, unlicensed Cullasaja Hydroelectric Project, located on the
Cullasaja River in Highlands, North Carolina, and has prepared a Draft Environmental Assessment (DEA) for the project.
In the DEA, the Commission's staff has analyzed the potential environmental impacts of the existing project and has
concluded that approval of the project, with appropriate mitigation or enhancement measures, would not constitute
a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.

Copies of the DEA are available for review in the Public Reference Branch, Room 3104, of the Commission's offices at
941 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426.

Please submit any comments within 45 days from the date of this notice. Comments should be addressed to Lois D. Cashell,
Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426. Please
affix Project No. 10873 to all comments. For further information, please contact Jennifer Hill, Environmental Coordinator,

4. Shell Gas Pipeline Company and BP Exploration & Oil, Inc.


[Docket No. CP94-808-000]



Take notice that on September 27, 1994, Shell Gas Pipeline Company, P.O. Box 576, Houston, Texas 77001, and BP Exploration
& Oil, Inc. (BP), P.O. Box 4527, Houston, Texas 77210-4587, referred to together as Petitioners, jointly
filed a petition for declaratory order in Docket No. CP94-808-000, requesting that the Commission declare
that facilities to be constructed on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) would have the primary function of gathering
natural gas and would thereby be exempt from the Commission's jurisdiction pursuant to Section 1(b) of the Natural
Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the petition which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.


Petitioners state that they propose to construct the MARS Gas Gathering System to attach natural gas produced from
the Mississippi Canyon 807 Unit (MARS), produced by Shell Offshore, Inc. (SOI) and BP, to a point on interconnection
with the existing offshore jurisdictional natural gas transmission infrastructure. Petitioners state that the
MARS project would be located about 130 miles southeast of New Orleans in a water depth of 2,940 feet and is estimated
to have approximately 700 million barrel equivalent of oil and natural gas reserves. Petitioners indicate that the
MARS prospect was discovered in 1989 and is reported to be the largest discovery in the Gulf of Mexico in the past 20 years.
It is stated that SOI and BP have committed $1.2 billion for the initial development of the MARS prospect. 

It is stated that phase 1 of the MARS prospect would be developed by installing a tension leg platform (TLP) which would
be secured to the ocean floor by vertical tendons. It is also indicated that up to 24 oil and gas production wells would
be drilled and completed from the TLP via sub-sea flowlines. Petitioners state that initial production from the TLP
is expected to commence in the second half of 1996 and production is forecasted to eventually reach peak daily rates
of approximately 100,000 barrels of oil and 110,000 Mcf on natural gas. 

Petitioners state that the system would consist of a 14-inch pipeline extending approximately 45 to 60 miles from
the TLP to a shelf interconnection platform in the OCS area, Offshore Louisiana. It is also indicated that the project
would also include certain related facilities, that may include one or more gas sales meter stations, a pig launcher
and receivers, risers, slug catcher, sumps, drains, over-pressure protection facilities, gas and condensate meters
and condensate pumps. 

Petitioners state that the exact terminus of the MARS Gas Gathering Pipeline at which the TLP would be located is still
under evaluation and negotiation, with the petitioners intending to select an interconnection platform or platforms
allowing connection to one or more pipelines in the South Pass and Mississippi Canyon Areas. Petitioners indicates
that the design capacity of the pipeline would be 160,000 Mcf per day at an operating pressure of 1,650 psig. It is stated
that the production would be separated and dehydrated on the TLP as this is necessary to prevent the formation of hydrates
in the line, and compressed on the platform to a pressure which is sufficient to overcome the pressure drop in the proposed
MARS pipeline as well as to allow the gas to flow into the downstream interstate pipeline. It is also stated that the
gas may be processed onshore for the removal of liquids.

Petitioners seek a declaratory order holding that the proposed facilities would have the primary function of gathering
natural gas and would thereby be exempt from the Commission's jurisdiction pursuant to Section 1(b) of the Natural
Gas Act. In support of its claim that the primary function of the proposed facility is gathering, Petitioners point
out the following: (1) The length (45 to 60 miles) and diameter (14 inches) are comparable to other OCS facilities previously
determined to be gathering, (2) the geographic configuration of the facility (a, straight line, relatively small
diameter gathering line feeding production into an interstate pipeline) is consistent with other OCS gathering
facilities, (3) preliminary separation, dehydration, and compression will be done on the MARS TLP, (4) the facility
will be located entirely behind onshore processing plants, and (5) the facility would be owned and operated by companies
engaging primarily in exploration, production and non-jurisdictional gas gathering activities.

5. Southern Natural Gas Co.


[Docket No. CP94-809-000] 



Take notice that on September 27, 1994, Southern Natural Gas Company (Southern), P.O. Box 2563, Birmingham, Alabama
35202-2563, filed in Docket No. CP94-809-000 a request pursuant to Sections 157.205, 157.212,
and 157.216 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.212, and 157.216) for authorization
to abandon certain regulating and measurement facilities and change the operation of an existing delivery point
for Alabama Gas Corporation (Alagasco), under the blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82-406-000,
pursuant to Sections 7(b) and 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request which is on file with
the Commission and open to public inspection. 

Southern states that it is currently authorized to sell and deliver natural gas to the Chilton County Gas District
(Chilton) at the Chilton County Delivery Point (Chilton County), in Shelby County, Alabama, and to transport and
sell natural gas to Alagasco at the Montevallo Point of Delivery, also in Shelby County. Southern states that, in October
1993, Alagasco acquired the distribution facilities of Chilton. It is indicated that the two above-mentioned delivery
points lie adjacent to each other. Southern states that, since Alagasco now serves the distribution facilities behind
both of these delivery points, Alagasco has requested and Southern has agreed to consolidate deliveries at these
two delivery points so that all gas that is now delivered to Alagasco at Chilton County would be delivered to Alagasco
at Montevallo. Accordingly, Southern proposes to abandon the measurement facilities at Chilton County. 

Southern states that, in order to accommodate the combined stream of volumes at Montevallo, Southern requests authorization
under  157.212(a) of the Commission's Regulations to deliver gas to Montevallo at a contract delivery pressure
of mainline pressure not less than 150 psig and to install a 3-inch rotary meter to have the ability to measure accurately
the additional level of flow at the higher pressure. Southern also indicates that, to implement the change in contract
delivery pressure, it requests authorization to abandon two 3-inch regulators at Montevallo which had been used
to reduce pressure from Southern's mainline to the present contract delivery pressure of 75 psig. In addition, Southern
proposes to abandon the meter station at Chilton County. 

Southern states that the modification of the Montevallo Station would eliminate the need to continue the Chilton
County Station. In addition, Southern states that the abandonment of the Chilton County Station would decrease Southern's
maintenance costs. 

Southern advises that the total volumes to be delivered to Alagasco after the request do not exceed the total volumes
authorized prior to the request. Also, Southern indicates that the proposed activity is not prohibited by its existing
tariff and that it has sufficient capacity to accommodate the changes proposed herein without detriment or disadvantage
to Southern's other customers. In addition, Southern indicates that the changes in operations at Montevallo would
have no impact on Southern's ability to serve its peak day and annual requirements.

Acid Rain Program: Draft Permits and Permit Modification 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of draft permits and permit modification.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is issuing for comment one draft substitution plan and five draft
nitrogen oxides (NOx) compliance plans for two utility plants in accordance with the Acid Rain Program regulations
(40 CFR parts 72 and 76).


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Title IV of the Clean Air Act directs EPA to establish a program to reduce the adverse effects of acidic deposition by
promulgating rules and issuing permits to emission sources subject to the program. On January 11, 1993, EPA promulgated
final rules implementing the SO

2

 portion of the program. Subsequently, several parties filed petitions for review of the rules with the U.S. Court
of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. On May 4, 1994, EPA and other parties signed a settlement agreement
addressing the substitution and reduced utilization issues. In today's action, EPA proposes to approve substitution
and NOx compliance plans and include them in final permits for the following utility plants consistent with the May
4, 1994 settlement and 40 CFR part 76: 


Petersburg in Indiana: one substitution plan for 1995, in which units 1 and 2 designate H T Pritchard units 3 and 4 as
substitution units; five NOx averaging plans, one for each calendar year 1995-1996 in which the actual annual
average emission rates for NOx shall not exceed the alternative contemporaneous annual emission limitations of
0.60 lbs/MMBtu for unit 1, 0.44 lbs/MMBtu for unit 2, 0.41 lbs/MMBtu for unit 3, and 0.41 lbs/MMBtu for unit 4, and the
actual annual heat input shall not be greater than the annual heat input limit of 10,635,000 MMBtu for unit 1, and shall
not be less than the annual heat input limits of 23,670,000 MMBtu for unit 2, 36,935,000 MMBtu for unit 3, and 36,118,000
MMBtu for unit 4. The other units designated in the plans are H T Pritchard units 3, 4, 5, and 6 and Elmer W Stout units 50,
60, and 70. The designated representative is Robert A. McKnight. 
H T Pritchard in Indiana: 586 substitution allowances for 1995 to unit 3; 1,305 substitution allowances for 1995 to
unit 4; one substitution plan for 1995 in which Petersburg units 1 and 2 designate units 3 and 4 as substitution units;
five averaging plans, one for each calendar year 1995-1996 for units 3, 4, 5, and 6 in which the actual annual average
emission rates for NOx shall not exceed the alternative contemporaneous annual emission limitations of 0.80 lbs/MMBtu
for units 3 and 4 and 0.54 lb/MMBtu for units 5 and 6, and the actual annual heat input shall not be greater than the annual
heat input limits of 1,312,000 MMBtu for unit 3, 1,883,000 MMBtu for unit 4, 2,044,000 MMBtu for unit 5, and 4,766,000
for unit 6. The other units designated in the plans are Petersburg units 1, 2, 3, and 4 and Elmer W Stout units 50, 60, and
70. The designated representative is Robert A. McKnight.

barring claims, discharging and releasing the Receiver, and cancelling the Articles of Incorporation of the Coleman
Production Credit Association arising out of the involuntary liquidation of the association. The text of the FCA
Board Action is set forth below: 

Farm Credit Administration Board Action to Bar Claims, to Discharge and Release Receiver, and Cancel Charter (Articles
of Incorporation) of Coleman Production Credit Association 

Whereas, the Farm Credit Administration (FCA) Board determined that the Coleman Production Credit Association
(Coleman PCA), headquartered in Coleman, Texas, was in an unsafe and unsound condition to transact business and,
under its authority in section 4.12(b) of the Farm Credit Act of 1971, as amended, and 12 CFR 611.1160(b), did place
the Coleman PCA into receivership on April 26, 1989; 

Whereas, on April 26, 1989, the FCA Board, by FCA Board Action 

#

DA-45 (26-APR-89), did appoint James C. Larson as the Receiver for the Coleman PCA (Receiver), and
published the notice of appointment in the 

Federal Register

 on May 4, 1989, at 54 FR 19236, as required by FCA regulations; 

Whereas, by May 1, 1992, all territory served by the Coleman PCA was reassigned by the FCA to adjoining production credit
associations affiliated with the Farm Credit Bank of Texas; 

Whereas, all assets of the Coleman PCA have been disposed of by the Receiver in accordance with the provisions of FCA
regulations and the written agreement between the Receiver and the FCA (Receivership Agreement); 

Whereas, in accordance with the provisions of FCA regulations and the Receivership Agreement, all claims filed by
creditors and holders of equities have been paid or provided for, including, without limitation, certain administrative
expenses that the Receiver has paid; 

Whereas, the final audit of the Coleman PCA was completed by KPMG Peat Marwick LLP, an independent auditor, as of June
15, 1994; and 

Whereas, on September 20, 1994, the FCA issued to the Receiver a final Report of Examination of the Coleman PCA as of
June 30, 1994; 

Now, therefore, it is hereby ordered that: 

1. All claims of creditors, stockholders, and holders of participation certificates and other equities, and of any
other persons and/or entities against the Coleman PCA, or to the extent arising out of the actions of the Receiver in
carrying out the liquidation of the Coleman PCA, as approved by the FCA Board on April 26, 1989, against the Receiver
are hereby forever discharged, and the commencement of any action, the employment of any process, or any other act
to collect, recover, or offset any such claims are hereby forever barred. 

2. The accounts of the Coleman PCA for the period from April 26, 1989, through the date of this FCA Board Action are hereby
approved. 

3. Mr. James C. Larson (Receiver) is hereby finally discharged and released from all responsibility or liability
to the FCA or any other person or entity arising out of, related to, or in any manner connected with the administration
and liquidation of the Coleman PCA during the period April 26, 1989, through the date of this FCA Board Action. FCA Board
Action 

#

DA-45 (26-APR-89) is hereby revoked. 

4. The Articles of Incorporation of the Coleman Production Credit Association are hereby cancelled.

any questions of fact that are in dispute, summarizing the evidence that would be presented at a hearing, and indicating

The applicant requests an amendment to his current permit to include take activities for the Texas (

Ayenia limitaris

) and the South Texas ambrosia (

<DOCTITLE>Availability of an Environmental Assessment/Habitat Conservation Plan and Receipt of an Application for an Incidental
Take Permit for the Proposed Barton Creek Development, Austin, Travis County, TX</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

F.M. Properties Operating Co., Inc. (Applicant) has applied to the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) for an incidental
take permit pursuant to Section 10(a) of the Endangered Species Act (Act). The Applicant has been assigned permit
number PRT-782833. The requested permit, which is for a period not to exceed 30 years, would authorize the incidental
take of the endangered golden-cheeked warbler 

(Dendroica chrysoparia).

 The proposed take would occur as a result of the construction of and operation of a 4,684-acre commercial and residential
development on a 9,000-acre tract in Austin, Travis County, Texas.



The Service has prepared an Environmental Assessment/Habitat Conservation Plan (EA/HCP) for the incidental take
permit application. A determination of jeopardy to the species or a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) will
not be made before 30 days from the date of publication of this notice. This notice is provided pursuant to Section 10(c)
of the Act and National Environmental Policy Act regulations (40 CFR 1506.6)



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Section 9 of the Act prohibits the ``taking'' of endangered species, like the golden-cheeked warbler. However, the
Service, under limited circumstances, may issue permits to take endangered wildlife species if such taking is incidental
to, and not the purpose of otherwise lawful activities. Regulations governing permits for endangered species are
at 50 CFR 17.22.



The Applicant plans to build a Residential-Resort and Commercial development located just west of Capital of Texas
Highway 360, south of FM 2244, and north of Highway 290, Austin, Travis County, Texas. The development will occupy
approximately 4,684 acres. These activities will permanently eliminate about 1,036 acres of the 3,830 acres of occupied
and/or suitable warbler habitat. The Applicant proposes to mitigate the incidental take via acquisition and donation
of 3,923 acres of land, provision of operating and maintenance funds for these preserve lands, minimize impacts to
warbler habitat, avoidance of direct impacts to warblers, preservation of undeveloped areas, and environmental
monitoring.

The Applicant considered four alternatives but rejected three of them because they were not economically viable.

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>





Northeast Nuclear Energy Company, The Connecticut Light and Power Company; The Western Massachusetts Electric
Company, Millstone Nuclear Power Station, Unit No. 2; Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact


The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an exemption from Facility Operating
License No. DPR-65, issued to Northeast Nuclear Energy Company, (NNECO or the licensee), for operation of the
Millstone Nuclear Power Station, Unit No. 2, located in New London County, Connecticut.



Environmental Assessment



Identification of the Proposed Action



The proposed action would provide a schedular exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR part 50, appendix J. Sections
III.D.2.(a) and III.D.3 on behalf of Millstone Nuclear Power Station, Unit 2. On September 23, 1994, NNECO determined
that the 24-month testing requirement had been exceeded for a number of Type B and C components by up to approximately
four months. The exemption would provide temporary relief from the 2-year schedular requirement associated with
Type B and C periodic Containment local leakage rate tests (LLRTs). The proposed exemption would extend the 2-year
requirement through the end of the 12 refueling outage.

The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's application for exemption dated September 26, 1994.



The Need for the Proposed Action



The proposed action would permit Millstone Unit 2 to proceed with the current schedule for the twelfth refueling outage
which is when the plant begins a shut down currently scheduled for October 1, 1994. The proposed exemption would allow
the licensee to take advantage of the preparations that have been made for the upcoming refueling outage, including
initiatives which would reduce personnel radiation exposure, allow dynamic testing of motor-operated valves,
permit testing of main steam safety valves, and allow the performance of work on the service water system to reduce
shutdown risks.



Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action



The Commission has completed its evaluation of the proposed action and concludes that there are no significant radiological
or nonradiological impacts associated with the proposed action and that the issuance of the proposed exemption will
have no significant impact on the quality of the human environment. The change will not increase the probability or
consequences of accidents, no changes are being made in the types of any effluents that may be released offsite, and
there is no significant increase in the allowable individual or cumulative occupational radiation exposure. Accordingly,
the Commission concludes that there are no significant radiological environmental impacts associated with the
proposed action.

<DOCNO> FR941006-2-00090 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941006-2-00073 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed action does involve features located entirely within
the restricted area as defined in 10 CFR part 20. It does not affect nonradiological plant effluents and has no other
environmental impact. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that their are no significant nonradiological environmental
impacts associated with the proposed action.


Alternatives to the Proposed Action


Since the Commission has concluded there is no measurable environmental impact associated with the proposed action,
any alternatives with equal or greater environmental impact need not be evaluated. The principal alternative to
the action would be to deny the request. Such action would not enhance the protection of the environment and would result
in unjustified cost to the licensee.


Alternative Use of Resources


This action does not involve the use of any resources not previously considered in the Final Environmental Statement
for the Millstone Nuclear Power Station, Unit No. 2.


Agencies and Persons Consulted


The NRC staff consulted with the Connecticut State Official regarding the environmental impact of the proposed action.
The State official had no comments.


Finding of no Significant Impact


Based upon the environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant
effect on the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental
impact statement for the proposed action.
For further details with respect to the proposed action, see the licensee's letter dated September 26, 1994, which
is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, The Gelman Building, 2120 L Street,
NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room located at the Learning Resource Center, Three Rivers
Community-Technical College, Thames Valley Campus, 474 New London Turnpike, Norwich, Connecticut 06360.

<DOCTITLE>Philadelphia Electric Company, Public Service Electric and Gas Company, Delmarva Power and Light Company, Atlantic
City Electric Company, (Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station, Unit 2); Exemption</DOCTITLE>


I


Philadephia Electric Company, et al. (PECo, the licensees), is the holder of Facility Operating License No. DPR-44,
which authorizes operation of the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station (PBAPS), Unit 2. The license provides, among
other things, that the licensee is subject to all rules, regulations, and orders of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(the Commission) now and hereafter in effect.
The PBAPS, Unit 2, facility consists of a boiling water reactor located in York County, Pennsylvania.


II


In its letter dated May 13, 1994, the licensee requested an exemption from the Commission's regulations. The subject
exemption is from a requirement in Appendix J to 10 CFR part 50 that a set of three Type A tests (Containment Integrated
Leak Rate Tests (CILRTs)) be performed, at approximately equal intervals, during each 10-year service period. The
exemption applies to the second 10-year service period; subsequent service periods are not changed.
The type A test is defined in 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J, Section II.F, as ``tests intended to measure the primary reactor
containment overall integrated leakage rate (1) After the containment has been completed and is ready for operation,
and (2) at periodic intervals thereafter.'' The 10-year service period begins with the inservice date. The request
for a one-time exemption would allow an extension of the second 10-year Type A service period and would allow the performance
of the three Type A tests in the second 10-year service period at intervals that are not approximately equal. It does
not affect the third 10-year service period.
Current TS and 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J, would require performing a Type A test during Unit 2's refueling outage 10
scheduled for September 1994 in order to comply with the requirement to perform three Type A tests within the current
10-year service period. Furthermore, 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J, would also require a Type A test to be performed during
the next refueling outage (Unit 2 refueling outage 11 scheduled for September 1996) in order to coincide with the end
of the current 10-year plant inservice inspection (ISI) interval. The current 10-year ISI period ends in November
1997 and current ISI inspections are scheduled for September 1996. Therefore, to fully comply with Appendix J, the
licensee would have to perform CILRTs during the tenth and eleventh refueling outages for Unit 2.
The licensee stated that the first and second CILRTs of the set of three tests for the second 10-year service period
for PBAPS were conducted in February 1989 and April 1991. Thus, the first CILRT testing interval of the second 10-year
service period was approximately 44 months, and the second CILRT testing interval was approximately 27 months. The
time interval between CILRTs should be about 40 months based on performing three such tests at approximately equal
intervals during each 10-year service period. The third of the second set of three CILRTs will be scheduled for Refueling
Outage 11, projected to start in September 1996, pending approval of the exemption request. Issuance of this exemption
would allow the extension of the second 10-year service period such that the next CILRT would be performed during Refueling
Outage 11, approximately 66 months after the April 1991 CILRT.

The licensee performed a review of the history of the PBAPS Unit 2 CILRT results to evaluate the risk of activity-based
and time-based degradation. This review identified only one activity-based component failure detected during
past CILRTs. The measured mass point and total time leakage rates measured for the June 1985 CILRT stabilized at approximately
0.70% wt/day, which failed to meet the TS and 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J criterion of less than 0.375% wt/day (0.75 La).
Following the completion of repairs, the CILRT was repeated with an as-left leakage of 0.0156% wt/day. After this
failure, the licensee modified the plant so that a similar failure, in the future, would be detected by a local leak
rate test (LLRT).

The Type B and C test (i.e., LLRT) program provides assurance that containment integrity has been maintained. LLRTs
demonstrate operability of components and penetrations by measuring penetration and valve leakage. Additionally,
there have been no modifications made to the plant, since the last Type A test, that could adversely affect the test
results.

The licensee further notes that the performance of consecutive Type A tests in refueling outages 2R010 and 2R011 to
meet the requirements of the TS and Appendix J, would result in additional radiation exposure to personnel. Performing
the Type A test during two consecutive refueling outages in order to comply with the TS and 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J,
would result in an unnecessary increased in personnel radiation exposure and increased cost by increasing the length
of one of the affected refueling outages. Omitting the test will result in additional dose savings by eliminating
contamination and by reducing exposure from venting and draining and from setups and restorations of instrumentation
required to perform the test. These factors and the costs associated with an additional test for a 24-month difference
in interval are not offset by the benefits of the additional test.

For the reasons set forth above, the NRC staff concludes that this deviation from the 10-year service period ending
August 1994 is not significant in terms of complying with the safety or scheduling requirements of Section III.D.1.(a)
of Appendix J. Accordingly, the staff finds that the additional test would not provide substantially different information
and that the intent of Appendix J is met. Therefore, the subject exemption request meets the special circumstances
of 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii), in that the fourth Type A test is not necessary to achieve the underlying purpose of the rule.

On this basis, the NRC staff finds that the licensee has demonstrated that special circumstances are present as required
by 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2). Further, the staff also finds that extending the service period will not present an undue risk
to the public health and safety; since the licensee has justified the leaktight integrity of the containment based
on previous leakage test results, the staff concludes that a one-time extension of the second 10-year service period
and a one-time implementation of an extended test interval will not have a significant safety impact.



III



Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12, the Commission may, upon application by any interested person or upon its own initiative,
grant exemptions from the requirements of 10 CFR Part 50 when (1) The exemptions are authorized by law, will not present
an undue risk to public health and safety, and are consistent with the common defense and security; and (2) when special
circumstances are present. Special circumstances are present whenever, according to 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii), ``Application
of the regulation in the particular circumstances would not serve the underlying purpose of the rule or is not necessary
to achieve the underlying purpose of the rule. . . .'' 

The underlying purpose of the requirement to perform Type A containment leak rate tests is to provide for periodic
verification of the leak-tight integrity of the primary reactor containment. The licensee has demonstrated that
the leak tight integrity of the primary containment can be assured the latest test results and by controlling the maintenance
activities which affect a primary containment penetration. The Type B and C testing will provide additional assurance
of the overall integrity of the primary containment.

On this basis, the NRC staff finds that the licensee has demonstrated that special circumstances are present as required
by 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii). Since the licensee has justified the leaktight integrity of the containment based on previous
leakage test results, the staff concludes that a one-time extension of the second 10-year service period will not
have a significant safety impact. The staff also finds that extending the interval between tests will not present
an undue risk to the public health and safety.



IV



Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12, an exemption is authorized by law and will
not present an undue risk to the public health and safety and that there are special circumstances present, as specified
in 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2), such that application of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J, Section III.D.1.(a) is not necessary in
order to achieve the underlying purpose of this regulation; and hereby grants the following exemption with respect
to the requirements of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J, Section III.D.1(a).

For the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station, Unit 2, the second 10-year Type A service period is extended such that the
third periodic Type A test may be performed during the Unit 2 Refueling Outage 11 currently scheduled for September
1996 and such that the three Type A tests in the second 10-year service period are performed at intervals that are not
approximately equal.

Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that the granting of this exemption will have no significant
effect on the quality of the human environment (59 FR 50018).

This exemption is effective upon issuance.

<DOCTITLE>Western Industrial X-Ray Inspection Company, Inc., Evanston, Wyoming; Order to Transfer Material (Effective Immediately)
and Order Revoking License</DOCTITLE>


I


Western Industrial X-Ray Inspection Company, Inc. (Licensee or WIX) is the holder of Byproduct Material License
No. 49-27356-01 issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or Commission) pursuant to 10 CFR Parts
30 and 34. The license authorizes the Licensee to possess sealed sources of iridium-192 in various radiography devices
for use in performing industrial radiography activities. The license originally issued on August 12, 1991, and due
to expire on August 31, 1996, was suspended by NRC Order (EA 93-238) on June 16 1994.


II


On June 16, 1994, the NRC issued an Order Suspending License (Immediately Effective) (Suspension Order) and Demand
for Information to WIX. The Suspension Order was based on inspections and investigations that had identified numerous
violations of NRC's radiation safety requirements, including some violations which were found to have recurred
after being found in previous inspections and several which were determined to have been committed deliberately
by WIX employees and by the President and Radiation Safety Officer (RSO) for WIX, Larry D. Wicks. Apparent violations
were described in inspection reports 030-32190/93-01 and 030-32190/94-01 issued on May
12, 1994. The violations were also described in the June 16, 1994 Suspension Order. The Suspension Order required
WIX to suspend its use of NRC-regulated material and to place it in safe storage pending further order. The Demand for
Information required WIX to describe why, in light of the violations and managerial failures discussed in the Suspension
Order, NRC License No. 49-27356-01 should not be revoked and also why an order should not be issued to Mr.
Wicks prohibiting him from performing NRC-licensed activities. 
On June 17 and June 28, 1994, letters were submitted to the NRC on behalf of WIX by its attorney, John C. Phillips. These
letters provided WIX's response to the violations and requested relaxation or rescission of the Suspension Order.
In response to the violations, WIX admitted some of the violations, denied some of the violations, and denied that
Larry D. Wicks had ever deliberately caused the Licensee to be in violation of NRC requirements or at any time provided
materially false information to the NRC. In addition, the June 28, 1994 letter included a Corrective Measure Plan
that described various actions taken by WIX to preclude a recurrence of the violations that led to the Suspension Order.
Actions described in the responses include obtaining more alarm ratemeters, establishing a system for their system
for their issuance and ensuring the current of their calibrations, designation of an Assistant RSO, and creation
of additional records, along with statements assuring future compliance. The responses amount to assertions of
being in compliance, that most of the violations were inconsequential and the public health and safety had not been
jeopardized, and that future conduct will prevent violations. These responses were submitted as a basis for relaxing
or rescinding the Suspension Order and did not provide an adequate or specific response to the Demand for Information
which asked why the license should not be revoked. The NRC reviewed the information in these letters to determine whether
WIX had provided sufficient justification for the NRC to relax or rescind the Suspension Order. On July 19, 1994, the
NRC denied WIX's requests in writing, stating, ``Given the nature of the violations in this case, the NRC's concerns
about the integrity of certain WIX personnel, and the licensee's failure to address adequately the fundamental problems
identified in the Order, e.g., our significant concerns regarding the capability or willingness of Mr. Wicks and
other WIX personnel to ensure compliance with NRC requirements, I find the mere promise in your submittals of future
compliance with NRC requirements insufficient assurance at this time that WIX employees will conduct licensed activities
in accordance with NRC requirements.''
In its second report, OI concluded that four WIX employees, including the President, committed four deliberate violations.
These violations have safety significance, such as failure to evaluate a potential overexposure, preparation of
false reports concerning a potential overexposure, and failure to supervise radiography operations. The NRC remains
concerned about the deliberate violations caused by WIX's President and RSO, especially as they pertain to a possible
overexposure incident, and his other failures to properly direct the conduct of licensed activities in a safe manner.
It is this failure to conduct licensed activities in a safe manner, coupled with questions as to the integrity of several
employees, that cause the NRC to be concerned about public health and safety. In its response, WIX did not sufficiently
demonstrate that the NRC could rely upon it to ensure that the public health and safety would be protected if radioactive
materials were to be used in the future under License No. 49-27356-01.

III


The acts and omissions of WIX's President and RSO violated NRC requirements over an extended period of time. These
violations jeopardized the public health and safety and, on that basis alone, represent a very significant regulatory
concern. These violations demonstrate that the Licensee and its President are not willing or able to comply with the
Commission's requirements to protect the public health and safety. As a result, I am also issuing an Order (EA 94-140)
this date to the President and RSO of WIX prohibiting him from engaging in NRC-licensed activities (except as necessary
to store and tranfer material).

WIX's license has remained suspended since June 16, 1994. Several radiography exposure devices containing sealed
radiation sources have remained in the Licensee's possession although the Licensee does not have authorization
to use the material. Given the seriousness of the violations that occurred, and the NRC's order removing WIX's President
and RSO, who is responsible for this material, I find that the public health, safety, and interest require the Licensee
to transfer all NRC-regulated material in its possession and that License No. 49-27356-01 be revoked.
Furthermore, in view of the nature of the violations and the deliberate misconduct described in both the June 16, 1994
Suspension Order (EA 93-238) and the Order Prohibiting Involvement in NRC-licensed activities (EA 94-140)
issued this date to Mr. Wicks, the Commission does not have reasonable assurance that the material will be safety stored
and transferred during the time that it might take to litigate this Order and the removal Order (EA 94-140). Therefore,
pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202, I find that the significance of the violations and deliberate misconduct described in the
June 16, 1994 Suspension Order (EA 93-238) and the Order (EA 94-140) to Mr. Wicks of this date, are such that
the public health, safety, and interest require that the Order to Transfer Material part of this Order be immediately
effective.



IV



Accordingly, pursuant to sections 81, 161b, 161c, 161i, 161o, 182 and 186 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended,
and the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 2.202 and 10 CFR Parts 30 and 34:

A. It is hereby ordered, effective immediately, that:

1. The licensee shall transfer all NRC-licensed material acquired or possessed under the authority of License No.
49-27356-01 within 20 days of the date of this Order, either by returning the material to the manufacturer
or transferring it to another person authorized to possess that material;

2. Any sources that have not been leak tested within six months prior to the transfer shall be leak tested by a person
authorized to do so, prior to transfer of the source;

3. The Licensee shall notify Ms. Linda Kasner, NRC, Region IV, (817) 860-8213, by telephone at least two working
days prior to the date(s) of transfer of radioactive material so that the NRC, may, if it elects, observe the transfer
of the material; and

4. The licensee shall, within 5 days after transfer of the material, certify in writing to the Regional Administrator,
NRC Region IV, that all material has been properly transferred and provide the Regional Administrator copies of records
of transfer required by 10 CFR 30.51.

5. The issuance of this Order does not otherwise alter the continued effectiveness of the Suspension Order.

B. It is further ordered that: Following confirmation of the transfer of all NRC-licensed material currently possessed,
as discussed above, License No. 49-27356-01 is revoked.

The Director, Office of Enforcement, may, in writing, at any time prior to final agency action sustaining the revocation
of License No. 49-27356-01, relax or rescind this order on demonstration by the Licensee, in writing,
of good cause.



V


In accordance with 10 CFR 2.202, the Licensee must, and any other person adversely affected by this Order may, submit
an answer to this Order, and may request a hearing on this Order, within 20 days of the date of this Order.

The answer may consent to this Order. Unless the answer consents to this Order, the answer shall, in writing and under
oath or affirmation, specifically admit or deny each allegation or charge made in this order and set forth the matter
of fact and law on which the Licensee or other person adversely affected relies and the reasons as to why the Order should
not have been issued. Any answer or request for a hearing shall be submitted to the Secretary, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, ATTN: Chief, Docketing and Service Section, Washington, D.C. 20555. Copies also shall be sent to the
Director, Office of Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20555, to the Assistant
General Counsel for Hearings and Enforcement at the same address, to the Regional Administrator, NRC Region IV, 611
Ryan Plaza Drive, Suite 400, Arlington, Texas 76011, and to the Licensee if the hearing request is by a person other
than the Licensee. If a person other than the Licensee requests a hearing, that person shall set forth with particularity
the manner in which his or her interest is adversely affected by this Order and shall address the criteria set forth
in 10 CFR 2.714(d).
If a hearing is requested by the Licensee or a person whose interest is adversely affected, the Commission will issue
an Order designating the time and place of any hearing. If a hearing is held, the issue to be considered at such hearing

<DOCTITLE>Larry D. Wicks; Order Prohibiting Involvement in NRC-Licensed Activities (Effective Immediately)</DOCTITLE>



I



Larry D. Wicks is the President and Radiation Safety Office for Western Industrial X-Ray Inspection Company, Inc.
(WIX), Evanston, Wyoming. WIX holds License No. 49-27356-01 issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(NRC or Commission) pursuant to 10 CFR Parts 30 and 34. The license authorizes the licensee to possess sealed sources
of iridium-192 in various radiography devices for use in performing industrial radiography in accordance with the
conditions of the license. The license was suspended by NRC Order on June 16, 1994, and remains suspended while a hearing
requested by the licensee is pending.



II



The suspension of License No. 49-27356-01 was based on the results of NRC staff inspections and Office
of Investigations (OI) investigations of WIX conducted in April 1993 and in January and March 1994. These inspections
and investigations identified numerous violations of NRC's radiation safety requirements, including some violations
that were found to have recurred after being identified in previous inspections and some which were found to have been
committed deliberately by Mr. Wicks and other employees of WIX. These violations were described in inspection reports
030-232190/93-01 and 030-32190/94-01 issued on May 12, 1993, and were the subject of an enforcement
conference held April 1, 1994 in Arlington, Texas, during which Mr. Wicks was given the opportunity to provide additional
information concerning each violation. In Investigation Report 4-93-017R, issued August 2, 1993, OI
found three deliberate violations and in Report 4-93-049R, issued July 8, 1994, OI found four deliberate
violations.

Based on its review of all available information, the NRC concludes that Mr. Wicks violated the provisions of 10 CFR
30.10 which prohibits individuals from deliberately causing a licensee to violate NRC requirements and from deliberately
providing materially incomplete or inaccurate information to the NRC or to a licensee of the NRC. Specifically, as
discussed below in more detail, the NRC concludes that: (1) Mr. Wicks deliberately failed to send an employee's thermoluminescent
dosimeter (TLD) in for immediate processing after he learned of a radiography incident that occurred on July 31, 1993,
a violation of 10 CFR 34.33(d); (2) Mr. Wicks deliberately failed to perform an evaluation of the same employee's radiation
exposure after becoming aware of the incident, a violation of 10 CFR 20.201; (3) Mr. Wicks deliberately provided inaccurate
information to NRC investigators about the July 31, 1993, incident and his follow-up to the incident, a violation
of 10 CFR 30.10; and (4) During March, April, and July of 1993 and January 1994, Mr.Wicks deliberately failed to ensure
that calibrated alarm ratemeters were provided and used by WIX radiography personnel, a violation of 10 CFR 34.33(f)(4).

The first three violations above are directly related to the July 31, 1993, radiography incident. That incident,
which was reported to Mr. Wicks on the date it occurred, by the two WIX employees who were involved in it, involved a radiation
source in a radiographic exposure device not being properly returned to its shielded position before the device was
moved by one of the employees. This resulted in the self-reading pocket dosimeter of one of the employees, a radiographer's
assistant, going off-scale, indicating that the radiographer's assistant received a radiation exposure beyond
the range of the pocket dosimeter.
 When the pocket dosimeter of someone engaged in radiography is discharged beyond its normal range, NRC regulations
in 10 CFR Parts 34 and 20, respectively, require: (1) That the licensee send the individual's TLD in for immediate processing
to determine the individual's radiation exposure; and (2) that the licensee perform evaluations as necessary, whether
or not a TLD reading is available, to determine the individual's radiation exposure and to ensure compliance with
NRC exposure limits. In this case, the NRC concludes that Mr. Wicks deliberately did neither and that he has not been
truthful in providing information about this incident to NRC personnel and others.





When the NRC began its investigation of this incident in January 1994, Mr. Wicks had no record of the radiographer's
assistant's exposure for the day or month in question. Mr. Wicks stated during the investigation and at the enforcement
conference that after learning of the incident he sent all TLDs worn by company personnel during the month of July 1993
in one package to Landauer, Inc., the company that processes TLDs for WIX, and that he included a note requesting immediate
processing of the TLD worn by the radiographer's assistant. However, a representative of Landauer, Inc., stated
to NRC personnel that while it had received TLDs from WIX for other employees for the month of July 1993, it had no record
of receiving a TLD for the radiographer's assistant for that month and no record of receiving a request from Mr. Wicks
for expedited processing of any TLDs sent in for that month. In fact, exposure records for the month of July 1993 and
quarterly records for the months of July-September 1993 which were mailed by Landauer to WIX and retained by
WIX contain no information regarding the radiographer's assistant's exposure for the month of July 1993 (her exposure
records for all other months are available).

Mr. Wicks told NRC investigators that he had never provided an exposure estimate to the rediographer's assistant
because he had none to give her, i.e., he did not have a report from Landuer. However, this is inconsistent with statements
by: (1) The radiographer's assistant_that she persisted in trying to obtain from Mr. Wicks the exposure for the month
of July and that Mr. Wicks eventually_about three weeks after the incident_told her she had received 350 millirem,
(2) the radiographer involved in the incident that Mr. Wicks had informed him that ``everything was OK'' and that the
radiographer's assistant had received 600 millirem for the quarter, and (3) the assistant's husband, also a WIX employee,
that Mr. Wicks had called his wife two to three weeks after the incident and had given her a number ``which was lower and
we were happy.'' 

Mr. Wicks contended during the enforcement conference that he had been misled by the employees involved in the incident
into believing that the incident was not serious. While both employees admit to providing Mr. Wicks false accounts
of the incident in an attempt to cover up their own mistakes, the radiographer's assistant and her husband both told
NRC investigators that Mr. Wicks was informed when the reports were turned in on July 31, 1993, that the reports were
false and that Mr. Wicks was told that the radiographer involved in the incident had been asleep in the truck instead
of supervising the radiographers assistant (as required by NRC regulations). Mr. Wicks denied having been told that
the reports were false. 

Mr. Wicks also told NRC personnel during the enforcement conference that he did not realize that Landauer had not provided
him a July 1993 exposure record for the radiographer's assistant and had not called Landauer until the NRC began its
investigation in January 1994. The only explanation Mr. Wicks has offered for not pursuing the question of the radiographer's
assistant's July 1993 exposure is that he was very busy. However, the following events raise significant questions
about Mr. Wicks' credibility: 

1. In August 1993, Mr. Wicks received Landauer's report for the month of July 1993 which, as indicated earlier, contained
no monthly exposure record for the radiographer's assistant. Despite, according to Mr. Wicks, having requested
immediate processing of the assistant's badge from Landauer, Mr. Wicks told the NRC investigator that he didn't read
the monthly report. 

2. Mr. Wicks stated at the enforcement conference that he placed the assistant on limited duty as soon as he was informed
of the incident pending the receipt of a report from Landauer and that she was limited to working in the darkroom and
``completely away from any shooting area'' from July 31, 1993, until she left WIX toward the end of September 1993.
 Mr. Wicks stated that having an employee in a restricted status for nearly two months did not remind him of the fact that
he had never received a response to his request for immediate processing of her July 1993 TLD. 





3. On October 1, 1993, Mr. Wicks provided a summary of the radiographer's assistant's radiation exposure history,
including the period in question (July 1993), to her new employer, and NRC licensee. In doing so, Mr. Wicks relied not
on Landauer records, even though records were available for all months but July and September 1993, but by adding up
daily dosimeter records, which were blank for July 31, 1993. Despite making these calculations for the radiographer's
assistant, Mr. Wicks stated at the enforcement conference that he was not reminded of the fact that he had never received
a response to his request for immediate processing of her July 1993 TLD. 

4. Later in October 1993, Mr. Wicks responded to a request from the NRC for the radiation exposure reports of terminated
employees, as required by 10 CFR 20.408(b) In responding to this request, Mr. Wicks did not provide a report for the
radiographer's assistant despite having provided one for her husband, whose termination date occurred five days
after hers. Mr. Wicks had not provided the NRC a termination report for the radiographer's assistant when the NRC began
its investigation in January 1994. 

Moreover, Mr. Wicks is an experienced radiographer and has been trained on the significance of overexposures. Considering
that this appears to be the first time that his firm had the potential for an overexposure warranting immediate processing
of the assistant's badge and assuming that the badge was sent as he states, them it is not credible that he would not have
followed up on it. The NRC also does not consider credible Mr. Wicks' statement that he sent the TLD in for processing.
According to Landauer, the incidence of TLDs being lost in delivery is very small. In this case, the loss of the radiographer's
assistant's TLD in the mail is not an issue because Mr. Wicks has indicated on a number of occasions that he packaged
all WIX TLDs together for shipment to Landauer and Landauer received the package. Landauer representatives have
informed the NRC staff that all TLDs are electronically scanned upon receipt, and the Landauer employs the use of a
data base to verify that TLDs which are scanned after processing match those which are scanned upon receipt. The process
is designed to alert Landauer to situations in which a TLD is lost during processing. Landauer's automated reporting
system includes controls to flag and TLD number which was canned upon receipt and was not scanned again after processing.
Lost TLDs are noted on dosimetry reports provided to Landauer customers.

Based on its review of the evidence gathered during its investigation, as well as the information obtained during
the enforcement conference, the NRC concludes that Mr. Wicks did not send the radiographer's assistant's TLD in for
processing; that Mr. Wicks deliberately failed to conduct an evaluation of this individual's radiation exposure
from the incident; and that Mr. Wicks deliberately provided false information regarding the incident to the NRC and
false information regarding the individual's radiation exposure history to another licensee of the NRC.

In addition, with regard to the NRC's requirement that all radiography personnel be equipped with alarm ratemeters
that have been calibrated at periods not to exceed one year, the NRC's investigations found that Mr. Wicks repeatedly
failed to ensure that this requirement was met. This violation was first discovered and discussed with Mr. Wicks following
an inspection and investigation in April 1993. When the NRC conducted its investigation beginning in January 1994,
this same violation was found to have occurred in July 1993, two months after it was first discussed with Mr. Wicks,
and again in January 1994 when Mr. Wicks could not produce current calibration records for alarm ratemeters worn by
either of two radiography personnel on January 18, 1994. When questioned by NRC investigators, Mr. Wicks provided
conflicting statements as to whether he had even supplied ratemeters to his radiographers but he said he understood
it was his responsibility to ensure that alarm ratemeters were calibrated. Given the repetitive nature of this violation
and Mr. Wicks' knowledge of this requirement, the NRC concludes that Mr. Wicks deliberately caused licensee to violate
this requirement.



III



Based on the above, the NRC staff concludes that Larry D. Wicks, President and Radiation Safety Office for WIX, has
engaged in deliberate misconduct that has caused the Licensee to be in violation of 10 CFR 34.33(d), 34.33(f)(4),
and 20.201. It further appears that Mr. Wicks has deliberately provided to NRC personnel and to another licensee of
the NRC information that he knew to be incomplete or inaccurate in some respect material to the NRC, in violation of
10 CFR 30.10. The NRC must be able to rely on the Licensee and its employees to comply with NRC requirements, including
the requirement to provide information that is complete and accurate in all material respects. Mr. Wicks' actions
in causing the Licensee to be in deliberate violation of radiation safety requirements and his misrepresentations
to the NRC have raised serious doubts as to whether he can be relied upon to comply with NRC requirements and to provide
complete and accurate information to the NRC. NRC confidence in Mr. Wicks' conducting NRC-licensed activities safely
and in compliance with NRC requirements is further eroded by the fact that he was the President of the company and the
Radiation Safety Officer when he engaged in deliberate misconduct. In both of these positions, particularly in his
role as the Radiation Safety Officer, Mr. Wicks is relied upon by the NRC to ensure that all radiation safety requirements
are met. Conduct of this nature cannot and will not be tolerated by the NRC.

Consequently, I lack the requisite reasonable assurance that licensed activities can be conducted in compliance
with the Commission's requirements and that the health and safety of the public will be protected, if Mr. Wicks were
permitted at this time to engage in NRC-licensed activities. Therefore, the public health, safety and interest require
that Larry D. Wicks be prohibited from engaging in NRC-licensed activities (including any supervising, training,
or auditing) for either an NRC licensee or an Agreement State licensee performing licensed activities in areas of
NRC jurisdiction in accordance with 10 CFR 150.20 for a period of five (5) years from the date of this Order. Furthermore,
pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202, I find that the significance of the violations and conduct described above is such that the
public health, safety and interest require that this Order be immediately effective.



IV



Accordingly, pursuant to sections 81, 161b, 161i, 182 and 186 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the Commission's
regulations in 10 CFR 2.202 and 10 CFR 30.10, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY, THAT:

1. Larry Dale Wicks is prohibited for five years from the date of this Order from engaging in NRC-licensed activities,
except as provided in item 3, below. NRC-licensed activities are those activities that are conducted pursuant to
a specific or general license issued by the NRC, including but not limited to, those activities of Agreement State
licensees conducted pursuant to the authority by 10 CFR 150.20.

2. The first time Mr. Wicks is employed in NRC-licensed activities following the five-year prohibition, he shall
notify the Director, Office of Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20555 and the
Regional Administrator, NRC Region IV, at least five days prior to the performance of licensed activities (as described
in 1 above). The notice shall include the name, address, and telephone number of the NRC or Agreement State licensee
and the location where the licensed activities will be performed. The notice shall be accompanied by a statement that
Mr. Wicks is committed to compliance with regulatory requirements and the basis why the Commission should have confidence
that he will now comply with applicable NRC requirements.
3. Mr. Wicks is permitted to conduct licensed activities only as necessary to maintain licensed material in the possession
of Western Industrial X-Ray Inspection Company in safe storage and transfer the material to an authorized recipient.
The Director, Office of Enforcement, may, in writing, relax or rescind any of the above conditions upon demonstration
by Mr. Wicks of good cause.


V


In accordance with 10 CFR 2.202, Mr. Wicks must, and any other person adversely affected by this Order may, submit an
answer to this Order, and may request a hearing on this Order, within 20 days of the date of this Order. The answer may
consent to this Order. Unless the answer consents to this Order, the answer shall, in writing and under oath or affirmation,
specifically admit or deny each allegation or charge made in this Order and shall set forth the matters of fact and law
on which Mr. Wicks or other person adversely affected relies and the reasons as to why the Order should not have been
issued. Any answer or request for a hearing shall be submitted to the Secretary, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Attn: Chief, Docketing and Service Section, Washington, DC 20555. Copies also shall be sent to the Director, Office
of Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, to the Assistant General Counsel for
Hearings and Enforcement at the same address, to the Regional Administrator, NRC Region IV, 611 Ryan Plaza Drive,
Suite 400, Arlington, Texas 76011, and to Mr. Wicks if the answer or hearing request is by a person other than Mr. Wicks.
If a person other than Mr. Wicks requests a hearing, that person shall set forth with particularity the manner in which
his or her interest is adversely affected by this Order and shall address the criteria set forth in 10 CFR 2.714(d).
If a hearing is requested by Mr. Wicks or a person whose interest is adversely affected, the Commission will issue an
Order designating the time and place of any hearing. If a hearing is held, the issue to be considered at such hearing
shall be whether this Order should be sustained.
Pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202(c)(2)(i), Mr. Wicks, or any other person adversely affected by this Order, may, in addition
to demanding a hearing, at the time the answer is filed or sooner, move the presiding officer to set aside the immediate
effectiveness of the Order on the ground that the Order, including the need for immediate effectiveness, is not based
on adequate evidence but on mere suspicion, unfounded allegations, or error.
In the absence of any request for hearing, the provisions specified in Section IV above shall be final 20 days from the
date of this Order without further order or proceedings. AN ANSWER OR A REQUEST FOR HEARING SHALL NOT STAY THE IMMEDIATE
EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS ORDER.

Self-Regulatory Organizations; Filing of Proposed Rule Change by American Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating to Amendments
to Rule 179 Regarding Automatic Cancellation of Open Orders in Expiring Equity Securities



September 30, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on September 6, 1994, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below,
which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to
solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The Amex is proposing to amend Rule 179 to expand the categories of expiring equity securities as to which open orders
are automatically cancelled prior to commencing ``next day'' and ``cash'' trading. The text of the proposed rule
change is available at the Office of the Secretary, the Amex, and at the Commission.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



1. Purpose



Amex Rule 179 provides time frames during which orders in expiring rights and warrants must be for ``next day'' delivery
or for ``cash'' settlement, rather than for ``regular way'' five-day delivery. The rule was amended last year to provide
for the automatic cancellation of open ``regular way'' and ``next day'' orders in expiring rights and warrants prior
to commencing ``next day'' and ``cash'' trading in those securities.
 The normal ticker notice provided by the Exchange with respect to expiring rights and warrants provides ample notice
to members and member organizations regarding such cancellations, thereby given them the opportunity to replace
their cancelled orders if they wish to do so. Substituted ``next day'' and ``cash'' orders are treated as new orders
and are not entitled to retain the priority on the specialist's book of the cancelled ``regular way'' order. This amendment
has resulted in a significant reduction in ``DKs'' 
 and has facilitated accurate clearance and settlement in these securities.






The Exchange is now proposing that Rule 179 be further amended to expand the categories of expiring securities as to
which open orders are automatically cancelled prior to commencing ``next day'' and ``cash'' trading to include 

any 

expiring equity security.
 The amendment would be applicable, for example, to preferred stock,
 Contingent Value Rights, Stock Index Return Securities, Equity Linked Securities (``ELKS''), Yield Enhanced Equity
Linked Debt Securities (``YEELDS'') and other similar securities. These securities would generally change to ``next
day'' delivery and ``cash'' in accordance with the time frames applicable to rights. Thus, during the five business
days preceding the final day for trading in such security, every order therein entered on a specialist's book must
be for ``next day'' delivery, and, on final day for trading in such security, every order therein entered on the specialist's
book must be for ``cash.'' However, when appropriate, the Exchange may establish different time frames for particular
types of expiring equity securities.






The extension of the automatic cancellation provisions of the rule to these securities can be expected to provide
comparable benefits, 

i.e., 

a reduction in ``DKs'' and clearance and settlement errors.

2. Statutory Basis




The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the objectives of Section
6(b)(5) in particular in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments
to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.


B. 

Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition




The proposed rule change will impose no burden on competition.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants
or Others




No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



Within 35 days of the publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such other period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:


(A) By order approve the proposed rule change, or

(B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.




IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of the Amex. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-Amex-94-35
and should be submitted by October 27, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Boston Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Granting Approval to Proposed Rule Change Relating
to the Reporting of Certain Financial and Other Information by Broker-Dealers</DOCTITLE>



September 30, 1994.



On May 2, 1994, the Boston Stock Exchange, Inc. (``BSE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange
Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rules change adopt new section 2(n) to chapter 
XXII of the Rules of the Board of Governors of the Exchange. On May 12, 1994, the Exchange submitted to the Commission
Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change.
 On August 16, 1994, the Exchange submitted Amendment No. 2 to the proposed rule change.








The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34556 (August 19, 1994),
59 FR 44201 (August 26, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal.

Among other matters, the rule being adopted requires each broker-dealer for which the Exchange is the designated
examining authority (``DEA'') to provide to the Exchange on a quarterly basis (or more often as deemed appropriate
by the Exchange):

(a) A report of all assets and liabilities attributable to the broker-dealer or held by another entity for the account
of the broker-dealer;

(b) A description of any outstanding litigation or contracts that may have a material financial impact on the broker-dealer;
and

(c) A pro-forma consolidated capital computation of assets and liabilities of any subsidiary or affiliate for which
the broker-dealer guarantees, endorses or assumes directly or indirectly the obligations or liabilities.

In addition, the rule requires each such broker-dealer immediately to notify the Exchange of any financial matters
that may have a material impact on the firm's capital and or its equity requirements.

The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange including the requirements of section 6(b)
of the Act.
 In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the section 6(b)(5) requirements that the
rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative
acts, and, in general, to protect investors and the public.





The Commission believes that this rule will protect investors and the public interest by providing the BSE with an
early warning of potential financial difficulties at member firms for which it is the DEA and by otherwise enhancing
the BSE's ability to monitor the continued financial well being of such firms. Moreover, the proposed rule will help
the BSE to ensure its members' compliance with the requirements of the Commission's net capital rule, Rule 15c3-1
under the Act.





It is therefore ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 
 that the proposed rule change (SR-BSE-94-07) is approved. 





For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change and Filing and Order Granting Accelerated
Approval of Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 to the Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. Relating
to the Listing Criteria for Certain Hybrid Securities.</DOCTITLE>



September 30, 1994.



I. Introduction




On February 25, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') a proposed rule change to establish
specific listing criteria for certain hybrid securities. Notice of the proposal appeared in the 

Federal Register

 on April 7, 1994.
 No comment letters were received on the proposed rule change. The CBOE filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change
on September 28, 1994,
 and Amendment No. 2 on September 29, 1994.
 This order approves the CBOE proposal, as amended.









II. Description of the Proposal



Pursuant to CBOE Rule 31.5.F, the Exchange may approve for listing securities which can not be readily categorized
under the listing criteria for common and preferred stocks, bonds, debentures, warrants, or unit investment trusts.
The CBOE is now proposing to: (1) Amend Rule 31.5.F to decrease the minimum aggregate market value of such securities
to $4 million;
 (2) add Rule 31.5.H to provide listing standards for contingent value rights (``CVRs''); (3) add Rule 31.5.I to provide
listing standards for equity-linked term notes (``ELNs''); and (4) add Rule 31.5.J to provide listing standards
for paired securities.

A. Contingent Value Rights



CVRs are unsecured obligations providing for a possible cash payment at maturity based on the value of an equity security
issued by an affiliate of the issuer of the CVRs (``related security''). The holder of a CVR would be entitled to a cash
payment at maturity if the market price of the related security is lower than a predetermined target price. If the market
price of the related security equals or exceeds the target price, the holder of the CVR would not be entitled to receive
such a cash payment.

Under proposed Rule 31.5.H, a CVR would be eligible for listing by the CBOE if: (1) The issuer satisfies the net worth
and earnings requirements set forth in Exchange Rule 31.5.A;
 (2) the issuer has assets in excess of $100 million; (3) there is a minimum public distribution of one million CVRs;
(4) there are at least 400 public holders of the CVRs; (5) the aggregate market value of the CVRs is at least $4 million;
and (6) the CVRs have an original term to maturity of at least one year.







Because CVRs are linked to another security, the Exchange has proposed safeguards that are designed to meet the investor
protection concerns raised by the trading of CVRs.
 First, pursuant to CBOE Rule 30.50(c), the Exchange will impose a duty of due diligence on its members and member firms
to learn the essential facts relating to every customer prior to trading CVRs. Second, consistent with CBOE Rule 30.50(c),
the Exchange will further require that a member or member firm specifically approve a customer's account for trading
CVRs prior to, or promptly after, the completion of the transaction. Third, prior to the commencement of trading of
CVRs, the Exchange will distribute a circular to the membership providing guidance regarding member firm compliance
responsibilities (including suitability recommendations and account approval) when handling transactions in
CVRs.





B. Equity-Linked Term Notes



The Exchange is also proposing to add Rule 31.5.I to its rules to establish specific listing criteria for ELNs.
 ELNs are intermediate-term, hybrid instruments whose value will be linked to the performance of a highly-capitalized,
actively traded common stock, non-convertible preferred stock, or sponsored American Depositary Receipt (``ADR'').

<DOCNO> FR941006-2-00109 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941006-2-00083 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

An issuer of ELNs may provide for periodic interest payments to holders, whether based on a fixed or floating rate.
 Furthermore, a particular issuance of ELNs may also be subject to a ``cap'' on the maximum principal amount to be repaid
to holders upon maturity of the ELNs, and, additionally, may feature a ``floor'' on the minimum principal amount to
be repaid to holders upon maturity of the ELNs. The Exchange believes that the listing flexibility available to an
issuer of ELNs will permit the creation of securities which will offer investors the opportunity to more precisely
focus on a specific investment strategy.





ELNs will conform to the listing guidelines under CBOE Rule 31.5.F, which provide that: (1) Issuers must satisfy certain
asset/equity requirements;
 and (2) issues must have (a) a minimum public distribution of one million trading units; (b) a minimum of 400 unit holders;
and (c) an aggregate market value of at least $4 million.
 Several additional criteria will also apply to the listing of ELNs. First, the issuer must have a minimum tangible
net worth of $150 million. Second, the original issue price of a series of ELNs, when combined with all of the issuer's
other ELNs listed on a national securities exchange or otherwise publicly traded in the United States, may not be greater
than 25% of the issuer's net worth at the time of issuance. Third, ELNs will have an original term to maturity of not less
than two years and not more than seven years, except ELNs linked to a security issued by a non-U.S. company
 (including a sponsored ADR) must have an original term to maturity of not more than three years. Additionally, ELNs
will be treated as equity instruments for, among other purposes, margin requirements.









Although the Exchange does not believe that ELNs will have any discernible impact on the trading market for the underlying
linked stock, it nevertheless proposes that each equity security (including sponsored ADRs) on which the value of
the ELN is based must either have: (1) A market capitalization of at least $3 billion and U.S. trading volume of at least
2.5 million shares during the one-year period preceding the listing of the ELN, (2) a market capitalization of at least
$1.5 billion and U.S. trading volume of at least 20 million shares during the one-year period preceding the listing
of the ELN, or (3) a market capitalization of at least $500 million and U.S. trading volume of at least 80 million shares
during the one-year period preceding the listing of the ELN. Moreover, the proposed rule change would provide the
Exchange with flexibility, subject to the concurrence of the staff of the Commission, to list an ELN linked to a security
that does not meet the specific market capitalization and volume criteria.
 In addition to the market capitalization and trading volume requirements, the underlying security to which an ELN
is linked must be: (1) Issued by a company which is subject to reporting requirements under the Act; (2) listed on a national
securities exchange or traded through Nasdaq; and (3) subject to last sale reporting pursuant to Rule 11As3-1
of the Act.
 Finally, without the concurrence of the staff of the Commission, an issue of ELNs linked to a security issued by a U.S.
company may not be linked to more than 5% of the total outstanding shares of that security.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941006-2-00110 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941006-2-00083 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

With regard to ELNs linked to securities issued by non-U.S. companies (including sponsored ADRs) subject to reporting
requirements under the Act, the following additional requirements apply: (1) The term of such ELNs shall be limited
to between two and three years; (2) either (i) the Exchange must have in place a comprehensive market information sharing
agreement
 with the primary exchange on which the underlying security is primarily traded (in the case of ADRs, with the primary
exchange where the security underlying the ADR is primarily traded), or (ii) at least 50% of the market for the underlying
security and all related securities
 for the six months prior to issuance must occur in the U.S. market (as defined below);
 (3) if linked to an ADR, the ADR must be sponsored;
 (4) there must be a minimum of 2,000 holders of the linked security; (5) the ELNs issuance may not exceed (i) 2% of the
total shares of the underlying security outstanding provided at least 30% of the worldwide trading volume for the
security and all related securities for the six months prior to listing occurred in the U.S. market, (ii) 3% of the total
shares of the underlying security outstanding provided at least 50% of the worldwide trading volume for the security
and all related securities for the six months prior to listing occurred in the U.S. market, or (iii) 5% of the total shares
of the underlying security outstanding provided at least 70% of the worldwide trading volume for the security and
all related securities for the six months prior to listing occurred in the U.S. market; and (6) no ELN may be listed if
the U.S. market for the underlying security and all related securities accounted for less than 30% of the worldwide
trading volume for the security and related securities during the prior six months, regardless of whether the relevant
comprehensive market information sharing agreement is in place.
 With the concurrence of the staff of the Commission, the Exchange may determine to list an ELN linked to a security (including
a sponsored ADR) issued by a non-U.S. company subject to reporting requirements under the Act that exceeds the above
percentages.










The proposal defines the U.S. market
 as the U.S. self-regulatory organizations that are members of the Intermarket Surveillance Group (``ISG'')
 and whose markets are linked together by the Intermarket Trading System (``ITS'').

As with CVRs, because ELNs are linked to another security, the Exchange has proposed safeguards that are designed
to meet the investor protection concerns raised by the trading of ELNs.
 First, pursuant to CBOE Rule 30.50(c), the Exchange will impose a duty of due diligence on its members and member firms
to learn the essential facts relating to every customer prior to trading ELNs. Second, consistent with CBOE Rule 30.50(c),
the Exchange will further require that a member or member firm specifically approve a customer's account for trading
ELNs prior to, or promptly after, the completion of the transaction. Third, prior to the commencement of trading of
ELNs, the Exchange will evaluate the nature and complexity of the issue and, if appropriate, distribute a circular
to the membership providing guidance regarding member firm compliance responsibilities (including suitability
recommendations and account approval) when handling transactions in ELNs.






C. Paired Securities


The Exchange is also proposing to add Rule 31.5.J to its rules to set forth specific listing criteria for ``paired securities.''
Under proposed Rule 31.5.J, the term ``paired securities'' would be defined as securities which may be transferred
and traded only in combination with one another as a single economic unit and for which the securities are printed back-to-back
on the same certificate.
 Under the proposed rule, the issuers of the paired securities would be required to satisfy, on an aggregate basis,
the size and earnings criteria set forth in Exchange Rule 31.5.A.
 In the event the pairing agreement between the issuers of the paired securities is terminated, the issuer which initially
met the original listing criteria need only satisfy the Exchange's continued listing guidelines in order to remain
listed on the Exchange. The other security, however, which at the time of listing did not qualify for listing under
CBOE Rule 31.5.A must, at the time of termination, meet both the net worth, earnings, and distribution requirements
of Rule 31.5.A in order to remain listed on the Exchange.
 The Exchange has represented that it will only list an issue of paired securities as a competitive response to the listing
of an issue of paired securities by another securities exchange and where the securities are being paired for purposes
other than for bypassing the Exchange's equity listing standards.








III. Commission Findings and Conclusions


For the reasons discussed below, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements
of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular,
the requirements of section 6(b)(5).

A. Contingent Value Rights


The Commission believes that the CBOE's proposal to establish listing criteria for CVRs addresses the special concerns
raised by these investment products. As with the equity-linked debt securities approved for listing by the NYSE and
the Amex,
 CVRs are not leveraged instruments. Their price, however, will still be derived and based upon the related security.
The Commission believes, however, that the CBOE proposal adequately minimizes the Commission's regulatory concerns
that arise because the final rate of return of a CVR is derivatively priced, based on the performance of the related
security. The proposed quantitative listing standards should ensure that only substantial companies capable of
meeting their financial obligations issue CVRs. This is important in light of the contingent financial obligations
created by these instruments, and should serve to protect investors and the public interest by ensuring that the companies
listing CVRs on the Exchange have sufficient financial means to meet their settlement obligations. Additionally,
the proposed suitability, disclosure, and compliance requirements noted above, adequately address the potential
public customer concerns that could arise from the hybrid nature of CVRs. In this regard, before any listing occurs,
the CBOE would be required to distribute a circular to the membership providing guidance regarding member firm compliance
responsibilities (including suitability recommendations and account approval) when handling transactions in
CVRs.




Finally, the Commission notes that the criteria proposed by the Exchange for the listing of CVRs are virtually the
same as those previously approved by the Commission for the listing and trading of CVRs by the NYSE and the Amex.





B. Equity-Linked Term Notes 


The Commission believes that the availability of ELNs will permit investors to more closely approximate their desired
investment objectives through, for example, shifting some of the opportunity for upside gain in return for additional
income. Accordingly, for these reasons, as well as the reasons stated in the Equity-Linked Note Approval Orders,
 the Commission finds that the CBOE's proposed standards for the listing and trading of ELNs are consistent with the
Act and that the listing and trading of ELNs is in the public interest.

<TEXT>
 

As with the CVRs discussed above, ELNs are not leveraged instruments, however, their price will still be derived and
based upon the underlying linked security. Accordingly, the level of risk involved in the purchase or sale of an ELNs
is similar to the risk involved in the purchase or sale of traditional common stock. Nonetheless, in considering the
proposals by the Amex and the NYSE to list and trade equity-linked notes, the Commission had several specific concerns
with this type of product because the final rate of return of an ELN is derivatively priced, based on the performance
of the underlying security. These concerns included: (1) Investor protection concerns; (2) dependence on the credit
of the issuer of the instrument; (3) systemic concerns regarding position exposure of issuers with partially hedged
positions or dynamically hedged positions; and (4) the impact on the market for the underlying linked security.
 The Commission concluded, however, that the proposals adequately addressed each of these issues such that the Commission's
regulatory concerns were adequately minimized.
 Similarly, in this proposal, the CBOE has proposed safeguards, as described above, which the Commission finds to
be equivalent to those approved for the trading of ELNs by the Amex and the NYSE. In particular, by imposing the listing
standards, suitability, disclosure, and compliance requirements noted above, the CBOE has adequately addressed
the potential public customer concerns that could arise from the hybrid nature of ELNs.






Except in two respects, the Commission finds that Amendment No. 1 confirms the proposal to rule changes already approved
by the Commission for the listing and trading of ELNs by the Amex and the NYSE.
 The two new items included in this proposal are: (1) An additional market capitalization and trading volume requirement
that allows the listing of ELNs linked to an underlying security with a minimum market capitalization of $500 million
and a trading volume in the year prior to listing of at least 80 million shares; and (2) allowing flexibility for the
CBOE, with the concurrence of the staff of the Commission, to determine on a case-by-case basis to list ELNs that either
do not satisfy the market capitalization and trading volume requirements discussed above, and/or that exceed the
percentage limits regarding the outstanding shares of the linked security. The Commission believes that neither
of these proposals raises any significant regulatory issues that were not addressed in the Equity-Linked Note Approval
Orders.
 The Commission finds that the proposal to add the third tier of eligible linked securities will expand the number of
securities that can be linked to these equity-linked products while maintaining the requirement that the linked
security be an actively traded common stock issued by a highly capitalized issuer. While the proposal introduces
a third alternative for ELN eligibility that reduces the minimum market capitalization requirement of the linked
security, the stock of such an issuer could only be linked to an issue of ELNs if its trading volume for the prior one-year
period is at least 80 million shares, which is four times higher than the current minimum trading volume for these products
as currently allowed on the Amex and the NYSE. Moreover, in recently approving proposals by the NYSE and the Amex to
list and trade ELNs linked to securities (including sponsored ADRs) issued by non-U.S. companies subject to reporting
requirements under the Act, the NYSE and the Amex represented to the Commission that no problems had been reported
to either exchange regarding the listing and trading of these products.
 The Commission believes that together, the new capitalization and trading volume requirements will continue to
ensure that ELNs are only issued on highly liquid securities of broadly capitalized companies and that these requirements
will reduce the likelihood of any adverse market impact on the securities underlying ELNs.







Additionally, allowing the CBOE, with the concurrence of the staff of the Commission, to approve, on a case-by-case
basis, an issue of ELNs that does not satisfy one of the existing requirements regarding market capitalization and
trading volume,
 or that exceeds the maximum allowable percentage of shares of the underlying security,
 merely adds flexibility to the proposed rule change. The Commission believes that this portion of the proposal does
not raise any regulatory concerns, particularly given the requirement of obtaining the concurrence of the staff
of the Commission prior to listing.

C. Paired Securities


The Commission believes that the CBOE's proposed listing standards for paired securities do not raise any substantial
regulatory concerns. First, the proposed rule is identical to a rule previously adopted by the Amex.
 Second, the Exchange will only list an issue of paired securities in response to competitive pressures resulting
from the listing of an issue of paired securities by another securities exchange and where the securities to be listed
by the CBOE are being paired for purposes other than for bypassing the Exchange's equity listing standards.
 These standards should serve to protect investors by preventing an issuer from listing a security on the CBOE that
does not satisfy the Exchange's listing criteria, terminating the pairing agreement, and then trading the securities
as separate securities. The certificate requirement serves to further protect investors and minimize confusion
by ensuring that investors are on notice when they receive such a certificate that the security is a paired security
and cannot be traded separately from the security to which it is paired. Moreover, requiring that in the event of the
termination of the pairing agreement that the security that did not originally meet the CBOE's listing criteria must
satisfy those criteria at the time of the termination or else be delisted, minimizes the potential that the paired
security vehicle will be used as a means of listing a security that otherwise could not be listed on the Exchange.








The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 to the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth
day after the date of publication of notice thereof in the 

Federal Register

 in order to allow the CBOE to begin listing hybrid securities satisfying the listing standards discussed above without
delay. With respect to CVRs, the Commission finds that Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 more closely conforms the Exchange's
proposal to proposals previously approved by the Commission with respect to the listing and trading of CVRs by the
Amex and the NYSE. For that reason and for the reasons stated above, the Commission believes that the proposal to list
and trade CVRs does not raise any significant regulatory issues that were not addressed when the NYSE and the Amex proposals
were approved.

With regard to ELNs, as discussed above, except for two aspects the proposal merely provides the CBOE with the ability
to list equity-linked debt securities on the same basis as the NYSE and the Amex. Moreover, the Commission notes that
the proposals by the NYSE and the Amex to list and trade equity-linked debt securities were published by the Commission
for the full comment period without any comments being received by the Commission. With respect to the two aspects
of the ELN proposal which expand on the standards previously approved for the NYSE and the Amex, for the reasons discussed
above, the Commission believes that no significant regulatory issues are raised that were not adequately addressed
in the Equity-Linked Note Approval Orders.






Finally, Amendment No. 1 to the proposal also lowers the minimum size for an issue of securities listed pursuant to
CBOE Rule 31.5.F from $20 million to $4 million. The Commission notes that this amendment merely conforms the CBOE's
rules to those of the NYSE which provide that an issue of a hybrid security must have a minimum market value at issuance
of at least $4 million.






Accordingly, the Commission believes it is consistent with sections 6(b)(5)
 and 19(b)(2)
 of the Act to approve Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 to the proposal on an accelerated basis.






Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 to the
proposed rule change. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities
and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments,
all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written
communications relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that
may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection
and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC. Copies of such filing
will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of the NYSE. All submissions should refer
to File No. SR-CBOE-94-04 and should be submitted by October 27, 1994.

It is Therefore Ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-CBOE-94-04), as amended, is approved.






For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of a Proposed Rule Change and Amendment
Nos. 1 and 2 to the Proposed Rule Change by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., Relating to Listing
Standards for Selected Equity-Linked Debt Securities (``SEEDS'').</DOCTITLE>



September 30, 1994.



Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on August 31, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below,
which Items have been prepared by the NASD. The NASD filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change on September 2,
1994, and Amendment No. 2 on September 9, 1994.
 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change, as amended, from interested
persons.





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The NASD is proposing amendments to Schedule D of the NASD By-Laws to provide listing standards for the designation
of Selected Equity-Linked Debt Securities (``SEEDS'')
 as Nasdaq National Market securities. The NASD also proposes to amend the Policy of the NASD Board of Governors issued
under Article III, section 2, of the NASD Rules of Fair Practice to highlight members' obligations to deal fairly with
their customers when making recommendations or accepting orders concerning SEEDS. The text of the proposed rule
change is available at the Office of the Secretary, NASD, and at the Commission.





II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



Under section 2(e) of Part III of Schedule D to the NASD By-Laws, the NASD may designate as Nasdaq National Market securities
financial instruments which can not be readily categorized under traditional listing guidelines for, among other
instruments, common and preferred stock, bonds, debentures, and warrants.
 The NASD is now proposing to amend Section 2 of Part III of Schedule D to the NASD By-Laws to provide listing standards
for SEEDS, a specific type of hybrid security. As with the more general hybrid product listing standards, all SEEDS
will be designated as Nasdaq National Market securities.
 In addition, SEEDS will be treated as equity instruments for, among other purposes, margin requirements.

SEEDS are intermediate-term, hybrid securities, the value of which is based, at least in part, on the value of another
issuer's common stock, non-convertible preferred stock, or certain sponsored American Depositary Receipts (``ADRs'').
SEEDS may pay periodic interest or may be issued as zero-coupon instruments with no payments to holders prior to maturity.
SEEDS may be subject to a ``cap'' on the maximum principal amount to be repaid to holders upon maturity, and they may
feature a ``floor'' on the minimum principal amount paid to holders upon maturity. A specific issue of SEEDS, for example,
may provide holders with a fixed semi-annual interest payment, while capping the maximum amount to be repaid upon
maturity at 135% of the issuance price, with no minimum floor guarantee on the principal to be repaid at maturity. Another
issue of SEEDS might offer lower semi-annual payments based upon a floating interest rate
 with a minimum floor for the repayment of principal of 75% of the issuance price. According to the NASD the flexibility
available to an issuer of SEEDS permits the creation of securities which offer issuers and investors the opportunity
to more precisely focus on a specific investment strategy.





The NASD generally believes that the level of risk involved in the purchase or sale of a SEEDS is similar to the risk involved
in the purchase or sale of traditional common stock. Nevertheless, the unique nature and characteristics of SEEDS
raises several concerns: (1) Investor protection concerns; (2) dependence on the creditworthiness of the issuer
of a SEEDS to meet its obligations under the instruments; (3) systemic concerns regarding the position exposure of
issues with partially hedged or dynamically hedged positions; and (4) the impact on the market for the underlying
linked security. The NASD believes its proposal adequately addresses these concerns.

Specifically, there are four components to the NASD's proposed listing standards for SEEDS: (1) Standards applicable
to issuers of SEEDS; (2) standards applicable to the SEEDS offerings themselves; (3) standards applicable to the
underlying linked security; and (4) limitations on the size of a particular SEEDS offering.



Issuer Listing Standards



The proposal provides that an issuer of a SEEDS must be a entity that is listed on Nasdaq or the NYSE, or an affiliate of
a company listed on Nasdaq or the NYSE.
 Each issuer of a SEEDS must also have a minimum net worth of $150 million. In addition, the market value of a SEEDS offering,
when combined with the market value of all other SEEDS offerings previously completed by the issuer and traded through
Nasdaq or on a national securities exchange, may not be greater that 25% of the issuer's net worth at the time of issuance.





Standard Applicable to SEEDS Offerings



In order to ensure adequate liquidity in the markets for SEEDS each issuance of a SEEDS must have: (1) A minimum public
distribution of one million SEEDS; (2) a minimum of 400 holders of the SEEDS; (3) a minimum market value of $4 million;
and (4) a term of two to seven years (although a SEEDS on a sponsored ADR can not have a term longer than three years).



Standards Applicable to the Underlying Linked Security



In order to help ensure that SEEDS will not have a disruptive effect on the markets for the securities underlying the
SEEDS, the NASD proposes that the securities underlying SEEDS must have sufficiently large market capitalizations
and high trading volumes. Specifically, a security underlying a SEEDS must have: (1) A market capitalization of at
least $3 billion and a trading volume in the United States of at least 2.5 million shares in the one-year period preceding
the listing of the SEEDS; or (2) a market capitalization of at least $1.5 billion and a trading volume in the United States
of at least 20 million shares in the one-year period preceding the listing of the SEEDS; or (3) a market capitalization
of at least $500 million and a trading volume in the United States of at least 80 million shares in the one-year period
preceding the listing of the SEEDS. In addition, if an issuer proposes to issue SEEDS on a security that does not meet
the market capitalization and trading volume standards set forth above, the NASD, with the concurrence of the staff
of the Commission, may evaluate the trading volume, public float, and market capitalization of that security, as
well as other relevant factors, and determine on a case-by-case basis that it is appropriate to list SEEDS overlying
that security.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941006-2-00118 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941006-2-00084 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The NASD believes that the $500 million market capitalization/80 million share trading volume standard and the flexibility,
with the concurrence of the Commission, to list issues of SEEDS that do not satisfy the market capitalization and trading
volume requirements, are the only significant modifications to the SEEDS listing standards from those currently
in place for the listing of ELDS at the NYSE and for the listing of ELNs at the Amex.
 The additional tier for trading volume and market capitalization is warranted, the NASD believes, because trading
volume is a better barometer for market liquidity than market capitalization. Accordingly, the NASD believes imposing
a higher trading volume standard and a lower market capitalization standard will not jeopardize the integrity of
the market for the linked security. Moreover, the NASD notes that the minimum market capitalization requirement
will still be $500 million, assuring that the linked security is issued by a sufficiently large company capable of
underlying SEEDS without any disruption to the market for its common stock. The NASD also believes that the flexibility
to list issues of SEEDS not satisfying the objective criteria is appropriate for those cases where the NASD, with the
concurrence of the staff of the Commission, determines, based on factors including, among others, public float and
affiliations between the issuer of the SEEDS and the issuer of the linked security, in addition to market capitalization
and trading volume, that the listing of the SEEDS does not raise any material market manipulation or investor protection
concerns.





In addition to the market capitalization and trading volume requirements, the issuer of the linked security must
be a reporting company under the Act. The underlying linked security also must be traded through Nasdaq or on a national
securities exchange and be subject to last sale reporting pursuant to Rule 11Aa3-1 under the Act. In addition,
consistent with the Amex and NYSE proposals recently approved by the Commission,
 the NASD proposes to permit SEEDS on certain non-U.S. companies
 subject to reporting requirements under the Act whose securities are traded in the United States either as ordinary
shares or sponsored ADRs, provided there are at least 2,000 holders of the underlying linked security.








Limitations of the Size of Particular SEEDS Offerings



Without the approval of the Commission, the issuance of SEEDS relating to any underlying U.S. security may not exceed
five percent of the total outstanding shares of such underlying security. Without the approval of the Commission,
the issuance of SEEDS relating to any security (including sponsored ADRs) that is traded in the United States and is
issued by a non-U.S. company subject to U.S. reporting requirements may not exceed: (A) Two percent of the total shares
outstanding worldwide if at least 30 percent of the worldwide trading volume in the underlying security occurs in
the U.S. market during the six-month period preceding the date of designation; (B) three percent of the total shares
outstanding worldwide if at least 50 percent of the worldwide trading volume in the underlying security occurs in
the U.S. market during the six-month period preceding the date of designation; or (C) five percent of the total shares
outstanding worldwide if at least 70 percent of the worldwide trading volume in the underlying security occurs in
the U.S. market during the six-month period preceding the date of designation.
 If an issuer proposes to issue SEEDS that relate to more than the allowable percentages of the underlying security
specified above, however, then the NASD, with the concurrence of the staff of the Commission, will evaluate, on a case-by-case
basis, the maximum percentage of SEEDS that may be issued.

<TEXT>
 

Finally, because SEEDS are linked to price movements in another security, the NASD proposes three safeguards that
are designed to satisfy the investor protection concerns raised by the trading of SEEDS. First, for each SEEDS, the
NASD will distribute a circular to the membership providing guidance concerning member firm compliance responsibilities
(including suitability recommendations and account approval) when handling transactions in SEEDS. Second, the
NASD reiterates that, pursuant to the NASD's customer suitability rule found at Section 2, Article III of the NASD
Rules of Fair Practice, members will have a duty of due diligence to learn the essential facts relating to every customer
trading SEEDS prior to their first SEEDS transaction. In addition, consistent with Section 2, Article III, of the
NASD Rules of Fair Practice, the NASD will require that a member specifically approve a customers's account for trading
SEEDS prior to, or promptly after, the completion of its first SEEDS transaction. In this connection the NASD has also
proposed to amend the Policy of the NASD Board of Governors issued under Article III, section 2 of the NASD Rules of Fair
Practice to highlight members' obligations to deal fairly with their customers when making recommendations or accepting
orders concerning SEEDS.

Therefore, the NASD believes the proposed rule change is consistent with section 15A(b)(6) of the Act. Section 15A(b)(6)
requires that the rules of a national securities association be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative
acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with
persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions
in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system
and in general to protect investors and the public interest. Specifically, the NASD believes the proposal strikes
an appropriate balance between the NASD's need to adapt and respond to innovations in the securities markets and the
NASD's concomitant need to ensure the protection of investors and the maintenance of fair and orderly markets. The
NASD believes the proposed numerical, quantitative listing standards should ensure that only substantial companies
capable of meeting their contingent obligations created by SEEDS are able to list such products on Nasdaq. Similarly,
by providing for the distribution of circulars to the membership concerning member firm compliance responsibilities
and requirements, the NASD believes the proposal addresses any potential sales practice concerns that may arise
in connection with SEEDS. The NASD also believes that the trading of SEEDS will provide investors with important investment
and hedging benefits that will serve to satisfy better their investment and portfolio management needs. Moreover,
the NASD believes that SEEDS represent innovative financing techniques that provide issuers with increased flexibility
to raise capital at potentially lower costs, in return for assuming some market volatility risk. Finally, the NASD
believes that listing SEEDS on Nasdaq will also facilitate members and investors desiring to trade SEEDS in a dealer
environment.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The NASD does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others



No written comments were either solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



The NASD has requested that the proposed rule changes be given accelerated effectiveness pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)
of the Act.

The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of section
15A(b)(6) of the Act.
 Specifically, the Commission believes that providing for the listing and trading of SEEDS will offer a new and innovative
means of participating in the securities markets. In particular, the Commission believes that the availability
of SEEDS will permit investors to more closely approximate their desired investment objectives through, for example,
shifting some of the opportunity for upside gain in return for additional income.
 Accordingly, for these reasons, as well as the reasons stated in the Commission's Equity-Linked Note Approval Orders,
 the Commission finds that the NASD standards for the listing and trading of SEEDS are consistent with the Act and that
the listing and trading of SEEDS is in the public interest.







As with ELNs and ELDS, SEEDS are not leveraged instruments. Their price, however, will still be derived and based upon
the underlying linked security. Accordingly, the level of risk involved in the purchase or sale of a SEEDS is similar
to the risk involved in the purchase or sale of traditional common stock. Nonetheless, in considering the Amex's and
the NYSE's respective proposals to list and trade ELNs and ELDS, the Commission had several specific concerns with
this type of product because the final rate of return of an ELN is derivatively priced, based on the performance of the
underlying security. The concerns included: (1) Investor protection concerns, (2) dependence on the credit of the
issuer of the instrument, (3) systemic concerns regarding position exposure of issuers with partially hedged positions
or dynamically hedged positions, and (4) the impact on the market for the underlying linked security.
 The Commission concluded, however, that the Amex and the NYSE proposals adequately addressed each of these issues
such that the Commission's regulatory concerns were adequately minimized.
 Similarly, in this proposal, the NASD has proposed safeguards, as described above, which the Commission finds to
be equivalent to those approved for the trading of ELNs and ELDS. In particular, by imposing the listing standards,
suitability, disclosure, and compliance requirements noted above, the NASD has adequately addressed the potential
public customer concerns that could arise from the hybrid nature of SEEDS. Further, the Commission believes that
the listing standards and issuance restrictions should help to reduce the likelihood of any adverse market impact
on the securities underlying SEEDS.






Except in two respects, the Commission finds that the proposal and Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 to the proposal are substantially
identical to rule changes already approved by the Commission with respect to the listing and trading of ELNs on the
Amex and ELDS on the NYSE.
 The two new items included in this proposal are: (1) The new requirement that allows the listing of SEEDS linked to an
underlying security with a minimum market capitalization of $500 million and a trading volume in the year prior to
listing of at least 80 million shares; and (2) allowing flexibility for the NASD, with the concurrence of the staff
of the Commission, to determine on a case-by-case basis to list SEEDS that do not satisfy one of the three objective
listing tiers with respect to market capitalization and trading volume. The Commission believes that neither of
these proposals raises any significant regulatory issues that were not addressed in the Equity-Linked Note Approval
Orders. The Commission finds that the proposal to add an additional market capitalization and trading volume requirement
for eligible linked securities will expand the number of securities that can be linked to these equity-linked products
while maintaining the requirement that the linked security be an actively traded common stock issued by a highly capitalized
issuer. While the proposal introduces a third alternative for ELN eligibility that reduces the minimum market capitalization
requirement for the linked security, the stock of such an issuer (or sponsored ADR related thereto) could only be linked
to a SEEDS issue if its trading volume for the prior one-year period is at least 80 million shares, which is four times
higher than the current minimum trading volume for these products as currently allowed on the Amex and the NYSE. Moreover,
in recently approving proposals by the NYSE and the Amex to list and trade ELDS and ELNs, respectively, linked to securities
(including sponsored ADRs) issued by non-U.S. companies subject to reporting requirements under the Act, the NYSE
and the Amex represented to the Commission that no problems had been reported to either exchange regarding the listing
and trading of these products.
 Furthermore, the Commission believes that together, the new capitalization and trading volume requirements will
continue to ensure that SEEDS are only issued on highly liquid securities of broadly capitalized companies and that
these requirements should help to reduce the likelihood of any adverse market impact on the securities underlying
SEEDS.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941006-2-00121 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941006-2-00084 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Additionally, allowing the NASD, with the concurrence of the staff of the Commission, to approve, on a case-by-case
basis, an issue of SEEDS that does not satisfy one of the existing requirements regarding market capitalization and
trading volume,
 or that exceeds the maximum allowable percentage of shares of the underlying security,
 merely adds flexibility to the proposed rule change. The Commission believes that this portion of the proposal does
not raise any regulatory concerns, particularly given the requirement of obtaining the concurrence of the staff
of the Commission prior to listing.









Finally, the NASD represents that a number of issuers, including Nasdaq listed companies, have expressed an interest
in listing SEEDS on Nasdaq. In light of the Commission's approval of the listing of ELNs on the Amex and ELDS on the NYSE,
accelerating approval of this proposal will ensure that the NASD is allowed to compete on an equal basis with the Amex
and NYSE with regard to these equity-linked products.

The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change and Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 to the proposed rule
change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice thereof in the 

Federal Register

 in order to allow the NASD to begin listing SEEDS without delay. As discussed above, except for two aspects the proposal
merely provides the NASD with the ability to list equity-linked debt securities on the same basis as the NYSE and the
Amex. Moreover, the Commission notes that the proposals by the NYSE and the Amex to list and trade equity-linked debt
securities were published by the Commission for the full comment period without any comments being received by the
Commission. With respect to the two aspects of the SEEDS proposal which expand on the standards previously approved
for the NYSE and the Amex, for the reasons discussed above, the Commission believes that no significant regulatory
issues are raised that were not adequately address in the Equity-Linked Note Approval Orders.







Finally, Amendment No. 1 to the proposal also eliminates the minimum holder requirement for securities which are
listed pursuant to Article III, Section 2 of the NASD Rules of Fair Practice but which trade in thousand dollar denominations.
The Commission notes that this amendment merely conforms the NASD's rules to those of the NYSE which do not contain
a minimum holder requirement for hybrid debt securities.
 Accordingly, the Commission believes that this amendment does not raise any significant regulatory issues.





For the above reasons, the Commission believes it is consistent with section 15A(b)(6)
 and 19(b)(2)
 of the Act to approve the proposed rule change and Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 to the proposal on an accelerated basis.







IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC. 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of the NASD. All submissions should refer to File Number SR-NASD-94-49
and should be submitted by October 27, 1994. 

It is therefore ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (SR-NASD-94-49), as amended, is approved.







For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change by the National
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., Relating to an Interim Extension of the OTC Bulletin Board

 

 Service Through December 31, 1994</DOCTITLE>


September 30, 1994.


Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on September 23, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'') filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III
below, which Items have been prepared by the NASD. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on
the proposed rule change from interested persons and is simultaneously approving the proposal.


I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


On June 1, 1990, the NASD, through a subsidiary corporation, initiated operation of the OTC Bulletin Board Service
(``OTCBB Service'' or ``Service'') in accord with the Commission's approval of File No. SR-NASD-88-19,
as amended.
 The OTCBB Service provides a real-time quotation medium that NASD member firms can elect to use to enter, update, and
retrieve quotation information (including unpriced indications of interest) for securities traded over-the-counter
that are neither listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market

SM

 nor on a primary national securities exchange (collectively referred to as ``OTC Equities'').
 Essentially, the Service supports NASD members' market making in OTC Equities through authorized Nasdaq Workstation
units. Real-time access to quotation information captured in the Service is available to subscribers of Level 2/3
Nasdaq service as well as subscribers of vendor-sponsored services that now carry OTCBB Service data. The Service
is currently operating under interim approval that expires on October 3, 1994.







The NASD hereby files this proposed rule change, pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Act and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
to obtain authorization for an interim extension of the Service through December 31, 1994. During this interval,
there will be no material change in the OTCBB Service's operational features, absent Commission approval of a corresponding
Rule 19b-4 filing.


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filings with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.


A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


1. Purpose


The purpose of this filing is to ensure continuity in the operation of the OTCBB Service while the Commission considers
an earlier NASD rule filing (File No. SR-NASD-92-7) that requested permanent approval of the Service.
For the month ending August 31, 1994, the Service reflected the market making positions of 402 NASD member firms displaying
quotations/indications of interest in approximately 5,107 OTC Equities.
During the proposed extension, foreign securities and American Depositary Receipts (collectively, ``foreign/ADR
issues'') will remain subject to the twice-daily, update limitation that traces back to the Commission's original
approval of the OTCBB Service's operation. As a result, all priced bids/offers displayed in the Service for foreign/ADR
issues will remain indicative.

<PARENT> FR941006-2-00085 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In conjunction with the start-up of the Service in 1990, the NASD implemented a filing requirement (under section
4 of Schedule H to the NASD By-Laws) and review procedures to verify member firms' compliance with Rule 15c2-11
under the Act. During the proposed extension, this review process will continue to be an important component of the
NASD's oversight of broker-dealers' market making in OTC Equities. The NASD also expects to work closely with the
Commission staff in developing further enhancements to the Service to fulfill the market structure requirements
mandated by the Securities Enforcement Remedies and Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990, particularly section 17B of the
Act.
 The NASD notes that implementation of the Reform Act entails Commission rulemaking in several areas, including the
development of mechanisms for gathering and disseminating reliable quotation/transaction information for ``penny
stocks.''




2. Statutory Basis


The NASD believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with sections 11A(a)(1), 15A(b) (6) and (11), and section
17B of the Act. Section 11A(a)(1) sets forth the Congressional findings and policy goals respecting operational
enhancements to the securities markets. Basically, the Congress found that new data processing and communications
techniques should be applied to improve the efficiency of market operations, broaden the distribution of market
information, and foster competition among market participants. Section 15A(b)(6) requires, among other things,
that the NASD's rules promote just and equitable principles of trade, facilitate securities transactions, and protect
public investors. Subsection (11) thereunder authorizes the NASD to adopt rules governing the form and content of
quotations for securities traded over-the-counter for the purposes of producing fair and informative quotations,
preventing misleading quotations, and promoting orderly procedures for collecting and disseminating quotations.
Finally, Section 17B contains Congressional findings and directives respecting the collection and distribution
of quotation information on low-priced equity securities that are neither Nasdaq nor exchange-listed.
The NASD believes that extension of the Service through December 31, 1994, is fully consistent with the foregoing
provisions of the Act.


B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


The NASD believes that the rule change will not result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.


C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others


Written comments were neither solicited nor received.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action







The NASD requests that the Commission find good cause, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, for approving the proposed
rule change prior to the 30th day after its publication in the 

Federal Register 

to avoid any interruption of the Service. The current authorization for the Service extends through October 3, 1994.
Hence it is imperative that the Commission approve the instant filing on or before that date. Otherwise, the NASD will
be required to suspend operation of the Service pending Commission action on the proposed extension.



The NASD believes that accelerated approval is appropriate to ensure continuity in the Service's operation pending
a determination on permanent status for the Service, as requested in File No. SR-NASD-92-7. Continued
operation of the Service will ensure the availability of an electronic quotation medium to support member firms'
market making in approximately 5,107 OTC Equities and the widespread dissemination of quotation information on
these securities. The Service's operation also expedites price discovery and facilitates the execution of customer
orders at the best available price. From the regulatory standpoint, the NASD's capture of quotation data from participating
market makers supplements the price and volume data reported by member firms pursuant to Part XII of Schedule D to the
NASD By-Laws.





IV. Solicitation of Comments





Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Room. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office
of the NASD. All submissions should refer to the file number in the caption above and should be submitted by [insert
date 21 days from the date of publication].




V. Commission's Findings and Order Granting Accelerated Approval






The Commission finds that approval of the proposed rule change is consistent with the Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder, and, in particular, with the requirements of section 15A(b)(11) of the Act, which provides that the rules
of the NASD relating to quotations must be designed to produce fair and informative quotations, prevent fictitious
or misleading quotations, and promote orderly procedures for collecting, distributing, and publishing quotations.



The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the 30th day after the date of publishing
notice of the filing thereof. Accelerated approval of the NASD's proposal is appropriate to ensure continuity in
the Service's operation as an electronic quotation medium that supports NASD members' market making in these securities
and that facilities price discovery and the execution of customers' orders at the best available price. Additionally,
continued operation of the Service will materially assist the NASD's surveillance of its members trading in OTC Equities
that are eligible and quoted in the Service, and in non-Tape B securities that are listed on regional exchanges and
quoted in the OTCBB by NASD members.



It is therefore ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule change be, and hereby is, approved
for an interim period through December 31, 1994.





For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority, 17 CFR 200.30-3(a)(12).

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; National Securities Clearing Corporation; Notice of Filing and Order Granting
Accelerated Approval on a Temporary Basis of a Proposed Rule Change Limiting the Use of Letters of Credit to Collateralize
Clearing Fund Contributions</DOCTITLE>



September 29, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 notice is hereby given that on September 14, 1994, the National Securities Clearing Corporation (``NSCC'') filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change (File No. SR-NSCC-94-18)
as described below. The Commission is publishing this notice and order to solicit comments from interested persons
and to grant accelerated approval of the proposed rule change through September 30, 1995.





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The proposed rule change increases the minimum cash clearing fund contribution for those members who use letters
of credit as clearing fund collateral and sets a limit on the amount of a member's required clearing fund contribution
that may be collateralized with letters of credit.






II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, NSCC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule
change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined
at the places specified in Item IV below. NSCC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below,
of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



NSCC is seeking approval of a proposed rule change that modified the amount of a member's required clearing fund deposit
that may be collateralized by letters of credit. Specifically, the proposed rule change increases the minimum cash
contribution for any member who uses letters of credit from $50,000 to the greater of $50,000 or 10% of that member's
required clearing fund deposit up to a maximum of $1,000,000. In addition, the rule change provided that only 70% of
a member's required clearing fund deposit may be collateralized with letters of credit. The rule change also adds
headings to the clearing fund formula section for purposes of clarity and includes other nonsubstantive drafting
changes. The effect of the proposed rule change is to increase the liquidity of the clearing fund and to limit NSCC's
exposure to unusual risks resulting from the reliance on letters of credit.

Since obtaining temporary approval of the original filing in 1989, NSCC has filed clearing fund composition reports
with the Commission. NSCC states that between December 31, 1989, and December 31, 1993, as a result of the new requirements,
it has observed the following changes in the composition of the clearing fund:




1. cash deposits have increased by approximately 225%;

2. the value of securities deposited has increased by approximately 205%;
 and





3. letter of credit deposits have declined by approximately 40%.






NSCC states that the proposal is consistent with its requirements under Section 17A of the Act because it enhances
NSCC's ability to safeguard securities and funds in its custody or under its control.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



NSCC does not believe that the proposed rule will have an impact or impose a burden on competition.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others



No new written comments have been solicited or received.
 NSCC will notify the Commission of any written comments it receives.





III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act requires that a clearing agency's rules be designed, among other things, to ensure
the safeguarding of securities and funds in its possession or control or for which it is responsible and to protect
investors and the public interest.
 NSCC's proposal to limit the use of letters of credit to collateralize clearing fund obligations should make NSCC's
clearing fund more liquid. A liquid clearing fund is necessary to ensure the safety and soundness of a clearing agency.
NSCC's proposal is therefore consistent with the requirements under the Act with regard to NSCC's obligation to safeguard
securities and funds and to protect the interests of investors and of the public.





Although letters of credit are a useful means of funding clearing agency guarantee deposits, their unrestricted
use may present risks to clearing agencies. Because letters of credit reflect the issuer's promise to pay funds upon
presentation of stipulated documents by the holder, a clearing agency holding letters of credit will be exposed to
risk should the issuer refuse to honor its promise to pay. Furthermore, because under the Uniform Commercial Code
the issuer may defer honoring a payment request until the close of business on the third banking day following receipt
of the required documents, the clearing agency either may have to await payment or may have to seek alternative short-term
financing. This waiting period could reduce a clearing agency's liquidity and thereby could hinder its ability to
meet its payment obligations on a timely basis.






As indicated above, since the proposal first received temporary approval, NSCC has experienced over a 200% increase
in both cash and securities deposited as clearing fund collateral. Because cash and securities are generally more
liquid than letters of credit, the enhanced level of such deposits helps to ensure the liquidity of the clearing fund
in the event of a major member insolvency, catastrophic loss, or major settlement loss. By reducing the risk associated
with the use of letters of credit, the proposal is consistent with NSCC's responsibilities under the Act to safeguard
securities or funds in its custody or control and to protect investors and the public in general.

NSCC has requested that the Commission find good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth
day after the date of publication of notice of the filing. The Commission finds good cause for so approving because
accelerated approval of the proposal will keep effective NSCC's rules that restrict member's usage of letters of
credit as clearing fund deposits and thereby help reduce the exposure of NSCC's clearing fund to the potential liquidity
risks associated with using letters of credit to collateralize member's clearing fund obligations. Moreover, since
it was first introduced in 1989, NSCC's proposal has been open for public comment and has elicited only one opposing
comment. Thus the Commission does not foresee that approval of the proposal will elicit further opposition.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's Public
Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection
and copying at the principal office of NSCC. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-NSCC-94-18
and should be submitted by October 27, 1994.



V. Conclusion



On the basis of the foregoing, the Commission finds that the proposed rule filing is consistent with the Act and in particular
with Section 17A of the Act.



It Is Therefore Ordered,

 pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-NSCC-94-18) be, and hereby is approved through September
30, 1995.






For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Granting Approval to Proposed Rule Change
Relating to the Fine Schedule for the Rule on Dissemination of Quotations in Local Issues</DOCTITLE>



September 30, 1994.



On May 24, 1994, the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PSE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange
Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change to amend its fine schedule relating to the dissemination of quotations in local issues and to
amend its Minor Rule Plan (``MRP'').








The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34320 (July 6, 1994), 59
FR 35545 (July 12, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal.

Pursuant to Equity Floor Procedure Advice (``EFPA'') 2-B, specialists are required to disseminate a quote
prior to one-half hour after the PSE opening. If a specialist fails to satisfy this requirement, he currently is subject
to a fine of $25 for each violation beginning with the sixth violation.
 The rule change will raise the fine for each violation to $100 beginning with the third violation.





In addition, the rule change will add violations of EFPA 2-B to Exchange Rule 10.13 and the Exchange's MRP.
 PSE Rule 10.13(a) authorizes certain PSE Committees to impose a fine not to exceed $5,000 on any member, member organization,
or person association with a member or member organization for any violation of an Exchange rule that has been deemed
to be minor in nature and approved by the Commission for inclusion in the MRP. Rule 10.13 includes a list of rule violations
that are eligible for the expedited disciplinary procedure under the MRP and that may be the subject of fines, in accordance
with the Recommended Fine Schedule.





The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements
of Section 6(b).
 In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the Section 6(b)(5) requirements that the
rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative
acts, and, in general, to protect investors and the public, and with the Section 6(b)(6) requirement that the rules
of an exchange provide that its members are appropriately disciplined for violations of the exchange's rules and
the Act.





Specifically, the Commission believes that an exchange's ability to effectively enforce compliance by its members
and member organization with Commission and Exchange rules is central to its self-regulatory functions. The inclusion
of a rule in an exchange's minor rule violation plan, therefore, should not be interpreted to mean that it is not an important
rule. On the contrary, the Commission recognizes that the inclusion of minor violations of particular rules under
a minor rule violation plan may make the exchange's disciplinary system more efficient in prosecuting more egregious
and/or repeated violations of these rules, thereby furthering its mandates to protect investors and the public interest.

The Commission believes that adding EFPA 2-B to PSE Rule 10.13 and the Exchange's MRP is consistent with Sections
6(b)(5) and 6(b)(6) in that the purpose of Rule 10.13 is to provide for a response to a rule violation when a meaningful
sanction is needed, but when initiation of a disciplinary proceeding under PSE Rule 10.3
 is not suitable because such a proceeding would be more costly and time-consuming than would be warranted given the
minor nature of the violation. Rule 10.13 provides for an appropriate response to minor violations of certain Exchange
rules, while preserving the due process rights of the party accused through specified, required procedures.





Furthermore, the Commission finds that violations of EFPA 2-B are objective and technical in nature, and are
easily verifiable, thereby lending themselves to the use of expedited proceedings. Noncompliance with the requirement
to disseminate quotations in local issue prior to one-half hour after the opening time for trading on the PSE may be
determined objectively and adjudicated quickly without the complicated factual and interpretive inquiries associated
with more sophisticated Exchange disciplinary proceedings. If the Exchange determines that a violation of one of
these rules is not minor in nature, the Exchange retains the discretion to initiate full disciplinary proceedings
in accordance with PSE Rule 10.3. The Commission expects the PSE to bring full disciplinary proceedings in appropriate
cases (

e.g.

, in cases where the violation is egregious or where there is a history or pattern of repeat violations).

In addition, the Commission finds that the increase in the fine from $25 per violation starting with the sixth violation,
to $100 per violation starting with the third violation should result in appropriate discipline of members, in a manner
that is proportionate to the nature of such violations. The Commission believes that calculating the fines on a rotating
quarterly basis is an equitable approach that accounts for the possibility that a substantial period of time may elapse
between violations.



It Is Therefore Ordered, 

pursuant to Section 19(b)()2
 of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (SR-PSE-94-13) is approved.






For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

Addresses:

 Secretary: SEC, 450 5th Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Applicants: 60 South 6th Street, Minneapolis, MN 55402-4422.



For Further Information Contact:

 Elaine M. Boggs, Staff Attorney (202) 942-0572, or Robert A. Robertson, Branch Chief, at (202) 942-0564
(Division of Investment Management, Office of Investment Company Regulation).



Supplementary Information:

 The following is a summary of the application. The complete application is available for a fee at the SEC's Public Reference
Branch.


Applicants' Representations


1. The Rollover Trust will consist of a series of unit investment trusts (the `Series'') registered under the Act.
The units representing undivided interests in each Series will be registered under the Securities Act of 1933. The
Rollover Trust is sponsored by Insight Investment Management (``Insight''). Applicants also request relief for
subsequent series of the Rollover Trust sponsored by Insight or a sponsor controlled by or under common control with
Insight.
2. Each Series will pursue an investment objective which is consistent with a specified investment philosophy. For
example, the first Series will consist of a portfolio of commons stocks of the ten companies in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average having the highest dividend yield as of the opening day of business on the day prior to the initial date of deposit
for such Series.
Insight intends to maintain a secondary market for the units of each Series, although it is not obligated to do so.
3. Each Series will terminate on a date (the ``Mandatory Termination Date'') which is a specified term (

e.g.,

 one, three or five years) after the Series' initial date of deposit. Commencing on the Mandatory Termination Date,
the common stocks held in the portfolio (``Equity Securities'') will be sold in connection with termination of the
Series. Insight will determine the manner, timing and execution of the sale of the Equity Securities. A specified
number of days prior to the Mandatory Termination Date of the Trust, the trustee will provide notice thereof to all
unit holders.
4. Absent an election discussed below, unit holders will receive a cash distribution evidencing their 

pro rata

 share of the proceeds from the liquidation of the Equity Securities in the Series. Unit holders who own at least a specified
number of units (

e.g.,

 2,500 units), however, may elect to receive a distribution of Equity Securities in connection with the termination
of the Trust.
5. Unit holders may elect alternatively to have all of their units redeemed in kind on a predetermined date prior to
the Mandatory Termination Date, and to have the distributed Equity Securities sold by the trustee, and the proceeds
of such sale reinvested in the units of a new Series (the ``Reinvestment Trust Series'') at a reduced sales charge.
The option of unit holders to make such election is referred to as the ``Rollover Option,'' and unit holders making
such election are referred to as ``Rollover Unit Holders''. The portfolio of the Reinvestment Trust Series will contain
a specified number of common stocks selected by Insight pursuant to the same investment philosophy which was followed
in selecting the common stocks in the terminating Series. The number of common stocks in the Reinvestment Trust Series
and the approximate duration of the Reinvestment Trust Series will be the same as those of the terminating Trust Series.

6. The applicable sales charge upon the initial investment in the Rollover Trust will be 2.95% of the public offering
price, while the reduced sales charge applicable to Rollover Unit Holders will be no more than 2.0% of the public offering
price.



Applicant's Legal Analysis



1. Section 11(a) requires SEC approval of an offer to exchange securities between open-end investment companies
if the exchange occurs on any basis other than the relative net asset values of the securities to be exchanged. Section
11(c) makes section 11(a) applicable to any type of exchange offer of securities of registered unit investment trusts
for the securities of any other investment company, irrespective of the basis of exchange.

2. Applicants represent that Rollover Unit Holders will not be induced or encouraged to participate in the Rollover
Option through an active advertising or sales campaign. Insight recognizes its responsibility to its customers
against generating excessive commissions through churning and claims that the sales charge collected will not be
a significant economic incentive to salesmen to promote inappropriately the Rollover Option. Applicants further
believe that the Rollover Option is appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors
and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act.



Applicant's Conditions



If the requested order is granted, applicants agree to the following conditions:

1. Whenever the Rollover Option is to be terminated or its terms are to be amended materially, any holder of a security
subject to that privilege will be given prominent notice of the impending termination or amendment at least 60 days
prior to the date of termination or the effective date of the amendment, provided that:

a. No such notice need to be given if the only material effect of an amendment is to reduce or eliminate the sales charge
payable at the time of a rollover; and 

b. No notice need to be given if, under extraordinary circumstances, either 

i. There is a suspension of the redemption of units of the Rollover Trust under section 22(e) of the Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder, or

ii. A Reinvestment Trust Series temporarily delays or ceases the sale of its units because it is unable to invest amounts
effectively in accordance with applicable investment objectives, policies and restrictions.

2. The sales charge collected at the time of any rollover shall not exceed 2.0% of the public offering price of the unit
being acquired on each rollover.

3. The prospectus of each Reinvestment Trust Series and any sales literature or advertising that mentions that existence
of the Rollover Option will disclose that the Rollover Option is subject to modification, termination or suspension.

Notice of application for an order under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``Act'').







APPLICANTS: 

Norwest Bank Minnesota, N.A. (``Bank''); Norwest Funds; Forum Financial Services, Inc.; Core Trust (Delaware)
(``Core Trust''); and Schroder Capital Management International, Inc. (``Schroder'').



RELEVANT ACT SECTIONS: 

Section 45(a).



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: 

Applicants request an order under section 45(a) that would declare that public disclosure of information submitted
in support of another application and relating to anticipated annual cost savings is neither necessary nor appropriate
in the public interest or for the protection of investors. In the other application (File No. 812-9218), applicants
request an order that would permit certain series of Norwest Funds to invest portions of their assets in certain series
of Core Trust.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.



Applicant's Representations





1. Norwest Funds is an open-end investment company for which the Bank acts as investment adviser. Five portfolios
of the Norwest Funds, the ``Blended Style Norwest Funds,'' intend to invest specified portions of their assets according
to a variety of different investment strategies or styles.

2. Core Trust is an open-end investment company that includes a portfolio that intends to invest in securities issued
by small companies (``Small Company Portfolio''), a portfolio that intends to invest in securities of foreign issuers
(``International Portfolio''), and a portfolio that will be designed to replicate the performance of the Standard
& Poor's 500 Composite Index (``Index Portfolio''). The Bank is the investment adviser to the Small Company and
S&P 500 Index Portfolios, and Schroder is the investment adviser to the International Portfolio.


3. Applicants have filed another application requesting an order under sections 6(c) and 17(b) of the Act that would
exempt applicants from sections 12(d)(1), 17(a)(1), and 17(a)(2), and under section 17(d) and rule 17d-1 thereunder
permitting certain joint transactions. The order would permit the Blended Style Norwest Funds to invest portions
of their assets in the Small Company, International, and Index Portfolios of Core Trust.

4. In support of the other application, applicants have submitted information relating to the estimated cost savings
that applicants anticipate will be achieved if the Blended Style Norwest Funds invest a portion of their assets in
Core Trust. In particular, applicants anticipate that the proposed arrangement will result in significant savings
to the Blended Style Norwest Funds in custodial fees and fund accounting.

Applicants' Legal Analysis


1. Section 45(a) provides that the information contained in any application filed with the SEC under the Act shall
be made available to the public, unless and except insofar as the SEC finds that public disclosure is neither necessary
nor appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.
2. Applicants request an order under section 45(a) for the exhibits they submitted in support of the other application
relating to international custody charges and other likely cost savings. These exhibits contain confidential business
information that has been supplied to support applicants' contention that granting the relief they requested would
likely result in cost savings, rather than increase expense, for the Blended Style Norwest Funds. It is possible for
an interested investor fully to understand and evaluate this argument without knowing the precise amount of the cost
savings that applicants believe the Blended Style Norwest Fund may realize. Therefore, applicants believe that
public disclosure of the information is not necessary in the public interest or for the protection of investors.
3. On the other hand, such public disclosure could result in harm to the shareholders of the Blended Style Norwest Funds.
Applicants have negotiated, or expect to negotiate, preferential treatment from the service providers to Core Trust
as a result of the larger Core Trust portfolios that will be created by the pooled investment of the Blended Style Norwest
Funds. Disclosure of how the negotiated fees have been computed and the specific amounts that would have been charged
under other circumstances could weaken the applicants' negotiating position towards the service providers and
could cause the service providers to refuse to give the applicants preferential rates. Applicants submit, therefore,
that public disclosure of the information is not appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.
4. The Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C.  552) generally provides that all information provided to or generated
by the government should be made available to the general public, with certain exceptions set forth in the statute.
One of those exceptions is for ``trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and
privileged or confidential.'' Applicants believe that the information that is the subject of this application falls
within the exception described, and it thus is eligible for protection under the Freedom of Information Act.

<DOCTITLE>Small Business Investment Company Computation of Alternative Maximum Annual Cost of Money to Small Business Concerns</DOCTITLE>


13 CFR 107.302 limits maximum annual Cost of Money (as defined in 13 CFR 107.3) that may be imposed upon a Small Concern
in connection with Financing by means of Loans or through the purchase of Debt Securities. The cited regulation incorporates
the term ``Debenture Rate'', which is defined elsewhere in 13 CFR 107.3 in terms that require SBA to publish, from time
to time, the rate charged on ten-year debentures sold by Licensees to the public. 
Accordingly, Licensees are hereby notified that effective the date of publication of this Notice, and until further
notice, the Debenture Rate for computation of maximum cost of money pursuant to 13 CFR 107.302 is 8.20 percent per annum.

13 CFR 107.302 does not supersede or preempt any applicable law imposing an interest ceiling lower than the ceiling
imposed by its own terms. Attention is directed to Section 308(i) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended,
to that law's Federal override of State usury ceilings, and to its forfeiture and penalty provisions.

Notice of Establishment of a VHF Navigation and Communication Frequency Utilization Working Group.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Notice is given for the establishment of a VHF Navigation and Communication Frequency Utilization Working Group
in support of the Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC) on General Aviation Issues. In addition to informing
the public of this activity, this notice provides a point of contact for further information; a brief description
of the working group's task and application procedures for working group membership.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has established an Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC) (56
FR 2190, January 22, 1991; and 58 FR 9230, February 19, 1993). One area that the ARAC deals with is general aviation operations
issues. The issues involve the operation of general aviation aircraft and certification of airmen. The VHF Navigation
and Communication Frequency Utilization Working Group is being formed to formulate and present recommendations
to the ARAC, which will determine whether to forward them to the FAA.


Specifically, the Working Group's task is as follows: The VHF Navigation and Communication Frequency Utilization
Working Group is charged with formulating and presenting recommendations on the implementation options, which
will provide greater immunity from modulation interference while still allowing the United States to comply with
the International Standards, Recommended Practices and Procedures for Air Navigation Services, contained in Annex
10 to the Convention of International Civil Aviation. To maximize opportunity for formulation and discussion of
possible options, the working group should have a balanced membership from the aviation and broadcast industries.
The working group should focus on the issues at hand, including: the economic impact of meeting the International
Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) requirements, alternatives for achieving improved frequency protection,
evolutionary implementation considerations, ICAO work on future VHF air/ground (A/G) communication system, the
evolving U.S. position for the proposed 1995 ICAO divisional meeting on precision approach and landing systems mix,
early implementation of the Global Positioning System and the U.S. Federal Radionavigation Plan.
The VHF Navigation and Communication Frequency Utilization Working Group will be responsible to the ARAC for the
following reports:
A. The Working Group should recommend time line(s) for completion of the task, including the rationale, for consideration
at the meeting of the ARAC to consider general aviation operations issues held following publication of this notice.
B. The Working Group will give a status report on the task at each meeting of the ARAC held to consider general aviation
operations issues.
The VHF Navigation and Communication Frequency Utilization Working Group will be comprised of experts from those
organizations having an interest in the tasks assigned. A Working Group member need not necessarily be a representative
of one of the member organizations of the ARAC. An individual who has expertise in the subject matter and wishes to become
a member of the Working Group should write the person listed under the caption 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT

 expressing that desire, describing his or her interest in the task, and the expertise he or she would bring to the Working
Group. The request will be reviewed with the ARAC Assistant Chair for General Aviation Operations Issues and the Chair
of the VHF Navigation and Communication Frequency Utilization Working Group, and the individual will be advised
whether or not the request can be accommodated.
The Secretary of Transportation has determined that the formation and use of the ARAC are necessary in the public interest
in connection with the performance of duties of the FAA. Meetings of the ARAC to consider general aviation operations
issues will be open to the public except as authorized by section 10(d) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Meetings
of the VHF Navigation and Communication Frequency Utilization Working Group will not be open to the public except
to the extent that individuals with an interest and expertise are selected to participate. No public announcement
of Working Group meetings will be made.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Scoping 


FTA and DART invite interested individuals, organizations, businesses and federal, state and local agencies to
participate in defining the alternatives to be evaluated and identifying any significant social, economic, or environmental
issues related to the alternatives. Comments on the appropriateness of the alternatives and impact issues are encouraged.
Specific suggestions on additional alternatives to be examined and issues to be addressed are welcome and will be
considered in the development of the final study scope. Comments may be made orally at the meetings or in writing not
later than November 2, 1994. 
DART and NCTCOG staff will be present at the scoping meetings to describe the corridor alternatives, answer any questions
and receive comments. Additional public meetings will be scheduled throughout the project to review results and
provide input. Interested persons will be notified of project progress through ongoing community information distributed
to the project mailing list which will include all scoping participants. 
Additional information on the EIS process, alternatives, and impact issues to be addressed by the study is contained
in a ``Scoping Information Document.'' Copies of the document have been sent to affected Federal, State of Texas,
local government agencies, and interested parties currently on record. Others may request the document from DART.

 above. 


II. Description of the Study Area and the Purpose and Need for a Corridor Improvement 


As part of the regional mobility planning effort, and as of June, 1994, DART initiated the process of updating the 1989
Transit System Plan. The Transit System Plan update effort has been coordinated with the North Central Texas Council
of Governments (NCTCOG) Mobility 2010 Plan Update and is DART's strategic plan of services and facilities for meeting
mobility goals. Elements of the plan currently being implemented include efficient delivery of bus service; construction
of the 20-mile LRT Starter System; commuter rail in the Dallas/Ft. Worth RAILTRAN corridor; and, High Occupancy Vehicle
(HOV) lanes. For the Northeast Corridor, DART's Draft System Plan contains recommendations for Intermediate Capacity
Light Rail Transit; HOV lanes on I-635; a Travel Demand Management program; and, enhanced bus service. 
The Corridor includes portions of three cities in the DART service area : Dallas, Garland and Rowlett. The Corridor's
southern boundary is Mockingbird Lane in the vicinity of the LRT station on the North Central line of the Starter System.
The Mockingbird Station and the North Central line are currently under construction. The Corridor generally follows
the MKT Railroad to the north and east. Skillman Road is considered the northwest study corridor boundary; Mockingbird
Lane/Northwest Highway/Garland Road form the southeastern boundary of the study area. 
The Corridor is approximately 15 miles in length from Mockingbird Lane to Rowlett Road in Rowlett. The corridor includes
popular recreation and leisure spots such as White Rock Lake and Park, Ridgewood Park, and Lake Ray Hubbard. A significant
industrial sector is located along I-635/LBJ Freeway where the MKT Railroad right-of-way is crossed by the
AT&SF Railroad. Both railroad lines have active freight service. 
It is not anticipated that there will be significant new roadway construction to meet the increase in travel demand.
The regional mobility plan for the area calls for a combination of modes including roadway improvements and investment
in transit improvements such as light rail, commuter rail, HOV lanes, as well as TSM and TDM improvements. 


III. Alternatives 


Alternatives proposed for consideration include:

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941006-2-00148 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941006-2-00103 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

No-Build_The No-Build Alternative consists of the Mobility Plan for 2010 as adopted by NCTCOG with the exception
of improvements in the Northeast Corridor. 
TSM_The Transportation System Management (TSM) Alternative includes all of the improvements included in the No-Build
Alternative plus a number of low-to-moderate-cost travel efficiency and travel demand management (TDM) strategies.

LRT_Light Rail Transit along the MKT Railroad corridor connecting with the LRT Starter System station at Mockingbird
Lane and continuing to the Central Garland Transit Center in downtown Garland with a possible extension to a station
in downtown Rowlett will be considered. Consideration is also being given to the concept of Intermediate Capacity
Light Rail Transit, which is a staged implementation phase of the ultimate double track LRT alternative. The Intermediate
Capacity LRT option would consist of a single-track LRT alignment along the MKT with passing sidings at key points.

Commuter Rail_This alternative involves the use of the MKT Railroad right-of-way to provide service to the Garland
and Rowlett areas. The commuter rail alternative is generally described in the NCTCOG 2010 Mobility Plan. This alternative
would follow the MKT Railroad right-of-way from the Mockingbird Station to Garland with a possible extension to Rowlett.



IV. Potential Impacts For Analysis 


The subjects and level of detail addressed in the EIS will be consistent with the requirements of the joint FTA/FHWA
environmental regulations (Environmental Procedures for Project Development, 23 CFR 771 and 40 CFR 1500-1508)
and other related regulations. The EIS will evaluate the following: local and regional economic concerns; transportation
service including future corridor capacity; transit cost; transit ridership and effect on traffic movement community
impacts, including land use, displacements, noise, neighborhood compatibility, and aesthetics; cultural resource
impacts including impacts on historic and archaeological resources and parklands; natural resource impacts including
air quality, wetlands, water resources, and wildlife; and transit financial implications. 
The proposed impact assessment and evaluation will take into account both positive and negative impacts, direct
and indirect impacts, short term (construction) and long term impacts, and site specific and corridor wide impacts.
Evaluation criteria will be consistent with all Federal, State of Texas and local criteria, regulations and policies.
Mitigation measures will be identified for any adverse environmental impacts. 
Other potential impact issues may be added as a result of scoping and agency coordination efforts.

Grant Guideline 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 State Justice Institute.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final grant guideline.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This Guideline sets forth the administrative, programmatic, and financial requirements attendant to Fiscal Year
1995 State Justice Institute grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Pursuant to the State Justice Institute Act of 1984, 42 U.S.C. 10701, 

et seq

., as amended, the Institute is authorized to award grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts to State and local
courts, nonprofit organizations, and others for the purpose of improving the administration of justice in the State
courts of the United States. Approximately $111/2 million is available for award in FY 1995. 



Changes in the Final Guideline 



On August 22, 1994, the Institute published its proposed FY 1995 Grant Guideline in the 

Federal Register

 for public comment. 59 FR 43160. Comment was specifically requested on whether SJI should continue to require each
applicant for a judicial education scholarship to submit a concurrence signed by the chief justice of the applicant's
State (see section II.B.2.b.v.). The only comment received on this issue was from a State court administrator who
emphasized the administrative importance of the chief justice's concurrence. The concurrence requirement is,
accordingly, retained in the Final Guideline. The Guideline also has been amended to better assure that sufficient
scholarship funds are available each quarter. 

In addition, the Final Guideline solicits applications from courts and other organizations interested in participating
as downlink (receiving) sites for the National Town Hall Meeting on Improving Public Confidence in the Courts scheduled
for October 1995 (see section II.B.2.a.ii.). The Institute recently awarded a grant to the National Center for State
Courts and the American Judicature Society to convene this videoconference. Interested jurisdictions must submit
an application to the National Center for State Courts addressing the criteria set forth in section II.B.2.a.ii.
no later than February 15, 1995. 

In FY 1994, the Institute required each grantee to submit its final product on a diskette in ASCII. The Final FY 1995
Guideline requires grantees to provide only a one-page abstract summarizing the grant product in ASCII. See section
VII.C.6. 

In response to comments, the audit requirements in the Final Guideline have also been changed to make OMB Circular
A-133 applicable to SJI grantees under the same terms and conditions (including applicability thresholds)
that would apply to Federal grantees. 

In addition, several technical clarifications and corrections have been made in the Final Guideline.

Types of Grants Available and Funding Schedules 



The SJI grant program is designed to be responsive to the most important needs of the State courts. To meet the full range
of the courts' diverse needs, the Institute offers six different types of grants. The types of grants available in
FY 1995 and the funding cycles for each program are provided below: 



Project Grants

. These grants are awarded to support education, research, demonstration and technical assistance projects to improve
the administration of justice in the State courts. With limited exceptions (see sections II.B.2.b.i. and II.c.),
project grants are intended to support innovative projects of national significance. As provided in section V. of
the Guideline, project grants may ordinarily not exceed $300,000 a year; however, grants in excess of $200,000 are
likely to be awarded only to support projects likely to have a significant national impact. Applicants must ordinarily
submit a concept paper (see section VI.) and an application (see section VII.) in order to obtain a project grant. 

As indicated in Section VI.C., the Board may make an ``accelerated'' project grant of less than $40,000 on the basis
of the concept paper alone when the need for the project is clear and little additional information would be provided
in an application. 

The FY 1995 mailing deadline for project grant concept papers is November 23, 1994. Papers must be postmarked or bear
other evidence of submission by that date. With two exceptions noted immediately below, the FY 1995 funding cycle
will be substantially similar to the FY 1994 cycle: the Board will meet in early March, 1995 to invite formal applications
based on the most promising concept papers; applications will be due in May; and awards will be approved by the Board
in July. 

The first exception to this schedule pertains to proposals to follow up on the National Conference on Mass Tort Litigation
to be held in November, 1994. Applicants interested in participating in this special round of funding may submit concept
papers proposing projects addressing the findings and recommendations of that conference by March 10, 1995. The
papers will be considered by the Board at its meeting in April, 1995. Invited applications will be reviewed at the Board's
July, 1995 meeting. See section II.B.2.l. 

The second exception is for projects to follow up on the National Conference on Eliminating Race and Ethnic Bias in
the Courts to be held March 2-5, 1995. Concept papers for projects to implement the State action plans developed
at the conference must be mailed by October 6, 1995. See section II.B.2.i. 



Package Grants

. This grant program permits applicants to submit one concept paper (or application) for a ``package'' of related
grants rather than separate proposals for each related component of the package. Package grants of up to $750,000
per year may be awarded to support projects that address interrelated topics or the core elements of a multifaceted
program, or that require the services of all or some of the same key staff persons. Package grants must enhance (not
merely maintain) an applicant's services and must otherwise meet the Institute's grant criteria. The Board retains
the discretion to support all, none, or selected portions of the proposed package. Package grant concept papers and
applications will be considered on the same schedule as project grants. See sections III.J., V.C. and D., VI.A.2.b.
and 3.b., VII.A.3., VII.C., and VII.D. for more information about package grants. 



Technical Assistance Grants

. Under this program, a State or local court may receive a grant of up to $30,000 to engage outside experts to provide
technical assistance to diagnose, develop, and implement a response to a jurisdiction's problems. The Guideline
allocates up to $600,000 in FY 1995 funds to support technical assistance grants. See section II.C.2. 



Curriculum Adaptation Grants

. A grant of up to $20,000 may be awarded to a State or local court to replicate or modify a model training program developed
with SJI funds. The Guideline allocates up to $350,000 for these grants in FY 1995, the same amount allocated in FY 1994.
See section II.B.2.b.i.(b). 

Like Technical Assistance grant applications, letters requesting Curriculum Adaptation grants may be submitted
at any time during the fiscal year. However, in order to permit the Institute sufficient time to evaluate these proposals,
letters must be submitted no later than 90 days before the projected date of the training program. See section II.B.2.b.i.(b).




Scholarships

. The Guideline allocates up to $250,000 of FY 1995 funds for scholarships to enable judges and court managers to attend
out-of-State education and training programs. See section II.B.2.b.v.

<TEXT>
 

The Guideline establishes four deadlines for scholarship requests: November 1, 1994 for training programs beginning
between February 1, 1995 and April 30, 1995; February 1, 1995 for programs beginning between May 1, 1995 and July 31,
1995; May 1, 1995 for programs beginning between August 1, 1995 and October 31, 1995; and August 1, 1995 for programs
beginning between November 1, 1995 and January 31, 1996. 



Renewal Grants

. There are two types of renewal grants available from SJI: Continuation grants (see sections III.G., V.C. and D.,
and IX.A.) and On-going support grants (see sections III.H., V.C. and D., and IX.B.). Continuation grants are 
intended to support limited duration projects that involve the same type of activities as the original project. On-going
support grants may be awarded for up to a three-year period to support national-scope projects that provide the State
courts with critically needed services, programs, or products. 

The Guideline establishes a target for renewal grants of no more than $3 million, a little more than 25% of the total
amount available for grants in FY 1995. See section IX. Grantees should accordingly be aware that the award of a grant
to support a project does not constitute a commitment to provide either continuation funding or on-going support.


An applicant for a continuation or on-going support grant must submit a letter notifying the Institute of its intent
to seek such funding, no later than 120 days before the end of the current grant period. The Institute will then notify
the applicant of the deadline for its renewal grant application. See section IX. 



Special Interest Categories 



The Guideline contains 12 Special Interest categories, i.e., those project areas that the Board has identified as
being of particular importance to the State courts. Four new categories have been added this year: ``Children and
Families in Court'' (section II.B.2.e.); ``Resolution of New Evidentiary Issues'' (section II.B.2.g.); ``Eliminating
Race and Ethnic Bias in the Courts'' (section II.B.2.i.); and ``Improving the Courts' Response to Gender-Related
Crimes of Violence'' (section II.B.2.k.). 

The Guideline also solicits proposals to conduct two major national conferences: The National Symposium on Reducing
Litigation Delay noted above and a National Symposium on Sentencing Issues. See section II.B.2.b.iv. Courts in States
permitting capital punishment should also note the Institute's interest in testing the effectiveness of using special
capital litigation law clerks to assist trial judges hearing cases involving the death penalty. See section II.B.2.l.




Consultant Rates 



The Institute is committed to assuring that the compensation paid to consultants working under SJI grants is reasonable
in terms of both the total amount paid to an individual consultant, and the amount paid for individual tasks. A recent
internal review of consultant rates found that the number of consultants charging in excess of $300 a day has risen
significantly in recent years. Although no changes in the Grant Guideline are required, the Institute will be undertaking
changes in procedure (including Board participation in the review process and more detailed reports from applicants
and grantees) to assure that the compensation paid consultants is commensurate with the nature and quality of the
services to be performed; reasonable, in terms of the tasks performed and in total; and consistent with the public
service mission of the Institute. 



Recommendations to Grant Writers

Over the past 7 years, Institute staff have reviewed approximately 2,700 concept papers and 1,300 applications.
On the basis of those reviews, inquiries from applicants, and the views of the Board, the Institute offers the following
recommendations to help potential applicants present workable, understandable proposals that can meet the funding
criteria set forth in this Guideline. 
The Institute suggests that applicants make certain that they address the questions and issues set forth below when
preparing a concept paper or application. Concept papers and applications should, however, be presented in the formats
specified in sections vi. and vii. of the guideline, respectively. 
1. 

What is the subject or problem you wish to address? 

Describe the subject or problem and how it affects the courts and the public. Discuss how your approach will improve
the situation or advance the state of the art or knowledge, and explain why it is the most appropriate approach to take.
When statistics or research findings are cited to support a statement or position, the source of the citation should
be referenced in a footnote or a reference list. 
2. 

What do you want to do? 

Explain the goal(s) of the project in simple, straightforward terms. The goals should describe the intended consequences
or expected overall effect of the proposed project (e.g., to enable judges to sentence drug-abusing offenders more
effectively, or to dispose of civil cases within 24 months), rather than the tasks or activities to be conducted (e.g.,
hold three training sessions, or install a new computer system). 
To the greatest extent possible, an applicant should avoid a specialized vocabulary that is not readily understood
by the general public. Technical jargon does not enhance a paper. 
3. 

How will you do it? 

Describe the methodology carefully so that what you propose to do and how you would do it are clear. All proposed tasks
should be set forth so that a reviewer can see a logical progression of tasks and relate those tasks directly to the accomplishment
of the project's goal(s). When in doubt about whether to provide a more detailed explanation or to assume a particular
level of knowledge or expertise on the part of the reviewers, provide the additional information. A description of
project tasks also will help identify necessary budget items. All staff positions and project costs should relate
directly to the tasks described. The Institute encourages applicants to attach letters of cooperation and support
from the courts and related agencies that will be involved in or directly affected by the proposed project. 
4. 

How will you know it works? 

Include an evaluation component that will determine whether the proposed training, procedure, service, or technology
accomplished the objectives it was designed to meet. Concept papers and applications should describe the criteria
that will be used to evaluate the project's effectiveness and identify program elements which will require further
modification. The description in the application should include how the evaluation will be conducted, when it will
occur during the project period, who will conduct it, and what specific measures will be used. In most instances, the
evaluation should be conducted by persons not connected with the implementation of the procedure, training, service,
or technique, or the administration of the project. 
The Institute has also prepared a more thorough list of recommendations to grant writers regarding the development
of project evaluation plans. Those recommendations are available from the Institute upon request. 
5. 

How will others find out about it? 

Include a plan to disseminate the results of the training, research, or demonstration beyond the jurisdictions and
individuals directly affected by the project. The plan should identify the specific methods which will be used to
inform the field about the project, such as the publication of law review or journal articles, or the distribution
of key materials. A statement that a report or research findings ``will be made available to'' the field is not sufficient.
The specific means of distribution or dissemination as well as the types of recipients should be identified. Reproduction
and dissemination costs are allowable budget items. 
6. 

What are the specific costs involved? 

The budget in both concept papers and applications should be presented clearly. Major budget categories such as personnel,
benefits, travel, supplies, equipment, and indirect costs should be identified separately. The components of ``Other''
or ``Miscellaneous'' items should be specified in the application budget narrative, and should not include set-asides
for undefined contingencies. 
7. 

What, if any, match is being offered? 

Courts and other units of State and local government (not including publicly-supported institutions of higher education)
are required by the State Justice Institute Act to contribute a match (cash, non-cash, or both) of not less than 50 percent
of the grant funds requested from the Institute. All other applicants also are encouraged to provide a matching contribution
to assist in meeting the costs of a project. 
The match requirement works as follows: If, for example, the total cost of a project is anticipated to be $150,000,
a State or local court or executive branch agency may request up to $100,000 from the Institute to implement the project.
The remaining $50,000 (50% of the $100,000 requested from SJI) must be provided as match.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941006-2-00163 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941006-2-00113 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Cash match includes funds directly contributed to the project by the applicant, or by other public or private sources.
It does not include income generated from tuition fees or the sale of project products. Non-cash match refers to in-kind
contributions by the applicant, or other public or private sources. This includes, for example, the monetary value
of time contributed by existing personnel or members of an advisory committee (but not the time spent by participants
in an educational program attending program sessions). When match is offered, the nature of the match (cash or in-kind)
should be explained and, at the application stage, the tasks and line items for which costs will be covered wholly or
in part by match should be specified. 

8. 

Which of the two budget forms should be used?

 Section VII.A.3. of the SJI Grant Guideline encourages use of the spreadsheet format of Form C1 if the funding request
exceeds $100,000. Form C1 also works well for projects with discrete tasks, regardless of the dollar value of the project.
Form C, the tabular format, is preferred for projects lacking a number of discrete tasks, or for projects requiring
less than $100,000 of Institute funding. Generally, use the form that best lends itself to representing most accurately
the budget estimates for the project. 


9. 

How much detail should be included in the budget narrative?

 The budget narrative of an application should provide the basis for computing all project-related costs, as indicated
in section VII.D. of the SJI Grant Guideline. To avoid common shortcomings of application budget narratives, include
the following information: 

 Personnel estimates that accurately provide the amount of time to be spent by personnel involved with the project
and the total associated costs, including current salaries for the designated personnel (e.g., Project Director,
50% for one year, annual salary of $50,000 = $25,000). If salary costs are computed using an hourly or daily rate, the
annual salary and number of hours or days in a work-year should be shown. 

 Estimates for supplies and expenses supported by a complete description of the supplies to be used, nature
and extent of printing to be done, anticipated telephone charges, and other common expenditures, with the basis for
computing the estimates included (e.g., 100 reports x 75 pages each x .05/page = $375.00). Supply and expense estimates
offered simply as ``based on experience'' are not sufficient. 

In order to expedite Institute review of the budget, make a final comparison of the amounts listed in the budget narrative
with those listed on the budget form. In the rush to complete all parts of the application on time, there may be many last-minute
changes; unfortunately, when there are discrepancies between the budget narrative and the budget form or the amount
listed on the application cover sheet, it is not possible for the Institute to verify the amount of the request. A final
check of the numbers on the form against those in the narrative will preclude such confusion. The Institute will provide
an illustrative budget and budget form upon request. 

10. 

What travel regulations apply to the budget estimates?

 Transportation costs and per diem rates must comply with the policies of the applicant organization, and a copy of
the applicant's travel policy should be submitted as an appendix to the application. If the applicant does not have
a travel policy established in writing, then travel rates must be consistent with those established by the Institute
or the Federal Government (a copy of the Institute's travel policy is available upon request). The budget narrative
should state which regulations are in force for the project and should include the estimated fare, the number of persons
traveling, the number of trips to be taken, and the length of stay. The estimated costs of travel, lodging, ground transportation,
and other subsistence should be listed separately. When combined, the subtotals for these categories should equal
the estimate listed on the budget form. 

11. 

May grant funds be used to purchase equipment?

 Generally, grant funds may be used to purchase only the equipment that is necessary to demonstrate a new technological
application in a court, or that is otherwise essential to accomplishing the objectives of the project. Equipment
purchases to support basic court operations ordinarily will not be approved. The budget narrative must list the equipment
to be purchased and explain why the equipment is necessary to the success of the project. Written prior approval of
the Institute is required when the amount of computer hardware to be purchased or leased exceeds $10,000, or the software
to be purchased exceeds $3,000. 

12. 

To what extent may indirect costs be included in the budget estimates?

 It is the policy of the Institute that all costs should be budgeted directly; however, if an applicant has an indirect
cost rate that has been approved by a Federal agency within the last two years, an indirect cost recovery estimate may
be included in the budget. A copy of the approved rate agreement should be submitted as an appendix to the application.


If an applicant does not have an approved rate agreement, an indirect cost rate proposal should be prepared in accordance
with Section XI.H.4. of the Grant Guideline, based on the applicant's audited financial statements for the prior
fiscal year. (Applicants lacking an audit should budget all project costs directly.) If an indirect cost rate proposal
is to be submitted, the budget should reflect estimates based on that proposal. Obviously, this requires that the
proposal be completed at the time of application so that the appropriate estimates may be included; however, grantees
have until three months after the project start date to submit the indirect cost proposal to the Institute for approval.
An indirect cost rate worksheet on computer diskette is available from the Institute upon request. 

13. 

Does the budget truly reflect all costs required to complete the project?

 After preparing the program narrative portion of the application, applicants may find it helpful to list all the major
tasks or activities required by the proposed project, including the preparation of products, and note the individual
expenses, including personnel time, related to each. This will help to ensure that, for all tasks described in the
application (e.g., development of a videotape, research site visits, distribution of a final report), the related
costs appear in the budget and are explained correctly in the budget narrative. 



Recommendations To Grantees 



The Institute's staff works with grantees to help assure the smooth operation of the project and compliance with the
SJI Guidelines. On the basis of monitoring more than 800 grants, the Institute staff offers the following suggestions
to aid grantees in meeting the administrative and substantive requirements of their grants.

<PARENT> FR941006-2-00113 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

1. 

After the grant has been awarded, when are the first quarterly reports due

? Quarterly Progress Reports and Financial Status Reports must be submitted within 30 days after the end of every calendar
quarter_i.e. no later than January 30, April 30, July 30, and October 30_regardless of the project's start date. The
reporting periods covered by each quarterly report end 30 days before the respective deadline for the report. When
an award period begins December 1, for example, the first Quarterly Progress Report describing project activities
between December 1 and December 31 will be due on January 30. A Financial Status Report should be submitted even if funds
have not been obligated or expended. 

By documenting what has happened over the past three months, Quarterly Progress Reports provide an opportunity for
project staff and Institute staff to resolve any questions before they become problems, and make any necessary changes
in the project time schedule, budget allocations, etc. Thus, the Quarterly Project Report should describe project
activities, their relationship to the approved timeline, and any problems encountered and how they were resolved,
and outline the tasks scheduled for the coming quarter. It is helpful to attach copies of relevant memos, draft products,
or other requested information. An original and one copy of a Quarterly Progress Report and attachments should be
submitted to the Institute. 

Additional Quarterly Progress Report or Financial Status Report forms may be obtained from the grantee's Program
Manager at SJI, or photocopies may be made from the supply received with the award. 


2. 

Do reporting requirements differ for renewal grants or package grants

? Recipients of a continuation, on-going support, or package grant are required to submit quarterly progress and
financial status reports on the same schedule and with the same information as recipients of a grant for a single new
project. 

A continuation or an on-going support grant should be considered as a supplement to and extension of the original award,
and the reports numbered accordingly. For example, if the last quarterly report filed under the original award is
report number six, the first report including a portion of the renewal grant should be report number seven. 

Recipients of a package grant should file a summary Financial Status Report covering the entire package as well as
separate financial reports for each of the projects in the package, identified by letter of the alphabet (e.g., SJI-93-15R-J-001-A;
SJI-93-15R-J-001-B; SJI-93-15R-J-001-C). 

3. 

What information about project activities should be communicated to SJI

? In general, grantees should provide prior notice of critical project events such as advisory board meetings or training
sessions so that the Institute Program Manager can attend if possible. If methodological, schedule, staff, budget
allocations, or other significant changes become necessary, the grantee should contact the Program Manager prior
to implementing any of these changes, so that possible questions may be addressed in advance. Questions concerning
the financial requirements section of the Guideline, quarterly financial reporting or payment requests, should
be addressed to the Chief or Deputy Chief of the Institute's Finance and Management Division. 

It is helpful to include the grant number assigned to the award on all correspondence to the Institute. 

4. 

Why is it important to address the special conditions that are attached to the award document

? In some instances, a list of special conditions is attached to the award document. The special conditions are imposed
to establish a schedule for reporting certain key information, to assure that the Institute has an opportunity to
offer suggestions at critical stages of the project, and to provide reminders of some, but not all of the requirements
contained in the Grant Guideline. Accordingly, it is important for grantees to check the special conditions carefully
and discuss with their Program Manager any questions or problems they may have with the conditions. Most concerns
about timing, response time, and the level of detail required can be resolved in advance through a telephone conversation.
The Institute's primary concern is to work with grantees to assure that their projects accomplish their objectives,
not to enforce rigid bureaucratic requirements. However, if a grantee fails to comply with a special condition or
with other grant requirements, the Institute may, after proper notice, suspend payment of grant funds or terminate
the grant. 

Sections X., XI., and XII. of the Grant Guideline contain the Institute's administrative and financial requirements.
Institute Finance and Management Division staff are always available to answer questions and provide assistance
regarding these provisions. 

5. 

What is a Grant Adjustment

? A Grant Adjustment is the Institute's form for acknowledging the satisfaction of special conditions, or approving
changes in grant activities, schedule, staffing, sites, or budget allocations requested by the project director.
It also may be used to correct errors in grant documents, add small amounts to a grant award, or deobligate funds from
the grant. 


6. 

What schedule should be followed in submitting requests for reimbursements or advance payments

? Requests for reimbursements or advance payments may be made at any time after the project start date and before the
end of the 90-day close-out period. However, the Institute follows the U.S. Treasury's policy limiting advances
to the minimum amount required to meet immediate cash needs. Given normal processing time, grantees should not seek
to draw down funds for periods greater than 30 days from the date of the request.

<DOCNO> FR941006-2-00165 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941006-2-00113 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

7. 

Do procedures for submitting requests for reimbursement or advance payment differ for renewal grants or package
grants? 

The basic procedures are the same for any grant. A continuation or an on-going support grant should be considered as
a supplement to and extension of the original award, and the payment requests numbered accordingly. For example,
if the last payment request under the original award is number nine, then the first request for funds from the continuation
award should be number ten. 


Recipients of a package grant should file separate requests for each project in the package. For example, if there
are three projects within a package grant, a grantee should prepare three separate payment requests, each identified
by the letter of the alphabet designated in the award document (e.g., SJI-93-15R-J-001-A;
SJI-93-15R-J-001-B; SJI-93-15R-J-001-C). Subsequent payment
requests should be numbered consecutively for each project within the package (e.g., project SJI-93-15R-J-001-A
payment number 2; SJI-93-15R-J-001-B payment number 4; etc.). 

8. 

If things change during the grant period, can funds be reallocated from one budget category to another? 

The Institute recognizes that some flexibility is required in implementing a project design and budget. Thus, grantees
may shift funds among direct cost budget categories. When any one reallocation or the cumulative total of reallocations
are expected to exceed five percent of the approved project budget, a grantee must specify the proposed changes, explain
the reasons for the changes, and request Institute approval. 

The same standard applies to renewal grants and package grants. In addition, prior written Institute approval is
required to shift leftover funds from the original award to cover activities to be conducted under the renewal award,
or to use renewal grant monies to cover costs incurred during the original grant period. Prior written Institute approval
also is needed to shift funds between projects included in a package grant. 

9. 

What is the 90-day close-out period? 

Following the last day of the grant, a 90-day period is provided to allow for all grant-related bills to be received
and posted, and grant funds drawn down to cover these expenses. No obligations of grant funds may be incurred during
this period. The last day on which an expenditure of grant funds can be obligated is the end date of the grant period.
Similarly, the 90-day period is not intended as an opportunity to finish and disseminate grant products. This should
occur before the end of the grant period. 

Starting the day after the end of the award period, and during the following 90 days, all monies that have been obligated
should be expended. All payment requests must be received by the end of the 90-day ``close-out-period.'' Any unexpended
monies held by the grantee that remain after the 90-day follow-up period must be returned to the Institute. Any funds
remaining in the grant that have not been drawn down by the grantee will be deobligated. 

10. 

Are funds granted by SJI ``Federal'' funds? 

The State Justice Institute Act provides that, except for purposes unrelated to this question, ``the Institute shall
not be considered a department, agency, or instrumentality of the Federal Government.'' 42 U.S.C. 10704(c)(1).
Because SJI receives appropriations from Congress, some grantee auditors have reported SJI grants funds as ``Other
Federal Assistance.'' This classification is acceptable to SJI but is not required. 

11. 

If SJI is not a Federal Agency, do OMB circulars apply with respect to audits? 

Except to the extent that they are inconsistent with the express provisions of the SJI Grant Guideline, OMB Circulars
A-110, A-21, A-87, A-88, A-102, A-122, A-128 and A-133 are incorporated
into the Grant Guideline by reference. Because the Institute's enabling legislation specifically requires the
Institute to ``conduct, or require each recipient to provide for, an annual fiscal audit'' [see 42 U.S.C. 10711(c)(1)],
the Grant Guideline sets forth options for grantees to comply with this statutory requirement. (See Section XI.J.)


Prior to FY 1994, the Institute did not require grantees to comply with the audit-related provisions of OMB circulars
A-110, A-128, or A-133, but did require that grantees, lacking an audit report prepared for a Federal
agency, conduct an independent audit in compliance with generally accepted auditing standards established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. 

The current Guideline makes it clear that SJI will accept audits conducted in accordance with the Single Audit Act
of 1984 and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circulars A-128, or A-133, in satisfaction of the annual
fiscal audit requirement. Grantees who are required to undertake these audits in conjunction with Federal grants
may include SJI funds as part of the audit even if the receipt of SJI funds would not require such audits. This approach
gives grantees an option to fold SJI funds into the governmental audit rather than to undertake a separate audit to
satisfy SJI's Guideline requirements
'.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941006-2-00166 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941006-2-00113 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In sum, educational and nonprofit organizations that receive payments from the Institute that are sufficient to
meet the applicability thresholds of OMB Circular A-133 must have their annual audit conducted in accordance
with Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States rather than with generally
accepted auditing standards. Grantees in this category that receive amounts below the minimum threshold referenced
in Circular A-133 must also submit an annual audit to SJI, but they would have the option to conduct an audit of
the entire grantee organization in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards; include SJI funds in
an audit of Federal funds conducted in accordance with the Single Audit Act of 1984 and OMB Circular A-128 or A-133;
or conduct an audit of only the SJI funds in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. (See Guideline
Section XI.J.) 

12. 

Does SJI have a CFDA number? 

Auditors often request that a grantee provide the Institute's Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) number
for guidance in conducting an audit in accordance with Government Accounting Standards. Because SJI is not a Federal
agency, it has not been issued such a number, and there are no additional compliance tests to satisfy under the Institute's
audit requirements beyond those of a standard governmental audit. 

Moreover, because SJI is not a Federal agency, SJI funds should not be aggregated with Federal funds to determine if
the applicability threshold of Circular A-133 has been reached. For example, if in fiscal year 1995 grantee
``X'' received $10,000 in Federal funds from a Department of Justice (DOJ) grant program and $20,000 in grant funds
from SJI, the minimum A-133 threshold would not be met. The same distinction would preclude an auditor from considering
the additional SJI funds in determining what Federal requirements apply to the DOJ funds. 

Grantees that are required to satisfy either the Single Audit Act, OMB Circular A-128 or A-133, and who
include SJI grant funds in those audits, need to remember that because of its status as a private non-profit corporation,
SJI is not on routing lists of cognizant Federal agencies. Therefore, the grantee needs to submit a copy of the audit
report prepared for such a cognizant Federal agency directly to SJI. The Institute's audit requirements may be found
in Section XI.J. of the Grant Guideline.

Summary



This Guideline sets forth the programmatic, financial, and administrative requirements of grants, cooperative
agreements, and contracts awarded by the State Justice Institute. The Institute, a private, nonprofit corporation
established by an Act of Congress, is authorized to award grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts to improve
the administration and quality of justice in the State courts. 

Grants may be awarded to State and local courts and their agencies; national nonprofit organizations controlled
by, operating in conjunction with, and serving the judicial branch of State governments; and national nonprofit
organizations for the education and training of judges and support personnel of the judicial branch of State governments.
The Institute may also award grants to other nonprofit organizations with expertise in judicial administration;
institutions of higher education; individuals, partnerships, firms, or corporations; and private agencies with
expertise in judicial administration if the objectives of the funded program can be better served by such an entity.
Funds may be awarded, as well, to Federal, State or local agencies and institutions other than courts for services
that cannot be provided adequately through nongovernmental arrangements. In addition, the Institute may provide
financial assistance in the form of interagency agreements with other grantors. 

The Institute will consider applications for funding support that address any of the areas specified in its enabling
legislation as amended. However, the Board of Directors of the Institute has designated certain program categories
as being of special interest. 

The Institute has established one round of competition for FY 1995 funds. The concept paper submission deadline for
all but two funding categories is November 23, 1994. Concept papers proposing projects that follow up on the November
1994 National Conference on the Management of Mass Tort Cases must be mailed by March 10, 1995. Concept papers to implement
the plans developed at the March 1995 National Conference on Eliminating Race and Ethnic Bias in the Courts must be
mailed by October 6, 1995. 

It is anticipated that between $11 million and $11.5 million will be available for award. This Guideline applies to
all concept papers and applications submitted, as well as grants awarded in FY 1995. 

The awards made by the State Justice Institute are governed by the requirements of this Guideline and the authority
conferred by Public Law 98-620, Title II, 42 U.S.C. 10701, 

et seq., 

as amended.

in the United States. Incorporated in the State of Virginia as a private, nonprofit corporation, the Institute is
charged, by statute, with the responsibility to: 

A. Direct a national program of financial assistance designed to assure that each citizen of the United States is provided
ready access to a fair and effective system of justice; 

B. Foster coordination and cooperation with the Federal judiciary; 

C. Promote recognition of the importance of the separation of powers doctrine to an independent judiciary; and 

D. Encourage education for judges and support personnel of State court systems through national and State organizations,
including universities. 

To accomplish these broad objectives, the Institute is authorized to provide funds to State courts, national organizations
which support and are supported by State courts, national judicial education organizations, and other organizations
that can assist in improving the quality of justice in the State courts. 

The Institute is supervised by an eleven-member Board of Directors appointed by the President, by and with the consent
of the Senate. The Board is statutorily composed of six judges, a State court administrator, and four members of the
public, no more than two of whom can be of the same political party. 

Through the award of grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements, the Institute is authorized to perform the following
activities: 

A. Support research, demonstrations, special projects, technical assistance, and training to improve the administration
of justice in the State courts; 

B. Provide for the preparation, publication, and dissemination of information regarding State judicial systems;


C. Participate in joint projects with Federal agencies and other private grantors; 

D. Evaluate or provide for the evaluation of programs and projects funded by the Institute to determine their impact
upon the quality of criminal, civil, and juvenile justice and the extent to which they have contributed to improving
the quality of justice in the State courts; 

E. Encourage and assist in furthering judicial education; 

F. Encourage, assist, and serve in a consulting capacity to State and local justice system agencies in the development,
maintenance, and coordination of criminal, civil, and juvenile justice programs and services; and

Funds wil l not be made available for the ordinary, routine operation of court systems or programs in any of these areas.



B. Special Interest Program Categories


1. General Description


The Institute is interested in funding both innovative programs and programs of proven merit that can be replicated
in other jurisdictions. Although applications in any of the statutory program areas are eligible for funding in FY
1995, the Institute is especially interested in funding those projects that:
a. Formulate new procedures and techniques, or creatively enhance existing arrangements to improve the courts;
b. Address aspects of the State judicial systems that are in special need of serious attention;
c. Have national significance in terms of their impact or replicability in that they develop products, services and
techniques that may be used in other States; and
d. Create and disseminate products that effectively transfer the information and ideas developed to relevant audiences
in State and local judicial systems or provide technical assistance to facilitate the adaptation of effective programs
and procedures in other State and local jurisdictions.
A project will be identified as a ``Special Interest'' project if it meets the four criteria set forth above and (1)
it falls within the scope of the ``special interest'' program areas designated below, or (2) information coming to
the attention of the Institute from the State courts, their affiliated organizations, the research literature,
or other sources demonstrates that the project responds to another special need or interest of the State courts.
Concept papers and applications which address a ``Special Interest'' category will be accorded a preference in the
rating process. (See the selection criteria listed in sections VI.B., ``Concept Paper Submission Requirements
for New Projects,'' and VIII.B., ``Application Review Procedures.'')


2. Specific Categories


The Board has designated the areas set forth below as ``Special Interest'' program categories. The order of listing
does not imply any ordering of priorities among the categories.
a. 

Improving Public Confidence in the Courts. 

This category includes research, demonstration, evaluation and education projects designed to improve the public's
confidence in the State courts' ability to administer justice fairly, and to test innovative methods for eliminating
economic, racial, ethnic, cultural or gender-based barriers to justice.
i. The Institute is particularly interested in supporting innovative projects that examine, develop, and test methods
that trial or appellate courts may use to:

<TEXT>
 

 Respond to the needs of the culturally, demographically, economically and physically diverse public the
courts serve; 
 Address court-community problems resulting from the influx of legal and illegal immigrants, including projects
to define the impact of immigration on State courts; design and assess procedures for use in custody, visitation,
and other domestic relations cases when key family members or property are outside the United States; facilitate
communication with Federal authorities when illegal aliens are involved in State court proceedings; and develop
protocols to facilitate service of process, the enforcement of orders of judgment, and the disposition of criminal
and juvenile cases when a non-U.S. citizen or corporation is involved; 
 Handle cases involving pro se litigants fairly and effectively; and 
 Increase public understanding of jury decisions and the juror selection and service process; foster positive
attitudes toward jury service; and enhance the attractiveness of juror service through, e.g., incentives to participate,
modifications of terms of service, and/or juror orientation and education programs. 
Institute funds may not be used to directly or indirectly support legal representation of individuals in specific
cases. In addition, it is unlikely that the Institute will support development or testing of additional automated
kiosks such as those being used by the courts in Arizona, California, and Florida. 
ii. 

National Town Hall Meeting.

 The Institute recently awarded a grant to the National Center for State Courts (NCSC) and the American Judicature
Society (AJS) to convene a National Town Hall Meeting on Improving Public Confidence in the Courts in October 1995.
The Meeting will be broadcast by satellite up to ten downlink (receiving) sites across the country. 
The sponsors of the Meeting are seeking proposals from (a) State and local courts or (b) community groups, other non-profit
organizations, universities, and other applicants collaborating with courts, that are interested in conducting
a local, State, or regional meeting at a downlink site in conjunction with the National Meeting. Each site will receive
several hours of programming from the uplink (originating) site, prepare its own program, and report back to the uplink
site about its plans for future collaboration between courts and communities to enhance public confidence in the
courts. 


Objectives.

 As approved by the Institute's Board of Directors, the objectives of the project are to: 
 Raise the level of awareness of both the court community and the public about the need to work together to improve
public trust and confidence in the courts; 
 Identify strategies for improving court and community collaboration at the local and State level; 
 Promote a diverse group of effective local approaches to improve the relationship between courts and the communities
they serve; and 
 Develop national goals rooted in local experience that will encourage courts and communities to work together
more effectively.

<TEXT>
 



Site Selection.

 Representatives of SJI, NCSC, and AJS will select sites to participate in the program on a competitive basis. Site
selection will be based on the following criteria: 
 The level of support and participation of the State and local courts serving the proposed site; 
 The level of support and participation of representatives of a broad range of interested community groups
in the proposed site; 
 The site's technological and logistical capability to participate in the meeting; 
 The likelihood of continued efforts to improve public confidence in the courts serving the site after the meeting;

 The availability of funding from local sources to support the site costs of participating in the meeting; and

 Geographical diversity across all participating sites. 


Meeting Content.

 The sponsors presently contemplate an evening orientation program at all downlink sites (including a common video
presentation at each site that defines the mission of the Meeting), followed by a full-day program featuring national
satellite broadcasts mixed with local discussions. 
With the guidance and support of the conference sponsors, each participating site will be responsible for originating
local programs to complement the national program. All selected sites will receive: 
 Technical assistance regarding the use of satellite technology and the conduct of the local programs; 
 Conference materials including the opening videotape, notebooks and other informational materials about
effective ways to improve public confidence in the courts; and 
 Post-conference products including multiple copies of a manual for implementing model programs, a national
directory of programs, and a video of conference highlights. 


Application Process.

 Applications seeking to organize and convene a downlink program must respond to a National Town Hall Meeting Request
for Proposals (RFP) available from NCSC. To obtain a copy of the RFP, applicants should write to: National Center for
State Courts, National Town Hall Project, 300 Newport Avenue, Williamsburg, VA 23187-8798. All applications
must be sent to the same address and postmarked no later than February 15, 1995. Further information about the National
Town Hall Meeting and the application process is available from NCSC [(804) 253-2000] and AJS [(312) 558-6900].

Previous SJI-supported projects that address these issues include: evaluation of an experimental community court
in New York City; development of a manual for management of court interpretation services and materials for training
and assisting court interpreters; development of touchscreen computer systems, videotapes and written materials
to assist pro se litigants; a demonstration of the use of volunteers to monitor guardianships; studies of effective
and efficient methods of providing legal representation to indigent parties in criminal and family cases and the
applicability of various dispute resolution procedures to different cultural groups; guidelines for court-annexed
day care systems; and development of a manual for implementing innovations in jury selection, use, and management;
technical assistance and training to facilitate implementation of the Standards on Jury Management; development
of a guide for making juries accessible to persons with disabilities. 
b. 

Education and Training for Judges and Other Key Court Personnel.

 The Institute continues to be interested in supporting an array of projects to strengthen and broaden the availability
of court education programs at the State, regional, and national levels. Accordingly, this category is divided into
five subsections: (i) State Initiatives; (ii) National and Regional Education Programs; (iii) Judicial Education
Technical Assistance; (iv) Conferences; and (v) Scholarships. All Institute-supported conferences and education
and training seminars should be accessible to persons with disabilities in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities
Act.

i. 

State Initiatives. 

This category includes support for training projects developed or endorsed by a State's courts for the benefit of
judges and other court personnel in that State. Funding of these initiatives does not include support for training
programs conducted by national providers of judicial education unless such a program is designed specifically for
a particular State and has the express support of the State Chief Justice, State Court Administrator, or State Judicial
Educator. The types of programs to be supported within this category should be defined by individual State need but
may include: 

(a) 

Development of State Court Education Programs. 

Projects to assist development of State court education programs include, but are not limited to: 

 Seed money for the creation of an ongoing State-based entity for planning, developing, and administering
judicial education programs; 

 Seed money for innovative interdisciplinary and, as appropriate, interbranch educational programs, such
as those addressing: (1) the development of better working relationships across court divisions and between courts
and criminal justice, social service, and treatment agencies; (2) organizational and leadership development,
including team-building; and (3) the specific educational needs of nonsupervisory staff as well of those filling
more direct managerial roles; and (4) the development and implementation of strategies for coping with the gap between
resources and the demand for services; and 

 The development of the expertise, information, and commitment required for the preparation and implementation
of State court education plans, including model plans for career-long education of the judiciary (e.g., new judge
training and orientation followed by continuing education and career development) and for the career-long education
of court managers, clerks, and other court personnel. 

(b) 

Curriculum Adaptation Projects. 

(1) 

Description of the Program. 

The Board is reserving up to $350,000 to provide support for adaptation and implementation of model curricula and/or
model training programs previously developed with SJI support. The exact amount to be awarded for curriculum adaptation
grants will depend on the number and quality of the applications submitted in this category and other categories of
the Guideline. The program is designed to provide State and local courts with sufficient support to prepare and conduct
a State-specific or regional modification of a model curriculum, course module, national or regional conference
program, or other model education program developed with SJI funds by any other State or national organization. An
illustrative list of the curricula that may be appropriate for the adaptation is contained in Appendix VI. 

Only State or local courts may apply for Curriculum Adaptation funding. Grants to support adaptation of educational
programs previously developed with SJI funds are limited to no more than $20,000 each. As with other awards to State
or local courts, cash or in-kind match must be provided equal to at least 50% of the grant amount requested. 

(2) 

Review Criteria. 

Curriculum Adaptation grants will be awarded on the basis of criteria including: The need for the educational program;
the need for outside funding to support the program; the likelihood of effective implementation; and expressions
of interest by the judges and/or court personnel who would be directly involved in or affected by the project. In making
implementation awards, the Institute will also consider factors such as the reasonableness of the amount requested,
compliance with the statutory match requirements, diversity of subject matter, geographic diversity, the level
of appropriations available in the current year, and the amount expected to be available in succeeding fiscal years.


(3) 

Application Procedures. 

In lieu of concept papers and formal applications, applicants for grants may submit, at any time, a detailed letter,
and three photocopies. Although there is no prescribed form for the letter nor a minimum or maximum page limit, letters
of application should include the following information to assure that each of the criteria for evaluating applications
is addressed: 

 

Project Description. 

Why is this education program needed at the present time? What is the model curriculum or training program to be tested?
How will it be adapted for State use, and who will be responsible for adapting the model curriculum? Who will the participants
be, how will they be recruited, and from where will they come (e.g., from across the State, from a single local jurisdiction,
from a multi-State region)? How many participants are anticipated? 

 

Need for funding. 

Why cannot State or local resources fully support the modification and presentation of the model curriculum? What
is the potential for replicating or integrating the program in the future using State or local funds, once it has been
successfully adapted and tested? 

 

Likelihood. 

What is the proposed date for presenting the program? What types of modifications in the length, format, and content
of the model curriculum are anticipated? How will the presentation of the program be evaluated and by whom? (Ordinarily,
an outside evaluation is not necessary.) What measures will be taken to facilitate subsequent presentations of the
adapted program?

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941006-2-00174 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941006-2-00113 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 

Expressions of Interest By Judges and/or Court Personnel. 

Does the proposed program have the support of the court system leadership, and of judges, court managers, and judicial
education personnel who are expected to attend? (This may be demonstrated by attaching letters of support.) 

 

Budget and Matching State Contribution. 

A copy of budget Form E (see Appendix IV) and a budget narrative (see Section VII.B.) that describes the basis for the
proposed costs and the source of the match offered. 

 Local courts should attach a concurrence signed by the Chief Justice of the State or his or her designee. (See
Form B, Appendix V.) 

Letters of application may be submitted at any time. However, applicants should allow at least 90 days between the
date of submission and the date of the proposed program to allow sufficient time for needed planning. The Board of Directors
has delegated its authority to approve Curriculum Adaptation grants to its Judicial Education Committee. The committee
anticipates acting upon applications within 45 days after receipt. Formal grant awards will be made only after committee
approval and negotiation of the final terms of the grant. 

(4) 

Grantee Responsibilities. 

A recipient of a Curriculum Adaptation grant must: 

(a) Comply with the same quarterly reporting requirements as other Institute grantees (see Section X.L., infra);


(b) Include in each grant product a prominent acknowledgment that support was received from the Institute, along
with the ``SJI'' logo, and a disclaimer paragraph based on the example provided in Section X.Q. of the Guideline; and


(c) Submit two copies of the manuals, handbooks, or conference packets developed under the grant at the conclusion
of the grant period, along with a final report that explains how it intends to replicate the program in the future. 

Applicants seeking other types of funding for developing and testing educational programs must comply with the requirements
for concept papers and applications set forth in Sections VI and VII or the requirements for renewal applications
set forth in Section IX. 

ii. 

National and Regional Education Programs. 

This category includes support for national or regional training programs developed by any provider, e.g., national
organizations, State courts, universities, or public interest groups. Within this category, priority will be given
to training projects which address issues of major concern to the State judiciary and other court personnel. Ordinarily,
national and regional education projects are expected to develop curricula (as defined in Section III.K.) that may
be adapted by State and local courts. Programs to be supported may include: 

 Training programs or seminars on topics of interest and concern that transcend State lines including the factors
that should be considered in deciding child custody and termination of parental rights; 

 Multi-State or regional training programs sponsored by national organizations, non-profit groups, State
courts or universities; 

 Interdisciplinary and, as appropriate, interbranch educational programs for State trial and appellate
court judges, State and local court managers including clerks of court, and non-supervisory staff or other court
personnel, including seminars based on Institute-supported research, and programs designed to develop better
working relationships across court divisions and between courts and criminal justice, social service, and treatment
agencies; and 

 Innovative independent study models that would enhance the availability of judicial education, especially
for judges and court personnel who do not have ready access to training programs, and possible models for the credentialing
of this type of continuing judicial education. 

iii. 

Judicial Education Technical Assistance. 

Unlike the preceding categories which support direct training, ``Technical Assistance'' refers to services necessary
for the development of effective educational projects for judges and other court personnel. Projects in this category
should focus on the needs of the States, and applicants should demonstrate their ability to work effectively with
State judicial educators. 



The Institute is currently funding the following judicial education technical assistance projects: the Judicial
Education Reference Information and Technology Transfer Project (JERITT), which collects and disseminates information
(as well as providing technical assistance) on continuing education programs for judges and court personnel; the
Judicial Education/Adult Education Project (JEAEP), which provides expert assistance on the application of adult
and continuing education theory and practices to court education programs; the Leadership Institute in Judicial
Education, which offers an annual training program and follow-up assistance to State judicial education leadership
teams to help them develop improved approaches to court education; and NASJE NEWS, a newsletter of the National Association
of State Judicial Educators. 

iv. Conferences. 

This category includes support for regional or national conferences on topics of major concern to the State judiciary
and court personnel. Applicants are encouraged to consider the use of videoconference and other technologies to
increase participation and limit travel expenses in planning and presenting conferences. Applicants also are reminded
that conference sites should be accessible to persons with disabilities in accordance with the Americans With Disabilities
Act. In planning a conference, applicants should provide for a written, video, or other product that would widely
disseminate the information, findings, and any recommendations resulting from the conference. 

The Institute is particularly interested in supporting:

<TEXT>
 

(a) 

National Symposium on Sentencing: The Judicial Response to Crime

, to enable State and Federal judges, legislators, prosecutors, defense counsel, corrections officials, legal
academics, social science researchers, media representatives, and members of the public to:

 Evaluate what is known about the impact of current sentencing practices on adult offenders, juvenile offenders
tried as adults, and juvenile offenders, the criminal and juvenile justice systems, and the public's perception
of justice;

 Explore how changes in sentencing legislation and judicial practices might better accomplish the goals of
sentencing;

 Identify changes in procedure, new sources of information or education, and other innovations that might
better assure that a sentence serves the judge's intended sentencing goal(s) in a particular case; and

 Recommend specific changes in law, policy, and procedure that would help courts better accomplish the goals
of sentencing and improve the public's confidence in the justice system.

Among the topics which could be addressed at the Symposium would be: the impact that Federal and State sentencing guidelines,
mandatory minimums, and other determinate sentencing approaches have had on the courts and other components of the
criminal justice system, the public, and offenders; whether these approaches have fulfilled their envisioned purposes;
whether sentencing innovations (e.g., giving judges greater access to information about the offender, the victim,
and available sentencing options; changed plea bargaining practices; and greater use of intermediate sanctions)
might better assure just and effective sentencing; and whether current sentencing legislation, processes, and
decisions adequately reflect the public's expectations of justice.

(b) 

National Symposium on Reducing Litigation Delay. 

The Institute has supported over 20 projects examining methods for improving caseflow in various types and levels
of courts, or training judges and court managers on pretrial and trial management. The Institute is interested in
supporting a symposium that would bring together litigation delay researchers, technical assistance providers,
trial and appellate court judges and managers both from courts that have not successfully implemented programs for
improving caseflow and reducing the time to disposition as well as those that have, State court administrators, attorneys,
scholars, and others to synthesize and share the information resulting from the projects funded by the Institute
and others; determine the approaches to pretrial, trial, and individual docket management that appear to be most
effective and the best methods for implementing them; identify the programs that may be needed to assist courts in
further reducing litigation delay; define and prioritize the topics for further research on improving caseflow
management; and encourage and assist courts that are experiencing litigation delay to undertake measures to ensure
the prompt and fair disposition of cases.

v. 

Scholarships for Judges and Court Personnel. 

The Institute is reserving up to $250,000 (in addition to any scholarship funds remaining from Fiscal Year 1994) to
support a scholarship program for State court judges and court managers.

(a) 

Program Description/Scholarship Amounts. 

The purposes of the Institute scholarship program are to: enhance the knowledge, skills, and abilities of judges
and court managers; enable State court judges and court managers to attend out-of-State educational programs sponsored
by national and State providers that they could not otherwise attend because of limited State, local and personal
budgets; and provide States, judicial educators, and the Institute with evaluative information on a range of judicial
and court-related education programs.

Scholarships will be granted to individuals only for the purpose of attending an out-of-State educational program
within the United States. The annual or midyear meeting of a State or national organization of which the applicant
is a member does not qualify as an out-of-State educational program for scholarship purposes, even though it may include
workshops or other training sessions.

<TEXT>
 

A scholarship may cover the cost of tuition and travel up to a maximum total of $1,500 per scholarship. (Transportation
expenses include roundtrip coach airfare or train fare, or up to $.25/mile if the recipient drives to the site of the
program.) Funds to pay tuition and transportation expenses in excess of $1,500, and other costs of attending the program
such as lodging, meals, materials, and local transporta-tion (including rental cars) at the site of the education
program, must be obtained from other sources or be borne by the scholarship recipient.

Scholarship recipients are encouraged to check with their tax advisor to determine whether the scholarship constitutes
taxable income under Federal and State law.

(b) 

Eligibility Requirements. 

Because of the limited amount of funds available, scholarships are limited to full-time judges of State or local trial
and appellate courts, to full-time professional, State or local court personnel with management responsibilities,
and to supervisory and management probation personnel in judicial branch probation offices. Senior judges, part
time judges, quasi-judicial hearing officers, State administrative law judges, staff attorneys, law clerks, line
staff, law enforcement officers and other executive branch personnel will not be eligible to receive a scholarship.

(c) 

Application Procedures. 

Judges and court managers interested in receiving a scholarship must submit the Institute's Judicial Education
Scholarship Application Form (Form S1, see Appendix III). Applications must be submitted by:

November 1, 1994, for programs beginning between February 1, 1995 and April 30, 1995;

February 1, 1995, for programs beginning between May 1 and July 31, 1995;

May 1, 1995, for programs beginning between August 1, and October 31, 1995; and

August 1, 1995, for programs beginning between November 1, 1995 and January 31, 1996.

No exceptions or extensions will be granted.

(d) 

Concurrence Requirement. All scholarship applicants must obtain the written concurrence of the Chief Justice of
his or her State's Supreme Court (or the Chief Justice's designee) on the Institute's Judicial Education Scholarship
Concurrence (Form S2, see Appendix III). 

Court managers, other than elected clerks of court, also should submit a letter of support from their supervisor.
The Concurrence (Form S2) may accompany the application or be sent separately. However, the original signed Concurrence
form must be received by the Institute within one week after the appropriate application mailing deadline (i.e. by
November 8, 1994, or February 8, May 8, or August 8, 1995). No application will be reviewed if a signed Concurrence has
not been received by the required date.

(e) 

Review Procedures/Selection Criteria. 

The Board of Directors has delegated the authority to approve or deny scholarships to its Judicial Education Committee.
The Institute intends to notify each applicant whose scholarship has been approved within 60 days after the relevant
application deadline. The Committee will reserve sufficient funds each quarter to assure the availability of scholarships
throughout the year.

The factors that the Institute will consider in selecting scholarship recipients are:

 The applicant's need for training in the particular course subject and how the applicant would apply the information/skills
gained;

 The benefits to the applicant's court or the State's court system that would be derived from the applicant's
participation in the specific educational program, including a description of current legal, procedural, administrative
or other problems affecting the State's courts, related to topics to be addressed at the educational program (in addition
to submission of a signed Form S2);

 The absence of educational programs in the applicant's State addressing the particular topic;

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941006-2-00177 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941006-2-00113 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 How the applicant will disseminate the knowledge gained (e.g., by developing/teaching a course or providing
in-service training for judges or court personnel at the State or local level); 
 The length of time that the applicant intends to serve as a judge or court manager, assuming reelection or reappointment,
where applicable; 
 The likelihood that the applicant would be able to attend the program without a scholarship; 
 The unavailability of State or local funds to cover the costs of attending the program; 
 The quality of the educational program to be attended as demonstrated by the sponsoring organization's experience
in judicial education, evaluations by participants or other professionals in the field, or prior SJI support for
this or other programs sponsored by the organization; 
 Geographic balance; 
 The balance of scholarships among types of applicants and courts; 
 The balance of scholarships among educational programs; and 
 The level of appropriations available to the Institute in the current year and the amount expected to be available
in succeeding fiscal years. 
(f) 

Responsibilities of Scholarship Recipients.

 In order to receive the funds authorized by a scholarship award, recipients must submit Scholarship Payment Voucher
(Form S3) together with a tuition statement from the program sponsor, and a transportation fare receipt (or statement
of the driving mileage to and from the recipient's home to the site of the educational program). Recipients also must
submit to the Institute a certificate of attendance at the program and an evaluation of the educational program they
attended. A copy of the evaluation also must be sent to the Chief Justice of their State. 
A State or a local jurisdiction may impose additional requirements on scholarship recipients that are consistent
with SJI's criteria and requirements, e.g., a requirement to serve as faculty on the subject at a State- or locally-sponsored
judicial education program. 
c. 

Dispute Resolution and the Courts.

 This category includes research, evaluation, and demonstration projects addressing the findings and recommendations
developed at the National Symposium on Court-Connected Dispute Resolution Research, conducted in Orlando in October
1993. The Institute is interested in projects that enhance the courts' ability to compare findings among research
studies; address the nature and operation of ADR programs within the context of the court system as a whole; compare
dispute resolution processes to attorney settlement as well as trial; and promote the ability of the courts to move
toward on-going self-evaluation of court-connected dispute resolution programs. Among the topics of greatest
interest are: 
i. The Structure of Court-Connected Dispute Resolution Programs including such issues as the appropriate timing
for referrals to dispute resolution services and the effects implementing such referrals at various stages during
litigation; the effect of different referral methods including any differences in outcome between voluntary and
mandatory referrals; cultural issues, including the nature of cultural conflict and its effect on outcomes; and
approaches that provide rural courts and other under-served areas with adequate court-connected dispute resolution
services. 
ii. The Selection, Qualifications and Training of Court-Connected Neutrals including what selection procedures
are most effective; what standards should be used to qualify a neutral; what constitutes effective dispute resolution
training; on what basis and when people should be eliminated from the training process; how courts can maintain and
improve neutrals' skills; and how ineffective neutrals should be removed from the pool. 
iii. Innovative uses of court-connected dispute resolution for resolving complex cases including land-use litigation.

Applicants should be aware that the Institute will not provide operational support for on-going ADR programs. Courts
also should be advised that it is preferable for the applicant to support operational costs of a new program, with Institute
funds targeted to support related technical assistance, training, and evaluation needs. 
In previous funding cycles, grants have been awarded to support evaluation of the use of mediation in civil, domestic
relations, juvenile, medical malpractice, appellate, and minor criminal cases. SJI grants also have supported
assessments of the impact of early neutral evaluation of motor vehicle cases, the impact of private judging on State
courts, multi-door courthouse programs, arbitration of civil cases, and civil settlement programs. In addition,
SJI has supported the creation of a consumer guide to choosing a mediator; the development of training programs for
judges; and technical assistance on implementation of multi-door courthouse programs, developing standards for
court-annexed mediation programs, examination of the applicability of various dispute resolution procedures
to different cultural groups, and creation of a national database of court-connected dispute resolution programs.

d. 

Planning and Managing the Future of the Courts.

 The Institute is interested in supporting activities that would enable courts to implement and evaluate long-range
strategic planning processes and complementary innovative management approaches in their own jurisdictions.

<TEXT>
 

The types of projects that fall within this category are: 
 Development, implementation, institutionalization, and evaluation of long-range planning approaches
in individual States and local jurisdictions, e.g., the development or inclusion of strategic planning techniques,
environmental scanning, trends analysis, benchmarking, and other comprehensive long-range, strategic planning
methods as components of courts' current planning processes or as part of the initiation of such a process; 
 Adaptation, implementation and evaluation of innovative management approaches, such as total quality management,
designed to complement, enhance or support use of a long-range strategic planning process. This includes the development
and testing of performance standards and other techniques to enable trial and appellate court officials to conduct
user evaluations of the quality of court services and to measure public, internal, and supplier satisfaction as a
means to improve court performance. Also included is the planning, implementation, and evaluation of innovative
delay and cost reduction programs including assessments of the advantages and disadvantages of privatizing court
activities; 
 Development, implementation, and evaluation of mechanisms for linking assessments of effectiveness such
as the Trial Court Performance Standards to fiscal planning and budgeting, including service efforts and accomplishments
approaches (SEA), performance audits, and performance budgeting; 
 Development, presentation and evaluation of training necessary to enable judges and court staff to participate
productively in the implementation or institutionalization of the planning process and/or related innovative
management approaches, including training to enhance the ability of courts to develop effective plans for coping
with natural or other disasters. 
The Institute has supported futures commissions in seven States. Because the Board of Directors believes that a sufficient
variety of commission models now exists, the Institute will not support the development or implementation of any
State futures commissions in FY 1995. 
The Institute also has supported planning, futures, and innovative management projects including: national and
Statewide ``future and the courts'' conferences and training; development of curricula, guidebooks and a video
on visioning, and a long-range planning guide for trial courts; the provision of technical assistance to courts conducting
futures and long-range planning activities, including development of a court futures network on Internet; a test
of the feasibility of implementing the Trial Court Performance Standards in four States; the development of Appellate
Court Performance Standards; the application of total quality management principles to court operations, and the
development of TQM guidebook for trial courts; and the development of service efforts and accomplishments (SEA)
measures for municipal courts. 
e. 

Children and Families in Court.

 This category includes education, evaluation, technical assistance, and research projects to identify and inform
judges of appropriate and effective approaches for: 
 Adjudicating child custody litigation in which family violence may be involved; 




</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941006-2-00179 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941006-2-00113 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 Determining and addressing the service needs of children exposed to family violence including the short-
and long-term effects on children of exposure to family violence and the methods for mitigating those effects when
issuing protection, custody, visitation, or other orders; 

 Adjudicating and monitoring child abuse and neglect litigation and reconciling the need to protect the child
with the requirement to make reasonable efforts to maintain or reunite the family; 

 Adjudicating and developing dispositions for cases involving elder abuse; 

 Determining when it may be appropriate to refer a case involving family violence for mediation, and what procedures
and safeguards should be employed; 

 Coordinating multiple cases involving members of the same family, and obtaining and appropriately using
social and psychological information gathered in one case involving a family member in a case involving another family
member; and 

 Handling the criminal and civil aspects of interstate and international parental child abductions. 

In previous funding cycles, the Institute supported a national and a State symposium on courts, children, and the
family; a national symposium on enhancing coordination of cases involving the same family that are being heard in
different courts; development and evaluation of a curriculum addressing the adjudication of allegations of child
sexual abuse when custody is in dispute; and the development and testing of curricula to enhance judges' understanding
of the dynamics of family violence and guide them in adjudication of family violence cases and custody cases in which
spousal abuse is involved. In addition, the Institute has supported studies of the appropriate use of mediation in
child abuse cases and in divorce, custody, and visitation cases involving family violence; development of a video
and other materials for parties and children awaiting a court hearing in domestic relations cases involving family
violence; a benchbook for judges on child abuse and neglect cases stemming from parental substance abuse; curricula
to fairly adjudicate child abuse and neglect cases; an examination of the effectiveness of probation as a sanction
for child sexual abuse offenders; and the development of guidelines for courts in handling elder abuse cases. 

f. 

Application of Technology. 

This category includes the testing of innovative applications of technology to improve the operation of court management
systems and judicial practices at both the trial and appellate court levels. 

The Institute seeks to support local experiments with promising but untested applications of technology in the courts
that include a structured evaluation of the impact of the technology in terms of costs, benefits, and staff workload.
In this context, ``untested'' refers to novel applications of technology developed for the private sector and other
fields that have not previously been applied to the courts. 

The Institute is particularly interested in supporting efforts to determine what benefits and problems may occur
as a result of courts entering the ``information superhighway,'' including projects to establish standards for
judicial electronic data interchange (EDI); local, Statewide, and/or interstate demonstrations of the courts'
use of EDI (i.e., the exchange of documents or data in a computerized format that enables courts to process or perform
work electronically on the documents received) beyond simple image transfer (facsimile or computer-imaging);
and demonstrations and evaluations of innovative judicial/court uses of electronic communications networks including
those required to meet the reporting mandates contained in recent Federal legislation such as the Brady Act and the
National Child Protection Act. In addition, the Institute is interested in demonstrations and evaluation of the
effective use of management information systems to monitor, assess, and predict evolving court needs; and evaluations
of innovative technologies highlighted at the Fourth National Conference on Court Technology held in Nashville
in October 1994. 

Ordinarily, the Institute will not provide support for the purchase of equipment or software in order to implement
a technology that has been thoroughly tested in other jurisdictions such as the establishment of videolinks between
courts and jails, the use of optical imaging for recordkeeping, and the creation of an automated management information
system. (See section XI.H.2.b. regarding other limits on the use of grant funds to purchase equipment and software.)


In previous funding cycles, grants have been awarded to support: 

Demonstration and evaluation of communications technology, e.g.: interactive computerized information systems
to assist pro se litigants; the use of FAX technology by courts; a multi-user ``system for judicial interchange''
designed to link disparate automated information systems and share court information among judicial system offices
throughout a State without replacement of the various hardware and software environments which support individual
courts; a compu-terized voice information system permitting parties to access by telephone information pertaining
to their cases; an automated public information directory of courthouse facilities and services; an automated appellate
court bulletin board; and a computer-integrated courtroom that provides full access to the judicial system for hearing-impaired
jurors, witnesses, crime victims, litigants, attorneys, and judges. 

Demonstration and evaluation of records technology, including: the development of a court management information
display system; the integration of bar-coding technology with an existing automated case management system; an
on-bench automated system for generating and processing court orders; an automated judicial education management
system; testing of a document management system for small courts that uses imaging technology, and of automated telephone
docketing for circuit-riding judges; and evaluation of the use of automated teller machines for paying jurors; and

Court technology assistance services, e.g., circulation of a court technology bulletin designed to inform judges
and court managers about the latest developments in court-related technologies; creation of a court technology
laboratory to provide judges and court managers with the opportunity to test automated court-related systems; enhancement
of a data base documenting automated systems currently in use in courts across the country; establishment of a technical
information service to respond to specific inquiries concerning court-related technologies; development of court
automation performance standards; and an assessment of programs that allow public access to electronically stored
court information. 

Grants also provided support for national court technology conferences; preparation of guidelines on privacy and
public access to electronic court information; the testing of a computerized citizen intake and referral service;
development of an ``analytic judicial desktop system'' to assist judges in making sentencing decisions; implementation
and evaluation of a Statewide automated integrated case docketing and record-keeping system; a prototype computerized
benchbook using hypertext technology; and computer simulation models to assist State courts in evaluating potential
strategies for improving civil caseflow. 

 g. 

Resolution of Current Evidentiary Issues. 

This category includes educational programs and other projects to assist judges in deciding questions regarding:


 The admissibility of new forms of demonstrative evidence, including computer simulations; 

 The application of the standards set forth in 

Daubert 

v. 

Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. governing the admissibility of scientific and technical evidence; 

 The admissibility of testimony based on recovered memory, and the admissibility of expert testimony about
memory recovery; 

 The competence of children to testify in criminal, civil, and family cases; 

 The appropriate use of expert testimony regarding the impact of gender-related offenses on victims and their
willingness and ability to testify, and the application of rape shield laws and other limits on the introduction of
evidence or the cross-examination of witnesses; 

 Determining what constitutes clear and convincing evidence of a person's wish not to initiate or continue
life-sustaining treatment, including the implications of the Federal Patient Self-Determination Act; and 

 Other complex evidentiary issues. 

In previous funding cycles, the Institute has supported the development of a computer-assisted training program
on evidentiary problems for juvenile and family court judges; training on medical/legal and scientific evidence
issues; regional seminars on evidentiary questions; and development of protocols for handling child victim cases.


h. Substance Abuse. 

This category includes the development and evaluation of innovative techniques for courts to handle the increasing
volume of substance abuse-related criminal, civil, juvenile and domestic relations cases fairly and expeditiously;
and the planning and presentation of seminars or other educational forums for judges, probation officers, caseworkers,
and other court personnel to examine court-related issues concerning alcohol and other drug abuse and develop specific
plans for how individual courts can respond effectively to the impact of substance abuse-related cases on their ability
to manage their overall caseloads fairly and efficiently.

The Institute is particularly interested in funding innovative projects which evaluate the applicability of court-enforced
treatment programs to substance abuse-related cases involving juveniles and cases requiring treatment services
in addition to substance abuse treatment (e.g., spousal abuse, child abuse, or mental health cases); establish coordinated
efforts between local courts and treatment providers for the effective disposition of cases involving substance
abuse; or evaluate the effectiveness of various court responses to treating substance abuse. Proposals should demonstrate
a direct impact on the ability of State courts to handle cases involving substance abuse fairly and effectively. 

The Institute will not fund projects focused on developing additional assessment tools, establishing court-enforced
treatment programs for adult substance abusers, or providing support for basic court or treatment services. 

The Institute is currently supporting the presentation of a National Symposium on the Implementation and Operation
of Court-Enforced Drug Treatment Programs. In previous funding cycles, the Institute has sponsored a National Conference
on Substance Abuse and the Courts, and State efforts to implement the plans developed at that Conference. It has also
supported projects to evaluate court-enforced treatment programs initiated by the Dade County, Florida, Pulaski
County, Arkansas, and New York City courts, and the effectiveness of other court-based alcohol and drug assessment
programs; replicate the Dade County program in non-urban sites; assess the impact of legislation and court decisions
dealing with drug-affected infants, and strategies for coping with increasing caseload pressures; develop a benchbook
to assist judges in child abuse and neglect cases involving parental substance abuse; test the use of a dual diagnostic
treatment model for domestic violence cases in which substance abuse was a factor; and present local and regional
educational programs for judges and other court personnel on substance abuse and its treatment. 

The Institute and the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) also are supporting two technical assistance projects:
one by the National Center for State Courts to assist courts in implementing the plans developed at the National Conference;
and the other by the American University Court Technical Assistance Project to identify successful drug case management
strategies, conduct seminars on drug case management, and develop a guidebook for implementing drug case processing
initiatives. In addition, the Institute and the Department of Health and Human Services' Center for Substance Abuse
Treatment (CSAT) have entered into interagency agreement to conduct regional training programs for State judges
and legislators on substance abuse treatment. 


i. 

Eliminating Race and Ethnic Bias in the Courts.

 This category includes State and local court projects to implement the action plans and strategies developed by the
teams that participated in the Institute-supported National Conference on Eliminating Race and Ethnic Bias in the
Courts, to be held in Albuquerque, New Mexico in March, 1995, and projects designed to assist teams in implementing
their plans. 

A special accelerated cycle has been established for considering such projects. In order to be considered during
the special cycle, concept papers proposing implementation projects must be mailed by October 6, 1995. They will
be considered by the Institute's Board of Directors at its meeting in November, 1995. Applications based on those
concept papers will be considered by the Board at its meeting in March, 1996.

 Determining and preparing approaches for dealing with the impact on the State Courts of proposed or enacted
changes in the State and Federal health care systems, including the anticipated increase in the number of disputes
regarding the scope and nature of insurance coverage; 
 Understanding and responding to the scientific, legal and ethical issues raised by the continuing advances
in the application of biotechnology to health care, including the use of gene therapy and genetic testing; and 
 Using effective innovative remedies in long-term environmental and toxic substance exposure cases such
as medical surveillance orders. 
In previous funding cycles, the Institute has supported projects to: Develop guidelines for judges in cases regarding
the withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment; prepare benchbooks, handbooks, videotapes, and training materials
on guardianship, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and AIDS; conduct a series of health science-law workshops
for judges and judicial educators; and develop a deskbook for judges on medical-legal issues arising in juvenile
and family cases. 
k. 

Improving the Courts' Response to Gender-Related Crimes of Violence.

 This category includes the development, testing, presentation, and dissemination of education programs for judges
and court personnel on: 
 The nature and incidence of stalking and gender-related crimes of violence (e.g., rape, sexual assault, spousal
abuse), and their impact on the victim and society; 
 Sentencing decision-making in cases involving gender-related crimes of violence; 
 The use of self-defense and provocation defenses by alleged victims of gender-related violence accused of
assaulting or killing their alleged abusers; and 
 The effective use and enforcement of protective orders and the implications of mutual orders of protection.

In previous funding cycles, the Institute supported a national conference on family violence and the courts, and
follow-up conferences in several States; development of a comprehensive curriculum on handling stranger and non-stranger
rape and sexual assault cases; evaluation of the effectiveness of court-ordered treatment for family violence offenders;
a demonstration of ways to improve court processing of injunctions for protection and a study of ways to improve the
effectiveness of civil protection orders for family violence victims; an examination of state-of-the-art court
practices for handling family violence cases and of ways to improve access to rural courts for victims of family violence;
and a manual for judges on the use of expert testimony regarding the battered woman syndrome. 
 
l. 

The Relationship Between State and Federal Courts.

 This category includes education, research, demonstration, and evaluation projects designed to facilitate appropriate
and effective communication, cooperation, and coordination between State and Federal courts. The Institute is
particularly interested in innovative education, evaluation, demonstration, technical assistance and research
projects that: 
i. Build upon the findings and recommendations gained at the Institute-supported National Conference on the Management
of Mass Tort Cases to be held in Cincinnati on November 10-13, 1994. Concept papers proposing projects addressing
these issues must be mailed by March 10, 1995. Concept papers following up on the Mass Tort Conference will be reviewed
by the Board of Directors at its April 1995 meeting. (A summary of the recommendations and findings from the conference
will be published in SJI NEWS in December, 1994.) 
ii. Develop and test curricula and other educational materials to: 
 Enhance the operation of State-Federal Judicial Councils; 
 Illustrate effective methods being used at the trial court, State and Circuit levels to coordinate cases and
administrative activities; and 
 Conduct regional conferences replicating the October, 1992 National Conference on State/Federal Judicial
Relationships. 
iii. Develop and test new approaches to: 
 Improve the fairness and pace of capital litigation by assigning special capital litigation law clerks to
assist trial judges hearing cases involving crimes punishable by death;

 Otherwise handle capital habeas corpus cases fairly and efficiently; 
 Coordinate related State and Federal criminal cases; 
 Coordinate cases that may be brought under the pending Violence Against Women Act; 
 Exchange information and coordinating calendars among State and Federal courts; and 
 Share jury pools, alternative dispute resolution programs, and court services. 

In previous funding cycles, the Institute has supported national and regional conferences on State-Federal judicial
relationships and the Chief Justices' Special Committee on Mass Tort Litigation. In addition, the Institute has
supported projects developing judicial impact statement procedures for national legislation affecting State
courts, and projects examining methods of State and Federal court cooperation; procedures for facilitating certification
of questions of law; the impact on the State courts of diversity cases and cases brought under section 1983; the procedures
used in Federal habeas corpus review of State court criminal cases; the factors that motivate litigants to select
Federal or State courts; and the mechanisms for transferring cases between Federal and State courts, as well as the
methods for effectively consolidating, deciding, and managing complex litigation. The Institute has also supported
a clearinghouse of information on State constitutional law decisions, educational programs for State judges on
coordination of Federal bankruptcy cases with State litigation, and a seminar examining the implications of the
``Federalization'' of crime. 


C. Single Jurisdiction Projects 


The Board will consider supporting a limited number of projects submitted by State or local courts that address the
needs of only the applicant State or local jurisdiction. It has established two categories of Single Jurisdiction
Projects: 


1. Programs Addressing a Critical Need of a Single State or Local Jurisdiction



a. 

Description of the Program. 

The Board will set aside up to $600,000 to support projects submitted by State or local courts that address the needs
of only the applicant State or local jurisdiction. A project under this section may address any of the topics included
in the Special Interest Categories or Statutory Program Areas, and may, but need not, seek to implement the findings
and recommendations of Institute supported research, evaluation, or demonstration programs. Concept papers for
single jurisdiction projects may be submitted by a State court system, an appellate court, or a limited or general
jurisdiction trial court. All awards under this category are subject to the matching requirements set forth in section
X.B.1. 
b. 

Application Procedures. 

Concept papers and applications requesting funds for projects under this section must meet the requirements of sections
VI. (``Concept Paper Submission Requirements for New Projects'') and VII. (``Application Requirements''), respectively,
and must demonstrate that: 
i. The proposed project is essential to meeting a critical need of the jurisdiction; and 








</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941006-2-00184 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941006-2-00113 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

ii. The need cannot be met solely with State and local resources within the foreseeable future. 


2. Technical Assistance Grants 


a. 

Description of the Program. 

The Board will set aside up to $600,000 of Fiscal Year 1995 funds (in addition to any technical assistance funds remaining
from Fiscal Year 1994) to support the provision of technical assistance to State and local courts. The exact amount
to be awarded for these grants will depend on the number and quality of the applications submitted in this category
and other categories of the Guideline. It is anticipated, however, that at least $150,000 will be available each quarter
to support Technical Assistance grants. The program is designed to provide State and local courts with sufficient
support to obtain technical assistance to diagnose a problem, develop a response to that problem, and initiate implementation
of any needed changes. 
Technical Assistance grants are limited to no more than $30,000 each, and may cover the cost of obtaining the services
of expert consultants, travel by a team of officials from one court to examine a practice, program or facility in another
jurisdiction that the applicant court is interested in replicating, or both. 
The technical assistance must be completed within 12 months after the start-date of the grant. Only State or local
courts may apply for Technical Assistance grants. As with other awards to State or local courts, cash or in-kind match
must be provided equal to at least 50% of the grant amount. Technical Assistance grant recipients also are subject
to the same quarterly reporting requirements as other Institute grantees. 
At the conclusion of the grant period, a Technical Assistance grant recipient must complete a Technical Assistance
Evaluation Form. The grantee also must submit to the Institute two copies of a final report that explains how it intends
to act on the consultant's recommendations as well as two copies of the consultant's written report. 
b. 

Review Criteria. 

Technical Assistance grants will be awarded on the basis of criteria including: Whether the assistance would address
a critical need of the court; the soundness of the technical assistance approach to the problem; the qualifications
of the consultant(s) to be hired, or the specific criteria that will be used to select the consultant(s); commitment
on the part of the court to act on the consultant's recommendations; and the reasonableness of the proposed budget.
The Institute will also consider factors such as the level and nature of the match that would be provided, diversity
of subject matter, geographic diversity, and the level of appropriations available to the Institute in the current
year and the amount expected to be available in succeeding fiscal years. 
c. 

Application Procedures. 

In lieu of concept papers and formal applications, applicants for Technical Assistance grants may submit, at any
time, an original and three copies of a detailed letter describing the proposed project and addressing the criteria
listed above. Letters from an individual trial or appellate court must be signed by the presiding judge or manager
of that court. Letters from the State court system must be signed by the Chief Justice or State Court Administrator.

Although there is no prescribed form for the letter nor a minimum or maximum page limit, letters of application should
include the following information to assure that each of the criteria is addressed: 
i. 

Need for Funding. 

What is the critical need facing the court? How will the proposed technical assistance help the court to meet this critical
need? Why cannot State or local resources fully support the costs of the required consultant services?

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941006-2-00185 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941006-2-00113 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

ii. 

Project Description. 

What tasks would the consultant be expected to perform? Who (organization or individual) would be hired to provide
the assistance and how was this consultant selected? If a consultant has not yet been identified, what procedures
and criteria would be used to select the consultant? (Applicants are expected to follow their jurisdiction's normal
procedures for procuring consultant services.) What is the time frame for completion of the technical assistance?
How would the court oversee the project and provide guidance to the consultant? 

If the consultant has been identified, a letter from that individual or organization documenting interest in and
availability for the project, as well as the consultant's ability to complete the assignment within the proposed
time period and for the proposed cost, should accompany the applicant's letter. The consultant must agree to submit
a detailed written report to the court and the Institute upon completion of the technical assistance. 

If the support or cooperation of agencies, funding bodies, organizations, or courts other than the applicant, would
be needed in order for the consultant to perform the required tasks, written assurances of such support or cooperation
must accompany the application letter. Support letters also may be submitted under separate cover; however, to ensure
that there is sufficient time to bring them to the attention of the Board's Technical Assistance Committee, letters
sent under separate cover must be received not less than two weeks prior to the Board meeting at which the technical
assistance requests will be considered (i.e., by November 4, 1994; February 17, 1995; April 28, 1995; and July 14,
1995). 

iii. 

Likelihood of implementation. 

What steps have been/will be taken to facilitate implementation of the consultant's recommendations upon completion
of the technical assistance? For example, if the support or cooperation of other agencies, funding bodies, organizations,
or a court other than the applicant will be needed to adopt the changes recommended by the consultant and approved by
the court, how will they be involved in the review of the recommendations and development of the implementation plan?


iv. 

Budget and matching State contribution. 

A completed Form E, ``Preliminary Budget'' (see Appendix IV to the Grant Guideline), must be included with the applicant's
letter requesting technical assistance. Please note that the estimated cost of the technical assistance services
should be broken down into the categories listed on the budget form rather than aggregated under the Consultant/Contractual
category. In addition, the budget should provide for submission of three copies of the consultant's final report
to the Institute. 

v. 

Support for the project from the State supreme court or its designated agency or council. 

Written concurrence on the need for the technical assistance must be submitted. This concurrence may be a copy of SJI
Form B (see Appendix V.) signed by the Chief Justice of the State Supreme Court or the Chief Justice's designee, or a
letter from the State Chief Justice or designee. The concurrence may be submitted with the applicant's letter or under
separate cover prior to consideration of the application. The concurrence also must specify whether the State Supreme
Court would receive, administer, and account for the grant funds, if awarded, or would designate the local court or
a specified agency or council to receive the funds directly. 

Letters of application may be submitted at any time; however, all of the letters received during a calendar quarter
will be considered at one time. Applicants submitting letters between October 1, 1994, and January 15, 1995, will
be notified of the Board's decision by March 31, 1995; those submitting letters between January 16, and March 15, 1995,
will be notified by May 31, 1995. Notification of the Board's decisions concerning letters received between March
16 and June 15, 1995, will be made by August 31, 1995; and applicants submitting letters between June 16 and September
29, 1995, will be notified by November 30, 1995. The Board has delegated its authority to approve these grants to its
Technical Assistance Committee. 

The Technical Assistance grant program described in this section should not be confused with the Judicial Education
Technical Assistance projects described in Section II.B.2.b.iii.

III. Definitions 



The following definitions apply for the purposes of this guideline: 



A. Institute 



The State Justice Institute. 



B. State Supreme Court 



The highest appellate court in a State, unless, for the purposes of the Institute program, a constitutionally or legislatively
established judicial council that acts in place of that court. In States having more than one court with final appellate
authority, State Supreme Court shall mean that court which also has administrative responsibility for the State's
judicial system. State Supreme Court also includes the office of the court or council, if any, it designates to perform
the functions described in this guideline. 



C. Designated Agency or Council 



The office or judicial body which is authorized under State law or by delegation from the State Supreme Court to approve
applications for funds and to receive, administer, and be accountable for those funds. 



D. Grantee 



The organization, entity, or individual to which an award of Institute funds is made. For a grant based on an application
from a State or local court, grantee refers to the State Supreme Court or its designee. 



E. Subgrantee 



A State or local court which receives Institute funds through the State Supreme Court. 



F. Match 



The portion of project costs not borne by the Institute. Match includes both in-kind and cash contributions. Cash
match is the direct outlay of funds by the grantee to support the project. In-kind match consists of contributions
of time, services, space, supplies, etc., made to the project by the grantee or others (e.g., advisory board members)
working directly on the project. Under normal circumstances, allowable match may be incurred only during the project
period. When appropriate, and with the prior written permission of the Institute, match may be incurred from the date
of the Institute Board of Directors' approval of an award. Match does not include project-related income such as tuition
or revenue from the sale of grant products, or the time of participants attending an education program. Amounts contributed
as cash or in-kind match may not be recovered through the sale of grant products during or following the grant period.




G. Continuation Grant 



A grant of no more than 24 months to permit completion of activities initiated under an existing Institute grant or
enhancement of the programs or services produced or established during the prior grant period. 



H. On-going Support Grant 



A grant of up to 36 months to support a project that is national in scope and that provides the State courts with services,
programs or products for which there is a continuing important need.

I. Package Grant 


A single grant that supports two or more closely-related projects which logically should be viewed as a whole or would
require substantial duplication of effort if administered separately. Closely-related projects may include those
addressing interrelated topics, or those requiring the services of all or some of the same key staff persons, or the
core elements of a multifaceted program. Each of the components of a package grant must operate within the same project
period. 


J. Human Subjects 


Individuals who are participants in an experimental procedure or who are asked to provide information about themselves,
their attitudes, feelings, opinions and/or experiences through an interview, questionnaire, or other data collection
technique(s). 


K. Curriculum 


The materials needed to replicate an education or training program developed with grant funds including, but not
limited to: The learning objectives; the presentation methods; a sample agenda or schedule; an outline of presentations
and other instructors' notes; copies of overhead transparencies or other visual aids; exercises, case studies,
hypotheticals, quizzes and other materials for involving the participants; background materials for participants;
evaluation forms; and suggestions for replicating the program including possible faculty or the preferred qualifications
or experience of those selected as faculty. 


L. Products 


Tangible materials resulting from funded projects including, but not limited to: Curricula; monographs; reports;
books; articles; manuals; handbooks; benchbooks; guidelines; videotapes; audiotapes; and computer software.



IV. Eligibility for Award 


In awarding funds to accomplish these objectives and purposes, the Institute has been authorized by Congress to award
grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts to State and local courts and their agencies (42 U.S.C. 10705(b)(1)(A));
national nonprofit organizations controlled by, operating in conjunction with, and serving the judicial branches
of State governments (42 U.S.C. 10705 (b)(1)(B)); and national nonprofit organizations for the education and training
of judges and support personnel of the judicial branch of State governments (42 U.S.C. 10705(b)(1)(C)). 
An applicant will be considered a national education and training applicant under section 10705(b)(1)(C) if: (1)
the principal purpose or activity of the applicant is to provide education and training to State and local judges and
court personnel; and (2) the applicant demonstrates a record of substantial experience in the field of judicial education
and training. 
The Institute also is authorized to make awards to other nonprofit organizations with expertise in judicial administration,
institutions of higher education, individuals, partnerships, firms, corporations, and private agencies with
expertise in judicial administration, provided that the objectives of the relevant program area(s) can be served
better. In making this judgment, the Institute will consider the likely replicability of the projects' methodology
and results in other jurisdictions. For-profit organizations are also eligible for grants and cooperative agreements;
however, they must waive their fees. 
The Institute may also make awards to Federal, State or local agencies and institutions other than courts for services
that cannot be adequately provided through nongovernmental arrangements. 
Finally, the Institute may enter into inter-agency agreements with other public or private funders to support projects
consistent with the purpose of the State Justice Institute Act. 

Each application for funding from a State or local court must be approved, consistent with State law, by the State's
Supreme Court or its designated agency or council. The latter shall receive all Institute funds awarded to such courts
and be responsible for assuring proper administration of Institute funds, in accordance with section XI.B.2. of
this Guideline. A list of persons to contact in each State regarding approval of applications from State and local
courts and administration of Institute grants to those courts is contained in Appendix I.

V. Types of Projects and Grants; Size of Awards 


A. Types of Projects 


Except as expressly provided in section II.B.2.b. and II.C. above, the Institute has placed no limitation on the overall
number of awards or the number of awards in each special interest category. The general types of projects are: 

1. Education and training; 
2. Research and evaluation; 
3. Demonstration; and 
4. Technical assistance. 


B. Types of Grants 


The Institute has established the following types of grants: 
1. New grants (See sections VI. and VII.). 
2. Continuation grants (See sections III.H. and IX.A). 
3. On-going Support grants (See sections III.I. and IX.B.).

successive fiscal years beginning with the fiscal year of the award. When funds to support the full amount of an on-going
support grant are not awarded from the appropriations for the fiscal year of award, funds to support any subsequent
years of the grant will be made available upon (1) the satisfactory performance of the project as reflected in the quarterly
Progress Reports required to be filed and grant monitoring, and (2) the availability of appropriations for that fiscal
year. 
3. An application for a package grant may request funding in an amount up to a total of $750,000 per year. 
4. Applications for technical assistance grants may request funding in amounts up to $30,000. 
5. Applications for curriculum adaptation grants may request funding in amounts up to $20,000.

VI. Concept Paper Submission Requirements for new Projects
 


Concept papers are an extremely important part of the application process because they enable the Institute to learn
the program areas of primary interest to the courts and to explore innovative ideas, without imposing heavy burdens
on prospective applicants. The use of concept papers also permits the Institute to better project the nature and amount
of grant awards. This requirement and the submission deadlines for concept papers and applications may be waived
for good cause (e.g., the proposed project would provide a significant benefit to the State courts or the opportunity
to conduct the project did not arise until after the deadline). 



A. Format and Content 



All concept papers must include a cover sheet, a program narrative, and a preliminary budget, regardless of whether
the applicant is proposing a single project or a ``package of projects,'' or whether the applicant is requesting accelerated
award of a grant of less than $40,000. 



1. The Cover Sheet 



The cover sheet for all concept papers must contain: 

a. A title describing the proposed project; 

b. The name and address of the court, organization or individual submitting the paper; 

c. The name, title, address (if different from that in b.), and telephone number of a contact person(s) who can provide
further information about the paper; 

d. The letter of the Special Interest Category (see section II.B.2.) or the number of the statutory Program Area (see
section II.B.1.) that the proposed project addresses most directly; and 

e. The estimated length of the proposed project. 

Applicants requesting the Board to waive the application requirement and approve a grant of less than $40,000 based
on the concept paper, should add APPLICATION WAIVER REQUESTED to the information on the cover page. 



2. The Program Narrative 



a.

 Concept Papers Proposing a Single Project

. The program narrative of a concept paper describing a single project should be no longer than necessary, but 

in no case should exceed eight (8) double-spaced pages on 81/2 by 11 inch paper. Margins must not be less than 1 inch and
type no smaller than 12 point and 12 cpi must be used. 

The narrative should describe: 

i. 

Why this project is needed and how it will benefit State courts? 

If the project is to be conducted in a specific location(s), applicants should discuss the particular needs of the
project site(s) to be addressed by the project, why those needs are not being met through the use of existing materials,
programs, procedures, services or other resources, and the benefits that would be realized by the proposed sites(s).


If the project is not site specific, applicants should discuss the problems that the proposed project will address,
why existing materials, programs, procedures, services or other resources do not adequately resolve those problems,
and the benefits that would be realized from the project by State courts generally. 

ii. 

What will be done if a grant is awarded? 

A summary description of the project to be conducted and the approach to be taken, including the anticipated length
of the grant period. Applicants requesting a waiver of the application requirement for a grant of less than $40,000
should explain the proposed methods for conducting the project as fully as space allows. 

iii. 

How the effects and quality of the project will be determined? 

A summary description of how the project will be evaluated, including the evaluation criteria. 

iv. 

How others will find out about the project and be 
able to use the results? 

A description of the products that will result, the degree to which they will be applicable to courts across the nation,
and the manner in which the products and results of the project will be disseminated. 

b. 

Concept Papers Requesting a Package Grant Covering More Than One Project. 

The program narrative of a concept paper requesting a package grant (see definition in section III.I.) should be no
longer than necessary, but in no case should exceed 15 double-spaced pages on 81/2 by 11 inch paper. Margins must not
be less than 1 inch, and type no smaller than 12-point and 12 cpi must be used. 

In addition to addressing the issues listed in paragraph VI.A.2.a., the program narrative of a package grant concept
paper must describe briefly each component project, as well as how its inclusion enhances the entire package; and
explain: 

i. How are the proposed projects related? 

ii. How would their operation and administration be enhanced if they were funded as a package rather than as individual
projects; and 

iii. What disadvantages, if any, would accrue by considering or funding them separately. 



3. The Budget 



a. 

Concept Papers Proposing a Single Project. 

A preliminary budget must be attached to the narrative that includes the estimates and information specified on Form
E included in Appendix IV of this Guideline.

<PARENT> FR941006-2-00113 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

b. 

Concept Papers Requesting a Package Grant Covering More Than One Project


A separate preliminary budget for each component project of the package, as well as a combined budget that reflects
the costs of the entire package, must be attached to the narrative. Each project budget must be identified by the title
that corresponds to the narrative description of the project in the program narrative and a letter of the alphabet
(i.e. A, B, C). Each of these budgets must include the estimates and information specified on Form E included in Appendix
IV of this Guideline. 


c. Concept Papers Requesting Accelerated Award of a Grant of Less than $40,000


Applicants requesting a waiver of the application requirement and approval of a grant based on a concept paper under
section VI.C., must attach to Form E (see Appendix IV) a budget narrative explaining the basis for each of the items
listed, and whether the costs would be paid from grant funds or through a matching contribution or other sources. The
budget narrative is not counted against the eight-page limit for the program narrative. 

4. The Institute encourages concept paper applicants to attach letters of cooperation and support from the courts
and related agencies that will be involved in or directly affected by the proposed project. Letters of support also
may be sent under separate cover. How-ever, in order to ensure that there is sufficient time to bring them to the Board's
attention, support letters sent under separate cover must be received no later than January 13, 1995. 

5. The Institute will not accept concept papers with program narratives exceeding the limits set in sections VI.A.2.a.
and b. The page limit does not include the cover page, budget form, the budget narrative if required under section VI.A.3.c.,
and any letters of cooperation or endorsements. Additional material should not be attached unless it is essential
to impart a clear understanding of the project. 

6. Applicants submitting more than one concept paper may include material that would be identical in each concept
paper in a cover letter, and incorporate that material by reference in each paper. The incorporated material will
be counted against the eight-page limit for each paper. A copy of the cover letter should be attached to each copy of
each concept paper. 

7. Sample concept papers from previous funding cycles are available from the Institute upon request. 


B. Selection Criteria.








1. All concept papers will be evaluated by the staff on the basis of the following criteria: 
a. The demonstration of need for the project; 
b. The soundness and innovativeness of the approach described; 
c. The benefits to be derived from the project; 
d. The reasonableness of the proposed budget; 
e. The proposed project's relationship to one of the ``Special Interest'' categories set forth in section II.B; and


f. The degree to which the findings, procedures, 
training, technology, or other results of the project can be transferred to other jurisdictions. 
2. ``Single jurisdiction'' concept papers submitted pursuant to section II.C. will be rated on the proposed project's
relation to one of the ``Special Interest'' categories set forth in section II.B., and on the special requirements
listed in section II.C.1. 
3. In determining which concept papers will be selected for development into full applications, the Institute will
also consider the availability of financial assistance from other sources for the project; the amount and nature
(cash or in-kind) of the applicant's anticipated match; whether the applicant is a State court, a national court support
or education organi-zation, a non-court unit of government, or another type of entity eligible to receive grants
under the Institute's enabling legislation (see 42 U.S.C. 10705(b) (as amended) and section IV above); the extent
to which the proposed project would also benefit the Federal courts or help the State courts enforce Federal constitutional
and legislative requirements, and the level of appropriations available to the Institute in the current year and
the amount expected to be available in succeeding fiscal years. 


C. Review Process 


Concept papers will be reviewed competitively by the Board of Directors. Institute staff will prepare a narrative
summary and a rating sheet assigning points for each relevant selection criterion for those concept papers which
fall within the scope of the Institute's funding program and merit serious consideration by the Board. Staff will
also prepare a list of those papers that, in the judgment of the Executive Director, propose projects that lie outside
the scope of the Institute's funding program or are not likely to merit serious consideration by the Board. The narrative
summaries, rating sheets, and list of non-reviewed papers will be presented to the Board for their review. Committees
of the Board will review concept paper summaries within assigned program areas and prepare recommendations for the
full Board. The full Board of Directors will then decide which concept paper applicants should be invited to submit
formal applications for funding. 
The decision to invite an application is solely that of the Board of Directors. With regard to concept papers requesting
a package grant, the Board retains discretion to invite an application including all, none, or selected portions
of the package for possible funding. 

The Board may waive the application requirement and approve a grant based on a concept paper for a project requiring
less than $40,000, when the need for and benefits of the project are clear, and the methodology and budget require little
additional explanation.

D. Submission Requirements 



An original and three copies of all concept papers submitted for consideration in Fiscal Year 1995 must be sent by first
class or overnight mail or by courier no later than November 23, 1994, except for concept papers proposing projects
that follow-up on the National Conference on the Managment of Mass Tort Cases which must be sent by March 10, 1995 (see
section II.B.2.l.), and concept papers proposing to implement an action plan developed during the National Conference
on Eliminating Race and Ethnic Bias in the Courts which must be sent by October 6, 1995 (see section II.B.2.i.). A postmark
or courier receipt will constitute evidence of the submission date. All envelopes containing concept papers should
be marked CONCEPT PAPER and should be sent to: State Justice Institute, 1650 King Street, Suite 600, Alexandria, Virginia
22314. 

It is preferable for letters of cooperation and support to be appended to the concept paper when it is submitted. If
support letters are sent under separate cover, they must be received no later than January 13, 1995 in order to ensure
that there is sufficient time to bring them to the Board's attention. 

The Institute will send written notice to all persons submitting concept papers of the Board's decisions regarding
their papers and of the key issues and questions that arose during the review process. A decision by the Board not to
invite an application may not be appealed, but does not prohibit resubmission of the concept paper or a revision thereof
in a subsequent round of funding. The Institute will also notify the designated State contact listed in the Appendix
when the Board invites applications that are based on concept papers which are submitted by courts within their State
or which specify a participating site within their State. 

Receipt of each concept paper will be acknowledged in writing. Extensions of the deadline for submission of concept
papers will not be granted. 



VII. Application Requirements for New Projects 



Except as specified in section VI., a formal application for a new project is to be submitted only upon invitation of
the Board following review of a concept paper. An application for Institute funding support must include an application
form; budget forms (with appropriate documentation); a project abstract and program narrative; a disclosure of
lobbying form, when applicable; and certain certifications and assurances. These documents are described below.




A. Forms 



1. Application Form (FORM A) 



The application form requests basic information regarding the proposed project, the applicant, and the total amount
of funding support requested from the Institute. It also requires the signature of an individual authorized to certify
on behalf of the applicant that the information contained in the application is true and complete, that submission
of the application has been authorized by the applicant, and that if funding for the proposed project is approved,
the applicant will comply with the requirements and conditions of the award, including the assurances set forth in
Form D.

<PARENT> FR941006-2-00113 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

2. Certificate of State Approval (FORM B) 



An application from a State or local court must include a copy of FORM B signed by the State's Chief Justice or Chief Judge,
the director of the designated agency, or the head of the designated council. The signature denotes that the proposed
project has been approved by the State's highest court or the agency or council it has designated. It denotes further
that if funding for the project is approved by the Institute, the court or the specified designee will receive, administer,
and be accountable for the awarded funds. 



3. Budget Forms (FORM C or C1) 



Applicants may submit the proposed project budget either in the tabular format of FORM C or in the spreadsheet format
of FORM C1. Applicants requesting more than $100,000 are strongly encouraged to use the spread-sheet format. If the
proposed project period is for more than a year, a separate form should be submitted for each year or portion of a year
for which grant support is requested. 

In addition to FORM C or C1, applicants must provide a detailed budget narrative providing an explanation of the basis
for the estimates in each budget category. (See section VII.D.) 

Applications for a package grant must include a separate budget and budget narrative for each project included in
the proposed package, as well as a combined budget that reflects the total costs of the entire package. 

If funds from other sources are required to conduct the project, either as match or to support other aspects of the project,
the source, current status of the request, and anticipated decision date must be provided. 



4. Assurances (FORM D) 



This form lists the statutory, regulatory, and policy requirements and conditions with which recipients of Institute
funds must comply. 



5. Disclosure of Lobbying Activities 



This form requires applicants other than units of State or local government to disclose whether they, or another entity
that is part of the same organization as the applicant, have advocated a position before Congress on any issue, and
to identify the specific subjects of their lobbying efforts. (See section X.D.) 



B. Project Abstract 



The abstract should highlight the purposes, goals, methods and anticipated benefits of the proposed project. It
should not exceed one single-spaced page on 8-1/2 by 11 inch paper. 



C. Program Narrative 



The program narrative for an application proposing a single project should not exceed 25 double-spaced pages on 8-1/2
by 11 inch paper. The program narrative for an application requesting a package grant for more than one project should
not exceed 40 double-spaced pages on 8-1/2 by 11 inch paper. Margins must not be less than 1 inch, and type no smaller
than 12-point and 12 cpi must be used.

 The page limit does not include the forms, the abstract, the budget narrative, and any appendices containing resumes
and letters of cooperation or endorsement. Additional background material should be attached only if it is essential
to obtaining a clear understanding of the proposed project. Numerous and lengthy appendices are strongly discouraged.


The program narrative should address the following topics: 



1. Project Objectives 



A clear, concise statement of what the proposed project is intended to accomplish. In stating the objectives of the
project, applicants should focus on the overall programmatic objective (e.g., to enhance understanding and skills
regarding a specific subject, or to determine how a certain procedure affects the court and litigants) rather than
on operational objectives (e.g., provide training for 32 judges and court managers, or review data from 300 cases).




2. Program Areas to be Covered 



A statement which lists the program areas set forth in the State Justice Institute Act, and, if appropriate, the Institute's
Special Interest program categories that are addressed by the proposed projects.

<TEXT>
 

3. Need for the Project 


If the project is to be conducted in a specific location(s), a discussion of the particular needs of the project site(s)
to be addressed by the project and why those needs are not being met through the use of existing materials, programs,
procedures, services or other resources. 
If the project is not site specific, a discussion of the problems that the proposed project will address, and why existing
materials, programs, procedures, services or other resources do not adequately resolve those problems. The discussion
should include specific references to the relevant literature and to the experience in the field. 
An application requesting a package grant to support more than one project also must describe how the proposed projects
in the package are related; how their operation and administration would be enhanced if they were funded as a package
rather than as individual projects; and what disadvantages, if any, would accrue by considering or funding them separately.



4. Tasks, Methods and Evaluation 


a. 

Tasks and Methods.

 A delineation of the tasks to be performed in achieving the project objectives and the methods to be used for accomplishing
each task. For example: 
i. 

For research and evaluation projects,

 the data sources, data collection strategies, variables to be examined, and analytic procedures to be used for conducting
the research or evaluation and ensuring the validity and general applicability of the results. For projects involving
human subjects, the discussion of methods should address the procedures for obtaining respondents' informed consent,
ensuring the respondents' privacy and freedom from risk or harm, and the protection of others who are not the subjects
of research but would be affected by the research. If the potential exists for risk or harm to the human subjects, a discussion
should be included of the value of the proposed research and the methods to be used to minimize or eliminate such risk.

ii. 

For education and training projects,

 the adult education techniques to be used in designing and presenting the program, including the teaching/learning
objectives of the educational design, the teaching methods to be used, and the opportunities for structured interaction
among the participants; how faculty will be recruited, selected, and trained; the proposed number and length of the
conferences, courses, seminars or workshops to be conducted; the materials to be provided and how they will be developed;
and the cost to participants. 
iii. 

For demonstration projects,

 the demonstration sites and the reasons they were selected, or if the sites have not been chosen, how they will be identified
and their cooperation obtained; how the program or procedures will be implemented and monitored. 
iv. 

For technical assistance projects,

 the types of assistance that will be provided; the particular issues and problems for which assistance will be provided;
how requests will be obtained and the type of assistance determined; how suitable providers will be selected and briefed;
how reports will be reviewed; and the cost to recipients.

<DOCNO> FR941006-2-00194 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941006-2-00113 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

An application requesting a package grant for more than one project must describe separately the tasks associated
with each project in the proposed package. Each project must be identified by a separate letter of the alphabet (i.e.,
A, B, C) and a descriptive title. 
b. 

Evaluation.

 Every project design must include an evaluation plan to determine whether the project met its objectives. The evaluation
should be designed to provide an objective and independent assessment of the effectiveness or usefulness of the training
or services provided; the impact of the procedures, technology or services tested; or the validity and applicability
of the research conducted. In addition, where appropriate, the evaluation process should be designed to provide
ongoing or periodic feedback on the effectiveness or utility of particular programs, educational offerings, or
achievements which can then be further refined as a result of the evaluation process. The plan should present the qualifications
of the evaluator(s); describe the criteria, related to the project's programmatic objectives, that will be used
to evaluate the project's effectiveness; explain how the evaluation will be conducted, including the specific data
collection and analysis techniques to be used; discuss why this approach is appropriate; and present a schedule for
completion of the evaluation within the proposed project period. 
The evaluation plan should be appropriate to the type of project proposed. For example: 
i. An evaluation approach suited to many 

research

 projects is a review by an advisory panel of the research methodology, data collection instruments, preliminary
analyses, and products as they are drafted. The panel should be comprised of independent researchers and practitioners
representing the perspectives affected by the proposed project. 

ii. The most valuable approaches to evaluating 

educational or training

 programs will serve to reinforce the participants' learning experience while providing useful feedback on the impact
of the program and possible areas for improvement. One appropriate evaluation approach is to assess the acquisition
of new knowledge, skills, attitudes or understanding through participant feedback on the seminar or training event.
Such feedback might include a self-assessment on what was learned along with the participant's response to the quality
and effectiveness of faculty presentations, the format of sessions, the value or usefulness of the material presented
and other relevant factors. Another appropriate approach would be to use an independent observer who might request
verbal as well as written responses from participants in the program. When an education project involves the development
of curricular materials an advisory panel of relevant experts can be coupled with a test of the curriculum to obtain
the reactions of participants and faculty as indicated above. 
iii. The evaluation plan for a 

demonstration

 project should encompass an assessment of program effectiveness (e.g., how well did it work?); user satisfaction,
if appropriate; the cost-effectiveness of the program; a process analysis of the program (e.g., was the program implemented
as designed? did it provide the services intended to the targeted population?); the impact of the program (e.g., what
effect did the program have on the court? what benefits resulted from the program?); and the replicability of the program
or components of the program.

iv. For 

technical assistance 

projects, applicants should explain how the quality, timeliness, and impact of the assistance provided will be determined,
and should develop a mechanism for feedback from both the users and providers of the technical assistance. 
v. Evaluation plans involving 

human subjects 

should include a discussion of the procedures for obtaining respondents' informed consent, ensuring the respondents'
privacy and freedom from risk or harm, and the protection of others who are not the subjects of evaluation but would
be affected by it. Other than the provision of confidentiality to respondents, human subjects protection issues
ordinarily are not applicable to participants evaluating an education program. 
vi. The evaluation plan in a package grant application should address the issues listed above for the particular types
of projects included in the package, assessing the strengths and weaknesses of the individual components as well
as the benefits and limitations of the projects as a package. 



5. Project Management 



A detailed management plan including the starting and completion date for each task; the time commitments to the project
of key staff and their responsibilities regarding each project task; and the procedures that will be used to ensure
that all tasks are performed on time, within budget, and at the highest level of quality. In preparing the project time
line, Gantt Chart, or schedule, applicants should make certain that all project activities, including publication
or reproduction of project products and their initial dissemination will occur within the proposed project period.
The management plan must also provide for the submission of Quarterly Progress and Financial Reports within 30 days
after the close of each calendar quarter (i.e., no later than January 30, April 30, July 30, and October 30). 


Package grant applications must include a management plan for each project included in the package with the same project
title and alphabetic identifier describing the project in the program narrative, as well as a plan embracing the package
as a whole. 



6. Products 




A description of the products to be developed by the project (e.g., training curricula and materials, videotapes,
articles, manuals, or handbooks), including when they will be submitted to the Institute. The application must explain
how and to whom the products will be disseminated; describe how they will benefit the State courts including how they
can be used by judges and court personnel; identify development, production, and dissemination costs covered by
the project budget; and present the basis on which products and services developed or provided under the grant will
be offered to the courts community and the public at large (i.e. whether products will be distributed at no cost to recipients,
or if costs are involved, the reason for charging recipients and the estimated price of the product). Ordinarily,
applicants should schedule all product preparation and distribution activities within the project period. Applicants
also must submit a one-page abstract summarizing products resulting from a project for inclusion on the Institute's
electronic bulletin board, and a diskette of the abstract in ASCII.

<DOCNO> FR941006-2-00196 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941006-2-00113 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Package grant applications must discuss these issues with regard to the products that would result from each of the
projects included in the package. 


The type of products to be prepared depend on the nature of the project. For example, in most instances, the products
of a research, evaluation, or demonstration project should include an article summarizing the project findings
that is publishable in a journal serving the courts community nationally, an executive summary that will be disseminated
to the project's primary audience, or both. Applicants proposing to conduct empirical research or evaluation projects
with national import should describe how they will make their data available for secondary analysis after the grant
period. (See section X.W.) 


The curricula and other products developed by education and training projects should be designed for use outside
the classroom so that they may be used again by original participants and others in the course of their duties. 


Applicants must provide for submitting a final draft of the final grant product(s) to the Institute for review and
approval at least 30 days before the product(s) are submitted for publication or reproduction. No grant funds may
be obligated for publication or reproduction of a final grant product without the written approval of the Institute.




Applicants must also provide for including in all project products a prominent acknowledgment that support was received
from the Institute and a disclaimer paragraph based on the example provided in section X.Q. of the Guideline. The ``SJI''
logo must appear on the front cover of a written product, or in the opening frames of a video product, unless the Institute
approves another placement. 



Twenty copies of all project products, including videotapes, must be submitted to the Institute. In addition, a copy
of each product must be sent to the library established in each State to collect the materials developed with Institute
support. (A list of these libraries is contained in Appendix II.) To facilitate their use, all videotaped products
should be distributed in VHS format. 




7. Applicant Status 



An applicant that is not a State or local court and has not received a grant from the Institute within the past two years
should include a statement indicating whether it is either a national non-profit organization controlled by, operating
in conjunction with, and serving the judicial branches of State governments; or a national non-profit organization
for the education and training of State court judges and support personnel. See section IV. If the applicant is a non-judicial
unit of Federal, State, or local government, it must explain whether the proposed services could be adequately provided
by non-governmental entities. 




8. Staff Capability 




A summary of the training and experience of the key staff members and consultants that qualify them for conducting
and managing the proposed project. Resumes of identified staff should be attached to the application. If one or more
key staff members and consultants are not known at the time of the application, a description of the criteria that will
be used to select persons for these positions should be included. 




9. Organizational Capacity 





</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941006-2-00197 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941006-2-00113 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Applicants that have not received a grant from the Institute within the past two years should include a statement describing
the capacity of the applicant to administer grant funds including the financial systems used to monitor project expenditures
(and income, if any), and a summary of the applicant's past experience in administering grants, as well as any resources
or capabilities that the applicant has that will particularly assist in the successful completion of the project.

If the applicant is a non-profit organization (other than a university), it must also provide documentation of its
501(c) tax exempt status as determined by the Internal Revenue Service and a copy of a current certified audit report.
For purposes of this requirement, ``current'' means no earlier than two years prior to the current calendar year.
If a current audit report is not available, the Institute will require the organization to complete a financial capability
questionnaire which must be signed by a Certified Public Accountant. Other applicants may be required to provide
a current audit report, a financial capability questionnaire, or both, if specifically requested to do so by the Institute.


Unless requested otherwise, an applicant that has received a grant from the Institute within the past two years should
describe only the changes in its organizational capacity, tax status, or financial capability that may affect its
capacity to administer a grant. 


10. Statement of Lobbying Activities 


Non-governmental applicants must submit the Institute's Disclosure of Lobbying Activities Form that requires
them to state whether they, or another entity that is a part of the same organization as the applicant, have advocated
a position before Congress on any issue, and identifies the specific subjects of their lobbying efforts. 


11. Letters of Support for the Project 


If the cooperation of courts, organizations, agencies, or individuals other than the applicant is required to conduct
the project, written assurances of cooperation and availability should be attached as an appendix to the application,
or they may be sent under separate cover. In order to ensure that there is sufficient time to bring them to the Board's
attention, letters of support sent under separate cover must be received at least four weeks before the meeting of
the Board of Directors at which the application will be considered (i.e., no later than October 17, 1994, February
1, 1995, March 31, 1995, June 23, 1995, or August 18, 1995, respectively). 



D. Budget Narrative 


The budget narrative should provide the basis for the computation of all project-related costs. An application for
a package grant for more than one project must include a separate budget narrative for each project component, with
the same alphabetic identifier and project title used to describe each component project in the program narrative.
Additional background or schedules may be attached if they are essential to obtaining a clear understanding of the
proposed budget. Numerous and lengthy appendices are strongly discouraged. 
The budget narrative should cover the costs of all components of the project and clearly identify costs attributable
to the project evaluation. Under OMB grant guidelines incorporated by reference in this Guideline, grant funds may
not be used to pay for coffee breaks during seminars or meetings, or to purchase alcoholic beverages.

1. Justification of Personnel Compensation 


The applicant should set forth the percentages of time to be devoted by the individuals who will serve as the staff of
the proposed project, the annual salary of each of those persons, and the number of work days per year used for calculating
the percentages of time or daily rate of those individuals. The applicant should explain any deviations from current
rates or established written organization policies. If grant funds are requested to pay the salary and related costs
for a current employee of a court or other unit of government, the applicant should explain why this would not constitute
a supplantation of State or local funds in violation of 42 U.S.C. 10706 (d)(1). An acceptable explanation may be that
the position to be filled is a new one established in conjunction with the project or that the grant funds will be supporting
only the portion of the employee's time that will be dedicated to new or additional duties related to the project. 


2. Fringe Benefit Computation 


The applicant should provide a description of the fringe benefits provided to employees. If percentages are used,
the authority for such use should be presented as well as a description of the elements included in the determination
of the percentage rate. 


3. Consultant/Contractual Services and Honoraria 


The applicant should describe the tasks each consultant will perform, the estimated total amount to be paid to each
consultant, the basis for compensation rates (e.g., number of days x the daily consultant rates), and the method for
selection. Rates for consultant services must be set in accordance with section XI.H.2.c. Honorarium payments must
be justified in the same manner as other consultant payments. 


4. Travel 


Transportation costs and per diem rates must comply with the policies of the applicant organization. If the applicant
does not have an established travel policy, then travel rates shall be consistent with those established by the Institute
or the Federal Government. (A copy of the Institute's travel policy is available upon request.) The budget narrative
should include an explanation of the rate used, including the components of the per diem rate and the basis for the estimated
transportation expenses. The purpose for travel should also be included in the narrative. 


5. Equipment 


Grant funds many be used to purchase only the equipment that is necessary to demonstrate a new technological application
in a court, or that is otherwise essential to accomplishing the objectives of the project. Equipment purchases to
support basic court operations ordinarily will not be approved. The applicant should describe the equipment to be
purchased or leased and explain why the acquisition of that equipment is essential to accomplish the project's goals
and objectives. The narrative should clearly identify which equipment is to be leased and which is to be purchased.
The method of procurement should also be described. Purchases for automatic data processing equipment must comply
with section XI.H.2.b. 


6. Supplies 


The applicant should provide a general description of the supplies necessary to accomplish the goals and objectives
of the grant. In addition, the applicant should provide the basis for the amount requested for this expenditure category.



7. Construction 


Construction expenses are prohibited except for the limited purposes set forth in section X.H.2. Any allowable construction
or renovation expense should be described in detail in the budget narrative. 


8. Telephone 


Applicants should include anticipated telephone charges, distinguishing between monthly charges and long distance
charges in the budget narrative. Also, applicants should provide the basis used in developing the monthly and long
distance estimates. 


9. Postage 


Anticipated postage costs for project-related mailings should be described in the budget narrative. The cost of
special mailings, such as for a survey or for announcing a workshop, should be distinguished from routine operational
mailing costs. The bases for all postage estimates should be included in the justification material. 


10. Printing/Photocopying 


Anticipated costs for printing or photocopying should be included in the budget narrative. Applicants should provide
the details underlying these estimates in support of the request. 


11. Indirect Costs 


Applicants should describe the indirect cost rates applicable to the grant in detail. If costs often included within
an indirect cost rate are charged directly (e.g., a percentage of the time of senior managers to supervise product
activities), the applicant should specify that these costs are not included within their approved indirect cost
rate. These rates must be established in accordance with section XI.H.4. If the applicant has an indirect cost rate
or allocation plan approved by any Federal granting agency, a copy of the approved rate agreement should be attached
to the application.

The applicant should describe the source of any matching contribution and the nature of the match provided. Any additional
contributions to the project should be described in this section of the budget narrative as well. If in-kind match
is to be provided, the applicant should describe how the amount and value of the time, services or materials actually
contributed will be documented sufficiently clearly to permit them to be included in an audit of the grant. Applicants
should be aware that the time spent by participants in education courses does not qualify as in-kind match. (Samples
of forms used by current grantees to track in-kind match are available from the Institute upon request.) 
Applicants that do not contemplate making matching contributions continuously throughout the course of the project
or on a task-by-task basis must provide a schedule within 30 days after the beginning of the project period indicating
at what points during the project period the matching contributions will be made. (See sections III.F., VIII.B.,
X.B. and XI.D.1.) 


E. Submission Requirements 


1. An application package containing the application, an original signature on FORM A (and on FORM B, if the application
is from a State or local court, or on the Disclosure of Lobbying Form if the applicant is not a unit of State or local government),
and four photo-copies of the application package must be sent by first class or overnight mail, or by courier no later
than May 10, 1995. A postmark or courier receipt will constitute evidence of the submission date. Please mark APPLICATION
on all application package envelopes and send to: State Justice Institute, 1650 King Street, Suite 600, Alexandria,
Virginia 22314.
Receipt of each proposal will be acknowledged in writing. Extensions of the deadline for receipt of applications
will not be granted. 
2. Applicants invited to submit more than one application may include material that would be identical in each application
in a cover letter, and incorporate that material by reference in each application. The incorporated material will
be counted against the 25-page (or in the case of package grant applications, the 40-page) limit for the program narrative.
A copy of the cover letter should be attached to each copy of each application. 
3. It is preferable for letters of cooperation or support to be appended to the application when it is submitted. If
support letters are sent under separate cover, they must be received no later than four weeks before the meeting of
the Board of Directors at which the application will be considered (i.e. no later than October 17, 1994, February 1,
1995, March 31, 1995, June 23, 1995, or August 18, 1995, respectively) in order to ensure that there is sufficient time
to bring them to the Board's attention.


VIII. Application Review Procedures 


A. Preliminary Inquiries 


The Institute staff will answer inquiries concerning application procedures. The staff contact will be named in
the Institute's letter inviting submission of a formal application. 


B. Selection Criteria 


1. All applications will be rated on the basis of the criteria set forth below. The Institute will accord the greatest
weight to the following criteria: 
a. The soundness of the methodology; 
b. The appropriateness of the proposed evaluation design; 
c. The qualifications of the project's staff; 
d. The applicant's management plan and organizational capabilities; 
e. The reasonableness of the proposed budget;

<TEXT>
 

f. The demonstration of need for the project; 
g. The products and benefits resulting from the project; 
h. The demonstration of cooperation and support of other agencies that may be affected by the project; 
i. The proposed project's relationship to one of the ``Special Interest'' categories set forth in section II.B.;
and 
j. The degree to which the findings, procedures, training, technology, or other results of the project can be transferred
to other jurisdictions. 

2. ``Single jurisdiction'' applications submitted pursuant to section II.C.1. will also be rated on the proposed
project's relation to one of the ``Special Interest'' categories set forth in section II.B. and on the special requirements
listed in section II.C.1.b. 
3. In determining which applicants to fund, the Institute will also consider whether the applicant is a State court,
a national court support or education organization, a non-court unit of government, or other type of entity eligible
to receive grants under the Institute's enabling legislation (see 42 U.S.C. 10705(6) (as amended) and Section IV
above); the availability of financial assistance from other sources for the project; the amount and nature (cash
or in-kind) of the applicant's match; the extent to which the proposed project would also benefit the Federal courts
or help the State courts enforce Federal constitutional and legislative requirements; and the level of appropriations
available to the Institute in the current year and the amount expected to be available in succeeding fiscal years.



C. Review and Approval Process 


Applications will be reviewed competitively by the Board of Directors. The Institute staff will prepare a narrative
summary of each application, and a rating sheet assigning points for each relevant selection criterion. When necessary,
applications may also be reviewed by outside experts. Committees of the Board will review applications within assigned
program categories and prepare recommenda-tions to the full Board. The full Board of Directors will then decide which
applications to approve for a grant. The decision to award a grant is solely that of the Board of Directors. 
Awards approved by the Board will be signed by the Chairman of the Board on behalf of the Institute. 



D. Return Policy 


Unless a specific request is made, unsuccessful applications will not be returned. Applicants are advised that Institute
records are subject to the provisions of the Federal Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. 



E. Notification of Board Decision 


The Institute will send written notice to applicants concerning all Board decisions to approve or deny their respective
applications and the key issues and questions that arose during the review process. A decision by the Board to deny
an application may not be appealed, but does not prohibit resubmission of a concept paper based on that application
in a subsequent round of funding. The Institute will also notify the designated State contact listed in Appendix I
when grants are approved by the Board to support projects that will be conducted by or involve courts in their State.




F. Response to Notification of Approval 


Applicants have 30 days from the date of the letter notifying them that the Board has approved their application to
respond to any revisions requested by the Board. If the requested revisions (or a reasonable schedule for submitting
such revisions) have not been submitted to the Institute within 30 days after notification, the approval will be automatically
rescinded and the application presented to the Board for reconsideration.

IX. Renewal Funding Procedures and Requirements 


The Institute recognizes two types of renewal funding as described below_``continuation grants'' and ``on-going
support grants.'' The award of an initial grant to support a project does not constitute a commitment by the Institute
to renew funding. The Board of Directors anticipates allocating no more than $3 million of available FY 1995 grant
funds for renewal grants. 



A. Continuation Grants 


1. Purpose and Scope 


Continuation grants are intended to support projects with a limited duration that involve the same type of activities
as the previous project. They are intended to enhance the specific program or service produced or established during
the prior grant period. They may be used, for example, when a project is divided into two or more sequential phases,
for secondary analysis of data obtained in an Institute-supported research project, or for more extensive testing
of an innovative technology, procedure, or program developed with SJI grant support. 

In order for a project to be considered for continuation funding, the grantee must have completed the project tasks
and met all grant requirements and conditions in a timely manner, absent extenuating circumstances or prior Institute
approval of changes to the project design. Continuation grants are not intended to provide support for a project for
which the grantee has underestimated the amount of time or funds needed to accomplish the project tasks. 

A continuation grant may be awarded for either a single project or for more than one project as a package grant (see sections
III.J., V.C.1 and 3, and V.D.1 and 3). 



2. Application Procedures_Letters of Intent 


In lieu of a concept paper, a grantee seeking a continuation grant must inform the Institute, by letter, of its intent
to submit an application for such funding as soon as the need for renewal funding becomes apparent but no less than 120
days before the end of the current grant period. 
a. A letter of intent must be no more than 3 single-spaced pages on 81/2 by 11 inch paper and must contain a concise but
thorough explanation of the need for continuation; an estimate of the funds to be requested; and a brief description
of anticipated changes in scope, focus or audience of the project. 
b. Letters of intent will not be reviewed competitively. Institute staff will review the proposed activities for
the next project period and, within 30 days of receiving a letter of intent, inform the grantee of specific issues to
be addressed in the continuation application and the date by which the application for a continuation grant must be
submitted. 


3. Application Format 


An application for a continuation grant must include an application form, budget forms (with appropriate documentation),
a project abstract conforming to the format set forth in section VII.B., a program narrative, a budget narrative,
a disclosure of lobbying form from (applicants other than units of State or local government), and certain certifications
and assurances. 

The program narrative should conform to the length and format requirements set forth in section VII.C. However, rather
than the topics listed in section VII.C., the program narrative of an application for a continuation grant should
include: 

a. 

Project Objectives. 

A clear, concise statement of what the continuation project is intended to accomplish. 

b. 

Need for Continuation. 

An explanation of why continuation of the project is necessary to achieve the goals of the project, and how the continuation
will benefit the participating courts or the courts community generally. That is, to what extent will the original
goals and objectives of the project be unful-filled if the project is not continued, and conversely, how will the findings
or results of the project be enhanced by continuing the project? 

A continuation application requesting a package grant to support more than one project should explain, in addition,
how the proposed projects are related; how their operation and administration would be enhanced by the grant; the
advantages of funding the projects as a package rather than individually; and the disadvantages, if any, that would
accrue by considering or funding them separately.

<PARENT> FR941006-2-00113 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

c. 

Report of Current Project Activities. 

A discussion of the status of all activities conducted during the previous project period. Applicants should identify
any activities that were not completed, and explain why. A continuation application requesting a package grant must
describe separately the activities undertaken in each of the projects included within the proposed package. 
d. 

Evaluation Findings. 

The key findings, impact, or recommendations resulting from the evaluation of the project, if they are available,
and how they will be addressed during the proposed continuation. If the findings are not yet available, applicants
should provide the date by which they will be submitted to the Institute. Ordinarily, the Board will not consider an
application for continuation funding until the Institute has received the evaluator's report. 
e. 

Tasks, Methods, Staff and Grantee Capability. 

A full description of any changes in the tasks to be performed, the methods to be used, the products of the project, how
and to whom those products will be disseminated, the assigned staff, or the grantee's organizational capacity. Applicants
should include, in addition, the criteria and methods by which the proposed continuation project would be evaluated.

A continuation application for a package grant must address these issues separately for each project included in
the proposed package, using the same alphabetic identifiers and project titles as in the original application. 
f. 

Task Schedule. 

A detailed task schedule and time line for the next project period. A continuation application for a package grant
should include a separate task schedule and timeline for each project included in the proposed package, as well as
a schedule and time line that covers the package of projects as a whole. The same alphabetic identifiers and project
titles used in the original application should be used to identify the component projects in the renewal application.

g. 

Other Sources of Support. 

An indication of why other sources of support are inadequate, inappropriate or unavailable. 


4. Budget and Budget Narrative 



Provide a complete budget and budget narrative conforming to the requirements set forth in paragraph VII.D. Changes
in the funding level requested should be discussed in terms of corresponding increases or decreases in the scope of
activities or services to be rendered. 
A continuation application for a package grant must include a separate budget narrative identified alphabetically
(i.e. A, B, C) and by project title for each project component. 


5. References to Previously Submitted Material 


An application for a continuation grant should not repeat information contained in a previously approved application
or other previously submitted materials, but should provide specific references to such materials where appropriate.



6. Submission Requirements, Review and Approval Process, and Notification of Decision 


The submission requirements set forth in section VII.E., other than the deadline for mailing, apply to applications
for a continuation grant. Such applications will be rated on the selection criteria set forth in section VIII.B. The
key findings and recommendations resulting from an evaluation of the project and the proposed response to those findings
and recommendations will also be considered. The review and approval process, return policy, and notification procedures
are the same as those for new projects set forth in sections VIII.C.-VIII.E. 


B. On-going Support Grants 


1. Purpose and Scope 


On-going support grants are intended to support projects that are national in scope and that provide the State courts
with services, programs or products for which there is a continuing important need. An on-going support grant may
also be used to fund longitudinal research that directly benefits the State courts. On-going support grants are subject
to the limits on size and duration set forth in V.C.2 and V.D.2. A project is eligible for consideration for an on-going
support grant if: 
a. The project is supported by and has been evaluated under a grant from the Institute; 




</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941006-2-00203 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941006-2-00113 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

b. The project is national in scope and provides a significant benefit to the State courts; 
c. There is a continuing important need for the services, programs or products provided by the project as indicated
by the level of use and support by members of the court community; 
d. The project is accomplishing its objectives in an effective and efficient manner; and 
e. It is likely that the service or program provided by the project would be curtailed or significantly reduced without
Institute support. 
Each project supported by an on-going support grant must include an evaluation component assessing its effectiveness
and operation throughout the grant period. The evaluation should be independent, but may be designed collaboratively
by the evaluator and the grantee. The design should call for regular feedback from the evaluator to the grantee throughout
the project period concerning recommendations for mid-course corrections or improvement of the project, as well
as periodic reports to the Institute at relevant points in the project. 
An interim evaluation report must be submitted 18 months into the grant period. The decision to obligate Institute
funds to support the third year of the project will be based on the interim evaluation findings and the applicant's
response to any deficiencies noted in the report. 
A final evaluation assessing the effectiveness, operation of, and continuing need for the project must be submitted
90 days before the end of the three-year project period. 
In addition, a detailed annual task schedule must be submitted not later than 45 days before the end of the first and
second years of the grant period, along with an explanation of any necessary revisions in the projected costs for the
remainder of the project period. (See also section IX.B.3.h.) 



2. Application Procedures_Letters of Intent 


The Board will consider awarding an on-going support grant for a period of up to 36 months. The total amount of the grant
will be fixed at the time of the initial award. Funds ordinarily will be made available in annual increments as specified
in section V.C.2. 
In lieu of a concept paper, a grantee seeking an on-going support grant must inform the Institute, by letter, of its
intent to submit an application for such funding as soon as the need for renewal funding becomes apparent but no less
than 120 days before the end of the current grant period. The letter of intent should be in the same format as that prescribed
for continuation grants in section IX.A.2.a. 


3. Application Procedures and Format 


An application for an on-going support grant must include an application form, budget forms (with appropriate documentation),
a project abstract conforming to the format set forth in section VII.B., a program narrative, a budget narrative,
and certain certifications and assurances. 

The program narrative should conform to the length and format requirements set forth in section VII.C. However, rather
than the topics listed in section VII.C., the program narrative of applications for on-going support grants should
address: 
a. 

Description of Need for and Benefits of the Project. 

Provide a detailed discussion of the benefits provided by the project to the State courts around the country, including
the degree to which State courts, State court judges, or State court managers and personnel are using the services
or programs provided by the project. 
An application for on-going support of a package grant should explain, in addition, how the proposed projects are
related; how their operation and administration would be enhanced by the grant; the advantages of funding the projects
as a package rather than individually; and the disadvantages, if any, that would accrue by considering or funding
them separately. 
b. 

Demonstration of Court Support. 

Demonstrate support for the continuation of the project from the courts community. 
c. 

Report on Current Project Activities. 

Discuss the extent to which the project has met its goals and objectives, identify any activities that have not been
completed, and explain why. An application for on-going support of a package grant must describe separately the activities
undertaken in each of the projects included within the proposed package. 
d. 

Evaluation Findings. 

Attach a copy of the final evaluation report regarding the effectiveness, impact, and operation of the project, specify
the key findings or recommendations resulting from the evaluation, and explain how they will be addressed during
the proposed renewal period. Ordinarily, the Board will not consider an application for on-going support until the
Institute has received the evaluator's report. 
e. 

Objectives, Tasks, Methods, Staff and Grantee Capability. 

Describe fully any changes in the objectives; tasks to be performed; the methods to be used; the products of the project;
how and to whom those products will be disseminated; the assigned staff; and the grantee's organizational capacity.

An application for on-going support of a package grant must address these issues separately for each project included
in the proposed package, using the same alphabetic identifiers and project titles as in the original application.

f. 

Task Schedule. 

Present a general schedule for the full proposed project period and a detailed task schedule for the first year of the
proposed new project period. An application for on-going support of a package grant should include a separate task
schedule and timeline for each project included in the proposed package, as well as a schedule and time line that covers
the package of projects as a whole. The same alphabetic identifiers and project titles used in the original application
should be used to identify the component projects in the renewal application. 
g. 

Other Sources of Support. 

Indicate why other sources of support are inadequate, inappropriate or unavailable. 


4. Budget and Budget Narrative 


Provide a complete three-year budget and budget narrative conforming to the requirements set forth in paragraph
VII.D. Changes in the funding level requested should be discussed in terms of corresponding increases or decreases
in the scope of activities or services to be rendered. A complete budget narrative should be provided for each year,
or portion of a year, for which grant support is requested. Changes in the funding level requested should be discussed
in terms of corresponding increases or decreases in the scope of activities or services to be rendered. The budget
should provide for realistic cost-of-living and staff salary increases over the course of the requested project
period. Applicants should be aware that the Institute is unlikely to approve a supplemental budget increase for an
on-going support grant in the absence of well-documented, unanticipated factors that clearly justify the requested
increase. 
A continuation application for a package grant must include a separate budget narrative identified alphabetically
(i.e. A, B, C) and by project title for each project component. 


5. References to Previously Submitted Material 


An application for an on-going support grant should not repeat information contained in a previously approved application
or other previously submitted materials, but should provide specific references to such materials where appropriate.




6. Submission Requirements, Review and Approval Process, and Notification of Decision 


The submission requirements set forth in section VII.E., other than the deadline for mailing, apply to applications
for an on-going support grant. Such applications will be rated on the selection criteria set forth in section VIII.B.
The key findings and recommendations resulting from an evaluation of the project and the proposed response to those
findings and recommendations will also be considered. The review and approval process, return policy, and notification
procedures are the same as those for new projects set forth in sections VIII.C._VIII.E.

X. Compliance Requirements 


The State Justice Institute Act contains limitations and conditions on grants, contracts and cooperative agreements
of which applicants and recipients should be aware. In addition to eligibility requirements which must be met to be
considered for an award from the Institute, all applicants should be aware of and all recipients will be responsible
for ensuring compliance with the following: 


A. State and Local Court Systems 


Each application for funding from a State or local court must be approved, consistent with State law, by the State's
Supreme Court, or its designated agency or council. The Supreme Court or its designee shall receive, administer,
and be accountable for all funds awarded on the basis of such an application. 42 U.S.C. 10705(b)(4). Appendix I to this
Guideline lists the person to contact in each State regarding the administration of Institute grants to State and
local courts. 


B. Matching Requirements 


1. All awards to courts or other units of State or local government (not including publicly supported institutions
of higher education) require a match from private or public sources of not less than 50% of the total amount of the Institute's
award. For example, if the total cost of a project is anticipated to be $150,000, a State court or executive branch agency
may request up to $100,000 from the Institute to implement the project. The remaining $50,000 (50% of the $100,000
requested from SJI) must be provided as a match. A cash match, non-cash match, or both may be provided, but the Institute
will give preference to those applicants who provide a cash match to the Institute's award. (For a further definition
of match, see section III.F.) 
The requirement to provide match may be waived in exceptionally rare circumstances upon approval of the Chief Justice
of the highest court in the State and a majority of the Board of Directors. 42 U.S.C. 10705(d). 
2. Other eligible recipients of Institute funds are not required to provide a match, but are encouraged to contribute
to meeting the costs of the project. In instances where match is proposed, the grantee is responsible for ensuring
that the total amount proposed is actually contributed. If a proposed contribution is not fully met, the Institute
may reduce the award amount accordingly, in order to maintain the ratio originally provided for in the award agreement
(see sections VIII.B. above and XI.D.). 


C. Conflict of Interest 


Personnel and other officials connected with Institute-funded programs shall adhere to the following requirements:

1. No official or employee of a recipient court or organization shall participate personally through decision, approval,
disapproval, recommendation, the rendering of advice, investigation, or otherwise in any proceeding, application,
request for a ruling or other determination, contract, grant, cooperative agreement, claim, controversy, or other
particular matter in which Institute funds are used, where to his/her knowledge he/she or his/her immediate family,
partners, organi-zation other than a public agency in which he/she is serving as officer, director, trustee, partner,
or employee or any person or organization with whom he/she is negotiating or has any arrangement concerning prospective
employment, has a financial interest.

<PARENT> FR941006-2-00113 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

2. In the use of Institute project funds, an official or employee of a recipient court or organization shall avoid any
action which might result in or create the appearance of: 

a. Using an official position for private gain; or 

b. Affecting adversely the confidence of the public in the integrity of the Institute program. 

3. Requests for proposals or invitations for bids issued by a recipient of Institute funds or a subgrantee or subcontractor
will provide notice to prospective bidders that the contractors who develop or draft specifications, requirements,
statements of work and/or requests for proposals for a proposed procurement will be excluded from bidding on or submitting
a proposal to compete for the award of such procurement. 



D. Lobbying 



Funds awarded to recipients by the Institute shall not be used, indirectly or directly, to influence Executive orders
or similar promulgations by Federal, State or local agencies, or to influence the passage or defeat of any legislation
by Federal, State or local legislative bodies. 42 U.S.C. 10706(a). 

It is the policy of the Board of Directors to award funds only to support applications submitted by organizations that
would carry out the objectives of their applications in an unbiased manner. Consistent with this policy and the provisions
of 42 U.S.C. 10706, the Institute will not knowingly award a grant to an applicant that has, directly or through an entity
that is part of the same organization as the applicant, advocated a position before Congress on the specific subject
matter of the application. 



E. Political Activities 



No recipient shall contribute or make available Institute funds, program personnel, or equipment to any political
party or association, or the campaign of any candidate for public or party office. Recipients are also prohibited
from using funds in advocating or opposing any ballot measure, initiative, or referendum. Finally, officers and
employees of recipients shall not intentionally identify the Institute or recipients with any partisan or nonpartisan
political activity associated with a political party or association, or the campaign of any candidate for public
or party office. 42 U.S.C. 10706(a). 



F. Advocacy 



No funds made available by the Institute may be used to support or conduct training programs for the purpose of advocating
particular nonjudicial public policies or encouraging nonjudicial political activities. 42 U.S.C. 10706(b).




G. Prohibition Against Litigation Support 



No funds made available by the Institute may be used directly or indirectly to support legal assistance to parties
in litigation, including cases involving capital punishment. 



H. Supplantation and Construction 



To ensure that funds are used to supplement and improve the operation of State courts, rather than to support basic
court services, funds shall not be used for the following purposes: 

1. To supplant State or local funds supporting a program or activity (such as paying the salary of court employees who
would be performing their normal duties as part of the project, or paying rent for space which is part of the court's
normal operations); 

2. To construct court facilities or structures, except to remodel existing facilities or to demonstrate new architectural
or technological techniques, or to provide temporary facilities for new personnel or for personnel involved in a
demonstration or experimental program; or 

3. Solely to purchase equipment. 



I. Confidentiality of Information 



Except as provided by Federal law other than the State Justice Institute Act, no recipient of financial assistance
from SJI may use or reveal any research or statistical information furnished under the Act by any person and identifiable
to any specific private person for any purpose other than the purpose for which the information was obtained. Such
information and copies thereof shall be immune from legal process, and shall not, without the consent of the person
furnishing such information, be admitted as evidence or used for any purpose in any action, suit, or other judicial,
legislative, or administrative proceedings.

<PARENT> FR941006-2-00113 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

J. Human Research Protection 



All research involving human subjects shall be conducted with the informed consent of those subjects and in a manner
that will ensure their privacy and freedom from risk or harm and the protection of persons who are not subjects of the
research but would be affected by it, unless such procedures and safeguards would make the research impractical.
In such instances, the Institute must approve procedures designed by the grantee to provide human subjects with relevant
information about the research after their involvement and to minimize or eliminate risk or harm to those subjects
due to their participation. 



K. Nondiscrimination 



No person may, on the basis of race, sex, national origin, disability, color, or creed be excluded from participation
in, denied the benefits of, or otherwise subjected to discrimination under any program or activity supported by Institute
funds. Recipients of Institute funds must immediately take any measures necessary to effectuate this provision.




L. Reporting Requirements 



Recipients of Institute funds, other than scholarships awarded under section II.B.2.b.v., shall submit Quarterly
Progress and Financial Reports within 30 days of the close of each calendar quarter (that is, no later than January
30, April 30, July 30, and October 30). Two copies of each report must be sent. The Quarterly Progress Reports shall
include a narrative description of project activities during the calendar quarter, the relationship between those
activities and the task schedule and objectives set forth in the approved application or an approved adjustment thereto,
any significant problem areas that have developed and how they will be resolved, and the activities scheduled during
the next reporting period. 

The quarterly financial status report shall be submitted in accordance with section XI.G.2. of this guideline. A
final project progress report and financial status report shall be submitted within 90 days after the end of the grant
period in accordance with section XI.K.2. of this Guideline. 



M. Audit 



Each recipient must provide for an annual fiscal audit which shall include an opinion on whether the financial statements
of the grantee present fairly its financial position and financial operations are in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. (See section XI.J. of the Guideline for the requirements of such audits.) 



N. Suspension of Funding 



After providing a recipient reasonable notice and opportunity to submit written documentation demonstrating why
fund termination or suspension should not occur, the Institute may terminate or suspend funding of a project that
fails to comply substantially with the Act, Institute guide-lines, or the terms and conditions of the award. 42 U.S.C.
10708(a). 



O. Title to Property 



At the conclusion of the project, title to all expendable and nonexpendable personal property purchased with Institute
funds shall vest in the recipient court, organization, or individual that purchased the property if certification
is made to the Institute that the property will continue to be used for the authorized purposes of the Institute-funded
project or other purposes consistent with the State Justice Institute Act, as approved by the Insti-tute. If such
certification is not made or the Institute disapproves such certification, title to all such property with an aggregate
or individual value of $1,000 or more shall vest in the Institute, which will direct the disposi-tion of the property.




P. Original Material 



All products prepared as the result of Institute-supported projects must be originally-developed material unless
otherwise specified in the award documents. Material not originally developed that is included in such products
must be properly identified, whether the material is in a verbatim or extensive paraphrase format. 



Q. Acknowledgment and Disclaimer 



Recipients of Institute funds shall acknowledge prominently on all products developed with grant funds that support
was received from the Institute. The ``SJI'' logo must appear on the front cover of a written product, or in the opening
frames of a video product, unless another placement is approved in writing by the Institute. A camera-ready logo sheet
is available from the Institute upon request. 

Recipients also shall display the following disclaimer on all grant products:

 


This [document, film, videotape, etc.] was developed under [grant/cooperative agreement, number SJI-(insert
number)] from the State Justice Institute. The points of view expressed are those of the [author(s), filmmaker(s),
etc.] and do not necessarily represent the official position or policies of the State Justice Institute. 



R. Institute Approval of Grant Products 



No grant funds may be obligated for publication or reproduction of a final product developed with grant funds without
the written approval of the Institute. Grantees shall submit a final draft of each such product to the Institute for
review and approval. These drafts shall be submitted sufficiently before the product is scheduled to be sent for publication
or reproduction to permit Institute review and incorporation of any appropriate changes agreed upon by the grantee
and the Institute. 



S. Distribution of Grant Products to State Libraries 





</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941006-2-00208 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941006-2-00113 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Grantees shall send 20 copies of each final product developed with grant funds to the Institute, unless the product
was developed under either a curriculum adaptation or a technical assistance grant, in which case submission of 2
copies is required. 

 Grantees shall send one copy of each final product developed with grant funds to the library established in each State
to collect materials prepared with Institute support. (A list of these libraries is contained in Appendix II. Labels
for these libraries are available from the Institute upon request.) Recipients of curriculum adaptation and technical
assistance grants are not required to submit final products to State libraries. 

 

T. Copyrights 

 

Except as otherwise provided in the terms and conditions of an Institute award, a recipient is free to copyright any
books, publications, or other copyrightable materials developed in the course of an Institute-supported project,
but the Institute shall reserve a royalty-free, nonexclusive and irrevocable right to reproduce, publish, or otherwise
use, and to authorize others to use, the materials for purposes consistent with the State Justice Institute Act. 

 

U. Inventions and Patents 

 

If any patentable items, patent rights, processes, or inventions are produced in the course of Institute-sponsored
work, such fact shall be promptly and fully reported to the Institute. Unless there is a prior agreement between the
grantee and the Institute on disposition of such items, the Institute shall determine whether protection of the invention
or discovery shall be sought. The Institute will also determine how the rights in the invention or discovery, including
rights under any patent issued thereon, shall be allocated and administered in order to protect the public interest
consistent with ``Government Patent Policy'' (President's Memorandum for Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies,
February 18, 1983, and statement of Government Patent Policy). 

 

V. Charges for Grant-Related Products/Recovery of Costs 

 

When Institute funds fully cover the cost of developing, producing, and disseminating a product, (e.g., a report,
curriculum, videotape or software), the product should be distributed to the field without charge. When Institute
funds only partially cover the development, production, or dissemination costs, the grantee may recover its costs
for developing, reproducing, and disseminating the material to those requesting it, to the extent that those costs
were not covered by Institute funds or grantee matching contributions. 

 Applicants should disclose their intent to sell grant-related products in both the concept paper and the application.
Grantees must obtain the written, prior approval of the Institute of their plans to recover project costs through
the sale of grant products. 

 Written requests to recover costs ordinarily should be received during the grant period and should specify the nature
and extent of the costs to be recouped, the reason that such costs were not budgeted (if the rationale was not disclosed
in the approved application), the number of copies to be sold, the intended audience for the products to be sold, and
the proposed sale price. If the product is to be sold for more than $25.00, the written request also should include a
detailed itemization of costs that will be recovered and a certification that the costs were not supported by either
Institute grant funds or grantee matching contributions.

<DOCNO> FR941006-2-00209 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941006-2-00113 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

If, following the end of the grant period, the sale of grant products results in revenues that exceed those costs, the
revenue must continue to be used for the authorized purposes of the Institute-funded project or other purposes consistent
with the State Justice Institute Act that have been approved by the Institute. See sections III.G. and XI.F. for requirements
regarding project-related income. 



W. Availability of Research Data for Secondary Analysis 



Upon request, grantees must make available for secondary analysis a diskette(s) or data tape(s) containing research
and evaluation data collected under an Institute grant and the accompanying code manual. Grantees may recover the
actual cost of duplicating and mailing or otherwise transmitting the data set and manual from the person or organization
requesting the data. Grantees may provide the requested data set in the format in which it was created and analyzed.




X. Approval of Key Staff 



If the qualifications of an employee or consultant assigned to a key project staff position are not described in the
application or if there is a change of a person assigned to such a position, a recipient shall submit a description of
the qualifications of the newly assigned person to the Institute. Prior written approval of the qualifications of
the new person assigned to a key staff position must be received from the Institute before the salary or consulting
fee of that person and associated costs may be paid or reimbursed from grant funds. 



XI. Financial Requirements 



A. Accounting Systems and Financial Records 



All grantees, subgrantees, contractors, and other organizations directly or indirectly receiving Institute funds
are required to establish and maintain accounting systems and financial records to accurately account for funds
they receive. These records shall include total program costs, including Institute funds, State and local matching
shares, and any other fund sources included in the approved project budget. 



1. Purpose 



The purpose of this section is to establish accounting system requirements and to offer guidance on procedures which
will assist all grantees/subgrantees in: 

a. Complying with the statutory requirements for the awarding, disbursement, and accounting of funds; 

b. Complying with regulatory requirements of the Institute for the financial management and disposition of funds;


c. Generating financial data which can be used in the planning, management and control of programs; and 

d. Facilitating an effective audit of funded programs and projects. 



2. References 



Except where inconsistent with specific provisions of this Guideline, the following regulations, directives and
reports are applicable to Institute grants and cooperative agreements under the same terms and conditions that apply
to Federal grantees. These materials supplement the requirements of this section for accounting systems and financial
recordkeeping and provide additional guidance on how these requirements may be satisfied.

B. 

Supervision and Monitoring Responsibilities 


1. Grantee Responsibilities 


All grantees receiving direct awards from the Institute are responsible for the management and fiscal control of
all funds. Responsibilities include accounting for receipts and expenditures, maintaining adequate financial
records and refunding expenditures disallowed by audits. 


2. Responsibilities of State Supreme Court 


Each application for funding from a State or local court must be approved, consistent with State law, by the State's
Supreme Court, or its designated agency or council. 
The State Supreme Court or its designee shall receive all Institute funds awarded to such courts; shall be responsible
for assuring proper administration of Institute funds; and shall be responsible for all aspects of the project, including
proper accounting and financial recordkeeping by the subgrantee. These responsibilities include: 
a. Reviewing Financial Operations. 

The State Supreme Court or its designee should be familiar with, and periodically monitor, its subgrantees' financial
operations, records system and procedures. Particular attention should be directed to the maintenance of current
financial data. 
b. 

Recording Financial Activities. 

The subgrantee's grant award or contract obligation, as well as cash advances and other financial activities, should
be recorded in the financial records of the State Supreme Court or its designee in summary form. Subgrantee expenditures
should be recorded on the books of the State Supreme Court OR evidenced by report forms duly filed by the subgrantee.
Non-Institute contributions applied to projects by subgrantees should likewise be recorded, as should any project
income resulting from program operations. 
c. 

Budgeting and Budget Review. 

The State Supreme Court or its designee should ensure that each subgrantee prepares an adequate budget as the basis
for its award commitment. The detail of each project budget should be maintained on file by the State Supreme Court.

d. 

Accounting for Non-Institute Contributions. 

The State Supreme Court or its designee will ensure, in those instances where subgrantees are required to furnish
non-Institute matching funds, that the requirements and limitations of this guideline are applied to such funds.

e. 

Audit Requirement. 

The State Supreme Court or its designee is required to ensure that subgrantees have met the necessary audit requirements
as set forth by the Institute (see sections X.M. and XI.J). 
f. 

Reporting Irregularities. 

The State Supreme Court, its designees, and its subgrantees are responsible for promptly reporting to the Institute
the nature and circumstances surrounding any financial irregularities discovered. 


C. Accounting System 


The grantee is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of accounting and internal controls
for itself and for ensuring that an adequate system exists for each of its subgrantees and contractors. An acceptable
and adequate accounting system is considered to be one which: 
1. Properly accounts for receipt of funds under each grant awarded and the expenditure of funds for each grant by category
of expenditure (including matching contributions and project income); 
2. Assures that expended funds are applied to the appropriate budget category included within the approved grant;

3. Presents and classifies historical costs of the grant as required for budgetary and evaluation purposes; 
4. Provides cost and property controls to assure optimal use of grant funds; 
5. Is integrated with a system of internal controls adequate to safeguard the funds and assets covered, check the accuracy
and reliability of the accounting data, promote operational efficiency, and assure conformance with any general
or special conditions of the grant; 
6. Meets the prescribed requirements for periodic financial reporting of operations; and 
7. Provides financial data for planning, control, measurement, and evaluation of direct and indirect costs.

<PARENT> FR941006-2-00113 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

D. Total Cost Budgeting and Accounting 


Accounting for all funds awarded by the Institute shall be structured and executed on a ``total project cost'' basis.
That is, total project costs, including Institute funds, State and local matching shares, and any other fund sources
included in the approved project budget shall be the foundation for fiscal administration and accounting. Grant
applications and financial reports require budget and cost estimates on the basis of total costs. 


1. Timing of Matching Contributions 


Matching contributions need not be applied at the exact time of the obligation of Institute funds. However, the full
matching share must be obligated during the award period, except that with the prior written permission of the Institute,
contributions made following approval of the grant by the Institute's Board but before the beginning of the grant
may be counted as match. Grantees that do not contemplate making matching contributions continuously throughout
the course of a project or on a task-by-task basis, are required to submit a schedule within 30 days after the beginning
of the project period indicating at what points during the project period the matching contributions will be made.
In instances where a proposed cash match is not fully met, the Institute may reduce the award amount accordingly, in
order to maintain the ratio originally provided for in the award agreement. 


2. Records for Match 


All grantees must maintain records which clearly show the source, amount, and timing of all matching contributions.
In addition, if a project has included, within its approved budget, contributions which exceed the required matching
portion, the grantee must maintain records of those contributions in the same manner as it does the Institute funds
and required matching shares. For all grants made to State and local courts, the State Supreme Court has primary responsibility
for grantee/subgrantee compliance with the requirements of this section. (See section XI.B.2.) 


E. Maintenance and Retention of Records 


All financial records, supporting documents, statistical records and all other records pertinent to grants, subgrants,
cooperative agreements or contracts under grants shall be retained by each organization participating in a project
for at least three years for purposes of examination and audit. State Supreme Courts may impose record retention and
maintenance requirements in addition to those prescribed in this chapter. 


1. Coverage 


The retention requirement extends to books of original entry, source documents supporting accounting transactions,
the general ledger, subsidiary ledgers, personnel and payroll records, cancelled checks, and related documents
and records. Source documents include copies of all grant and subgrant awards, applications, and required grantee/subgrantee
financial and narrative reports. Personnel and payroll records shall include the time and attendance reports for
all individuals reimbursed under a grant, subgrant or contract, whether they are employed full-time or part-time.
Time and effort reports will be required for consultants. 


2. Retention Period 


The three-year retention period starts from the date of the submission of the final expenditure report or, for grants
which are renewed annually, from the date of submission of the annual expenditure report.

<TEXT>
 

3. Maintenance 


Grantees and subgrantees are expected to see that records of different fiscal years are separately identified and
maintained so that requested information can be readily located. Grantees and subgrantees are also obligated to
protect records adequately against fire or other damage. When records are stored away from the grantee's/subgrantee's
principal office, a written index of the location of stored records should be on hand, and ready access should be assured.



4. Access 


Grantees and subgrantees must give any authorized representative of the Institute access to and the right to examine
all records, books, papers, and documents related to an Institute grant. 


F. Project-Related Income 


Records of the receipt and disposition of project-related income must be maintained by the grantee in the same manner
as required for the project funds that gave rise to the income. The policies governing the disposition of the various
types of project-related income are listed below. 


1. Interest 


A State and any agency or instrumentality of a State including State institutions of higher education and State hospitals,
shall not be held accountable for interest earned on advances of project funds. When funds are awarded to subgrantees
through a State, the subgrantees are not held accountable for interest earned on advances of project funds. Local
units of government and nonprofit organizations that are direct grantees must refund any interest earned. Grantees
shall so order their affairs to ensure minimum balances in their respective grant cash accounts. 


2. Royalties 


The grantee/subgrantee may retain all royalties received from copyrights or other works developed under projects
or from patents and inventions, unless the terms and conditions of the project provide otherwise. 


3. Registration and Tuition Fees 


Registration and tuition fees shall be used to pay project-related costs not covered by the grant, or to reduce the
amount of grant funds needed to support the project. Registration and tuition fees may be used for other purposes only
with the prior written approval of the Institute. Estimates of registration and tuition fees, and any expenses to
be offset by the fees, should be included in the application budget forms and narrative. 


4. Income From the Sale of Grant Products 


When grant funds fully cover the cost of producing and disseminating a limited number of copies of a product, the grantee
may, with the written prior approval of the Institute, sell additional copies reproduced at its expense only at a price
that recovers actual reproduction and distribution costs that were not covered by Institute grant funds or grantee
matching contributions to the project. When grant funds only partially cover the costs of developing, producing
and disseminating a product, the grantee may, with the written prior approval of the Institute, recover costs for
developing, reproducing, and disseminating the material to the extent that those costs were not covered by Institute
grant funds or grantee matching contributions.

If the sale of products occurs during the project period, the costs and income generated by the sales must be reported
on the Quarterly Financial Status Reports and documented in an auditable manner. 
Whenever possible, the intent to sell a product should be disclosed in the concept paper and application or reported
to the Institute in writing once a decision to sell products has been made. The grantee must request approval to recover
its product development, reproduction, and dissemination costs as specified in section X.V. 


5. Other 


Other project income shall be treated in accordance with disposition instructions set forth in the project's terms
and conditions. 


G. Payments and Financial Reporting Requirements 


1. Payment of Grant Funds 


The procedures and regulations set forth below are applicable to all Institute grant funds and grantees. 

a. 

Request for Advance or Reimbursement of Funds.

 Grantees will receive funds on a ``Check-Issued'' basis. Upon receipt, review, and approval of a Request for Advance
or Reimbursement by the Institute, a check will be issued directly to the grantee or its designated fiscal agent. A
request must be limited to the grantee's immediate cash needs. The Request for Advance or Reimbursement, along with
the instructions for its preparation, will be included in the official Institute award package. 
For purposes of submitting Requests for Advance or Reimbursement, recipients of continuation and on-going support
grants should consider these grants as supplements to and extensions of the original award and number their requests
on a project rather than a grant basis. (See Recommendations to Grantees in the Introduction for further guidance.)

Payment requests for projects within a package grant may be submitted at the same time, but must be calculated separately
by component project. The alphabetic project identifier (A, B, C, etc.) should be appended to the grant number in Block
5 of the Request for Advance or Reimbursement. (See Recommendations to Grantees in the Introduction for further guidance.)

b. 

Termination of Advance and Reimbursement Funding.

 When a grantee organization receiving cash advances from the Institute: 
i. Demonstrates an unwillingness or inability to attain program or project goals, or to establish procedures that
will minimize the time elapsing between cash advances and disbursements, or cannot adhere to guideline requirements
or special conditions; 
ii. Engages in the improper award and administration of subgrants or contracts; or 
iii. Is unable to submit reliable and/or timely reports; 



the Institute may terminate advance financing and require the grantee organization to finance its operations with
its own working capital. Payments to the grantee shall then be made by check to reimburse the grantee for actual cash
disbursements. In the event the grantee continues to be deficient, the Institute reserves the right to suspend reimbursement
payments until the deficiencies are corrected.

<PARENT> FR941006-2-00113 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

c. 

Principle of Minimum Cash on Hand.

 Recipient organizations should request funds based upon immediate disbursement requirements. Grantees should
time their requests to ensure that cash on hand is the minimum needed for disbursements to be made immediately or within
a few days. Idle funds in the hands of subgrantees will impair the goals of good cash management. 



2. Financial Reporting 



In order to obtain financial information concerning the use of funds, the Institute requires that grantees/subgrantees
of these funds submit timely reports for review. 

Two copies of the Financial Status Report are required from all grantees, other than recipients of scholarships under
section II.B.2.b.v., for each active quarter on a calendar-quarter basis. This report is due within 30 days after
the close of the calendar quarter. It is designed to provide financial informa-tion relating to Institute funds,
State and local matching shares, and any other fund sources included in the approved project budget. The report contains
information on obligations as well as outlays. A copy of the Financial Status Report, along with instructions for
its preparation, will be included in the official Institute Award package. In circumstances where an organization
requests substantial payments for a project prior to the completion of a given quarter, the Institute may request
a brief summary of the amount requested, by object class, in support of the Request for Advance or Reimbursement. 

Grantees receiving a continuation or on-going support grant should provide financial information and number their
quarterly Financial Status Reports on a project rather than a grant basis. 

Grantees receiving a package grant must submit a quarterly financial report summarizing the financial activity
for the entire package and separate reports for each project within the package. On the separate reports for the component
projects, the alphabetic project identifier (A, B, C, etc.) must be appended to the grant number in Block 5 of the Financial
Status Report. 



3. Consequences of Non-Compliance With Submission Requirements 



Failure of the grantee organization to submit required financial and program reports may result in a suspension of
grant payments or revocation of the grant award. 



H. Allowability of Costs 



1. General 



Except as may be otherwise provided in the conditions of a particular grant, cost allowability shall be determined
in accordance with the principles set forth in 

OMB Circulars A-87,

 Cost Principles for State and Local Governments; 

A-21

, Cost Principles Applicable to Grants and Contracts with Educational Institutions; and 

A-122

, Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations. No costs may be recovered to liquidate obligations which are incurred
after the approved grant period. 



2. Costs Requiring Prior Approval 



a. 

Preagreement Costs.

 The written prior approval of the Institute is required for costs which are considered necessary to the project but
occur prior to the award date of the grant. 

b. 

Equipment.

 Grant funds may be used to purchase or lease only that equipment which is essential to accom-plishing the goals and
objectives of the project. The written prior approval of the Institute is required when the amount of automated data
processing (ADP) equipment to be purchased or leased exceeds $10,000 or the software to be purchased exceeds $3,000.


c. 

Consultants.

 The written prior approval of the Institute is required when the rate of compensation to be paid a consultant exceeds
$300 a day. 



3. Travel Costs 



Transportation and per diem rates must comply with the policies of the applicant organization. If the applicant does
not have an established written travel policy, then travel rates shall be consistent with those established by the
Institute or the Federal Government. Institute funds shall not be used to cover the transportation or per diem costs
of a member of a national organization to attend an annual or other regular meeting of that organization.

4. Indirect Costs 



These are costs of an organization that are not readily assignable to a particular project, but are necessary to the
operation of the organization and the performance of the project. The cost of operating and maintaining facilities,
depreciation, and administrative salaries are examples of the types of costs that are usually treated as indirect
costs. It is the policy of the Institute that all costs should be budgeted directly; however, if a recipient has an indirect
cost rate approved by a Federal agency as set forth below, the Institute will accept that rate. 

a. 

Approved Plan Available

. 

i. The Institute will accept an indirect cost rate or allocation plan approved for a grantee during the preceding two
years by any Federal granting agency on the basis of allocation methods substantially in accord with those set forth
in the applicable cost circulars. A copy of the approved rate agreement must be submitted to the Institute. 

ii. Where flat rates are accepted in lieu of actual indirect costs, grantees may not also charge expenses normally
included in overhead pools, e.g., accounting services, legal services, building occupancy and maintenance, etc.,
as direct costs. 

iii. Organizations with an approved indirect cost rate, utilizing total direct costs as the base, usually exclude
contracts under grants from any overhead recovery. The negotiation agreement will stipulate that contracts are
excluded from the base for overhead recovery. 

b. 

Establishment of Indirect Cost Rates.

 In order to be reimbursed for indirect costs, a grantee or organization must first establish an appropriate indirect
cost rate. To do this, the grantee must prepare an indirect cost rate proposal and submit it to the Institute. The proposal
must be submitted in a timely manner (within three months after the start of the grant period) to assure recovery of
the full amount of allowable indirect costs, and it must be developed in accordance with principles and procedures
appropriate to the type of grantee institution involved. 

c. 

No Approved Plan.

 If an indirect cost proposal for recovery of actual indirect costs is not submitted to the Institute within three months
after the start of the grant period, indirect costs will be irrevocably disallowed for all months prior to the month
that the indirect cost proposal is received. This policy is effective for all grant awards. 



I. Procurement and Property Management Standards 



1. Procurement Standards 



For State and local governments, the Institute is adopting the standards set forth in Attachment O of 

OMB Circular A-102

. Institutions of higher education, hospitals, and other non-profit organizations will be governed by the standards
set forth in Attachment O of 

OMB Circular A-110. 



2. Property Management Standards 



The property management standards as prescribed in Attachment N of OMB Circulars A-102

 and 

A-110

 shall be applicable to all grantees and subgrantees of Institute funds except as provided in section X.O. 




</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941006-2-00216 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941006-2-00113 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

All grantees/subgrantees are required to be prudent in the acquisition and management of property with grant funds.
If suitable property required for the successful execution of projects is already available within the grantee or
subgrantee organization, expenditures of grant funds for the acquisition of new property will be considered unnecessary.



J. Audit Requirements 


1. Implementation 


Each non-scholarship grantee (including a State or local court receiving a subgrant from the State Supreme Court)
shall provide for an annual fiscal audit. The audit may be of the entire grantee organization (e.g., a university)
or of the specific project funded by the Institute. Audits conducted in accordance with the Single Audit Act of 1984
and OMB Circular A-128, or OMB Circular A-133 will satisfy the requirement for an annual fiscal audit.
The audit shall be conducted by an independent Certified Public Accountant, or a State or local agency authorized
to audit government agencies. 
Grantees who receive funds from a Federal agency and who satisfy audit requirements of the cognizant Federal agency,
should submit a copy of the audit report prepared for that Federal agency to the Institute in order to satisfy the provisions
of this section. Cognizant Federal agencies do not send reports to the Institute. Therefore, each grantee must send
this report directly to the Institute. 


2. Resolution and Clearance of Audit Reports 


Timely action on recommendations by responsible management officials is an integral part of the effectiveness of
an audit. Each grant recipient shall have policies and procedures for acting on audit recommendations by designating
officials responsible for: follow-up, maintaining a record of the actions taken on recommendations and time schedules,
responding to and acting on audit recommendations, and submitting periodic reports to the Institute on recommendations
and actions taken. 


3. Consequences of Non-Resolution of Audit Issues 


It is the general policy of the State Justice Institute not to make new grant awards to an applicant having an unresolved
audit report involving Institute awards. Failure of the grantee organization to resolve audit questions may also
result in the suspension of payments for active Institute grants to that organization. 


K. Close-Out of Grants 


1. Definition 


Close-out is a process by which the Institute determines that all applicable administrative and financial actions
and all required work of the grant have been completed by both the grantee and the Institute. 


2. Grantee Close-Out Requirements 


Within 90 days after the end date of the grant or any approved extension thereof (revised end date), the following documents
must be submitted to the Institute by a grantee other than a recipient of a scholarship under section II.B.2.b.v. 
a. 

Financial Status Report.

 The final report of expenditures must have no unliquidated obligations and must indicate the exact balance of unobligated
funds. Any unobligated/unexpended funds will be deobligated from the award by the Institute. Final payment requests
for obligations incurred during the award period must be submitted to the Institute prior to the end of the 90-day close-out
period. Grantees on a check-issued basis, who have drawn down funds in excess of their obligations/expenditures,
must return any unused funds as soon as it is determined that the funds are not required. In no case should any unused
funds remain with the grantee beyond the submission date of the final financial status report. 
b. 

Final Progress Report.

 This report should describe the project activities during the final calendar quarter of the project and the closeout
period, including to whom project products have been disseminated; provide a summary of activities during the entire
project; specify whether all the objectives set forth in the approved application or an approved adjustment thereto
have been met and, if any of the objectives have not been met, explain the reasons therefor; and discuss what, if anything,
could have been done differently that might have enhanced the impact of the project or improved its operation.

<TEXT>
 

3. Extension of Close-out Period 



Upon the written request of the grantee, the Institute may extend the close-out period to assure completion of the
Grantee's close-out requirements. Requests for an extension must be submitted at least 14 days before the end of the
close-out period and must explain why the extension is necessary and what steps will be taken to assure that all the
grantee's responsibilities will be met by the end of the extension period. 



XII. Grant Adjustments 



All requests for program or budget adjustments requiring Institute approval must be submitted in a timely manner
by the project director. All requests for changes from the approved application will be carefully reviewed for both
consistency with this guideline and the enhancement of grant goals and objectives. 



A. Grant Adjustments Requiring Prior Written Approval 



There are several types of grant adjustments which require the prior written approval of the Institute. Examples
of these adjustments include: 

1. Budget revisions among direct cost categories which, individually or in the aggregate, exceed or are expected
to exceed five percent of the approved original budget or the most recently approved revised budget. For the purposes
of this section, the Institute will view budget revisions cumulatively. 

a. For package grants, reallocations among budget categories of an individual project within the package that total
less than five percent of the approved budget for that project do not require a grant adjustment. However, transfers
of funds between projects included in the package require prior, written approval by the Institute. 

b. For continuation and on-going support grants, funds from the original award may be used during the renewal grant
period and funds awarded by a continuation or on-going support grant may be used to cover project-related expenditures
incurred during the original award period, with the prior, written approval of the Institute. 

2. A change in the scope of work to be performed or the objectives of the project (see section XII.D.). 

3. A change in the project site. 

4. A change in the project period, such as an extension of the grant period and/or extension of the final financial or
progress report deadline (see section XII.E.). 

5. Satisfaction of special conditions, if required. 

6. A change in or temporary absence of the project director (see sections XII.F. and G.).

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941006-2-00218 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941006-2-00113 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

7. The assignment of an employee or consultant to a key staff position whose qualifications were not described in the
application, or a change of a person assigned to a key project staff position (see section X.X.). 
8. A change in the name of the grantee organization. 
9. A transfer or contracting out of grant-supported activities (see section XII.H.). 
10. A transfer of the grant to another recipient. 
11. Preagreement costs, the purchase of automated data processing equipment and software, and consultant rates,
as specified in section XI.H.2. 
12. A change in the nature or number of the products to be prepared or the manner in which a product would be distributed.



B. Request for Grant Adjustments 


All grantees and subgrantees must promptly notify the SJI program managers, in writing, of events or proposed changes
which may require an adjustment to the approved application. In requesting an adjustment, the grantee must set forth
the reasons and basis for the proposed adjustment and any other information the SJI program managers determine would
help the Institute's review. 


C. Notification of Approval/Disapproval 


If the request is approved, the grantee will be sent a Grant Adjustment signed by the Executive Director or his/her
designee. If the request is denied, the grantee will be sent a written explanation of the reasons for the denial. 


D. Changes in the Scope of the Grant 


A grantee/subgrantee may make minor changes in methodology, approach, or other aspects of the grant to expedite achievement
of the grant's objectives with subsequent notification of the SJI program manager. Major changes in scope, duration,
training methodology, or other significant areas must be approved in advance by the Institute. 


E. Date Changes 


A request to change or extend the grant period must be made at least 30 days in advance of the end date of the grant. A revised
task plan should accompany requests for a no-cost extension of the grant period, along with a revised budget if shifts
among budget categories will be needed. A request to change or extend the deadline for the final financial report or
final progress report must be made at least 14 days in advance of the report deadline (see section XI.K.3.). 


F. Temporary Absence of the Project Director 


Whenever absence of the project director is expected to exceed a continuous period of one month, the plans for the conduct
of the project director's duties during such absence must be approved in advance by the Institute. This information
must be provided in a letter signed by an authorized representative of the grantee/subgrantee at least 30 days before
the departure of the project director, or as soon as it is known that the project director will be absent. The grant may
be terminated if arrangements are not approved in advance by the Institute. 


G. Withdrawal of/Change in Project Director 


If the project director relinquishes or expects to relinquish active direction of the project, the Institute must
be notified immediately. In such cases, if the grantee/subgrantee wishes to terminate the project, the Institute
will forward procedural instructions upon notification of such intent. If the grantee wishes to continue the project
under the direction of another individual, a statement of the candidate's qualifications should be sent to the Institute
for review and approval. The grant may be terminated if the qualifications of the proposed individual are not approved
in advance by the Institute. 


H. Transferring or Contracting Out of Grant-Supported Activities 


A principal activity of the grant-supported project shall not be transferred or contracted out to another organization
without specific prior approval by the Institute. All such arrangements should be formalized in a contract or other
written agreement between the parties involved. Copies of the proposed contract or agreement must be submitted for
prior approval at the earliest possible time. The contract or agreement must state, at a minimum, the activities to
be performed, the time schedule, the policies and procedures to be followed, the dollar limitation of the agreement,
and the cost principles to be followed in determining what costs, both direct and indirect, are to be allowed. The contract
or other written agreement must not affect the grantee's overall responsibility for the direction of the project
and accountability to the Institute.
