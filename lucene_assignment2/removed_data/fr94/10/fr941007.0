Agricultural Marketing Service









Use of Direct Final Rulemaking 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Policy statement.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Agricultural Marketing Service is implementing a new rulemaking procedure to expedite making noncontroversial
changes to its regulations. Rules that the agency judges to be non-controversial and unlikely to result in adverse
comments will be published as ``direct final'' rules. (``Adverse comments'' are comments that suggest that a rule
should not be adopted or suggest that a change should be made to the rule.) Each direct final rule will advise the public
that no adverse comments are anticipated, and that unless written adverse comments or written notice of intent to
submit adverse comments are received within 30 days, the revision made by the rule will be effective 60 days from the
date the direct final rule is published in the 

Federal Register

. This new policy should expedite the promulgation of routine or otherwise noncontroversial rules by reducing the
time that would be required to develop, review, clear, and publish separate proposed and final rules.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Agricultural Marketing Service is committed to improving the efficiency of its regulatory process. In pursuit
of this goal, we plan to employ the rulemaking procedure known as ``direct final rulemaking'' to promulgate some Agricultural
Marketing Service rules. 



The Direct Final Rule Process 



Rules that the Agricultural Marketing Service judges to be noncontroversial and unlikely to result in adverse comments
will be published as direct final rules. Each direct final rule will advise the public that no adverse comments are
anticipated, and that unless written adverse comments or written notice of intent to submit adverse comments are
received within 30 days, the revision made by the direct final rule will be effective 60 days from the date the direct
final rule is published in the 

Federal Register

. 

``Adverse comments'' are comments that suggest that the rule should not be adopted, or that suggest that a change should
be made to the rule. A comment expressing support for the rule as published will not be considered adverse. Further,
a comment suggesting that requirements in the rule should, or should not, be employed by the Agricultural Marketing
Service in other programs or situations outside the scope of the direct final rule will not be considered adverse.


In accordance with the rulemaking provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), the direct final
rulemaking procedure gives the public general notice of the Agricultural Marketing Service's intent to adopt a rule,
and gives interested persons an opportunity to participate in the rulemaking through submission of comments. The
major feature of direct final rulemaking is that if the Agricultural Marketing Service receives no written adverse
comments and no written notice of intent to submit adverse comments within 30 days of the publication of the direct
final rule, the rule will become effective without the need to publish a separate final rule. However, the Agricultural
Marketing Service will publish a notice in the 

Federal Register

 stating that no adverse comments were received regarding the direct final rule, and confirming that the direct final
rule is effective on the date stated in the direct final rule. 

If the Agricultural Marketing Service receives written adverse comments or written notice of intent to submit adverse
comments within 30 days of the publication of a direct final rule, a notice of withdrawal of the direct final rule will
be published in the 

Federal Register

. If the Agricultural Marketing Service intends to proceed with the rulemaking, the direct final rule will be republished
as a proposed rule and we will proceed with the normal notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures. 



Determining When to Use Direct Final Rulemaking 



Not all Agricultural Marketing Service rules are good candidates for direct final rulemaking. The Agricultural
Marketing Service intends to use the direct final rulemaking procedure only for rules that we consider to be noncontroversial
and unlikely to generate adverse comments. The decision to use direct final rulemaking for a rule will be based on the
Agricultural Marketing Service experience with similar rules.

Alternate Foods for Meals: Enriched Macaroni Products With Fortified Protein; National School Lunch Program 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Nutrition Service, USDA. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This final rule requires the use of the Protein Digestibility- 
Corrected Amino Acid Score (PDCAAS) instead of the Protein Efficiency Ratio 
(PER) for evaluating the biological quality of proteins in enriched macaroni 
products with fortified protein. This action is necessary for consistency 
with the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Nutrition Labeling Education Act 
regulations. The PDCAAS is a more accurate, efficient and less costly method 
for measuring protein quality of this food product used in the National School 
Lunch Program (NSLP). This rule also makes clear that enriched macaroni 
products may not be used for infants under one year of age. In addition, this 
rule deletes reference in the NSLP regulations to the FDA Standard of Identity 
(21 CFR 139.117) for enriched macaroni products with fortified protein which 
has been stayed by FDA and clarifies that protein quality is to be determined 
on the dry basis not on the cooked food. This rule also makes a typographical 
correction and in accordance with the Metric Conversion Act of 1975 adds the 
metric equivalent for all weights and measurements. This final rule further 
clarifies that manufacturers of enriched macaroni with fortified protein must 
notify the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) if there is a change in the 
protein content of their product after the original testing. FNS will assume 
the protein content of the product remains the same as that submitted for the 
original testing unless otherwise notified.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
This rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive 
Order 12866 and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of Management 
and Budget. 



This rule has been reviewed with regard to the requirements of the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612). The Administrator of FNS has 
certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities. There are currently fewer than ten 
companies participating in the Child Nutrition Programs (CNPs) under this 
regulation. In addition, the changes contained in this regulation are 
expected to reduce costs for the manufacturer. 

The Administrator of FNS has determined pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553 (b) and (d) 
that notice and comment on this rule prior to implementation is unnecessary 
and contrary to public interest. The public interest would be better served 
by allowing a more accurate and efficient method for measuring the protein 
quality of foods used in the NSLP. This change will allow food companies to 
minimize costs, thereby allowing them to provide quality products at the 
lowest cost possible. Moreover, receiving prior comment would be unnecessary 
and impracticable in this case for the following reasons. First, requiring 
prior notice and comment would waste valuable government resources. The Food 
Safety and Inspection Service of the Department of Agriculture (USDA) and FDA 
already have received and reviewed comments on this issue in response to 
proposed rules governing nutrition labeling of all regulated products, 
including products covered by this FNS regulation, and have published final 
regulations which accept the PDCAAS method. Second, FNS, with FDA 
concurrence, has already recognized the merits of the PDCAAS method in 
permitting its use for vegetable protein products (VPPs). Third, this rule 
provides affected parties an implementation period of 30 days during which 
either protein quality test may be used for enriched macaroni products.

Executive Order 12778 



This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is intended to have
preemptive effect with respect to any State or local laws, regulations or policies which conflict with its 
provisions or which would otherwise impede its full implementation. This rule 
is not intended to have retroactive effect unless so specified in the ``Date'' 
section of this preamble. Prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions 
of this rule or the application of the provisions, all applicable 
administrative procedures must be exhausted. In the NSLP, the administrative 
procedures are set forth under the following regulations: (1) school food 
authority appeals of State agency findings as a result of a Coordinated Review 
must follow State agency hearing procedures as established pursuant to 7 CFR 
210.18(q); (2) school food authority appeals of FNS findings as a result of a 
Coordinated Review must follow FNS hearing procedures as established pursuant 
to 7 CFR 210.30(d)(3); AND (3) State agency appeals of State Administrative 
Expense fund sanctions (7 CFR 235.11(b)) must follow the FNS Administrative 
Review Process as established pursuant to 7 CFR 235.11(f). 

The NSLP is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 
10.555 and is subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372 which 
requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. (7 
CFR Part 3015, Subpart V and final rule-related notice at 48 FR 29114, June 
24, 1983). 

No new data collection or recordkeeping requiring Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB) approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 
3501 through 3502) are included in this rule. 

Background: On March 27, 1974, the Department published final regulations (39 FR 11248) which defined enriched macaroni
products with fortified protein as a food item meeting the NSLP meal pattern requirements specified in 7 CFR 210.10
under specified terms and conditions. At that time, the PER was the only recognized test for determining the biological
quality of protein in foods. At present, there is another recognized method for determining the biological quality
of protein in foods, the PDCAAS method. Several international bodies, including a Joint Expert Consultation on Protein
Evaluation of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations and the World Health Organization
(WHO) (1989), have concluded that PDCAAS, in which a score of 1.0 equals 100 percent of the 1985 WHO essential amino
acid requirement patterns for 2 to 5 year olds, is an appropriate method for evaluating food protein quality. The 2
to 5 year old requirement is the most inclusive of those recommended and thus may be used for all age groups, except infants.


PER is based on the assumption that proteins which are equivalent to casein meet the amino acid and protein requirements
for the various age groups 
consuming a particular food. The specification of this methodology, which is 
based upon rodent nutrition requirements, was assumed to correlate to human 
requirements when PER was adopted as the sole regulatory method for 
determining protein quality. Extensive studies have since been conducted on 
human amino acid requirements which demonstrate that the essential amino acid 
requirements of humans are significantly different from those of rodents. 
This was recognized as early as 1980 by a conference of protein scientists and 
nutritionists held to assess protein quality in humans. A report of this 
working conference indicated a dissatisfaction with the PER method. The 
report further recognized that an amino acid scoring system, corrected for 
digestibility, is an appropriate alternative for measuring protein value.

In 1985, WHO published its revised Energy and Protein Requirement Report 
prepared by a Joint Expert Consultation of the FAO/WHO and United Nations 
University (UNU). This consultation revised amino acid pattern requirements 
for humans into age groups of 2 to 5 years, 6 to 12 years, and adult, and 
extensively reviewed the requirements based on amino acid scoring and 
digestibility. Of the three amino acid patterns established, the 2 to 5 year 
old child pattern has the highest individual and total requirements. The 
report stated that protein and diets containing essential amino acids that met 
the greater needs of young children were also adequate for older children and 
adults, whereas the reverse may not be true. On this basis, the Joint FAO/WHO 
Expert Consultation on Protein Evaluation (1989) concluded that no adequate 
basis existed for using different scoring patterns for different age groups, 
with the exception of infants, who have a much greater need for essential 
amino acids. They recommended that the FAO/WHO/UNU amino acid scoring pattern 
for preschool children should be used to evaluate protein quality for all age 
groups, except infants. PDCAAS was recommended for calculating dietary 
protein intakes. Thus, precise human amino acid requirement patterns are 
available for all age groups. 

Both FNS and the FDA have recognized the applicability and usefulness of the PDCAAS method of measuring protein quality.
The regulation governing the use of VPP in the Child Nutrition Programs, 7 CFR Parts 210, 225 and 226, Appendix A - Alternate
Foods for Meals; Vegetable Protein Products, published January 7, 1983, allowed FNS to approve an alternate test
for measuring the biological quality of protein for VPP. This provision was included in the regulation in anticipation
of recognition by the scientific community and FDA of the PDCAAS. FNS has since accepted the PDCAAS method in addition
to the PER method for determining protein quality of VPP. This acceptance was based on the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation
on Protein Evaluation (1989) and with FDA's concurrence. 

On July 19, 1990 (55 FR 29487 at 29499), FDA stated that their regulatory 
requirements to use PER ``inhibit(ed) flexibility in determining protein 
quality by alternative methodologies.'' At that time, FDA proposed to continue 
the use of the PER, while also allowing use of alternative acceptable 
validated procedures as they become available. 

Subsequently, in response to a petition from Protein Technologies 
International, Inc., FDA stated in the preamble to the nutrition labeling 
proposal published on November 27, 1991 (56 FR 60366 at 60369), that 
permitting PDCAAS to be used as an alternative to PER had merit. In 
commenting on that petition FDA quoted its earlier comments on the need for a 
flexible approach to determining protein quality:

 


As new methodologies and new information on amino acid requirements of 
various age groups become available, the agency believes it must become 
more flexible in regard to permitted protein quality methodologies. 
Therefore, while the PER method described in the Official Methods of 
Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists may continue 
to be used as one of the methods for assessing the protein quality of 
foods, alternative acceptable validated procedures may be used as they 
become available. (55 FR 29487 at 29499).


 

However, FDA later proposed to require the PDCAAS, stating in the preamble (56 FR 60366 at 60370) that:

 


The agency has reviewed the FAO/WHO report and tentatively accepts its 
conclusion that the protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score 
method is more appropriate for assessing protein quality of foods than 
animal assays and is preferable for regulatory purposes.

 


In October, 1989, the Subcommittee on the 10th Edition of the Recommended 
Dietary Allowances published the revised Recommended Dietary Allowances. 
These new allowances confirm and accept the amino acid requirement pattern as 
published by the WHO, 1985, and recognize PDCAAS as an appropriate method of 
assessing protein quality of human diets. The amino acid requirements for the 
2 to 5 year old suggested by both of these scientific bodies are identical. 
The Codex Alimentarius Vegetable Protein Committee as well as the Codex 
Committee on Special Dietary Foods have also recommended amino acid scoring 
for evaluation of vegetable proteins and special dietary foods. 

The PDCAAS was considered and accepted by the Joint FAO/WHO Codex Alimentarius Commission which convened in Geneva,
Switzerland during July 1989. An Expert Consultation convened at the request of the Codex Alimentarius Commission
reviewed the amino acid scoring methodologies and recommended the 
implementation of the PDCAAS for measuring protein quality. After extensive 
deliberation, resulting in a comprehensive report, it was reported that, 
``. . . the Consultation agreed that the Protein Digestibility-Corrected Amino 
Acid Score method was the most suitable approach for routine evaluation of 
protein quality for humans, and recommended the adoption of this method as an 
official method at the international level.'' (Joint FAO/WHO Expert 
Consultation on Protein Evaluation, Codex Alimentarius, Washington, D.C., 
1989). The Expert Consultation's report and recommendations were transmitted 
to the FAO Secretariat in Rome for final review and dissemination to the Codex 
Alimentarius Commission membership. The report of the Expert Consultation 
contains many findings and conclusions, most supportive of the PDCAAS. No 
conclusions adverse to this method were reported.

On January 6, 1993, FDA published final rules (58 FR 2079) requiring use of 
the PDCAAS method as the method for determining protein quality for food 
intended for children over 1 year of age and adults. While this method is 
recommended for all children above 1 year of age, it is not recommended for 
infants, and therefore FDA's final rule (58 FR 2079 at 2102) retained the PER 
method for assessing protein quality and retained casein as the standard in 
expressing the percentage of the Reference Daily Intake (RDI) for protein in 
foods represented and purported to be for use by infants. This rule became 
effective on May 8, 1994. In recognition of these scientific advances and the 
adoption by FDA of PDCAAS as the only method for determining protein quality 
for children above one year of age, this rule amends the NSLP regulations at 
appendix A of Part 210 to require PDCAAS as the only method for determining 
protein quality for enriched macaroni. However, in order to provide affected 
parties an implementation period, the amended paragraph 2 further provides 
that for 30 days after publication of the rule either the PER or the PDCAAS 
may be used. 
Finally, a new paragraph 1(c) is added to Appendix A to make clear that 
enriched macaroni may not be used for infants under 1 year of age in the NSLP. 
Accordingly, FNS will no longer approve enriched macaroni products purported 
for use by infants regardless of what method their protein quality has been 
tested. It was never the Department's intention that enriched macaroni 
products be served to infants and this amendment is meant to make clear that 
policy. 
Manufacturers of enriched macaroni with fortified protein, currently approved 
by FNS, will not be affected by the change to an alternate method unless the 
nutritional composition of their approved product changes. Should the 
nutritional composition of an approved product previously tested under PER 
method change after the 30 day implementation period, data obtained by the 
PDCAAS method will be required for re-approval. 
The FDA Standard of Identity (21 CFR 139.117), referenced and quoted in 
Appendix A and upon which the FNS final regulation was based, was stayed on 
March 21, 1978, pending a determination of whether a public hearing was 
necessary to resolve issues raised by objections (43 FR 11695). At that time, 
FDA stated that ``during the period of the stay, the (enriched macaroni 
products with fortified protein) may be introduced into interstate commerce 
with appropriate labeling as a nonstandardized food.'' (43 FR 11695). 
Therefore, this rule deletes all references to that Standard in Appendix A. 
However, the requirements for processing and labeling of enriched macaroni 
products with fortified protein prescribed by FDA in the stayed Standard of 
Identity were previously incorporated in the FNS final rule and will remain 
the same, with some technical changes. 
In addition, this final rule amends the current regulation to correct a 
statement which has caused confusion and which was recently brought to our 
attention by analytical laboratories. The current regulation states that the 
protein quality is to be determined on the cooked food. However, determining 
protein quality on the cooked food is not feasible in practice, because when 
utilizing the PER method the moisture content prevents laboratory rodents from 
eating test foods in sufficient quantities to accurately determine protein 
quality. Likewise, the moisture content in the cooked food may affect the 
test results under the PDCAAS method. Therefore, FAO/WHO suggests a moisture 
content in the cooked food of less than ten percent for viable testing. 
Determinations made on a dry basis has been the procedure commonly employed by 
commercial laboratories in the past. Thus, this rule requires determination 
of protein quality on a dry basis. 
This final rule makes a typographical correction and, in accordance with the 
Metric Conversion Act of 1975, adds, side by side, the metric equivalent for 
all weights and measurements contained in the rule. 
This final rule also includes a clarification that all manufacturers, 
including those with currently accepted macaroni products, must notify FNS if 
there is a change in the protein portion of their product since the original 
data submission and product approval. FNS will assume the protein content 
remains the same unless otherwise notified.

Appendix A to Part 210_Alternate Foods for Meals 
Enriched Macaroni Products With Fortified Protein 


1. * * *
(c) Enriched macaroni product may not be used for infants under 1 year 
of age. 
2. Only enriched macaroni products with fortified protein that have been 
accepted by FNS for use in the USDA Child Nutrition Programs may be 
labeled as provided in paragraph 1(b) of this appendix. Manufacturers 
seeking acceptance of their product shall furnish FNS a chemical 
analysis, the Protein Digestibility-Corrected Amino Acid Score (PDCAAS), 
and such other pertinent data as may be requested by FNS, except that 
prior to November 7, 1994, manufacturers may 
submit protein efficiency ratio analysis in lieu of the PDCAAS. This 
information is to be forwarded to: Director, Nutrition and Technical 
Services Division, Food and Nutrition Service, U.S. Department of 
Agriculture, 3101 Park Center Drive, room 607, Alexandria, VA 22302. 
All laboratory analyses are to be performed by independent or other 
laboratories acceptable to FNS. (FNS prefers an independent 
laboratory.) All laboratories shall retain the ``raw'' laboratory data 
for a period of 1 year. Such information shall be made available to FNS 
upon request. Manufacturers must notify FNS if there is a change in the 
protein portion of their product after the original testing. 
Manufacturers who report such a change in protein in a previously 
approved product must submit protein data in accordance with the method 
specified in this paragraph. 
3. The product should not be designed in such a manner that would require 
it to be classified as a Dietary Supplement as described by the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) in 21 CFR part 105. To be accepted by FNS, 
enriched macaroni products with fortified protein must conform to the 
following requirements: 
(a)(1) Each of these foods is produced by drying formed units of dough 
made with one or more of the milled wheat ingredients designated in 21 
CFR 139.110(a) and 139.138(a), and other ingredients to enable the 
finished food to meet the protein requirements set out in paragraph 
3.(a)(2)(i) under Enriched Macaroni Products with Fortified Protein in 
this Appendix. Edible protein sources, including food grade flours or 
meals made from nonwheat cereals or from oilseeds, may be used. Vitamin 
and mineral enrichment nutrients are added to bring the food into 
conformity with the requirements of paragraph (b) under Enriched 
Macaroni Products with Fortified Protein in this Appendix. Safe and 
suitable ingredients, as provided for in paragraph (c) under Enriched 
Macaroni Products with Fortified Protein in this Appendix, may be added. 
The proportion of the milled wheat ingredient is larger than the 
proportion of any other ingredient used.

(2) Each such finished food, when tested by the methods described in 
the pertinent sections of ``Official Methods of Analysis of the AOAC 
International,'' (formerly the Association of Official Analytical 
Chemists), 15th Ed. (1990) meets the following specifications. This 
publication is incorporated by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 
552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies may be obtained from the AOAC 
International, 2200 Wilson Blvd., suite 400, Arlington, VA 22201-3301. 
This publication may be examined at the Food and Nutrition Service, 
Nutrition and Technical Services Division, 3101 Park Center Drive, room 
607, Alexandria, Virginia 22302 or the Office of the Federal Register, 
800 North Capital Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. 
(i) The protein content (N x 6.25) is not less than 20 percent by weight 
(on a 13 percent moisture basis) as determined by the appropriate method 
of analysis in the AOAC manual cited in (a)(2) under Enriched Macaroni 
Products with Fortified Protein in this Appendix. The protein quality 
is not less than 95 percent that of casein as determined on a dry basis 
by the PDCAAS method as described below: 
(A) The PDCAAS shall be determined by the methods given in sections 
5.4.1, 7.2.1. and 8.0 as described in ``Protein Quality Evaluation, 
Report of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation on Protein Quality 
Evaluation,'' Rome, 1990, as published by the Food and Agriculture 
Organization (FAO) of the United Nations/World Health Organization 
(WHO). This report is incorporated by reference in accordance with 5 
U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies of this report may be obtained 
from the Nutrition and Technical Services Division, Food and Nutrition 
Service, 3101 Park Center Drive, room 607, Alexandria, Virginia 22302. 
This report may also be inspected at the Office of the Federal Register 
800 North Capitol St., NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. 
(B) The standard used for assessing protein quality in the PDCAAS method 
is the amino acid scoring pattern established by FAO/WHO and United 
Nations University (UNU) in 1985 for preschool children 2 to 5 years of 
age which has been adopted by the National Academy of Sciences, 
Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA), 1989. 
(C) To calculate the PDCAAS for an individual food, the test food must 
be analyzed for proximate analysis and amino acid composition according 
to AOAC methods. 
(D) The PDCAAS may be calculated using FDA's limited data base of 
published true digestibility values (determined using humans and rats). 
The true digestibility values contained in the WHO/FAO report referenced 
in paragraph 3.(a)(2)(i)(A) under Enriched Macaroni Products with 
Fortified Protein in this Appendix may also be used. If the 
digestibility of the protein is not available from these sources it must 
be determined by a laboratory according to methods in the FAO/WHO report 
(sections 7.2.1 and 8.0). 
(E) The most limiting essential amino acid (that is, the amino acid that 
is present at the lowest level in the test food compared to the 
standard) is identified in the test food by comparing the levels of 
individual amino acids in the test food with the 1985 FAO/WHO/UNU 
pattern of essential amino acids established as a standard for children 
2 to 5 years of age. 
(F) The value of the most limiting amino acid (the ratio of the amino 
acid in the test food over the amino acid value from the pattern) is 
multiplied by the percent of digestibility of the protein. The 
resulting number is the PDCAAS. 
(G) The PDCAAS of food mixtures must be calculated from data for the 
amino acid composition and digestibility of the individual components by 
means of a weighted average procedure. An example for calculating a 
PDCAAS for a food mixture of varying protein sources is shown in section 
8.0 of the FAO/WHO report cited in paragraph 3.(a)(2)(i)(A) under 
Enriched Macaroni Products with Fortified Protein in this Appendix.

(H) For the purpose of this regulation, each 100 grams of the product 
(on a 13 percent moisture basis) must contain protein in amounts which 
is equivalent to that provided by 20 grams of protein with a quality of 
not less than 95 percent casein. The equivalent grams of protein 
required per 100 grams of product (on a 13 percent moisture basis) would 
be determined by the following equation: 









X=grams of protein required per 100 grams of 
product 
a=20 grams (amount of protein if casein) 
b=.95 [95%  x  1 (PDCAAS of casein)] 
c=PDCAAS for protein used in formulation 
(ii) The total solids content is not less than 87 percent by weight as 
determined by the methods described in the ``Official Methods of Analysis 
of the AOAC International'' cited in paragraph (a)(2) under Enriched 
Macaroni Products with Fortified Protein in this Appendix. 
(b)(1) Each pound of food covered by this section shall contain 5 
milligrams of thiamine, 2.2 milligrams of riboflavin, 34 milligrams of 
niacin or niacinamide, and 16.5 milligrams of iron. 
(2) Each pound of such food may also contain 625 milligrams of calcium. 
(3) Only harmless and assimilable forms of iron and calcium may be 
added. The enrichment nutrients may be added in a harmless carrier used 
only in a quantity necessary to effect a uniform distribution of the 
nutrients in the finished food. Reasonable overages, within the limits 
of good manufacturing practice, may be used to assure that the 
prescribed levels of the vitamins and mineral(s) in paragraphs (b)(1) 
and (2) under Enriched Macaroni Products with Fortified Protein in this 
Appendix are maintained throughout the expected shelf life of the food 
under customary conditions of distribution. 
(c) Ingredients that serve a useful purpose such as to fortify the 
protein or facilitate production of the food are the safe and suitable 
ingredients referred to in paragraph (a) under Enriched Macaroni 
Products with Fortified Protein in this Appendix. This does not include 
color additives, artificial flavorings, artificial sweeteners, chemical 
preservatives, or starches. Ingredients deemed suitable for use by this 
paragraph are added in amounts that are not in excess of those 
reasonably required to achieve their intended purposes. Ingredients are 
deemed to be safe if they are not food additives within the meaning of 
section 201(s) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or in case 
they are food additives if they are used in conformity with regulations 
established pursuant to section 409 of the act. 
(d)(1) The name of any food covered by this section is ``Enriched Wheat 


XXXXXXXX

 Macaroni Product with Fortified Protein'', the blank being filled 
in with appropriate word(s) such as ``Soy'' to show the source of any 
flours or meals used that were made from non-wheat cereals or from

Tomatoes Grown in Florida; Amendment of Rules and Regulations 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim final rule. 





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This interim rule clarifies registered handler application and approval procedures and the Florida Tomato Committee's
(committee) authority to cancel a handler's certificate of registration for good cause. The rule also clarifies
that only registered handlers of Florida tomatoes may ship such tomatoes in interstate commerce. This rule also adds
special purpose shipment outlets, redefines one of those outlets, and brings the order's special purpose shipment
provisions into conformity with each other. Finally, this rule provides that handlers must report packout information
on a daily basis to the committee or an authorized agent of the committee. This rule is expected to enhance compliance
with the order and regulations and bring the regulations into conformity with current industry practices. The amendments
were unanimously recommended by the committee. In addition, the Department of Agriculture (Department) makes conforming
changes. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
This rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 966 [7 CFR part 966], both as amended, regulating the handling
of tomatoes grown in Florida. The order is authorized by the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended
[7 U.S.C. 601-674], hereinafter referred to as the ``Act''. 



The Department is issuing this rule in accordance with Executive Order 12866. 

This rule has been reviewed under Executive 
Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform and is not intended to have retroactive effect. This rule will not preempt any State
or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 

The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After a hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after the date of entry of the ruling.

Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. 
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
There are approximately 50 handlers of Florida tomatoes subject to regulation under the marketing order and approximately
250 producers in the production area. Small agricultural service firms, including tomato handlers, are defined
by the Small Business Administration 
[13 CFR 121.601] as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000, and small agricultural producers have been
defined as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000. The majority of the tomato handlers and producers may
be classified as small entities. 
On May 31, 1994, the committee met to discuss the difficulty it has experienced in collecting assessments from a few
handlers and in receiving complete, up-to-date packout information from some handlers. The committee recommended
several modifications to the order's existing rules and regulations to improve these situations. 


Handler Certification


Currently, pursuant to  966.323 Handling regulation, fresh market shipments of tomatoes by handlers to points
outside the regulated area must meet grade, size, inspection, and container requirements. Fresh market shipments
within the regulated area are not subject to such requirements. Fresh market shipments within and outside the regulated
area are subject to assessments. The regulated area is defined as the portion of the State of Florida which is bounded
by the Suwannee River, the Georgia Border, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Gulf of Mexico. Basically, it is the entire State
of Florida, except the Panhandle. The production area is part of the regulated area. 
Under  966.113 Registered handler, and for the purpose of this order, registered handlers are persons who have
adequate facilities for grading tomatoes for market and who assume initial responsibility for compliance with inspection,
assessment, reporting, and other regulatory requirements concerning tomatoes grown in the production area. Any
person who wishes to become a registered handler is required to make an application for registration with the committee
on forms prescribed by, and available at the principle office of, the committee. If the applicant has facilities which
are determined by the committee as adequate for grading tomatoes, the applicant may be approved as a registered handler.
``Adequate facilities'' are currently defined as those being in a permanent location with nonportable equipment
for the proper grading, sizing and packing of tomatoes. The committee recommended two minor additions to the definition:
(1) The term ``washing'' should be added to the definition, as that activity is an integral part of the handling process;
and (2) the phrase ``grown in the production area'' be added at the end of the definition to further identify the tomatoes
being handled. 
Most tomatoes produced in Florida are shipped fresh to markets outside the regulated area. The committee's goal is
to avoid marketing problems associated with poor quality tomato shipments. The industry has spent substantial sums
of money to promote Florida tomatoes to the trade and consumers. Such expenditures are predicated on the shipment
by handlers of good quality tomatoes, which buyers have come to expect from Florida. 
The committee reported that it has been difficult to collect assessments from some handlers in the past. One handler
indicates no intention of paying assessments this year. Because of these compliance difficulties, and to foster
shipments of good quality tomatoes, the committee recommended changes in the rules and regulations to strengthen
the registered handler procedures, clarify handler responsibilities under the order, and enhance the committee's
compliance capabilities. 
The committee recommended amending  966.113 and adopting new provisions which would: (1) Establish that registered
handlers must be certified by the committee; 
(2) provide the committee with the authority, criteria, and procedures for approving registered handler certifications
and for cancelling such certifications for failure to pay assessments or provide reports to the committee; and 
(3) allow only registered handlers to lawfully ship tomatoes outside of the regulated area. After considering the
committee's recommendations, the Department has determined that the changes in this interim rule are necessary
to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. 
New  966.113 contains an introductory statement explaining the criteria that a handler must meet to be registered
under the order. These provisions include having adequate facilities and being certified by the committee as a registered
handler, handling tomatoes in compliance with order requirements, obtaining inspection, submitting required
reports, and paying applicable assessments. Four of these provisions are currently specified in  966.113.
The provisions for certification as a registered handler and submission of reports are added in this rule to help the
committee with its compliance responsibilities and improve marketing assistance provided to handlers under the
order.

New paragraph (a) establishes qualifications for registered handler certification. The committee or its duly authorized
agent inspects handling facilities to determine if those facilities meet the requirements for certification. The
facilities must be located in the regulated area and be permanent, non-portable buildings. The equipment in the facilities
must also be nonportable and capable of properly washing, grading, sizing, and packing of tomatoes grown in the production
area. These requirements are the same as those in the current definition for 

Adequate facilities 

in paragraph (e) of  966.323, with the addition of washing as an activity and the reference to where the tomatoes
are produced. The definition is removed from paragraph (e) of 
 966.323 and, as modified, added to new paragraph (a) of 
 966.113 to define, in the appropriate place in the rules and regulations, the kind of facilities and equipment
needed for certification as a registered handler. 
New paragraph (b) of  966.113 specifies the information requested by the committee in the application for registered
handler certification. The information requested is common business identification information. 
New paragraph (c) of  966.113 provides that the committee or an agent of the committee make the determination
that an applicant's facilities meet requirements. Such certification will be made in writing by the committee. Denial
of certification, and the basis thereof, will also be made in writing to the applicant by the committee. 
New paragraph (d) of  966.113 establishes criteria for cancellation of a registered handler's certification,
with the approval of the Secretary, based on failure to pay assessments on a timely basis and failure to provide required
reports. A registered handler's certification will also be subject to cancellation, with the approval of the Secretary,
if the handler no longer has adequate facilities, as that term is defined in  966.113(a). A cancelled certification
will be reinstated once a handler demonstrates compliance with assessment, reporting and facility requirements.
New paragraph (d) also includes the exemption, currently in  966.113, concerning persons who make deliveries
of ungraded tomatoes to handling facilities. 


New paragraph (e) of  966.113 provides that any inspection certificate of tomatoes offered for inspection
by a non-registered handler contains a statement to that effect. The inspection certificate for all such tomato lots
will read ``Fails to meet the requirements of Marketing Order No. 966 because the handler is not a registered handler.''
Such failing certificate will be issued, regardless of the grade, size or containerization of the tomatoes inspected.
The committee will keep the Federal State Inspection Service (inspection service) abreast of all handlers' status.
Any handler who is denied a registered handler certificate or who has a registered handler certificate cancelled,
may appeal to the committee for reconsideration. Such appeal must be made in writing. 
The Florida Road Guard Bureau of the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services releases tomato shipments
for interstate commerce only if the inspection certificates indicate that such shipments meet marketing order requirements.
Thus, persons or handlers not certified as a registered handler by the committee will not be able to ship tomatoes outside
the regulated area. 
The committee recommended that this provision be included under a separate title and paragraph. Because inspection
certification is dependent on handler certification, the Department includes this recommendation as part of the
new provision on certified registered handlers in  966.113. For emphasis and to provide consistency in regulations,
the Department also adds this requirement to paragraph (a)(4) 

Inspection 

in  966.323. 


Section 966.113 provides that handlers must pay assessments on a timely basis to maintain their registered handler
certification. For emphasis and to provide consistency in regulations, the Department also adds this requirement
as new paragraph (e) 

Assessments 

under 
 966.323.

Certificates of Privilege 


The committee recommended changing an incorrect citation in the first sentence of  966.120 Application for
Certificate of Privilege which incorrectly refers to 
 966.53 of the order. The committee states that the intent of the section is to require Certificates of Privilege
for special purpose shipments authorized in  966.54 Shipments for special purposes. Thus,  966.54 is
referenced in the first sentence of the paragraph. This adjustment does not change current practices as the committee's
use of Certificates of Privilege is consistent with  966.54 of the order. 
This rule also changes  966.120 to be consistent with the outlets specified in  966.323 Handling regulations.
One outlet currently specified in  966.120 is changed and three new outlets are added. The term ``processing''
replaces the term ``canning'' to make the regulations consistent with current industry practice. Pickling, experimental
purposes and export, which are currently specified in  966.323(b), are added to  966.120. The committee
also proposed that it have the authority, with the Secretary's approval, to add other outlets to meet changing food
technologies and services which could benefit from receiving tomatoes shipped under Certificate of Privilege.
This authority is added to  966.120. 
The Department makes conforming changes to 
paragraph (b) of  966.323 to make that paragraph consistent with the changes to  966.120. The term ``canning''
is changed to ``processing'' and committee authority to add special purpose outlets, with the Secretary's approval,
is added as conforming changes. 
The Department also adds a definition for ``processing'' to paragraph (e)  966.323 Definitions. ``Processing''
is defined as the manufacture of any tomato product which has been converted into juice, or preserved by any commercial
process, including canning, dehydrating, drying, and the addition of chemical substances. Also, paragraph (e)
of 
 966.323, as provided herein, is redesignated as 
paragraph (g). 


Packout Reports


The committee also recommended that all handlers be required to present daily packout reports to the inspection service.
The inspection service currently collects these reports from most handlers for inspection billing purposes and
sends a daily packout report to the committee. 
Currently, all handlers maintain records of their daily packout activity based on the grade, size, and containers
of tomatoes handled. The inspection service collects this data at the end of each work day for inspection billing purposes.
As a service to the committee and tomato handlers, the inspection service compiles this information (received from
its various inspectors) and reports it to the committee at the end of the day or the following morning. The committee
compiles this data into a daily, industry-wide, packout report. The report is considered an indispensable tool for
handlers to assess daily tomato market conditions and is disseminated, upon request, to registered handlers. 
However, some handlers fail to provide their packout data to the inspection service on a timely basis to allow inclusion
of the handler's data in each daily, industry-wide report. To be a useful tool, the industry-wide report must be accurate
and include, to the extent possible, the total industry packout. Because the report is such a valuable marketing tool
for handlers, the committee voted unanimously to propose that each registered handler be required to report the handler's
daily packout data to the inspection service in a timely manner. 
The packout data that handlers provide to the inspection service, to the committee directly, or to another agent of
the committee is data that is routinely compiled by each handler as part of the handler's normal, daily operating records.
The reporting deadline of the end of the working day, as designated by the committee, will not present an undue burden
on handlers because the data requested is routinely recorded by handlers at the end of each working day. Individual
handler data collated and disseminated in an industry-wide report will not disclose confidential information or
the business position of individual handlers. 
The committee recommended that this change be added to the rules and regulations as a separate, new number, title and
paragraph. However, because the new provision establishes a reporting requirement on handlers, the Department
inserts the provision as a separate, new paragraph under current  966.323. Thus, a new 
paragraph (e) is added to the handling regulation and current paragraph (e) 

Definitions 

is redesignated as paragraph (g). 


Assessments


Finally, the committee recommended that a clarification be added to the rules and regulations to clearly state that
handlers must pay assessments to maintain their certification as registered handlers. Failure of some handlers
to pay their assessments places an unfair burden upon those handlers who comply with order requirements. The Department
adds that this clarification to  966.323 handling regulation because payment of assessments is a requirement
of handlers under the order. A new paragraph (f) 

Assessments 

is added to  966.323. This paragraph stated that failure of a registered handler to pay assessments in a timely
manner will result in cancellation of the registered handler's status, thus, making that handler ineligible to ship
tomatoes outside of the regulated area. Current committee collection procedures are: 
(1) Weekly assessment billings during the harvest season; (2) payment within 30 days; (3) followed by a demand letter
specifying the end of a 15 day extended notice period; and (4) referral to the Department for legal action. Under this
rule, a handler who has not paid assessments after expiration of the extended notice period provided in the demand
letter will be considered out of compliance and will be reported to the inspection service as a non-registered handler.

Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this interim rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
In accordance with the Paper Work Reduction Act of 1980, [44 U.S.C. Chapter 35], the information collection requirement
contained in this rule has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for approval and has been assigned
OMB No. 0581-0073. Because handlers currently complete a form to be certified as a registered handler, no additional
OMB approval is needed for such registration. However, this rule provides that each registered handler, at the end
of each day in which tomatoes are handled by the registered handler, furnish the committee or it's designated agent
an accurate accounting of the number of tomato containers packed that day. This report provides the grade, size, and
containers of tomatoes packed by the handler each packing day. Because the information is readily available from
each day's packout, the report takes five minutes to complete. The committee needs this information to compile a daily
packout report which is used by handlers in their marketing efforts. This provision is consistent with current industry
practice. It is estimated that 50 handlers currently submit daily reports and receive marketing assistance during
the marketing period October 10, through June 15 each year. 
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is found and determined, upon good cause, that it is impracticable, unnecessary and contrary
to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect, and that good cause exists
for not postponing the effective date of this rule until 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

 because this rule: (1) clarifies order regulations and makes those regulations consistent with current conditions
in the industry; (2) is expected to improve compliance with order requirements; (3) needs to be in effect as soon as
possible because the marketing season begins on October 10, 1994; (4) was unanimously recommended by the committee
at a public meeting; and (5) provides a 30-day comment period and all comments timely received will be considered prior
to the finalization of this rule.

List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 966



Marketing agreements, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Tomatoes.




For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 7 CFR part 966 is amended as follows: 



PART 966_TOMATOES GROWN IN FLORIDA 



1. The authority citation for 7 CFR part 966 continues to read as follows: 






Authority:

 7 U.S.C. 601-674.




2. Section 966.113 is revised to read as follows: 



 966.113

Registered handler certification. 



Each handler who handles tomatoes grown in the production area must be certified as a registered handler by the committee
in order to ship such tomatoes outside of the regulated area. A handler who is certified as a registered handler is a
handler who has adequate facilities to meet the requirements for preparing tomatoes for market, obtains inspection
on tomatoes handled, agrees to handle tomatoes in compliance with the order's grade, size and container requirements,
pays applicable assessments on a timely basis, submits reports required by the committee, and agrees to comply with
other regulatory requirements on the handling of tomatoes grown in the production area. 

(a) Based on the criteria specified in this section, the committee shall determine eligibility for certification
as a registered handler. The committee or its authorized agent shall inspect a handler's facilities to determine
if the facilities are adequate for preparing tomatoes for market. In order to be adequate for such purposes, the facilities
must be permanent, nonportable buildings located in the production area with equipment that is nonportable for the
proper washing, grading, sizing and packing of tomatoes grown in the production area. 

(b) Application for certification shall be executed by the handler and filed with the committee on a form, prescribed
by and available at the principal office of the committee, containing the following information: 

(1) Business name, 

(2) Address of handling facilities (including telephone and facsimile number), 

(3) Mailing address (if different from handling facility), 

(4) Number of years in tomato business in Florida, 

(5) Type of business, and 

(6) Names of senior officers, partners, or principal owners with financial interest in the business. 

(c) If the committee determines from available information that an applicant meets the criteria specified in this
section, such applicant shall be certified as a registered handler and shall be so informed by written notice from
the committee. If certification is denied, such denial shall be made by the committee in writing, stating the reasons
for denial. 

(d) A registered handler's certification shall be cancelled by the committee, with the approval of the Secretary,
if the handler fails to pay assessments within 
45 days of the end of the assessment billing period, fails to provide reports, or no longer has adequate facilities
as described in this section. Cancellation of a handler's registration shall be made in writing to the handler and
shall specify the reason(s) for and effective date of such cancellation. The committee shall recertify the handler's
registration at such time as the handler corrects the deficiencies which resulted in the cancellation. Certification
is permanent until the committee determines, based on criteria herein, that cancellation is warranted. Persons
who make deliveries of ungraded tomatoes to such certified registered handlers are hereby determined to be exempt
from otherwise applicable regulations pursuant to this part. 

(e) During any period in which the handling of tomatoes is regulated pursuant to this part, no handler shall obtain
an inspection certifying that said handler's tomatoes meet the requirements of the marketing order unless said handler
has been certified as a registered handler. Any person who is not certified as a registered handler may receive inspection
on tomatoes from the Federal-State Inspection Service. Such inspection certificate shall state ``Fails to meet
the requirements of Marketing Order No. 966 because the handler is not a registered handler.'' 

3. In  966.120, paragraph (a) is revised to read as follows: 



 966.120

Application for Certificate of Privilege. 



(a) Whenever handling is regulated pursuant to  966.54, each handler desiring to make shipments of tomatoes
for any of the following purposes shall, prior thereto, apply to the committee for and obtain a Certificate of Privilege
permitting such shipment: 

(1) For pickling, or 

(2) For processing, or 

(3) For experimental purposes, or 

(4) For relief or charity, or 

(5) For export, or 

(6) For other purposes which may be specified by the committee, with the approval of the Secretary. 



* * * * * 



4. Section 966.323 is amended by revising 
paragraphs (a)(4) and (b), redesignating paragraph (e) as paragraph (g), revising redesignated paragraph (g),
and adding new paragraphs (e) and (f) to read as follows: 


 966.323

(4) 

Inspection. 

Tomatoes shall be inspected and certified pursuant to the provisions of  966.60. Each handler who applies for
inspection shall register with the committee pursuant to  966.113. Persons not certified by the committee
as a registered handler shall be issued inspection certificates on shipments handled by such persons stating ``Fails
to meet the requirements of Marketing Order No. 966 because the handler is not a registered handler.'' Evidence of
inspection must accompany truck shipments. 

(b) 

Special purpose shipments. 

The requirements of paragraph (a) of this section shall not be applicable to shipments of tomatoes for pickling, processing,
experimental purposes, relief, charity, export, or other outlets recommended by the committee and approved by the
Secretary, if the handler thereof complies with the safeguard requirements of paragraph (c) of this section. Shipments
for processing are also exempt from the assessment requirements of this part. 



* * * * * 



(e) 

Report of packouts. 

Each registered handler shall, at the end of each day during which handling activities have been conducted, or the
following morning as the committee may prescribe, provide to the committee or its designated agent a complete and
accurate accounting of the number of containers of tomatoes packed that day. The report shall include an accounting
of the grade, size, maturity, and net weight of the containers packed in each such category. The total packout report
shall be provided to the committee or its authorized agent in a timely fashion that allows the committee to compile
a daily, industry-wide packout report.

(f) 

Assessments. 

Handlers shall pay assessments as provided in  966.42. Assessment will be based on inspection certificates
supplied to the committee by the Federal-State Inspection Service. 

(g) 

Definitions. Hydroponic tomatoes 

means tomatoes grown in solution without soil; 

greenhouse tomatoes 

means tomatoes grown indoors. A 

Certified Tomato Repacker 

is a repacker of tomatoes in the regulated area who has the facilities for handling, regrading, resorting, and repacking
tomatoes into consumer sized packages and has been certified as such by the committee. 

Processing 

as used in   966.120 and 966.323 means the manufacture of any tomato product which has been converted into
juice, or preserved by any commercial process, including canning, dehydrating, drying, and the addition of chemical
substances. 

U.S. tomato standards 

means the revised United States Standards for Fresh Tomatoes (7 CFR 51.1855 through 51.1877), effective October
1, 1991, as amended, or variations thereof specified in this section. Other terms in this section shall have the same

Adjustment of Status to That of Person Admitted for Permanent Residence; Temporary Removal of Certain Restrictions
of Eligibility



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Immigration and Naturalization Service, Justice.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Interim rule with request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This interim rule will amend the Immigration and Naturalization Service (Service) regulations to allow certain
persons in the United States to adjust status to that of a lawful permanent resident before October 1, 1997. These persons,
although immediately eligible for immigrant visa issuance abroad, had been barred from adjustment of status in the
United States because they had committed certain administrative violations of United States immigration law. This
rule allows prospective lawful permanent residents to avoid the difficulties and expense of travel to a United States
consulate or embassy abroad. It continues, however, to penalize these violators of the immigration laws by requiring
most applicants to pay an additional sum in excess of the standard adjustment of status filing fee. After adjusting
status, these persons can lawfully live and work in the United States and may later become eligible to seek United States
citizenship through naturalization.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Background



The Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act) allows a person who is neither a citizen nor a national of the United States
to live and work in this country for an unlimited period of time if he or she has been granted lawful permanent resident
status. It also provides for a grant of lawful permanent resident status on a conditional basis for an initial two-year
period, if the residency is based on a recent marriage or on alien entrepreneur status, and allows for the removal of
the conditions upon fulfillment of certain requirements.

The Act generally requires a qualified intending immigrant to obtain an immigrant visa abroad before seeking admission
to the United States for lawful permanent residence. It also allows certain persons who have not obtained an immigrant
visa abroad to adjust status to that of a lawful permanent resident after arrival in the United States. As set forth
in the Act, most persons seeking adjustment of status must show that they could qualify for immigrant visa issuance
abroad and must meet certain additional requirements. 

An immigrant visa may be issued only at a United States consulate or embassy abroad. Each prospective immigrant is
required to show that he or she is eligible for immigrant classification and has an immediately available immigrant
visa number through a qualifying family or employment relationship, or other means. The applicant must also establish
that he or she is not included in any of the classes of persons who cannot, by law, be admitted to the United States, or
that any basis for inadmissibility has been waived. After the immigrant visa has been issued, the person may lawfully
travel to the United States. A qualified immigrant visa holder becomes a lawful permanent resident upon admission
to the United States. 

An adjustment of status applicant must be physically present in the United States at the time of application. A person
applying under section 245 of the Act, the most frequently used adjustment of status provision, must meet the basic
requirements for immigrant visa issuance. Like immigrant visa applicants, the adjustment applicant must prove
that he or she is eligible for immigrant classification and has an immediately available immigrant visa number through
a qualifying family or employment relationship, or other means. The adjustment applicant must also show that he or
she is not included in any of the classes of persons who, by law, cannot be admitted to the United States, or that any basis
for inadmissibility has been waived. Section 245(a) of the Act further restricts eligibility for adjustment of status
by prohibiting adjustment unless the applicant entered the United States after having been inspected and admitted
or paroled by an immigrant officer. Section 245(c) of the Act also bars the adjustment of most applicants who have been
employed in the United States without authorization; who have not complied with the terms of temporary nonimmigrant
status; or who entered in transit without visa status, under a visa waiver program, or as crewmen. A qualified adjustment
applicant becomes a lawful permanent resident upon approval of the adjustment of status application. 

The requirements of sections 245(a) and 245(c) of the Act were established to discourage intending immigrants from
moving to the United States before becoming fully eligible for permanent residence and bypassing the orderly immigrant
visa issuance process abroad. These requirements have caused many persons who are in the United States to be unable
to adjust status in this country.

Intending immigrants who could not meet the adjustment requirements have been obliged to leave the country and apply
for an immigrant visa at a United States consulate or embassy abroad. They then were immediately eligible for admission
as lawful permanent residents upon returning to the United States. By virtue of the requirements of sections 245(a)
and 245(c) of the Act, these persons were putatively required to leave the United States and United States consuls
abroad have been burdened with immigrant visa issuance that would not otherwise have been necessary.



Public Law 103-317



Section 506(b) of the Department of Commerce, Justice, State, the Judiciary and Related Agencies Appropriations
Act, 1995, Pub. L. 103-317, was enacted August 26, 1994. It temporarily lifts many of the restrictions on adjustment
of status under section 245 of the Act on applications filed on or after October 1, 1994, although it does not affect
persons adjusting under other sections of law. This law adds a new section 245(i) to the Act, which allows a person who
is physically present in the United States and would otherwise have been eligible for immigrant visa issuance abroad,
to adjust status to that of a lawful permanent resident under section 245 of the Act. Applicants may be subject to a financial
penalty, since the law requires most persons seeking adjustment of status under the new law to pay an additional sum
in excess of the standard adjustment of status filing fee. The provisions of the new section 245(i) of the Act cease
to have effect on October 1, 1997.



Persons Who Remain Ineligible To Adjust Status



Section 245(i) of the Act does not waive all requirements for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act. An applicant
must be eligible for immigrant classification and have an immediately available immigrant visa number through a
qualifying family or employment relationship, or other means. The person must also show that he or she is not included
in any of the classes of persons listed in section 212 of the Act who cannot be admitted to the United States, or must show
that any basis for excludability has been waived.





Section 245(i) of the Act also does not waive several other grounds of ineligibility for adjustment of status under
section 245 of the Act. An applicant seeking adjustment as an immediate relative of a United States citizen or as a preference
alien, but who is not the beneficiary of a valid unexpired visa petition, remains ineligible for adjustment. A person
who is currently a lawful permanent resident also continues to be ineligible for adjustment. An applicant who was
admitted to the United States as a K-1 fiance(e) but did not marry the United States citizen who filed the petition,
or who was admitted as the K-2 child of a fiance(e) parent who did not marry the United States citizen who filed
the petition, is also barred from adjusting status under section 245 of the Act. A person who is seeking adjustment
based on a marriage entered into while the applicant was under deportation, exclusion, or related judicial proceedings
may not adjust status, unless the person provides clear and convincing evidence of a bona fide marriage or has resided
outside the United States for two or more years after the marriage.



Payment of Additional Sum



This temporary adjustment provision continues to encourage intending immigrants who are abroad to comply with the
immigrant visa issuance requirements, by making adjustment of status under the new provision much more expensive
than immigrant visa issuance abroad. Most applicants for the new benefit will be required to pay the standard adjustment
of status filing fee, plus an additional sum of five times the standard filing fee. Thus, persons currently applying
for adjustment of status under the provisions of the new section 245(i) of the Act must pay the standard filing fee of
$130.00, plus an additional sum of $650.00, for a total of $780.00. Any future modifications of the standard adjustment
of status filing fee will change the amount of the additional sum, as well as the total cost.

Persons who can meet all the requirements for adjustment of status under sections 245(a) and 245(c) of the Act will
continue to pay only the standard filing fee (currently $130.00 or $100.00 if less than 14 years of age). Section 245(i)
of the Act also exempts certain persons applying under the new provision from payment of the additional sum. An unmarried
child who is less than 17 years of age when he or she applies for adjustment of status will be required to pay only the standard
filing fee (currently $130.00, or $100.00 if less than 14 years of age). The spouse of a legalized alien or the unmarried
child under 21 years of age of a legalized alien will also be required to pay only the standard filing fee (currently
$130.00, or $100.00 if less than 14 years of age), if the spouse or child qualifies for and has applied for voluntary
departure under the family unity program established by section 301(a) of the Immigration Act of 1990.
This additional sum is a penalty dictated by section 245(i) of the Act; therefore, payment of the additional sum will
not be waived, except as directed in section 245(i) of the Act. Also, fee waivers may be granted under 8 CFR 103.7(c)
only if the applicant substantiates his or her inability to pay the prescribed fee. Since a person applying for adjustment
of status under section 245 of the Act is required to show financial resources or income establishing that he or she
is not likely to become a public charge in the United States, a person who can establish a basis for waiving payment of
the additional sum would be unlikely to be eligible for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act. The few adjustment
provisions that waive the public charge exclusion ground for a person seeking adjustment of status under section
245 of the Act also provide other waivers that eliminate any need for the applicant to seek the benefits of section 245(i)
of the Act.


Application


Each person applying for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act, including a child, must complete Form I-485.
Each applicant must also compile the initial evidence required by that form's instructions. Supplement A to Form
I-485 (Supplement A) may then be completed to determine whether the applicant must file under section 245(i)
of the Act and whether the additional sum must be paid. This supplementary form asks several questions and provides
instructions that allow the applicant to decide whether he or she must submit Supplement A and whether an additional
sum must be paid.
Each person, including a child, whose eligibility for adjustment of status is based on the provisions of section 245(i)
of the Act must file Supplement A. The Form I-485 with fee and the Supplement A with any required additional sum
must be filed with the office having jurisdiction over the applicant's place of residence.


Beginning of Application Period


Section 506(c) of Pub. L. 103-317 states that ``(t)he provisions of these amendments to the Immigration and
Nationality Act shall take effect on October 1, 1994.'' These amendments to the Act are not retroactive and cannot
be applied to applications for adjustment of status filed before that date. They also cannot be applied to a motion
to reopen or reconsider an adjustment of status application if the underlying adjustment application was filed before
October 1, 1994. An intending immigrant is not, however, precluded from obtaining the benefits of the new law merely
because he or she previously sought to adjust status. If the person meets the requirements for adjustment of status
under the provisions of the new section 245(i) of the Act, he or she may file a new application for adjustment of status
with fee, accompanied by Supplement A and any required additional sum. The applicant must show that he or she has an
immigrant visa number immediately available and meets all other applicable requirements of section 245 of the Act
on the date the new application is filed.

End of Application Period


Section 506(c) of Pub. L. 103-317 states that ``(t)he provisions of these amendments to the immigration and
Nationality Act shall * * * cease to have effect on October 1, 1997.'' Applications for adjustment
of status under section 245(i) of the Act cannot be granted on or after that date. Prospective adjustment of status
applicants who are seeking the benefits of section 245(i) of the Act must file their applications sufficiently in
advance of October 1, 1997, to ensure that they can be completed before that date. Application processing times vary
by location, and persons who will be seeking adjustment of status under the provisions of section 245(i) of the Act
during 1997 are encouraged to file as early in the year as possible. Persons who must file after June 1997 should contact
the office having jurisdiction over their place of residence for further instructions.


Immediate Availability of Immigrant Visa Number


All applicants for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act must have an immediately available immigrant
visa number. ``Immediately available'' for the purpose of accepting and processing the Form I-485 application
filed by a preference alien is defined in 8 CFR 245.1(f) as being not later than the date shown in the current Department
of State Bureau of Consular Affairs Visa Bulletin. The Department of State, however, defines ``immediately available''
as being earlier than the date shown in the current Visa Bulletin. This rule amends 8 CFR 245.1(f) to bring the adjustment
of status provision into accordance with the Department of State's definition. It also changes the name of the Visa
Bulletin to reflect its current title.



New Restriction on Immigrant Visa Issuance Abroad


Public Law 103-317 also places a new restriction on the issuance of immigrant visas abroad before October 1,
1997, which has no effect on persons seeking adjustment of status in the United States. Section 506(a) of Pub. L. 103-317
adds a new section 212(o) to the Act, which forbids immigrant visa issuance to certain prospective immigrants, including
children, who have been physically present in the United States. Prospective immigrants, except certain spouses
and children of legalized aliens, who were not maintaining lawful nonimmigrant status at the time of departure from
the United States, will not be eligible for immigrant visa issuance within 90 days of departure from the United States.
This new restriction does not apply to the spouse of a legalized alien or the unmarried child under 21 years of age of
a legalized alien, if the spouse or child qualifies for and has applied for voluntary departure under the family unity
program established by section 301(a) of the Immigration Act of 1990. The new section 212(o) of the Act takes effect
on October 1, 1994, and ceases to have effect on October 1, 1997. The Department of State, which has jurisdiction over
immigrant visa issuance at United States consulates and embassies abroad, will promulgate regulations implementing
this provision of Pub. L. 103-317.


Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994


The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (Crime bill), Pub. L. 103-322, was enacted on September
13, 1994. Section 130003 of the Crime Bill, entitled ``Alien Witness Cooperation and Counterterrorism Information''
adds a new section 245(i) to the Act. This provision restricts the adjustment of status of certain persons admitted
to the United States under a newly established ``S'' nonimmigrant classification. Congress clearly did not intend
to repeal or supersede the provisions of the Department of Commerce, Justice, State, the Judiciary and Related Agencies
Appropriations Act, 1995, Pub. L. 103-317, by adding another section 245(i) to the 
Act. The Service regards the establishment of the second section 245(i) of the Act as a numbering error and will recommend
that Congress enact a technical amendment to redesignate the Crime Bill's provision as section 245(j) of the Act.
The Service's implementation of this rule as an interim rule, with provision for post-promulgation public comment,
is based on the ``good cause'' exceptions found at 5 U.S.C. 553 (b)(3)(B), (d)(3); see 

Animal Legal Defense Fund 

v. 

Quigg, 

932 F.2d 920 (Fed. Cir. 1991). The reasons and necessity for immediate implementation of this interim rule are as follows:

Early implementation will allow persons in the United States to apply for adjustment of status to that of a lawful permanent
resident as of the beginning of the statutorily established application period on October 1, 1994. These persons
had been ineligible to adjust status and had been obliged to incur the expense and inconvenience of applying for an
immigrant visa at a United States embassy or consulate abroad.

Regulatory Flexibility Act


The Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility
Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this regulation and by approving it certifies that the rule will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because of the following factors. By temporarily removing
certain restrictions on eligibility for adjustment of status, the rule will eliminate inconvenience to a number
of individuals currently in the United States who otherwise would have incurred significant monetary expenses by
traveling abroad to apply for an immigrant visa at a United States consulate or embassy abroad. It will have no effect
on small entities.


Executive Order 12866


This rule is not considered by the Department of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Service to be a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866,  3(f), Regulatory Planning and Review, and the Office of
Management and Budget has waived its review process under section 6(a)(3)(A).


Executive Order 12612


The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this rule does not have
sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.


Executive Order 12606


The Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service certifies that she has assessed this rule in light
of the criteria in Executive Order 12606 and has determined that this regulation would enhance family well-being
by allowing certain family members, who were formerly precluded from adjusting status, to become lawful permanent
residents of the United States without first having obtained immigrant visas abroad.


Paperwork Reduction Act


The information collection requirements contained in this rule have been cleared by the Office of Management and
Budget under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act.

Admission of Certain Nurses Seeking Nonimmigrant Classification Under the H-1A Category



<AGENCY>
agency: 

Immigration and Naturalization Service, Justice.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
action: 

Interim rule with request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

This rule amends the Immigration and Naturalization Service (Service) regulations with regards to the admission
of certain nurses seeking nonimmigrant classification under the H-1A classification. This rule is necessary
because of a change in the method that the National Council of State Boards of Nursing employs in administering the
permanent state licensure examination (NCLEX). In response to this change in testing procedures, this rule provides
that nurses entering the United States on the basis of a temporary license issued by the state of intended employment
must pass the NCLEX within six months after the date of their initial admission to the United States. The rule also clarifies
for businesses and the general public the requirements for the admission of foreign nurses into the United States.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information: 

Section 212(m)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (Act) describes the qualifications necessary for an alien
to obtain classification as an H-1A registered nurse. The Act requires, among other things, that the nurse must
have either: (1) a full and unrestricted license to practice professional nursing in the state of intended employment
or (2) have passed an approximate examination (under current 8 CFR 214.2 (h)(3)(iii), the examination given by the
Commission on Graduates of Foreign Nursing Schools (CGFNS)) and have a temporary license for the state of intended
employment. Under the current regulations, a foreign nurse who is accorded H-1A status based on a temporary
license after passage of the CGFNS is required to sit and pass the first available permanent state licensing examination.



Prior to April 1, 1994, the permanent state licensing examination was given twice a year, in February and July. Under
current 8 CFR 214.2(h)(3)(v)(B), a nurse admitted in H-1 classification based on passage of the CGFNS examination
and temporary licensure who fails the permanent state licensing examination or fails to sit for the first available
permanent licensing examination is no longer eligible for H-1A status. On April 1, 1994, however, the National
Council of State Boards of Nursing altered its testing procedures and now offers the permanent state licensing examination
on a walk-in basis, six days a week. Thus, the current regulatory requirement that the alien sit and pass the first available
state nursing examination is no longer appropriate since the test is now available to the nurse immediately upon entry
into the United States.

In order to provide a nurse with sufficient time to acclimate himself or herself to the country and to prepare for the
examination, the Service has determined that a nurse who has been accorded H-1A status on the basis of a temporary
license shall be granted a period of six months after the date of entry to sit and pass the permanent state licensing
examination. After passage of the permanent state licensing examination, the alien's employer must file an application
to extend the stay of the alien. At the time of the application for extension of stay, the alien's employer must demonstrate
that the alien has remained in H-1A status continuously from the time of his or her admission by submitting evidence
reflecting that the alien has been employed continuously as a registered professional nurse since entry. An alien
who does not pass the permanent state licensing examination with six months of his or her admission or fails to maintain
a valid H-1A status is not eligible for a further extension of stay.

Despite these changes, petitions for H-1A aliens entering the United States based on a temporary license will
continue to be approved for a period not to exceed one year. Further, an H-1A alien shall be admitted to the United
States for the validity of the supporting petition.

The Service's implementation of this rule as an interim rule, with provisions for post-promulgation public comment,
is based upon the ``good cause'' exception found at 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3). Because of changes in the National Council
of State Boards of Nursing testing procedures, immediate implementation of the interim rule is necessary to ensure
foreign nurses admitted to the U.S. in H-1A status based on possession of temporary licenses an adequate and
realistic period of time to prepare for the permanent state licensing examination and therefore, continued eligibility
for H-1A classification.

Regulatory Flexibility Act


The Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility
Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this regulation and by approving it certifies that the rule will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The regulation merely modifies certain filing procedures
for petitions for foreign nurses to make them consistent with industry practices.


Executive Order 12866


This rule is not considered by the Department of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Service, to be a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866, section 3(f), Regulatory Planning and Review, and the Office of
Management and Budget has waived its review process under section 6(a)(3)(A).


Executive Order 12612


The regulation proposed herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the National Government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of Government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this rule does not have
sufficient Federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.


Executive Order 12606


The Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service certifies that she has assessed this rule in light
of the criteria in Executive Order 12606 and has determined that it will have no effect on family well-being.

who has been in the United States for a period of five years in such status may receive a one-year extension of stay if
it is established by the petitioner that extraordinary circumstances exist which warrant such an extension. Extraordinary
circumstances shall exist when the director finds that termination of the alien's services will impose extreme hardship
on the petitioner's business operation or that the alien's services are required in the national welfare, safety,
or security interests of the United States. Each request for an extension of stay for the beneficiary of an H-1A
petition must be accompanied by a current copy of the Department of Labor's notice of acceptance of the petitioner's
attestation on Form ETA 9029. A request for an extension of stay filed in behalf of an alien who initially entered the
United States on the basis of a temporary license must be accompanied by evidence that the alien has remained in a valid
H-1A status since his or her initial entry into the United States.

Swine Brucellosis 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Affirmation of interim rule as final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are adopting as a final rule, without change, an interim rule that provided for payment at fair market value for whole
herds of swine depopulated because of brucellosis. This action is necessary to eliminate in an expeditious manner
all swine herds known to be affected with brucellosis, and to help ensure that swine brucellosis is eradicated in the
United States within the next 5 years. This action is also necessary to help eliminate the human health risk associated
with swine brucellosis. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


Brucellosis is a serious infectious disease of swine, cattle, bison, and other species, including humans, caused
by bacteria of the genus 

Brucella.

 Brucellosis in swine is characterized by abortion, infertility, orchitis, posterior paralysis, and lameness.
To help prevent the spread of the disease, and to further its eradication, the regulations in 9 CFR part 51 provide for
payment of Federal indemnity to owners of certain animals destroyed because of brucellosis. The payment of indemnity
is intended to provide owners with a financial incentive for promptly destroying animals infected with or exposed
to brucellosis. 
The regulations in 9 CFR part 78 govern the interstate movement of swine affected with brucellosis. To help prevent
the spread of the disease, under these regulations the interstate movement of brucellosis reactor swine and exposed
swine is subject to certain restrictions. 
In an interim rule effective and published in the 

Federal Register

 on March 17, 1994 (59 FR 12530-12533, Docket No. 94-007-1), we amended the regulations in part 51
to provide for payment at fair market value for whole herds of swine depopulated because of brucellosis. We also amended
the regulations in part 78 to require that all brucellosis-exposed swine from herds known to be affected with the disease
be identified with an eartag before being moved interstate from the herd. 
We solicited comments on the interim rule for a 60-day comment period ending May 16, 1994. We received 13 comments by
that date. The commenters included a swine industry association and other members of the swine industry, a national
veterinary association, a Federal agency, a workers union, representatives of a county government, and other members
of the general public. Twelve of the commenters supported the interim rule as written. 
One commenter opposed the interim rule, on the grounds that the swine industry, not the Federal Government, should
take financial responsibility for swine destroyed because of brucellosis. We are making no changes based on this
comment. Under 21 U.S.C. 111, the Secretary of Agriculture has statutory authority to promulgate regulations to
prevent the dissemination from one State to another of contagious, infectious, or communicable diseases of animals.
Under 21 U.S.C. 114a, the Secretary is authorized to pay claims growing out of the destruction of animals affected
by or exposed to any communicable disease of livestock that threatens the U.S. livestock industry. 
In accordance with this statutory authority, the regulations in part 51 provide for payment of Federal indemnity
to owners of swine destroyed because of brucellosis. As we discussed in our interim rule, under the provisions of that
rule, the total cost for indemnity is expected to increase only slightly over the life of the swine brucellosis eradication
program, and total swine brucellosis eradication costs are expected to decrease substantially. We expect that paying
fair market value for whole herds of swine depopulated because of brucellosis will reduce the total cost of eradication
from $18.6 million to $11.35 million, and will shorten the time necessary to achieve eradication by more than 25 years.

Therefore, based on the rationale set forth in the interim rule and in this document, we are adopting the provisions
of the interim rule, without change, as a final rule. 


Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 


This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The rule has been determined to be not significant for
purposes of Executive Order 12866, and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. 
This rule also requires that all exposed swine in a herd known to be affected with brucellosis be identified with a metal
eartag before being moved interstate from the herd known to be affected. At present, 10 swine herds in the United States
are known to be affected with brucellosis. This number represents less than 0.005 percent of the 235,840 swine herds
in this country. We estimate that the cost of applying eartags to exposed swine in the average herd known to be affected
will be less than $20. 
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 


Executive Order 12372 


This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive
Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. (See 
7 CFR part 3015, subpart V.) 


Executive Order 12778 


This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule: (1) Preempts all State and
local laws and regulations that are in conflict with this rule; (2) has no retroactive effect; and 
(3) does not require administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule. 


Paperwork Reduction Act 


In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq

.) the information collection or recordkeeping requirements included in this rule have been submitted for approval
to the Office of Management and Budget.

Airworthiness Directives; McDonnell Douglas Model MD-11 and MD-11F Series Airplanes



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document revises and publishes in the 

Federal Register

 an amendment adopting Airworthiness Directive (AD) T94-19-51 that was sent previously to all known U.S.
owners and operators of McDonnell Douglas Model MD-11 and MD-11F series airplanes by individual telegrams.
This AD supersedes an existing airworthiness directive that currently requires a revision to the Airplane Flight
Manual (AFM) to ensure that the flight crews verify the accuracy of data provided by the Flight Management Computer
(FMC) under certain conditions. This amendment requires a revision to the AFM to ensure that the flight crews verify
the accuracy of data provided by the FMC under all conditions. This amendment is prompted by a report that the ``check/confirm
V speed'' message may be inhibited when the flaps are extended to within three degrees of the takeoff flap setting that
was entered into the FMC. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent FMC miscalculations that may result
in excessively high takeoff decision (V

1

) speeds, which may adversely affect accelerate-stop distances and may lead to the failure of the airplane to stop
prior to departing the end of the runway during a high speed rejected takeoff. This amendment also revises the previously
issued telegraphic AD by correcting a typographical error in the listing of the part numbers for the FMC's.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On April 6, 1994, the FAA issued AD 94-08-07, amendment 39-8879 (59 FR 17467, April 13, 1994), to require
revising the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) to ensure that the flight crews verify the accuracy of data
provided by the Flight Management Computer (FMC) when the anti-ice system is turned on during flex (assumed) temperature
takeoffs. That AD does not require that these procedures be followed if the runway is dry, if the field length is balanced,
or if the ice protection is turned off. That action was prompted by a report that certain Honeywell FMC's provided erroneous
V speed data when the anti-ice system was turned on during flex temperature takeoffs. The FAA determined that this
phenomenon may occur on McDonnell Douglas Model MD-11 and MD-11F series airplanes equipped with Honeywell
FMC's having part numbers 4059050-906, -907, and -908. That condition, if not corrected, could
result in the airplane failing to achieve sufficient climb gradient, which may result in the airplane failing to achieve
obstacle clearance.



Since the issuance of that AD, the FAA has received a report that the ``check/confirm V speed'' message may be inhibited
when the flaps are extended to within three degrees of the takeoff flap setting that was entered into the FMC. Under
normal operating conditions, the FMC calculates V speeds based on data the pilot enters into the FMC and data the FMC
receives from the aircraft sensors, including total air temperature (TAT). Investigation revealed that on hot sunny
days, the TAT probe may indicate an erroneously high ambient temperature that is up to 15 degrees Celsius higher than
the actual ambient temperature. The FMC, however, was supposedly designed and certified to account for this error
in the actual ambient temperature by continually recalculating the V speed data and indicating a ``check/confirm
V speed'' message when the calculations indicate that the V speeds differ by more than two knots from the V speeds entered
into the FMC by the pilot. However, if the flaps are set to the takeoff position prior to the TAT probe temperature reaching
the ambient temperature, that message would be inhibited and the pilot would not be notified that the indicated V speed
is incorrect. The FAA has determined that such erroneous indications may result in an FMC calculation of the takeoff
decision speed (V

1

) that is up to six knots greater than the actual V

1

 speed.

<TEXT>
 

FMC miscalculations that result in excessively high V

1

 speeds could result in accelerate-stop distances that exceed planned takeoff distances, which may lead to the airplane
departing the end of the runway during a high speed rejected takeoff.

Since the unsafe condition described is likely to exist or develop on other McDonnell Douglas Model MD-11 and
MD-11F series airplanes of the same type design, the FAA issued telegraphic AD T94-19-51, on September
14, 1994, to supersede AD 94-08-07 and to require a revision to the FAA-approved AFM to ensure that the flight
crews verify the accuracy of data provided by the FMC under all conditions. The AD also requires that V speeds be manually
entered into the FMC.

This is considered to be interim action. The manufacturer of these airplanes, in concert with the manufacturer of
the FMC, is currently developing new software that will address the unsafe condition addressed by this AD. Once this
software is developed, approved, and available, the FAA may consider additional rulemaking.

Additionally, subsequent to the issuance of telegraphic AD T94-19-51, the FAA discovered that a typographical
error appeared in the listing of affected part numbers for the Honeywell FMC's. The part numbers were inadvertently
listed as ``4059040-906, -907, and -908.'' The correct part numbers are ``4059050-906, -907,
and -908.'' (These correct part numbers were listed correctly in the preamble to the telegraphic AD and in the
previously-issued AD 94-08-07.)

Since it was found that immediate corrective action was required, notice and opportunity for prior public comment
thereon were impracticable and contrary to the public interest, and good cause existed to make the AD effective immediately
by individual telegrams issued on September 14, 1994, to all known U.S. owners and operators of McDonnell Douglas
Model MD-11 and MD-11F series airplanes. These conditions still exist, and the AD is hereby published
in the 

Federal Register

 as an amendment to section 39.13 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 39.13) to make it effective to all persons.
Additionally, this AD revises the telegraphic AD by correcting a typographical error in the listing of FMC part numbers.



Comments Invited



Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire.

Communications shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under
the caption 

ADDRESSES. 

All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed.

Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket.

Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this rule must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94-NM-160-AD.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter.

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and that it is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866.
It has been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and
Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be
significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed
in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption


ADDRESSES.

Recapture of LIFO Benefits 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Treasury. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final regulations. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document contains final regulations that 
describe the events that trigger the recapture of LIFO 
benefits under section 1363(d) when a C corporation elects 
to become an S corporation or transfers LIFO inventory to an 
S corporation in a tax-free reorganization. The final 
regulations reflect changes made to the law by the Revenue 
Act of 1987 and affect corporations that use the last-in, 
first-out (LIFO) method of accounting. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



On August 18, 1993, a notice of proposed rulemaking (PS-16-93) was published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 43827) 
proposing amendments to the Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR 
part 1) under section 1363(d). 

Written comments responding to the notice were received. 
No public hearing was requested or held. After 
consideration of all the comments, the regulations proposed 
by PS-16-93 are adopted as revised by this Treasury 
decision. 



Explanation of Provisions 



Under the proposed regulations, a C corporation that 
transfers LIFO inventory to an S Corporation in a tax-free 
reorganization is subject to the LIFO recapture rules of 
section 1363(d) and must include the LIFO recapture amount 
in its gross income in its last taxable year of existence. 

One commentator asserted that the IRS appeared to have 
exceeded its authority by extending the application of 
section 1363(d) to situations in which an S corporation 
succeeds to LIFO inventory in a tax-free reorganization. 
The IRS and the Treasury Department believe that the 
regulations are a valid exercise of authority to prevent the 
circumvention of section 1363(d). Therefore, the final 
regulations retain the rule of the proposed regulations.

<DOCNO> FR941007-0-00036 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941007-0-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Another commentator noted that the proposed regulations 
would apply to a transfer of LIFO inventory by a transferor 
C corporation that goes out of existence in a tax-free 
reorganization but would not apply to a transfer in 
connection with a tax-free reorganization under section 
368(a)(1)(D) in which the transferor corporation remains in 
existence. The commentator suggested revising the 
regulations to require inclusion of the LIFO recapture 
amount in the year of the transfer of the LIFO inventory 
instead of the transferor corporation's last year of 
existence. The final regulations adopt this suggestion. 

The final regulations also clarify which corporation has 
the responsibility to pay the three succeeding installments 
of tax described in section 1363(d)(2). 

Commentators suggested expanding the scope of the 
regulations to deal with various related issues that arise 
from application of the LIFO recapture rules. The IRS and 
the Treasury Department believe that those issues are more 
appropriately dealt with in other forms of administrative 
guidance. Accordingly, these comments have not been 
adopted. 



Special Analyses 



It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not 
a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. 
Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It also 
has been determined that section 553(b) of the 
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the 
Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply 
to these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory 
Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 
7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, the notice of proposed 
rulemaking preceding these regulations was submitted to the 
Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on 
small business. 



Drafting Information 



The principal author of these regulations is Jeffrey A. 
Erickson, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel 
(Passthroughs and Special Industries), IRS. However, other 
personnel from the IRS and Treasury Department participated 
in their development. 



List of Subjects 26 CFR Part 1 



Income taxes, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. 



Adoption of Amendments to the Regulations 



Accordingly, 26 CFR part 1 is amended as follows:

Par. 2.

 Section 1.1363-2 is added to read as follows: 



 1.1363-2 

Recapture of LIFO benefits. 



(a) 

In general.

 A C corporation must include the LIFO 
recapture amount (as defined in section 1363(d)(3)) in its 
gross income_ 

(1) In its last taxable year as a C corporation if the 
corporation inventoried assets under the LIFO method for its 
last taxable year before its S corporation election becomes 
effective; or 

(2) In the year of transfer by the C corporation to an 
S corporation of the LIFO inventory assets if paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section does not apply and the 
C corporation_ 

(i) Inventoried assets under the LIFO method during the 
taxable year of the transfer of those LIFO inventory assets; 
and 

(ii) Transferred the LIFO inventory assets to the 
S corporation in a nonrecognition transaction (within the 
meaning of section 7701(a)(45)) in which the transferred 
assets constitute transferred basis property (within the 
meaning of section 7701(a)(43)). 

(b) 

Payment of tax.

 Any increase in tax caused by 
including the LIFO recapture amount in the gross income of 
the C corporation is payable in four equal installments. 
The C corporation must pay the first installment of this 
payment by the due date of its return, determined without 
regard to extensions, for the last taxable year it operated 
as a C corporation if paragraph (a)(1) of this section 
applies, or for the taxable year of the transfer if 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section applies. The three 
succeeding installments must be paid_ 

(1) For a transaction described in paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section, by the corporation (that made the election 
under section 1362(a) to be an S corporation) on or before 
the due date for the corporation's returns (determined 
without regard to extensions) for the succeeding three 
taxable years; and 

(2) For a transaction described in paragraph (a)(2) of 
this section, by the transferee S corporation on or before 
the due date for the transferee corporation's returns 
(determined without regard to extensions) for the succeeding 
three taxable years. 

(c) 

Basis adjustments.

 Appropriate adjustments to the 
basis of inventory are to be made to reflect any amount 
included in income under this section. 

(d) 

Effective dates.

 (1) The provisions of paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section apply to S elections made after 
December 17, 1987. For an exception, see section 
10227(b)(2) of the Revenue Act of 1987. 

(2) The provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this section 
apply to transfers made after August 18, 1993.

 The Office of Foreign Assets Control is amending the Libyan Sanctions Regulations to add Arab Hellenic Bank, S.A.,
Lafitrade Holdings BV, and three other entities to appendix A, Organizations Determined to be within the Term ``Government
of Libya'' (Specially Designated Nationals of Libya); to note a name change for an entity previously listed in appendix
A; to identify certain blocked property in appendix A; and to add the names of 10 individuals to appendix B, Individuals
Determined to be Specially Designated Nationals of the Government of Libya.

WordPerfect 5.1 and ASCII.


Background


The Office of Foreign Assets Control (``FAC'') is amending the Libyan Sanctions Regulations, 31 CFR part 550 (the
``Regulations''), to add new entries to appendices A and B. Appendix A, Organizations Determined to be Within the
Term ``Government of Libya'' (Specially Designated Nationals of Libya), is a list of organizations determined by
the Director of FAC to be within the definition of the term ``Government of Libya,'' as set forth in  550.304(a)
of the Regulations, because they are owned or controlled by or act or purport to act directly or indirectly on behalf
of the Government of Libya. Appendix B, Individuals Determined to be Specially Designated Nationals of the Government
of Libya, lists individuals determined by the Director of FAC to be acting or purporting to act directly or indirectly
on behalf of the Government of Libya, and thus to fall within the term ``Government of Libya'' in  550.304(a).

Appendix A to part 550 is amended to provide public notice of the designation of Arab Hellenic Bank, S.A., Lafitrade
Holdings BV, Sabtina Limited, Teknica Oil Services (Overseas) Limited, and Teknica (UK) Limited as Specially Designated
Nationals of Libya. In addition, the listing for The Libyan Arab Uganda Bank for Foreign Trade and Development is amended
to note the bank's new name, Tropical Africa Bank Limited. Finally, Jardine House, located at 6 Crutched Friars, London
EC3N 2HT, England, is identified as blocked property of the Government of Libya.
Appendix B to part 550 is amended to provide public notice of ten individuals determined to be Specially Designated
Nationals of the Government of Libya: Dino Armani, Giampiero Armani, Dr. Najmeddine Abdalla Arifi, Dr. Nuri Abdalla
Berruien, Marcello Busenti, Dr. Mukhtar Ali El-Ageli, Bahjat Fadel El Amir, Mustapha Ali El-Khoja, Smeida
El-Hosh El Naili, and Hassan Senoussi Zughaid. Messrs. Dino and Giampiero Armani and Mr. Busenti are shareholders
in Oilinvest (Netherlands) B.V., previously identified as a Specially Designated National, and the remaining individuals
are officers or directors in other institutions named as Specially Designated Nationals in this amendment.
All prohibitions in the Regulations pertaining to the Government of Libya apply to the entities and individuals identified
in appendices A and B. All unlicensed transactions with such entities or persons, or transactions in property in which
they have an interest, are prohibited unless otherwise exempted or generally licensed in the Regulations.
Determinations that persons fall within the definition of the term ``Government of Libya'' and are thus Specially
Designated Nationals of Libya are effective upon the date of determination by the Director of FAC, acting under authority
delegated by the Secretary of the Treasury. Public notice is effective upon the date of publication or upon actual
notice, whichever is sooner.
The list of Specially Designated Nationals in appendices A and B is a partial one, since FAC may not be aware of all agencies
and officers of the Government of Libya, or of all persons that might be owned or controlled by, or acting on behalf of
the Government of Libya within the meaning of  550.304(a). Therefore, one may not rely on the fact that a person
is not listed in appendix A or B as a Specially Designated National as evidence that it is not owned or controlled by,
or acting or purporting to act directly or indirectly on behalf of, the Government of Libya. The Treasury Department
regards it as incumbent upon all persons governed by the Regulations to take reasonable steps to ascertain for themselves
whether persons with whom they deal are owned or controlled by, or acting or purporting to act on behalf of, the Government
of Libya, or on behalf of other countries subject to blocking or transactional restrictions administered by FAC.
Section 206 of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1705, provides for civil penalties not
to exceed $10,000 for each violation of the Regulations. Criminal violations of the Regulations are punishable by
fines of up to $250,000 or imprisonment for up to 10 years per count, or both, for individuals and criminal fines of up
to $500,000 per count for organizations. 

See

 50 U.S.C. 1705; 18 U.S.C. 3571.
Because the Regulations involve a foreign affairs function, Executive Order 12866 and the provisions of the Administrative
Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public participation, and
delay in effective date, are inapplicable. Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required for this rule, the
Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601-612, does not apply.

Approval and Promulgation of a New Source Review Implementation Plan; Indiana 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Direct final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The USEPA is approving the State implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Indiana for the purpose
of meeting requirements of the Clean Air Act (Act), as amended in 1990 (amended Act), with regard to new source review
(NSR) in areas that have not attained the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). This SIP revision was submitted
by the State to satisfy Federal requirements for an approvable nonattainment area NSR SIP for Indiana. The USEPA is
approving the recodified version of the Indiana permitting rules to replace those in the existing SIP. The USEPA is
also removing references in the Code of Federal Regulations to the construction ban imposed in Lake and Porter Counties
for failure to have an approved ozone plan since the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 removed this ban. In the proposed
rules section of this 

Federal Register

, USEPA is proposing approval of and soliciting public comment on this requested SIP revision. If adverse comments
are received on this direct final rule, USEPA will withdraw this final rule and address the comments received in a final
rule on the related proposed rule which is being published in the proposed rules section of this 

Federal Register

. Unless this final rule is withdrawn, no further rulemaking will occur on this requested SIP revision. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Background 


The air quality planning requirements for nonattainment NSR are set out in part D of title I of the Act. The USEPA has
issued a ``General Preamble'' describing its preliminary views on how USEPA intends to review SIPs and SIP revisions
submitted under part D, including those State submittals containing nonattainment area new source review (NSR)
SIP requirements [see 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) and 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992)]. Because USEPA is describing its
interpretations here only in broad terms, the reader should refer to the General Preamble for a more detailed discussion
of the interpretations of part D advanced in this rule and the supporting rationale. In this final rule on the Indiana
nonattainment NSR SIP, USEPA is applying its interpretations taking into consideration the specific factual issues
presented. 


II. This Action 


Section 110(k) of the Act sets out provisions governing USEPA's action on SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565-13566).

Analysis of State Submission 


1. Procedural Background 


The Act requires States to observe certain procedural requirements in developing implementation plans and plan
revisions for submission to USEPA. Section 110(a)(2) of the Act provides that each implementation plan submitted
by a State must be adopted after reasonable notice and public hearing.

1

 Section 110(l) of the Act similarly provides that each revision to an implementation plan submitted by a State under
the Act must be adopted by such State after reasonable notice and public hearing. 





The USEPA also must determine whether a submittal is complete and therefore warrants further USEPA review and action
(see section 110(k)(1) of the Act and 57 FR 13565). The USEPA's completeness criteria for SIP submittals are set out
at 40 CFR part 51, appendix V (1991), as amended by 57 FR 42216 (August 26, 1991). The USEPA attempts to make completeness
determinations within 60 days of receiving a submission. However, a submittal is deemed complete by operation of
law under section 110(b)(1)(B) if a completeness determination is not made by USEPA within 6 months after receipt
of the submission. 

The State of Indiana held public hearings on March 22, March 25, and April 1, 1993, to entertain public comment on the
requested NSR SIP revision. Following the public hearings, the plan was adopted by the State on July 21, 1993, became
effective on December 12, 1993, and was submitted to USEPA on February 25, 1994, as a requested revision to the SIP.


The SIP revision was reviewed by USEPA to determine completeness shortly after its submittal, in accordance with
the completeness criteria referenced above. The submittal was found to be complete on April 8, 1994, and a letter dated
April 8, 1994, was forwarded to the Governor's designee for SIPs, Timothy J. Method, indicating the completeness
of the submittal and the next steps to be taken in the review process. In this action, USEPA approves the Indiana nonattainment
new source review SIP submittal, and invites public comment on the action. At this time USEPA is also approving the
recodified permit rules to replace those in the existing SIP which were approved as APC 19 at 40 CFR 52.770(c)(24).
Since the time of this approval, Indiana has recodified its air pollution control rules into Title 326 of the Indiana
Administrative Code (326 IAC). As requested by the State on August 15, 1994, USEPA is approving the incorporation
of recodified rules into the SIP to replace those previously approved as part of APC 19. This action is intended to make
it easier for the public, the State and USEPA to precisely identify what provisions covering permits are part of the
SIP.

The statutory requirements for nonattainment new source review SIPs and permitting are found at sections 172 and
173 of the Act. The Act requires States to address a number of nonattainment NSR provisions in a SIP submittal to meet
the requirements of part D of title I of the Act. What follows is a summary of the requirements and how the Indiana submittal
addresses them. A more detailed analysis is contained in the Technical Support Document for this rule which is available
for inspection at the Region 5 address listed above. 
The Act requires States to submit the following nonattainment NSR provisions: 
a. Provisions to ensure that certain construction bans previously imposed in States pursuant to section 110(a)(2)(I)
are lifted. 
The amended Act repealed provisions formerly in section 110(a)(2)(I) which required construction bans in certain
nonattainment areas. A construction ban was imposed in Lake and Porter Counties pursuant to section 110(a)(2)(I).
With some exceptions not applicable here, the amended Act thus lifted such construction bans, including the ban in
Lake and Porter Counties. This final rule therefore revises the Code of Federal Regulations to remove references
to the construction ban formerly imposed in Lake and Porter Counties for failure to have an approvable ozone plan.

b. Provisions, pursuant to section 173(a)(1), to assure that calculations of emissions offsets are based on the same
emissions baseline used in the demonstration of reasonable further progress. 326 IAC 2-3-3(a)(5) requires
emission offsets to result in reasonable further progress toward attainment of the NAAQS. Also, the definition of
emissions offsets baselines in 326 IAC 2-3-3(b) is consistent with reasonable further progress. 
c. A provision, pursuant to section 173(c)(1), to allow offsets to be obtained in another nonattainment area if the
area has an equal or higher nonattainment classification and emissions from the other nonattainment area contribute
to a NAAQS violation in the area in which the source would construct. Indiana has established this provision in 326
IAC 2-3-5. 
d. A provision, pursuant to section 173(c)(1), that any emissions offsets obtained in conjunction with the issuance
of a permit to a new or modified source must be enforceable at the time of permit issuance and in effect by the time the
new or modified source commences operation. Indiana has established this provision in 326 IAC 2-3-3(b)(8).

e. A provision, pursuant to section 173(c)(1), to assure that emissions increases from new or modified sources are
offset by real reductions in actual emissions. Indiana has established this provision in 326 IAC 2-3-3(a)(5).

f. A provision, pursuant to section 173(c)(2), to prevent emissions reductions otherwise required by the Act from
being credited for purposes of satisfying part D offset requirements. Indiana has established this provision in
326 IAC 2-3-3(b)(9). 
g. States must establish provisions, pursuant to sections 172(c)(4) and 173(a)(1)(B), that reflect changes in growth
allowances; specifically, (1) the elimination of existing growth allowances in any nonattainment area that received
a notice prior to the Amendments that the SIP was substantially inadequate or receives such a notice in the future;
and (2) the restriction of growth allowances to only those portions of nonattainment areas formally targeted as special
zones for economic development. Indiana does not have any of the above mentioned growth allowances. 
h. A provision, pursuant to section 173(a)(5), that requires an analysis of alternative sites, sizes, production
processes, and environmental control techniques for proposed sources. This analysis shall demonstrate that the
benefits of the proposed source significantly outweigh the environmental and social costs imposed as a result of
its location, construction, or modification. This shall be a prerequisite to issuing any part D permit. Indiana has
established this provision in 326 IAC 2-3-3(a)(4). 
i. In accordance with section 173(d), Indiana has committed to report determinations, from nonattainment new source
review permits, to the RACT/BACT/LAER clearinghouse in the annual Indiana Department of Environmental Management
Air Management Program Workplan. 
j. A provision, pursuant to section 173(e), that allows any existing or modified source that tests rocket engines
or motors to use alternative or innovative means to offset emissions increases from firing and related cleaning,
if four conditions are met: (a) the proposed modification is for expansion of a facility already permitted for such
purposes, (b) the source has used all available offsets and all reasonable means to obtain offsets and sufficient
offsets are not available, (c) the testing is essential to national security, and (d) the source will comply with an
alternative measure designed to offset any emissions increases not directly offset by the source. Indiana has established
this provision in 326 IAC 2-3-3(b)(11). 
k. Provisions pursuant to section 819 of the Act that effectively exempt activities related to stripper wells from
the new additional NSR requirements of new subparts 2, 3, and 4 for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter
less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM-10), ozone, or carbon monoxide (CO) nonattainment areas classified
as serious or less and having a population of less than 350,000. Indiana has not established such provisions. This
is acceptable because there are no stripper well activities in the State of Indiana. 
l. Provisions, pursuant to section 328, to assure that sources located on an outer continental shelf (OCS) and within
25 miles of the State's seaward boundary, are subject to the same requirements applicable if the source were located
in the corresponding onshore area. Indiana has not established such provisions. This is acceptable because Indiana
is inland and not located on an OCS. 
m. Pursuant to sections 302(z) and 111(a)(3), a definition of ``stationary source'' to include internal combustion
engines other than the newly defined category of ``nonroad engines.'' Indiana has established a definition consistent
with these requirements in 326 IAC 2-3-1(aa). 
n. Pursuant to section 415, exemptions from nonattainment NSR provisions for installation, operation, cessation,
or removal of a qualifying temporary clean coal technology demonstration project. Such projects must still comply
with any applicable SIP and all other requirements for the attainment and maintenance of NAAQS. Indiana has established
this provision in 326 IAC 2-3-2(i). 
o. A provision, pursuant to section 173(a)(3), to assure that owners or operators of each proposed new or modified
major stationary source demonstrate, as a condition of permit issuance, the compliance of all other major stationary
sources under the same ownership in the State. Indiana has established this provision in 326 IAC 2-3-3(a)(3).

Pursuant to section 172(c)(5), SIPs must require permits for the construction and operation of new or modified major
stationary sources. The statutory permit requirements for ozone nonattainment areas are generally contained in
revised section 173, and in subpart 2 of part D. These are the minimum requirements that States must include in an approvable
implementation plan. For all classifications of ozone nonattainment areas and for ozone transport regions, States
must adopt the appropriate major source thresholds and offset ratios. States must also adopt provisions to ensure
that any new or modified major stationary source of nitrogen oxides (NO

X

) satisfies the requirements applicable to any major source of volatile organic compounds (VOC), unless a special
NO

X

 exemption is granted by the Administrator under the provision of section 182(f). For serious and severe ozone nonattainment
areas, State plans must implement sections 182(c)(6), (7) and (8) with regard to modifications. 
For emissions of VOC and NO

X

 in ozone nonattainment areas, the State of Indiana has established major source thresholds in 326 IAC 2-3-1(q)(2)
and offset ratios in 326 IAC 2-3-3(a)(5)(B) as follows: 






Indiana does not have an extreme ozone nonattainment area. 
In addition, Indiana's plan submittal reflects appropriate modification provisions in 326 IAC 2-3-1(j),
including a de minimis level of 25 tons for serious and severe ozone nonattainment areas. 326 IAC 2-3-1(j)
sets the major modification threshold level (``deminimis level'') at 25 tons per year (tpy) when the net emissions
increase from the proposed modification is aggregated with all other net emissions increases from the source over
a 5 consecutive calendar year period prior to, and including, the year of the modification. This meets the requirements
of section 182(c)(6). The registration requirement exemption levels of 15 pounds per day of VOC and 25 pounds per day
of NO

X

 (326 IAC 2-1-1(b)(2)(B)) are for the purposes of determining applicability of the registration requirements
for new sources and modifications to existing sources. These exemption levels do not exclude smaller emissions increases
from being counted in the 5 year aggregated net emissions increase analyses required in serious and severe ozone nonattainment
areas. 


4. Carbon Monoxide 


The statutory permit requirements for CO nonattainment areas are generally contained in revised section 173, and
in subpart 3 of part D. These are the minimum requirements that States must include in an approvable implementation
plan. States must adopt the appropriate major source threshold and offset ratio. 
Indiana has established a major source threshold of 100 tpy (in 326 IAC 2-3-1(q)(1)) and an offset ratio
of 1 to 1 (in 326 IAC 2-3-3(a)(5)(A)) for moderate CO nonattainment areas. Indiana does not have a serious
CO nonattainment area. 


5. PM-10 


The statutory permit requirements for PM-10 nonattainment areas are generally contained in revised section
173, and in subpart 4 of part D. These are the minimum requirements that States must include in an approvable implementation
plan. For both classifications of PM-10 nonattainment areas, States must adopt the appropriate major source
threshold, offset ratio, significance level for modifications, and provisions for PM-10 precursors. 
Indiana has established major source thresholds (in 326 IAC 2-3-1(q)(1)), offset ratios (in 326 IAC 2-3-3(a)(5)(A)),
modification significance levels (in 326 IAC 2-3-1(x)), and PM-10 precursor provisions as follows:




 


Indiana does not have a serious PM-10 nonattainment area. Also, Indiana is not required to count PM-10
precursors towards PM-10 emissions. Filter analysis data from ambient monitors in Cook County, Illinois (the
data was collected in 1992) were used to asses the significance of PM precursors in the Lake County, Indiana PM nonattainment
area. The monitors used are located at the Washington School and the Bright School in the city of Chicago, Illinois.
These monitors are located approximately .6 and 1.75 miles, respectively, west the Lake County nonattainment area.
Besides the close proximity, these sites are also appropriate because the source mix in southeast Chicago closely
approximates that of the Lake County nonattainment area. 
The mean sulfate concentration plus the mean nitrate concentration for the Washington school and Bright school monitors
were 13.1

m

g/m3 and 14.9

m

g/m3 respectively. This compares to an average annual background PM concentration of 23

m

g/m3 in the Lake County nonattainment area. This illustrates the relative insignificance of the impact of PM precursors,
and supports representing PM precursor impacts as part of the background concentration. 
Further considerations also argue against applying the same control requirements for precursor sources as for direct
emission sources. The climatology in northwest Indiana is such that precursor emission control for a particular
source would not have a significant effect until far downwind. In considering the reductions to be achieved by controlling
PM precursors under section 189(e) Congress has indicated that USEPA should take into account reductions achievable
from control requirements imposed by other sections or titles of the 1990 Clean Air Act. Title IV of the Clean Air Act
mandates significant particulate precursor emission reductions in Indiana, after which the impacts of these sources
on particulate matter concentrations will be even less significant. 
For these reasons, it is appropriate to conclude that precursors do not contribute significantly to particulate
matter concentrations in the Lake County nonattainment area. This finding is based on the current character of the
area including, for example, the existing mix of sources in the area. It is possible, therefore, that future growth
could change the significance of precursors in the area. The USEPA intends to issue future guidance addressing such
potential changes in the significance of precursor emissions in an area. 



6. Sulfur Dioxide 


The statutory permit requirements for sulfur dioxide (SO

2

) nonattainment areas are generally contained in revised section 173, and in subpart 5 of part D. These are the minimum
requirements that States must include in an approvable implementation plan. For SO

2

 nonattainment areas, States must adopt the appropriate major source threshold, offset ratio, and significance
level for modifications.

Indiana has established a major source threshold of 100 tpy (in 326 IAC 2-3-1(q)(1)), an offset ratio of
1 to 1 (in 326 IAC 2-3-3(a)(5)(A)), and a modification significance level of 40 tpy (in 326 IAC 2-3-1(x)).




7. Lead 



The statutory permit requirements for lead nonattainment areas are generally contained in revised section 173,
and in subpart 5 of part D. These are the minimum requirements that States must include in an approvable implementation
plan. For lead nonattainment areas, States must adopt the appropriate major source threshold, offset ratio, and
significance level for modifications. 

Indiana has established a major source threshold of 25 tpy (in 326 IAC 2-3-1(q)(4)), an offset ratio of
1 to 1 (in 326 IAC 2-3-3(a)(5)(A)), and a modification significance level of 0.6 tpy (in 326 IAC 2-3-1(x)).




8. Permit Exemption Emission Levels 



The Indiana nonattainment rules have exemption levels listed in 326 IAC 2-1-1(b)(2). 326 IAC 2-1-1(b)(2)
states that a new source or a modification to an existing source with emissions above these exemption levels and below
potential emissions of 25 tons per year for any regulated pollutant shall be registered according to 326 IAC 2-1-2.
Also, 326 IAC 2-1-1(b)(1) establishes exemption levels for requiring new sources or modifications to
existing sources obtain a construction permit under 326 IAC 2-1-3. The exemption levels are available
to sources for registration applicability purposes. These levels are applied before any netting calculations.
Sources cannot net emissions increases and decreases and then use net emissions in the exemption test. These do not
affect the provisions for special modifications. 



9. Definition of Federally Enforceable 



The Indiana 326 IAC regulations do not include a definition of ``federally enforceable''. On July 13, 1994, Pamela
Carter, Attorney General of the State of Indiana, sent a letter to USEPA clarifying Indiana's interpretation of the
definition of federally enforceable. The letter states that federally enforceable, e.g. as used in 326 IAC 2-3-1,
should be interpreted in accordance with the Federal definition at 40 CFR 51.165(a)(1)(xiv). The USEPA, therefore,
interprets `federally enforceable' as used in the Indiana rules to be defined according to the Federal definition.




10. Recodification of SIP Approved Regulations 



The previous regulations approved into the Indiana SIP establishing a new source review program were contained in
APC-19 and codified at 40 CFR 52.770(c)(24). These regulations provided for a new source review program pursuant
to 40 CFR part 51 subpart I, including both minor and major new source review. USEPA is approving Indiana's SIP revisions
not only to adopt the changes referenced elsewhere in this notice but also to recodify the previously approved new
source review rules, formerly in APC-19 and currently in 326 IAC 2, based on a review of the entire submission,
USEPA has determined that the new source review regulations contained in 326 IAC 2 submitted by the state, including
both the rule changes and the recodification, meet the requirements of part D of title I of the Act. In addition, these
rules are being approved pursuant to 40 CFR 51 Subpart I, for both major and non-major new source review except not for
PSD requirements in 40 CFR 51.166. 



11. Plantwide Source Definition 



On October 14, 1981, the USEPA revised the new source review regulations in 40 CFR Part 51 to give states the option of
adopting the ``plantwide'' definition of stationary source which provides that only physical or operational changes
that result in a net increase in emissions at the entire plant require a NSR permit. For example, if a plant decreased
emissions by the same amount at another piece of process equipment, then there would be no net increase in emissions
at the plant and therefore, no ``modification'' to the ``source.'' The plantwide definition is in contrast to the
so-called ``dual'' definition [or definition of structure like that in the 1979 offset ruling (44 FR 3274), which
has much the same effect as the dual definition]. Under the dual definition, the emissions from each physical or operational
change are gauged without regard to reductions elsewhere at the plant. 

In the October 1981 rule, USEPA set forth its rationale for allowing use of the plantwide definition (46 FR 50766-69).
In its view, allowing use of the plantwide definition was a reasonable accommodation of the conflicting goals of part
D of title I of the Act. The Act provided for reasonable further progress (RFP) and timely attainment of National Ambient
Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), while also allowing for maximum state flexibility and economic growth. The USEPA
recognized that the plantwide definition would bring fewer plant modifications into the nonattainment permitting
process, but emphasized that this generally would not interfere with RFP and timely attainment primarily because
the states under the demands of Part D eventually would have adequate SIPs in place. For instance, USEPA stated: 




Since demonstration of attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS continues to be required, deletion of the dual definition
increases State flexibility without interfering with timely attainment of the ambient standards and so is consistent
with Part D [46 FR 50767]. 





USEPA also indicated that under the plantwide definition, new equipment would still be subjected to any applicable
new source performance standard and that wholly new plants, as well as any modifications that resulted in a significant
net emissions increase, would still be subject to NSR. Thus, EPA saw no significant disadvantage in the plantwide
definition from the environmental standpoint, but the advantages from the standpoints of state flexibility and
economic growth. It regarded the plantwide definition as presenting, at the very worst, environmental risks that
were manageable because of the independent impetus to create adequate Part D plans. 

As a result, EPA ruled that a state wishing to adopt a plantwide definition generally has complete discretion to do
so, and it set only one restriction on that discretion. If a state had specifically projected emission reductions
from its NSR program as a result of a dual or similar definition and had relied on those reductions in an attainment strategy
that USEPA later approved, then the state needed to revise its attainment strategy as necessary to accommodate reduced
NSR permitting under the plantwide definition (46 FR 50767 and 50769). 

In 1984, the Supreme Court upheld USEPA's action as a reasonable accommodation of the conflicting purposes of Part
D of Title I of the Act, and hence, well within USEPA's broad discretion. 

Chevron, U.S.A. 

v. 

NRDC

, 104 S.Ct. 2778 (1984). Specifically, the Court agreed that the plantwide definition is fully consistent with the
Act's goal of maximizing state flexibility and allowing reasonable economic growth. Likewise, the Court recognized
that USEPA had advanced a reasonable explanation for its conclusion that the plantwide definition serves the Act's
environmental objectives as well (see 104 S.Ct. at 2792). In this rule USEPA generally reaffirms the rationales stated
in the 1981 rulemaking. Those rationales were left undisturbed by the Supreme Court decision.

The SIP revision USEPA is approving in this action substitutes a plantwide definition for a dual definition in Indiana's
existing nonattainment NSR program. In obtaining USEPA approval of its original part D SIP, Indiana did not rely on
any emission reductions from the operation of its existing NSR program. Also, Indiana uses a plantwide definition
of source. A July 22, 1987 letter from Timothy J. Method, then Acting Assistant Commissioner, Office of Air Management,
Steve Rothblatt then Chief of the Air and Radiation Branch, states Indiana's rationale for implementing the plantwide
definition. The letter further states that in obtaining USEPA approval of its original part D SIP, Indiana did not
rely on emission reductions from its existing NSR program. Indiana has nonattainment areas for sulfur dioxide, lead,
ozone, and fine particulate matter. Indiana has submitted several revisions required by the amended Act prior to
attainment of the NAAQS by the statutory attainment dates, which range from 1994 to 2007 for the nonattainment areas
in Indiana. For example, Indiana has submitted revisions for VOC and NO

X

 RACT, Stage II vapor recovery, clean fuel fleets, and 15% VOC reduction, employee commute options vehicle inspection
and maintenance and the 1990 base year ozone emissions inventory. These revisions have been or will be acted on by USEPA
in subsequent actions. 

Indiana's plantwide definition of source is consistent with the NSR requirements for ozone nonattainment areas
in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. Lake and Porter Counties are classified as a ``severe'' ozone nonattainment
area. Therefore, the attainment date for the area is now 2007 (see section 181(a)), and Indiana must meet an independent
requirement to reduce VOC emissions by fifteen percent in the first six years after 1990 and three percent per year
thereafter (see section 182(b)(1) and (c)(2)(B)). 

While Indiana must account for the impact of its plantwide definition of source in the attainment and reasonable further
progress demonstrations it submits under the amended Act, it is clear that Congress anticipated States could use
the plantwide definition of source when devising such plans. 

The amended Act includes provisions regulating the application of the plantwide definition of source, including
a special rule for serious and severe ozone nonattainment areas for determining ``de minimis'' net increases in VOC
emissions from source modifications (section 182(c)(6)). It is clear that Congress anticipates states will often
continue to employ USEPA's plantwide definition of source in ozone nonattainment areas (except in extreme areas,
see section 182(e)(2)), provided the states can also meet the new reasonable further progress requirements in the
Act. In addition, it is important to note that the 1990 Amendments' adoption of new future attainment deadlines has
mooted concerns regarding the approvability of a plantwide source definition where a state has missed prior attainment
deadlines. Congress has given Indiana additional time to submit a revised SIP to provide for attainment by the revised
deadlines. As described above, Indiana has already begun to meet its obligations under the 1990 Amendments. 

USEPA expects to publish a proposed rule in late 1994 to implement the changes under the amended Act in the NSR provisions
in parts C and D of title I of the Act. USEPA may refer to the proposed rule as the most authoritative guidance available
regarding the approvability of the NSR SIP submittals. USEPA expects to take final action to promulgate a rule to implement
the parts C and D changes sometime during 1995. At that time, USEPA will review the NSR SIPs of all states to determine
whether further SIP revisions are necessary. Prior to USEPA approval of a State's NSR SIP submission, the State may
continue permitting only in accordance with the new statutory requirements for permit applications completed after
the relevant SIP submittal date (e.g. November 15, 1992 for ozone nonattainment areas). This policy was explained
in transition guidance memoranda from John Seitz dated March 11, 1991 and September 3, 1992. 

As explained in the March 11 memorandum, USEPA does not believe Congress intended to mandate the more stringent Title
I NSR requirements during the time provided for SIP development. States were thus allowed to continue to permit consistent
with requirements in their current NSR SIPs during that period, or apply 40 CFR part 51, appendix S for newly designated
areas that did not previously have NSR SIP requirements. 

The September 3 memorandum also addressed the situation where States did not submit the part D NSR SIP requirements
or revisions by the applicable statutory deadline. For permit applications complete by the SIP submittal deadline,
States may issue final permits under the prior NSR rules, assuming certain conditions in the September 3 memorandum
are met. However, for applications completed after the SIP submittal deadline, USEPA will consider the source to
be in compliance with the Act only where the source obtains a permit that is consistent with the substantive new NSR
part D provisions in the amended Act from the State. USEPA believes this guidance continues to apply to permitting
pending final action on NSR SIP submittals. 



III. Rulemaking Action 



Section 110(k) of the Act sets out provisions governing USEPA's action on SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565-66).
The USEPA is taking the following final rulemaking actions. 






</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941007-0-00044 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941007-0-00011 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

1. The USEPA is approving the requested SIP revision submitted on March 7, 1994. The submittal consists of Title 326
IAC 2-1-1, 2-1-2, 2-1-3, 2-3-1, 2-3-2, 2-3-3,
and 2-3-5. The State of Indiana has submitted a complete plan to implement the new source review provisions
of part D. Each of the program elements mentioned above was properly addressed. 

2. The USEPA is also approving the recodified permitting rules to replace those in the existing SIP which were approved
as APC 19 at 40 CFR 52.770(c)(24). The incorporation of the recodified version of these Indiana rules into the SIP will
make it easier for the public, the State and USEPA to identify precisely what permitting provisions are part of the
SIP. Some confusion surrounding what State rules were part of the permitting SIP has existed since Indiana recodified
its APC rules into the Title 325 of the Indiana Administrative Code (IAC) and subsequently into Title 326 IAC. After
the effective date of this final rule all of Indiana's permitting SIP rules will be contained in Title 326 of the IAC.


3. Consistent with section 110(n)(3) of the amended Act the USEPA is taking this opportunity to remove references
in 52.773(i) and 52.777(d) to the sanctions formerly imposed on Lake and Porter Counties which were lifted by the 1990
Act amendments. 

Because USEPA considers these actions to be noncontroversial and routine, we are approving them without prior proposal.
This action will become effective on December 6, 1994. However, if we receive adverse comments on these actions by
November 7, 1994, then USEPA will publish a final rule that withdraws the action, and will address the comments received
in the final rule on the requested SIP revision which has been proposed for approval in the proposed rules section of
this 

Federal Register

. The public comment period will not be extended or reopened. 



IV. Executive Order (EO) 12866 



This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has exempted this regulatory
action from Executive Order 12866 review. 

Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 



V. Regulatory Flexibility 



Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small
entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on
a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises,
and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 

SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Act forbids USEPA to base
its actions concerning SIP's on such grounds. 

Union Electric Co.

U.S. E.P.A.

, 427 U.S. 246, 256-66 (S.Ct 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2). 

Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by December 6, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by
the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor
does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section
307(b)(2).)

(94) On February 25, 1994, Indiana requested a revision to the State Implementation Plan (SIP) in the form of amendments
to Title 326: Air Pollution Control Board of the Indiana Administrative Code (326 IAC) 2-1-1 and 2-1-3
which were intended to satisfy the additional new source review requirements of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.
The USEPA, at this time, is also approving the incorporation of permitting rules recodified as Article 2. Permit Review

* * * * * 



(i) The Administrator finds that Indiana's ozone plan for Lake and Porter Counties, which was required to be submitted
by July 1, 1992, does not satisfy all the requirements of part D, title 1 of the Clean Air Act and, thus, is disapproved.
See   52.770(c)(69)and 52.770(d). The disapproval does not affect USEPA's approval (or conditional
approval) of individual parts of Indiana's ozone plan and they remain approved.

(d) Part D_Disapproval. The 1982 Indiana plan for Lake and Porter County is disapproved because it does not assure
the attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS there. See   52.770(c)(69) and 52.773(i). The disapproval
does not affect USEPA's approval (or conditional approval) of individual parts of Indiana's ozone plan and they remain
approved. 

5. Section 52.780 is amended by adding paragraph (h) to read as follows: 



 52.780

Review of new sources and modifications. 



* * * * * 




(h) On March 7, 1994, Indiana requested a revision to the State Implementation Plan (SIP) for New Source Review (NSR)
to satisfy the requirements of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. The Indiana 326 IAC regulations do not include
a definition of ``federally enforceable''. On July 13, 1994, Pamela Carter, Attorney General of the State of Indiana,
sent a letter to USEPA clarifying Indiana's interpretation of the definition of federally enforceable. The letter
states that federally enforceable, e.g. as used in 326 IAC 2-3-1, should be interpreted in accordance
with the federal definition at 40 CFR 51.165(a)(1)(xiv). The USEPA took the opportunity of rulemaking on the State's
submittal to recodify the permitting SIP to conform to Title 326 the Indiana Administrative Code.

Control of Air Pollution From New Motor Vehicles and New Motor Vehicle Engines: Regulations Requiring Tampering
Prevention for On-Board Diagnostic Systems 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Court Decision Regarding Agency Regulations. 





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice is intended to inform the public that the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
has ordered that regulations published by the Agency intended to prevent tampering with vehicle on-board emissions
diagnostic systems be vacated.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On February 19, 1993, the 

Federal Register

 published the Environmental Protection Agency's (the Agency's) rulemaking requiring on-board emission diagnostics
systems on 1994 and later model year light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks (58 FR 9468). This rulemaking promulgated
regulations that included provisions requiring vehicle manufacturers to install on affected vehicles:

 

``* * * features to deter modification except as authorized by the manufacturer. Any reprogrammable
computer codes or operating parameters must be resistant to tampering and the computer and any related maintenance
instructions must conform to the provisions of SAE J2186 ``E/E Data Link Security.'' (SEP91). A removable calibration
memory chip shall be potted or encased in a sealed container * * *. Demonstration of compliance
with the tampering protection section of the California OBD II requirements shall satisfy the requirements of this
section through the 1998 model year.'' 40 CFR  86.094-18 (the ``anti-tampering regulation''.)

 


Several associations representing aftermarket automotive parts manufacturers, rebuilders, distributors, retailers
and automotive service and repair providers (``the petitioners'') subsequently petitioned for review of the rulemaking
by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (Docket No. 93-1277). 
On May 9, 1994, the Agency and the petitioners (``the parties'') filed with the Court a Joint Motion to Remand the Administrative
Record to the Agency ``in order for EPA to reconsider the anti-tampering provisions, to address any tensions between
these provisions and the access and information availability requirements [of sections 202(m)(4) and 202(m)(5)
of the Act], and, if necessary, to promulgate new regulations addressing EPA's concerns about tampering.'' The parties
further requested the Court to order that the anti-tampering provisions (and the incorporation of California's
anti-tampering regulations) be vacated and be declared void 

ab initio. 
On May 19, 1994, the Court ordered that the joint motion for remand be granted and that the anti-tampering regulation
be vacated. The Court also ordered that 40 CFR  86.094-17(j) be vacated to the extent it requires compliance
with California's anti-tampering regulations for those vehicles optionally certified to the California OBD II
requirements (Title 13, California Code of Regulations,  1968.1(d)). The Court also ordered the remainder
of the case be held in abeyance pending further order of the Court. 
EPA intends to issue a final rulemaking that will officially withdraw the anti-tampering provisions (40 CFR  86.094-18
and 40 CFR  86.094-17(j), to the extent it requires compliance with California's anti-tampering regulations
for those vehicles optionally certified to the California OBD II requirements) from the Code of Federal Regulations.
In addition, EPA is continuing to review its policy concerns regarding tampering, (i.e.

 modifications made to vehicles in order to, or resulting in, the vehicles' emission control systems being incapacitated,
damaged, or made less effective.) EPA may in the future determine that it is appropriate to promulgate new regulations
to address its concerns regarding tampering. If the Agency so determines, it will at that time publish a notice of proposed
rulemaking addressing these concerns.

Arkansas: Final Authorization of State Hazardous Waste Management 
Program Revisions 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Immediate final rule.


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The State of Arkansas has applied for final authorization of revision to its hazardous waste program under the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reviewed the State of Arkansas's
application and decided that its hazardous waste program revision satisfies all of the requirements necessary to
qualify for final authorization. Unless adverse written comments are received during the review and comment period
provided for public participation in this process, EPA intends to approve Arkansas's hazardous waste program revision
subject to the authority retained by EPA in accordance with the Hazardous Solid Waste Amendments of 1984. Arkansas's
application for the program revision is available for public review and comment.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
A. Background 


States with final authorization under section 3006(b) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (``RCRA or the
Act''), 42 U.S.C. 6926(b), have a continuing obligation to maintain a hazardous waste program that is equivalent
to, consistent with, and no less stringent than the Federal hazardous waste program. Revisions to State hazardous
waste programs are necessary when Federal or State statutory or regulatory authority is modified or when certain
other changes occur. Most commonly, State program revisions are necessitated by changes to EPA's regulations in
40 CFR parts 124, 260 through 268, and 270. 


B. Arkansas 


Arkansas initially received final authorization on January 25, 1985, (see 50 FR 1513) to implement its base hazardous
waste management program. Arkansas received authorization for revisions to its program on August 23, 1985, May 29,
1990 (see 55 FR 11192), November 18, 1991 (see 56 FR 57593 and 56 FR 47153), and December 4, 1992 (see 57 FR 45721 and 57
FR 45722). The authorized Arkansas RCRA program was incorporated by reference into the Code of Federal Regulations
effective December 13, 1993 (see 58 FR 52674). On June 9, 1994, Arkansas submitted a final complete program revision
application for additional program approvals. Today, Arkansas is seeking approval of its program revision in accordance
with 40 CFR 271.21(b)(3). 
EPA has reviewed the State of Arkansas's application, and decided that Arkansas's hazardous waste program revision
satisfies all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Consequently, EPA intends to grant
final authorization for Arkansas's additional program modifications. The public may submit written comments on
EPA's final decision until November 21, 1994. Copies of Arkansas's application for program revision are available
for inspection and copying at the locations indicated in the 

ADDRESSES

 section of this notice.

Approval of Arkansas's program revision shall become effective 75 days from the date this notice is published, unless
an adverse written comment pertaining to the State's application discussed in this notice is received by the end of
the comments period. If an adverse comment is received, EPA will publish either: (1) A withdrawal of the immediate
final decision; or (2) a notice containing a response to comments which either affirms that the immediate final decision
takes effect or reverses the decision. 
Arkansas's program revision application includes State regulatory changes that are equivalent to the rules promulgated
in the Federal RCRA implementing regulations in 40 CFR parts 124, 260 through 262, 264, 265, 266, 268, and 270 that were
published in the FR through June 30, 1992. This proposed approval includes the provisions that are listed in the chart
below. This chart lists the State analogs that are being recognized as equivalent to the appropriate Federal requirements.

Arkansas is not authorized to operate the Federal program on Indian lands. This authority remains with EPA.



C. Decision



I conclude that the Arkansas application for program revision meets all of the statutory and regulatory requirements
established by RCRA. Accordingly, Arkansas is granted final authorization to operate its hazardous waste program
as revised. Arkansas now has responsibility for permitting treatment, storage, and disposal facilities within
its borders and carrying out the the aspects of the RCRA program described in its revised program application, subject
to the limitations of the HSWA. Arkansas also has primary enforcement responsibilities, although EPA retains the
right to conduct inspections under section 3007 of RCRA and to take enforcement actions under sections 3008, 3013,
and 7003 of RCRA.



D. Codification in Part 272



EPA uses part 272 for codification of the decision to authorize Arkansas's program and for incorporation by reference
of those provisions of Arkansas's statutes and regulations that EPA will enforce under sections 3008, 3013, and 7003
of RCRA. Therefore, EPA is reserving amendment of part 272, subpart E until a later date.



Compliance With Executive Order 12866



The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 6 of Executive Order 12866.



Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act



Pursuant to the provisions of 4 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this authorization will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This authorization effectively suspends the applicability
of certain Federal regulations in favor of Arkansas's program, thereby eliminating duplicative requirements for
handlers of hazardous waste in the State. This authorization does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This
rule, therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.



Lists of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 271



Administrative practice and procedure, Confidential business information, Hazardous materials transportation,
Hazardous waste, Indian lands, Intergovernmental relations, Penalties, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements,
Water pollution control, Water supply.

B. Oklahoma 


Oklahoma initially received Final Authorization on January 10, 1985, (see 49 FR 50362) to implement its base hazardous
waste management program. Oklahoma received authorization for revisions to its program on June 18, 1990 (see 55 FR
14280), November 27, 1990 (see 55 FR 39274), June 3, 1991 (see 56 FR 13411), and November 19, 1991 (see 56 FR 47675). The
authorized Oklahoma RCRA program was incorporated by reference into the Code of Federal Regulations effective December
13, 1993. On August 3, 1994, Oklahoma submitted a final complete program revision application for additional program
approvals. Today, Oklahoma is seeking approval of its program revision in accordance with  271.21(b)(3).

Statutory authority is provided by the Oklahoma Hazardous Waste Management Act, as amended, 27A Oklahoma Statute
(O.S.) Supplement 1993,   2-7-101 et seq. The Act was amended May 28, 1993, and is expected
to be amended this legislative session by Senate Bills 832 and 997. Pursuant to this Act, the Oklahoma Department of
Environmental Quality (DEQ) adopted by reference the Rules and Regulations for Hazardous Waste Management, Oklahoma
Department of Health (ODH) Bulletin 0525, as amended on October 5, 1992. The Environmental Quality Board adopted
these rules by reference and without amendment, under the emergency rulemaking procedures of the Administrative
Procedures Act, 75 O. S. Supp. 1992   250 et seq. The Governor signed the emergency rulemaking action with
an effective date of July 1, 1993. 
On November 24, 1993, the Environmental Quality Board adopted permanent rules, Oklahoma Administrative Code (OAC)
Title 252 Chapter 200 (Rules) with an effective date of May 26, 1994. The Rules are a slightly modified version of the
former rules which were adopted by reference from ODH Bulletin 0525. Modifications include changing references
of Oklahoma State Department of Health to the Department of Environmental Quality, Commissioner of Health to Executive
Director, 310:270 to 252:200, and references of former statutory authority to present statutory authority. Substantive
changes are found in former OAC 310:270-11-2 ``County Commissioner Involvement In Permit Issuance'',
Tables 1, 2, and 3.B, dealing with fees, and Subchapter 17, which addresses tax credits.

award; the conditions for eligibility for the grant; limitations on the use of grant funds in certain circumstances;
reporting requirements; and an opportunity to appeal our determination regarding a State's grant application.


The provisions of this rule are in accordance with section 4360 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990.
In addition, this rule eliminates the supplemental coordinated care grants program.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
I. Background


Section 4360 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA '90), Public Law 101-508, and applicable
appropriations authorize us to make grants to States, Commonwealths, and Territories for health insurance advisory
service programs for Medicare beneficiaries. (Hereinafter, unless otherwise indicated, the term ``State'' or
``States'' includes the 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, and American
Samoa.) Grant funds are available to support providing information, counseling, and assistance (ICA) relating
to Medicare, Medicaid, Medicare supplemental policies, long-term care insurance, and other health insurance benefit
information. Thus, this funding activity is known as the Health Insurance ICA Grants Program.

Section 4360(a) of OBRA '90 specifies that, in order to 
be eligible for a grant under this program, the State must 
have a Federally-approved Medicare supplemental regulatory 
program under section 1882 of the Social Security Act (the 
Act) (42 USC 1395ss). Section 1882 addresses the 
certification of Medicare supplemental health insurance 
policies. In general, section 1882(b) provides that, if a 
State establishes, under State law, a regulatory program 
that applies the standards and requirements that the 
Secretary would apply to Medicare supplemental health 
insurance policies under section 1882(c) and that meets 
certain other criteria, those Medicare supplemental policies 
issued by the State are deemed to meet the standards and 
requirements that the Secretary would, herself, apply. 
Thus, in order to be eligible for an ICA grant a State must 
operate a regulatory program that we determine meets the 
criteria of section 1882(b) of the Act. 
Section 4360(b) of OBRA '90 specifies that, in 
submitting an application for an ICA grant, the State must 
submit a plan for a State-wide ICA program. It also 
specifies the minimum information that the program must 
provide to Medicare beneficiaries. 
Grant funding is available to States for projects to 
plan, implement, operate, and/or enhance a variety of ICA 
activities. States may request grant funds to develop new 
health insurance ICA programs or to enhance existing health 
insurance ICA programs that meet the requirements specified 
in section 4360 of OBRA '90. 
Section 4360(a) requires us to publish regulations to 
establish a minimum level of funding for a health insurance 
ICA grant. 
Subject to congressional appropriations, in accordance 
with the requirements of section 4360 of OBRA '90, we will 
announce the availability of funding for health insurance 
ICA grants. Solicitation and grant application packages 
will be mailed to the Governor (or his or her designee) of 
each eligible State. The closing date for receipt of 
applications will be approximately 60 days thereafter. 
Awards for health insurance ICA grants will be made before 
October 1 of the year in which the solicitation is made. 
ICA grants will be administered in accordance with the 
provisions of: 42 CFR part 403, subpart E; 45 CFR part 74, 
(which concerns administration of grants) as specified by 
 74.4(a)(2); 45 CFR part 92 (which concerns uniform 
administrative requirements for grants and cooperative 
agreements to State and local governments); the terms of the 
solicitation; and the terms of the notice of grant award. 


II. Provisions of this Final Rule With Comment Period 


On August 26, 1992, we published an interim final rule 
with comment period (57 FR 38616) that established a minimum 
level of funding for health insurance ICA grants made for 
fiscal years 1992 and 1993. Those provisions are contained 
at 42 CFR part 403, subpart E. In general, this final rule 
amends those provisions in order to establish a basis in 
regulations for continuation funding beyond FY 1993. It 
also eliminates the program of supplemental coordinated care 
grants. The provisions of this final rule with comment 
period are discussed below. 


A. Eligibility for Grants 


Based on sections 4360 (a) and (b) of OBRA '90, this 
rule specifies, in  403.501, that, in order to be eligible 
for a health insurance ICA grant, the State must_

<TEXT>
 

 Have a Federally-approved Medicare supplemental 
regulatory program under section 1882 of the Act; and 
 Submit a timely application to us that meets the 
requirements of section 4360 of OBRA '90; 42 CFR part 403, 
subpart E; and our solicitation for grant applications. 


B. Availability and Duration of Funds for Grants 


This rule specifies, at  403.502, that grants for a 
fiscal period will be approved subject to congressional 
appropriation of funds and, if applicable, satisfactory 
progress in each State's project under a preceding health 
insurance ICA grant. (The criteria by which progress will 
be evaluated and the performance standards for determining 
whether satisfactory progress has been made will be 
specified in the notice of grant award sent to each State.) 
Note that we may, at our discretion, set aside a portion of 
the appropriated funds to be used for ICA-related 
activities. The grant award is based on a 12-month period 
and is made by the close of a fiscal year for each State 
application approved by that date. However, information 
regarding the timing of the award and its duration will be 
included in the notice of grant solicitation, rather than 
included in the regulations. 


C. Number and Size of Grants 


This rule revises the provisions at existing  403.504. 
We continue to provide, at  403.504(a) for two types of 
grants: (1) New program grants, and (2) existing program 
enhancement grants for States with ``substantially similar'' 
health insurance ICA programs. We are interested in 
establishing or enhancing health insurance ICA programs in 
all eligible States. Therefore, under  403.504(b), each 
eligible State that submits an acceptable application will 
receive a grant that consists of two parts: a fixed amount 
(the minimum funding level) and a variable amount. Under 
 403.504(b), the grant available to each of the 50 States, 
Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia equals $75,000 
(the fixed amount), plus a per capita payment per resident 
Medicare beneficiary. Because of their relatively small 
populations, the grant available to the Virgin Islands, 
Guam, and American Samoa is $25,000 each (the fixed amount), 
plus a per capita payment per Medicare beneficiary residing 
in the territory. 
The establishment of the fixed amount portion of the 
grant award as the minimum funding level is a change from 
the minimum funding level described at existing 
 403.504(b). (Existing  403.504(b), which was applicable 
for fiscal years 1992 and 1993, provided that the minimum 
funding level consisted of two parts: a basic (fixed) 
portion and a variable portion.) We believe it is clearer 
(more descriptive) to establish as the minimum funding level 
a fixed, stated dollar amount and to consider the variable 
amount as being in addition to the minimum funding level. 
This change will not affect the amount of the grant award. 
The grant award will still consist of the fixed portion 
amount and the variable portion amount. 
The calculation of the variable portion of the grant is 
described at existing  403.405(c). We base the variable 
portion of the grant on the amount of available funds and a 
comparison of each State with the average of all of the 
States except the State being compared with respect to three 
factors that relate to the size of the State's Medicare 
population and where that population resides. The three 
factors are: the percentage of nationwide Medicare 
beneficiaries residing in the State, the State's proportion 
of Medicare beneficiaries to its total population, and the 
percentage of the State's Medicare beneficiary population 
that resides in rural areas. 
Nationally, the average variable payment is 
10.75 cents. A State with a higher than average proportion 
of Medicare beneficiaries to its total State population 
and/or a higher than average proportion of rural Medicare 
beneficiaries will receive variable funds greater than 
10.75 cents per beneficiary under this grant program. Of 
the total variable portion of the award, approximately 
75 percent is based on the number of Medicare beneficiaries 
in the State; approximately 10 percent is based on the 
proportion of Medicare beneficiaries to the total State 
population; and approximately 15 percent is based on the 
percentage of the State's Medicare beneficiary population 
that resides in rural areas. (We based population estimates 
on the U.S. Census estimates for 1990. The Medicare 
beneficiary estimates came from our beneficiary enrollment 
database as of July 1990. We consider ``rural areas'' to be 
counties located outside of metropolitan statistical areas.) 
At the time we announce the availability of grant funding, 
we provide each State with an estimate of the amount of 
funds that may be awarded to it. As part of its 
application, the State submits a budget based on the 
estimated amount. When the grant awards are made, we 
allocate all available monies based on the methodology 
described above. If the grant amount the State receives is 
different than the anticipated amount on which its budget 
was based, the State must submit, along with its acceptance 
of the grant award, a revised budget that is based on the 
amount of the award.

It has come to our attention that the provisions at 
existing  403.504, particularly paragraph (d) of that 
section, have caused confusion because they do not clearly 
reflect the above process. (Some interpreted paragraph (d) 
as indicating that there was a two-step process involved in 
applying for the grants. That is, that a State applied for 
and was awarded a basic grant and that, if there were 
additional funds available, the State submitted another 
application and a subsequent award was made.) This rule 
revises  403.504 to more clearly reflect the award process. 


D. Limitations 


In accordance with section 4360(c) of OBRA '90, this 
rule retains existing   403.508 (a) and (b), with editorial 
changes. Paragraphs (a) and (b) provide that a State that 
receives a grant under this program may, with one exception, 
use the grant for any expenses incurred in planning, 
developing, implementing, and/or operating the program for 
which the grant is made. The exception applies to a State 
that receives a grant to supplement an existing 
``substantially similar'' program. In this case, the State 
must not use the grant to supplant funds for activities that 
were conducted immediately preceding the date of the initial 
award of the grant and funded through other sources 
(including in-kind contributions), but must maintain the 
activities of the program at least at the level that those 
activities were conducted immediately preceding that date. 
(States will be required to provide information to document 
their maintenance of effort and funding levels.) 


E. Reporting Requirements 


In accordance with section 4360(e) of OBRA '90, which 
requires the State to submit to us an annual report on its 
ICA program, this rule provides that a State that receives a 
grant under this program must submit at least one annual 
report to us and any additional reports we prescribe in the 
notice of grant award. It further specifies that HCFA will 
advise the State of the requirements concerning the 
frequency, timing, and contents of the report(s) in the 
notice of grant award that it sends to the State. This rule 
removes existing paragraph (d) (``Annual report'') from 
 403.508 and establishes a new  403.510 (``Reporting 
requirements'') to set forth the reporting requirements as 
described above. 


F. Administration of Grants 


This rule adds  403.512(a) to identify those 
provisions that control the administration of the ICA 
grants. Section 403.512 specifies that health insurance ICA 
grants are administered in accordance with the provisions of 
42 CFR part 403, subpart E; certain provisions of 45 CFR 
part 74 (``Administration of Grants''), 45 CFR part 92 
(``Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and 
Cooperative Agreements to State and Local Governments''), the 
terms of the solicitation, and terms of the notice of grant 
award. Section 403.512(a) also specifies that, except for 
the minimum funding levels established by  403.504(b)(1), 
in the event of conflict between a provision of the notice 
of grant award and any provision of the solicitation, 
subpart E of 42 CFR part 403, or of 45 CFR part 74 or 
part 92, the terms of the notice of grant award prevail. 
This rule adds  403.512(b) to state that HCFA provides 
notice to each applicant regarding HCFA's decision on an 
application for grant funding under  403.504. 
This rule adds  403.512(c) to enable States to appeal, 
under 45 CFR part 16, HCFA's determination regarding its 
grant application. 45 CFR part 16 contains procedures for 
appealing a final decision to our Departmental Grant Appeals 
Board. 


G. Technical Change_Definition of ``State'' 


This rule revises the definition of ``State'' at 
 403.500(c) to correct the inadvertent omission of ``the 50 
States'' from the definition.

H. Elimination of Supplemental Coordinated Care Grants 
Program 



During fiscal years 1992 and 1993, supplemental grants 
were awarded to States for intensive, innovative approaches 
to making information, counseling, and/or assistance related 
to coordinated care benefits available to Medicare 
beneficiaries. The purpose of the grants was to encourage 
States with existing coordinated care programs to be more 
active in this area. We believe that States have now had 
adequate opportunity and funding to establish supplemental 
coordinated care materials and/or activities and that 
separate funding is no longer warranted. States should make 
provision in a grant awarded under  403.502 for any 
previous and/or current initiatives in ICA activities 
related to coordinated care. We may, however, make funds 
available from time to time to fund special ICA-related 
activities. 



III. Collection of Information Requirements 



Section 403.510 of this document contains information 
collection and recordkeeping requirements that were approved 
by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.) on 
January 2, 1994. The approval number is 0938-0641 and the 
expiration date is January 31, 1997. 



IV. Response to Comments 



Because of the large number of items of correspondence 
we normally receive on documents published for comment, we 
are not able to acknowledge or respond to them individually. 
Nevertheless, we will consider all comments that we received 
by the date and time specified in the ``Dates'' section of 
this preamble, and if we proceed with a subsequent document, 
we will respond to the comments in the preamble to that 
document. 



V. Waiver of Prior Notice with Comment Period and of 
Delayed Effective Date 



We ordinarily publish a general notice of proposed 
rulemaking in the 

Federal Register

 and invite public comment 
on the proposed rule. That rule would have included a 
reference to the legal authority under which it is proposed, 
and the terms and substance of the proposed rule or a 
description of the subjects and issues involved. This 
procedure can be waived, however, when an agency finds good 
cause that a notice and comment procedure is impracticable, 
unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest, and 
incorporates a statement of the finding and its reasons in 
the rule issued. Further, we generally provide for final 
rules to be effective no sooner than 30 days after the date 
of publication unless we find good cause to waive the delay. 

In the case of this rule, its principal effect is to 
continue the funding of an existing program rather than to 
implement a new program. The affected entities, that is, 
the States, are already familiar with the program and will 
receive separate, individual notice. Further, it is 
desirable that regulations that will govern the 
administration of FY 1994 grants be issued as soon as 
possible. Therefore, we find that it would be against the 
public interest to delay the publication of this rule 
pending completion of a prior public comment period. For 
the above reasons, we also find that it would be against the 
public interest to delay the effective date of this rule. 



VI. Regulatory Impact Statement 



Consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) 
(5 U.S.C. 601 through 612), we prepare a regulatory 
flexibility analysis unless the Secretary certifies that a 
rule will not have a significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities. States and 
individuals are not included in the definition of small 
entities. 

In addition, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the 
Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a rule 
may have a significant impact on the operations of a 
substantial number of small rural hospitals. This analysis 
must conform to the provisions of section 604 of the RFA. 
For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a 
small rural hospital as a hospital that is located outside 
of a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer than 50 
beds. 

This rule simply establishes the terms and conditions 
of funding for grants. It has no independent or 
consequential effect on the economy. The activities 
conducted under the grant may improve competition by 
informing consumers of health insurance alternatives. 

We are not preparing analyses for either the RFA or 
section 1102(b) of the Act because we have determined, and 
the Secretary certifies, that this interim final rule with 
comment period will not have a significant economic impact 
on a substantial number of small entities or a significant 
impact on the operations of a substantial number of small 
rural hospitals. 

In accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 
12866, this regulation was not reviewed by the Office of 
Management and Budget.

 403.500

Basis, scope, and definition. 



(a) 

Basis.

 This subpart implements, in part, the 
provisions of section 4360 of Public Law 101-508 by 
establishing a minimum level of funding for grants made to 
States for the purpose of providing information, counseling, 
and assistance relating to obtaining adequate and 
appropriate health insurance coverage to individuals 
eligible to receive benefits under the Medicare program. 

(b) 

Scope of subpart.

 This subpart sets forth the 
following: 

(1) Conditions of eligibility for the grant. 

(2) Minimum levels of funding for those States 
qualifying for the grants. 

(3) Reporting requirements. 

(c) 

Definition.

 For purposes of this subpart, the term 
``State'' includes (except where otherwise indicated by the 
context) the 50 States, the District of Columbia, the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, and 
American Samoa. 

3. A new  403.501 is added to read as follows: 



 403.501

 Eligibility for grants. 



To be eligible for a grant under this subpart, the 
State must have an approved Medicare supplemental regulatory 
program under section 1882 of the Act and submit a timely 
application to HCFA that meets the requirements of_


(a) Section 4360 of Public Law 101-508 (42 USC 
1395b-4); 

(b) This subpart; and 

(c) The applicable solicitation for grant applications 
issued by HCFA. 

4. Section 403.502 is revised to read as follows: 



 403.502

Availability of grants. 



HCFA awards funds to States subject to congressional 
appropriations of funds and, if applicable, subject to the 
satisfactory progress in the State's project during the 
preceding grant period. The criteria by which progress is 
evaluated and the performance standards for determining 
whether satisfactory progress has been made is specified in 
the notice of grant award sent to each State. HCFA advises 
each State as to when to make application and provides 
information as to the timing of the grant award and the 
duration of the grant award. HCFA also provides an estimate 
of the amount of funds that may be available to the State. 

5. Section 403.504 is revised to read as follows: 



 403.504

Number and size of grants. 



(a) 

General

. HCFA awards the following types of 
grants: 

(1) New program grants. 

(2) Existing program enhancement grants. 

(b) 

Grant Award.

 Each eligible State that submits an 
acceptable application receives a grant including a fixed 
amount (minimum funding level) and a variable amount. 

(1) A fixed portion is awarded to States in the 
following amounts: 

(i) Each of the 50 States, $75,000. 

(ii) The District of Columbia, $75,000. 

(iii) Puerto Rico, $75,000. 

(iv) American Samoa, $25,000. 

(v) Guam, $25,000. 

(vi) The Virgin Islands, $25,000. 

(2) A variable portion, which is based on the number and 
location of Medicare beneficiaries residing in the State is 
awarded to each State. The variable amount a particular 
State receives is determined as set forth in paragraph (c) 
of this section.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941007-0-00066 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941007-0-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(c) 

Calculation of variable portion of the grant.

 (1) HCFA bases the variable portion of the grant on_
(i) The amount of available funds, and

(ii) A comparison of each State with the average of all 
of the States (except the State being compared) with respect 
to three factors that relate to the size of the State's 
Medicare population and where that population resides. 

(2) The factors HCFA uses to compare States' Medicare 
populations comprise separate components of the variable 
amount. These factors, and the extent to which they each 
contribute to the variable amount, are as follows: 

(i) Approximately 75 percent of the variable amount is 
based on the number of Medicare beneficiaries living in the 
State as a percentage of all Medicare beneficiaries 
nationwide. 

(ii) Approximately 10 percent of the variable amount is 
based on the percentage of the State's total population who 
are Medicare beneficiaries. 

(iii) Approximately 15 percent of the variable amount 
is based on the percentage of the State's Medicare 
beneficiaries that reside in rural areas (``rural areas'' are 
defined as all areas not included within a Metropolitan 
Statistical Area). 

(3) Based on the foregoing four factors (that is, the 
amount of available funds and the three comparative 
factors), HCFA determines a variable rate for each 
participating State for each grant period. 

(d) 

Submission of revised budget

. A State that 
receives an amount of grant funds under this subpart that 
differs from the amount requested in the budget submitted 
with its application must submit a revised budget to HCFA, 
along with its acceptance of the grant award, that reflects 
the amount awarded. 


 403.506

[Removed]



6. Section 403.506 is removed. 

7. Section 403.508 is revised to read as follows: 



 403.508

Limitations. 



(a) 

Use of grants.

 Except as specified in paragraph 
(b) of this section, a State that receives a grant under 
this subpart may use the grant for any reasonable expenses 
incurred in planning, developing, implementing, and/or 
operating the program for which the grant is made. 

(b) 

Maintenance of effort.

 A State that receives a 
grant to supplement an existing program (that is, an 
existing program enhancement grant)_


(1) Must not use the grant to supplant funds for 
activities that were conducted immediately preceding the 
date of the initial award of a grant made under this subpart 
and funded through other sources (including in-kind 
contributions). 

(2) Must maintain the activities of the program at 
least at the level that those activities were conducted 
immediately preceding the initial award of a grant made 
under this subpart. 

8. Sections 403.510 and 403.512 are added to read as 
follows: 



 403.510

Reporting requirements. 



A State that receives a grant under this subpart must 
submit at least one annual report to HCFA and any additional 
reports as HCFA may prescribe in the notice of grant award. 
HCFA advises the State of the requirements concerning the 
frequency, timing, and contents of reports in the notice of 
grant award that it sends to the State. 



 403.512

Administration. 



(a) 

General.

 Administration of grants will be in 
accordance with the provisions of this subpart, 45 CFR part 
92 (``Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and 
Cooperative Agreements to State and Local Governments''), 45 
CFR 74.4, the terms of the solicitation, and the terms of 
the notice of grant award. Except for the minimum funding 
levels established by  403.504(b)(1), in the event of 
conflict between a provision of the notice of grant award, 
any provision of the solicitation, or of any regulation 
enumerated in 45 CFR 74.4 or in part 92, the terms of the 
notice of grant award control. 

(b) 

Notice.

 HCFA provides notice to each applicant 
regarding HCFA's decision on an application for grant 
funding under  403.504. 

(c) 

Appeal.

 Any applicant for a grant under this 
subpart has the right to appeal HCFA's determination 
regarding its application. Appeal procedures are governed 
by the regulations at 45 CFR part 16 (Procedures of the 
Departmental Grant Appeals Board).

Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement; Terrorist Countries


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of Defense (DoD).


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Interim rule with request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Director of Defense Procurement has issued an interim rule amending the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation
Supplement (DFARS) to require offerors and contractors to report commercial transactions they have conducted with
the government of a terrorist country.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
A. Background


Section 843 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 (Public Law 103-160) requires offerors
and contractors under DoD solicitations and contracts exceeding $5,000,000 to report commercial transactions
conducted with the Government of a terrorist country. This interim rule adds new language to DFARS Subpart 209.1,
a new provision at 252.209-7003, and a new clause at 252.209-7004 to implement the requirements of Section
843 of Public Law 103-160. The rule also revises the provision at 252.209-7001 for consistency with the
terminology used in the new provision and clause.


B. Regulatory Flexibility Act


The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within
the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq.

, because the rule only applies to contracts exceeding $5,000,000. An initial regulatory flexibility analysis has
therefore not been performed. Comments are invited from small businesses and other interested parties. Comments
from small entities concerning the affected subparts will be considered in accordance with Section 610 of the Act.
Such comments must be submitted separately and cite DFARS Case 93-D319 in correspondence.


C. Paperwork Reduction Act


The Paperwork Reduction Act applies. A request for approval of the information collection requirement has been sent
to the Office of Management and Budget.

<DOCTITLE>Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement; Award to Foreign Controlled Contractors</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of Defense (DoD).




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Director of Defense Procurement has issued a final rule amending the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation
Supplement (DFARS) to implement a statutory prohibition against award of a DoD contract under a national security
program to an entity controlled by a foreign government.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

A. Background




This amends and finalizes an interim rule published as Item VII of DAC 91-5, at 58 FR 28458, on May 13, 1993, that
implemented 10 U.S.C. 2536. 10 U.S.C. 2536 prohibits award of a DoD contract under a national security program to an
entity controlled by a foreign government, if access to proscribed information is required to perform the contract.

Section 842 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 (Pub. L. 103-160) amended 10 U.S.C.
2536 by revising the definition of ``entity controlled by a foreign government'' to exclude organizations and corporations
that are owned, but are not controlled, either directly or indirectly, by a foreign government if the ownership of
the organization or corporation by the foreign government was effective before October 23, 1992.

This final rule differs from the interim rule in that it (1) revises the definition of ``entity controlled by a foreign
government'' as required by Section 842 of Public Law 103-160; (2) revises the definition of ``effectively
owned or controlled'' for clarity; (3) revises the definition of ``foreign government'' for consistency with the
regulations of the Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control at 31 CFR Ch. V; and (4) contains minor clarifying
revisions.



B. Regulatory Flexibility Act



The Department of Defense certifies that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq

., because the rule only applies to a small number of contracts and companies. No comments were received on the impact
of this rule on small entities during the public comment period.



C. Paperwork Reduction Act



The Paperwork Reduction Act applies. The information collection requirement in this final rule is approved through
December 31, 1996, under OMB Control Number 0704-0353.

Charter Service Regulation; Technical Amendment 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Transit Administration, DOT. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final Rule; technical amendment. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document amends the Federal Transit 
Administration Charter Service Regulation by extending the 
charter service demonstration program mandated by section 3040 
of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) 
through October 31, 1995. This extension has been granted in 
order to accommodate several participants in the demonstration 
program, who consider that the initial demonstration period is 
inadequate. It will allow both public and private operators to 
participate in the program over two summer and two winter 
periods, thereby providing FTA with more substantive data on 
which to base its evaluation of the effectiveness of the 
program.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A final rule published in the 


Federal Register

 on July 9, 1993 (58 FR 36894) established a charter services demonstration program which would allow transit operators
to 
meet the needs of government, civic, charitable and other community activities, as directed by section 3040 of the
Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA). Under the program, recipients in eight sites within
four states are allowed to provide direct charter service as determined by local officials. The rule provided that
the demonstration program would be conducted from August 9, 1993, to August 9, 1994. 




Because of specific local circumstances, however, certain participants were unable to begin their demonstration
programs on the effective date of August 9, 1993. In order to provide these participants with a full 12-month implementation
period, FTA published, on October 12, 1993, a technical amendment extending the program through October 31, 1994
(58 FR 52684). 


In May 1994, the American Public Transit Association (APTA), on 
behalf of several transit agencies participating in the 
demonstration program, requested a further extension to allow 
both public and private operators to participate in the program 
over two summer and two winter periods. APTA indicated that the 
extension would provide FTA with more complete data 
upon which to base both its evaluation of the program and the 
report and recommendations to Congress on the charter regulation 
mandated by section 3040(c) of ISTEA. 

Section 3040 of ISTEA provides that the demonstration program 
should be established in consultation with both public and 
private operators. To this end, FTA developed the program in 
consultation with an advisory committee convened for that 
purpose, and composed of an equal number of representatives of 
the public and private sectors. Since some private operators 
in the demonstration sites are likely to be affected by the 
extension of the program, FTA forwarded copies of APTA's request 
to all of the private sector members of the advisory committee 
for comment. The majority of committee members responding to 
FTA's request for comments were favorable to an extension of the 
demonstration program. Moreover, FTA agrees that extending the 
demonstration would allow the collection of more substantive 
data on which to base its evaluation of the program. 
Accordingly, FTA hereby extends the charter service 
demonstration program for an additional 12-month period, ending 
on October 31, 1995. All transit agencies participating in the 
program may provide charter services in conformance with 49 CFR 
604.9(b)(8) during this period. 



Regulatory Impacts and Assurances 



A. Executive Order 12866 



The Department ha determined that this proposed rule is not subject to review under Executive Order 12866. Moreover,
the rule is not significant under the Department's Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; Feb. 26, 1979).
Since this final rule makes only technical 
amendments to current regulatory language, it is anticipated 
that the economic impact of this rulemaking will be minimal; 
therefore, a full regulatory evaluation is not required. 



B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 



In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), as added by the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act, Pub. L. 96-354, FTA certifies that this rule 
will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of 
small entities within the meaning of the Act. 



C. Paperwork Reduction Act 
 



This action does not contain a collection of information 
requirement for purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 
44 U.S.C. 3501, 

et seq.

 



D. Federalism 



This action has been reviewed under Executive Order 12612 on 
Federalism and FTA has determined that it does not have 
implications for principles of Federalism that warrant the 
preparation of a Federalism Assessment. If promulgated, this 
rule will not limit the policy making or administrative 
discretion of the States, nor will it impose additional costs or 
burdens on the States, nor will it affect the States' abilities 
to discharge the traditional State governmental functions or 
otherwise affect any aspect of State sovereignty.

to exempt from regulation the railroad transportation of rock salt and salt. The comments have been received and analyzed.
We are approving AAR's proposal. 

We reaffirm our initial finding that the exemption will not significantly affect either the quality of the human environment
or the conservation of energy resources. 

We also reaffirm our initial finding that the exemption will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Closure.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for pollock in Statistical Area 61 (between 159




 and 170




 W. long.) in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA). This action is necessary to prevent exceeding the 1994 total allowable catch
(TAC) for pollock in Statistical Area 61.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The groundfish fishery in the GOA exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the
Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the GOA (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council
under the authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed
by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 672.


In accordance with  672.20(c)(1)(ii)(B), the 1994 pollock TAC for Statistical Area 61 is established by the
final 1994 specifications (59 FR 7647, February 16, 1994) as 22,130 metric tons (mt). The fourth quarterly allowance
of that TAC for Statistical Area 61 became available at noon, October 1, 1994, pursuant to  672.20(a)(2)(iv).
The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Director), has determined, in accordance with  672.20(c)(2)(ii),
that the 1994 TAC for pollock in Statistical Area 61 soon will be reached. The Regional Director established a directed
fishing allowance of 21,500 mt, and has set aside the remaining 630 mt as bycatch to support other anticipated groundfish
fisheries. The Regional Director has determined that the directed fishing allowance has been reached. Consequently,
directed fishing for pollock in Statistical Area 61 is prohibited, effective from 12 noon, A.l.t., October 4, 1994,
until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994.
Directed fishing standards for applicable gear types may be found in the regulations at  672.20(g).

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS issues a final rule to implement Amendment 31 to the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Groundfish Fishery
of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area (BSAI), Amendment 35 to the FMP for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA),
and a regulatory amendment affecting the Pacific halibut fishery in and off of the State of Alaska (Alaska or State).
This action implements the Modified Block Proposal, which is necessary to prevent excessive consolidation of the
halibut and sablefish fisheries. This action also clarifies the transfer process for the Individual Fishing Quota
(IFQ) program.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 




Background 




The Modified Block Proposal, as well as the other alternatives for the IFQ program for fixed-gear halibut and sablefish
fisheries, are described in the Environmental Assessment/Regulatory Impact Review/Initial Regulatory Flexibility
Analysis (Analysis) dated December 17, 1993. Language amending the BSAI and the GOA FMPs was developed for the Modified
Block Proposal, the Council's chosen alternative. 
The amendments to the FMPs affect the sablefish fisheries in the exclusive economic zone off Alaska, which are managed
in accordance with the BSAI and the GOA groundfish FMPs. The Council prepared both FMPs under authority of the Magnuson
Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act).

The domestic fishery for halibut in and off of Alaska is managed by the International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC),
as provided by the Convention between the United States and Canada for the Preservation of the Halibut Fishery of the
Northern Pacific Ocean and the Bering Sea (Convention) and the Northern Pacific Halibut Act of 1982 (Halibut Act).
The Convention and the Halibut Act authorize the Council to develop regulations that are in addition to, but not in
conflict with, regulations adopted by the IPHC affecting the U.S. halibut fishery. Under this authority, the Council
may develop, for approval by NMFS, limited-access policies for the Pacific halibut fishery in Convention waters
in and off of Alaska. 
The Council acted under these authorities in recommending changes to the IFQ program for the halibut and sablefish
fisheries. The Council, through these changes, intends to promote the conservation and management of the sablefish
and halibut fisheries, and to further the objectives of the Magnuson Act and the Halibut Act. 


QS Block Proposals 


Concern over the potential for excessive consolidation of fishing privileges under the IFQ program was the impetus
for the Modified Block Proposal. The Modified Block Proposal provides that (1) initial allocations of QS that represent
less than 20,000 lb (9 mt) of IFQ in the implementation year will be issued as a block, (2) QS that represent 20,000 lb
(9 mt) or more of IFQ in the implementation year will be ``unblocked'' QS, and (3) QS in a block cannot be separated and
will have to be transferred as a block. For each species in each IFQ regulatory area, a person who does not hold any unblocked
QS can hold up to two QS blocks for that area, but the sum of the two QS blocks cannot exceed use limits in 50 CFR 676.22 (e)
and (f). A person who holds unblocked QS for an IFQ regulatory area can hold only one QS block for that area, provided
that the total QS held, blocked and unblocked, for that IFQ regulatory area does not exceed use limits referenced above.
The Modified Block Proposal also provides that QS blocks resulting in less than 1,000 lb (0.5 mt) of IFQ for halibut,
or 3,000 lb (1.4 mt) of IFQ for sablefish, in the implementation year can be combined. The QS block resulting from this
combination cannot exceed 1,000 lb (0.5 mt) for halibut or 3,000 lb (1.4 mt) for sablefish. This ``sweeping-up'' provision
will allow very small QS allocations to be combined into ``fishable'' amounts. 
The Modified Block Proposal is intended to reduce the maximum potential consolidation relative to the current IFQ
program. The Analysis indicated that, if actual consolidation is proportional to the estimates of maximum potential
consolidation, more QS holders are likely to remain in the halibut and sablefish fisheries under the Modified Block
Proposal than under the current IFQ program. 
The Modified Block Proposal will not interfere with the opportunities currently available under the IFQ program
for larger operations, because QS allocations for an IFQ regulatory area that represent 20,000 lb (9 mt) or more of
IFQ in 1994 will remain unblocked. The Council decided that the Modified Block Proposal would protect small producers,
part-time participants, and entry-level participants_who may tend to disappear because of excessive consolidation
under the current IFQ program_without compromising the flexibility and the economic efficiency of the IFQ program
as a whole. 
Whether QS is blocked or unblocked will be determined by the QS pools for each IFQ regulatory area as they exist on October
17, 1994. Using a specific date to calculate whether to block QS ensures that all persons are treated in a similar manner,
regardless of when their QS is issued. October 17, 1994, was chosen as the date to calculate QS because it was long enough
after the application period, which ended July 15, 1994, to allow the QS pools to achieve QS amounts reflective of their
eventual range, but long enough before the 1995 fishing season to allow for transfers of QS for that fishing season.



Transfer of QS Blocks 


Blocked and unblocked QS will be transferable subject to the approval of the Director, Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional
Director), and compliance with the transfer regulations found in 50 CFR part 676. Changes are made to the transfer
procedure in 50 CFR part 676 to accommodate the Modified Block Proposal, and to clarify further the transfer process.
Further information on the rationale for these changes, and on the Modified Block Proposal, can be found in the proposed
rule published in the 

Federal Register

 on June 28, 1994 (59 FR 33272).

Changes From the Proposed Rule in the Final Rule 


1. The amendatory language to  676.20 in the proposed rule was numbered in such a manner that existing paragraphs
(a)(1) 

Qualified persons 

and (a)(2) 

Vessel categories 

would have been deleted. This was a technical oversight. Paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of  676.20 will remain
as published on November 9, 1993 (58 FR 59375), and will not be amended by this final rule. The amendatory language in
paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of  676.20, which was in the proposed rule published June 28, 1994, (59 FR 33272)
will be incorporated in paragraph (a) of  676.20 of this final rule. 
2. The reference to  676.22 in  676.21(c)(2) was changed to  676.22(j) to indicate the paragraph
of the regulatory text intended to be referenced by the citation. 


Response to Comments 


Twenty-two letters of comments were received regarding the Modified Block Proposal. Twelve letters provided comments
that supported the Modified Block Proposal, eight letters provided comments in opposition, and two letters provided
no comments. These comments, which are summarized and responded to below, were considered during the formulation
of the final rule. 


Comment 1: 

The Modified Block Proposal is overly restrictive, especially to the smaller vessel categories. 


Response: 

Though the Modified Block Proposal will have a larger impact on the smaller vessel categories, the determining factor
of whose QS will be blocked is the amount of catch landed and duration of participation during the qualifying years,
not vessel size. Some owners/lessees of large and small vessels will be issued QS as a block, and some owners/lessees
will be issued unblocked QS. More owners/lessees of smaller vessels will have blocked QS due to smaller harvests during
the qualifying years. 


Comment 2: 

Most of the QS issued in smaller vessel categories will be blocked. The QS in small blocks will have less value, making
those blocks difficult to market. 


Response: 

The response to Comment 1 addresses why most QS issued in smaller vessel categories will be blocked. Any determination
on the value of blocked or unblocked QS, whether in large or small quantities, is purely speculative. Blocked QS may
be more or less valuable than unblocked QS, depending upon market forces. Small blocks, with their lesser overall
dollar value, will make the IFQ Program more accessible to new entrants. Furthermore, the Modified Block Proposal
allows very small blocks to be combined into fishable amounts under the ``sweep-up'' provision. 


Comment 3: 

All QS should be blocked or unblocked. It is inequitable and discriminatory to block some QS and not other QS.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941007-0-00078 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941007-0-00023 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Response: 

Blocking all QS was considered along with the Modified Block Proposal in the Analysis (see Sitka Block Alternative
and Full/Partial Block Alternative). The Council selected the Modified Block Proposal from among the other block
proposals because: (1) Like the other block alternatives, it prevented excessive consolidation of QS; and (2) unlike
the other block alternatives, it did not interfere with the opportunities currently available to larger operations
in the fixed-gear Pacific halibut and sablefish fisheries by blocking all QS. 
The guidelines for FMPs at 50 CFR 602.14 (national standard 4_Allocations) indicates that total parity in allocations
is not necessary to comport with fairness and equity. Allocation decisions by the Council may be fair and equitable
if those decisions are justified in terms of the objectives of the FMP amendment. The Modified Block Proposal was designed
to preserve the way of life for fishermen and their families and the dependence of local communities on the fishery,
which are legitimate social factors provided in the guidelines and identified by the Council. Furthermore, the Modified
Block Proposal does not discriminate between residents of different states, which is the standard specified at  602.14(b).



Comment 4: 

The Modified Block Proposal is inequitable because persons who were initially issued QS who owned/leased large vessels
will receive most of their QS unblocked, allowing them to purchase more QS up to the use cap. Persons who were initially
issued QS, however, who owned/leased small vessels will be issued their QS in blocks, preventing them from purchasing
QS up to the use cap. 


Response: 

As explained in the response to Comment 3, the Modified Block Proposal is not inequitable under the guidelines in 50
CFR part 602. Furthermore, although the Modified Block Proposal restricts the number of QS blocks that can be held
by a person (up to two blocks per species and area), it does not prevent a person from purchasing QS up to the use cap. For
example, if a person is initially issued QS in a block, that person, like a person who was initially issued unblocked
QS, can purchase unblocked QS up to the use cap. 


Comment 5: 

The Modified Block Proposal creates a monopoly that violates the anti-trust laws. The IFQ Program should be administered
under a ``free market'' system. Gear restrictions, rather than limited access, should be used to manage the resource.



Response: 

The Modified Block Proposal does not create a monopoly, nor does it violate anti-trust laws. The Modified Block Proposal
was designed to reduce consolidation by ensuring that more persons would hold QS under the Modified Block Proposal
than may have held QS without it. The consolidation that may have occurred without the Modified Block Proposal could
be more accurately characterized as a process that tends toward monopolistic control of the resource. 
QS, whether blocked or unblocked, is a harvest privilege that may be transferred. The value of transferred QS is not
limited by the program. The value of QS will be determined by market forces, and, therefore, the IFQ Program is administered
under a ``free market'' approach. 
Although gear restrictions can assist in managing a fishery, effective management requires a holistic approach.
The IFQ Program is one of the many management tools used by NMFS to manage effectively the Pacific halibut and sablefish
fisheries. 


Comment 6: 

The Modified Block Proposal will create different classes of QS holders depending on how much QS each person is issued.
The restrictions on the amount of blocks that can be held, along with the various sizes of blocks, may necessitate the
use of brokerage firms to facilitate transfers. 


Response: 

The Modified Block Proposal does not create different classes of QS holders. As explained in the response to Comment
1, the Modified Block Proposal establishes the criteria for determining whether QS will be blocked and unblocked.
A person, if issued QS in a block, is not prohibited from obtaining unblocked QS. The transferable nature of QS will
allow persons to hold blocked and/or unblocked QS, as long as the other requirements on holding QS are met. 
The Modified Block Proposal may increase QS transaction costs because some persons (i.e., those who already hold
the maximum blocks allowed) will be required to transfer away one block before another block can be transferred to
them. This cost may be exacerbated if the person who is making this transaction has a specific QS amount as a target.
The Analysis for the Modified Block Proposal contemplated and addressed this increase in transaction costs for transfers.
NMFS concluded from the Analysis that the benefits of curbing excessive consolidation outweighed the increase of
transaction costs for transfers.

Comment 7: 

Because blocks cannot be divided under the Modified Block Proposal, seizure of assets by the Internal Revenue Service
to collect on delinquent taxes would mean that the entire block would be seized, rather than just the portion of QS necessary
to satisfy the delinquency. 



Response: 

This course of events (i.e., seizing the entire block to satisfy a debt) was evaluated during the formulation of the
rule. NMFS decided that the administrative costs associated with dividing blocks was not justifiable, especially
because any inconvenience that may occur by seizing the entire block is due to the QS block holder's own delinquency.
QS blocks can be sold to satisfy the existing debt like any other indivisible asset. After the debt has been satisfied,
excess funds can be returned to the person whose block had been seized. 



Comment 8: 

The Modified Block Proposal will create greater administrative and enforcement costs for NMFS. 



Response: 

There will be no significant increase in administrative or enforcement costs because of the Modified Block Proposal.
The Modified Block Proposal will affect the initial allocation and transfer of QS. This can be monitored by the computer
at Restricted Access Management Division, NMFS, Alaska Region, which is currently programmed to perform this task.
The Modified Block Proposal will not affect IFQ resource harvesting or deliveries, minimizing any impacts on enforcement.




Comment 9: 

The Modified Block Proposal will decrease consolidation of fishing operations under the IFQ program. 



Response: 

The Modified Block Proposal was intended to prevent excessive consolidation that might have occurred under the IFQ
program. This rationale is discussed at length in the Analysis for the Modified Block Proposal and the proposed rule
published in the 

Federal Register

 on June 28, 1994 (59 FR 33272). In brief, the Modified Block Proposal will prevent excessive consolidation by blocking
a portion of the total amount of QS issued and by restricting the number of blocks that can be held by an individual. These
actions will increase the potential minimum holders of QS to an amount greater than under the status quo. 



Comment 10: 

The Modified Block Proposal will create block sizes that will provide easy access to the IFQ fisheries and maintain
diversity in the longline fleet. 



Response: 

Under the Modified Block Proposal, all initially issued QS that would result in less than 20,000 lb (9 mt) of IFQ using
the 1994 total allowable catch (TAC) would be blocked. This means that a variety of block sizes will be created, and
will be available for transfer. Persons who would like to enter the fishery would be able to secure a smaller block,
and then subsequently transfer the smaller block for a larger block as the fishing operation grows and the experience
of the person increases. This ``step'' approach, made possible by the Modified Block Proposal, assists in the growth
of each operation to efficient economies of scale. 

Also, the size and amount of QS blocks will remain constant, except for consolidation of the smallest blocks under
the ``sweep-up'' provision. This means that at least the minimum number of QS block holders will hold blocks of various
sizes, providing diversity in the longline fleet. 



Comment 11: 

The Modified Block Proposal will benefit coastal communities dependent on the IFQ fisheries by reducing the amount
of QS that can be consolidated into larger operations, ensuring a more uniform landing pattern of fishery product,
and providing higher levels of harvesting employment. 



Response: 

NMFS concurs with this comment. Along with reducing excessive consolidation, the Modified Block Proposal was designed
to benefit local coastal communities traditionally dependent on the Pacific halibut and sablefish fixed-gear fisheries.
As explained earlier, QS blocks will maintain diversity in the longline fleet by reducing the amount of QS available
for consolidation by larger operations. Also, smaller, locally owned and operated vessels are more likely to deliver
to local communities than larger vessels. This is because large vessels typically have the capacity to store large
quantities of fishery product for extended periods of time, thus enabling these vessels to deliver to ports other
than those located in local coastal communities.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941007-0-00080 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941007-0-00023 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

By increasing the potential minimum number of QS holders, the Modified Block Proposal will provide more employment
for fishermen and crew members. By increasing the potential for delivery of fishery product in coastal communities,
the Modified Block Proposal will provide more employment in the fishery processing sector for those communities.




Comment 12: 

The Modified Block Proposal can be repealed or modified at a later date if it turns out to be overly restrictive. 



Response: 

NMFS concurs with this comment. On the other hand, if the Modified Block Proposal is not adopted at this time, adoption
at a later time will not accomplish the same goals. Transfers and consolidation of QS that could occur if the Modified
Block Proposal is not in place when the IFQ program is implemented might cause irrevocable damage to coastal communities
and the small vessel fleet. 



Classification 



The Council prepared a final regulatory flexibility analysis (FRFA) that indicates the action will have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. By reducing consolidation, the Modified Block Proposal
may increase the total cost of harvesting the resource, thereby decreasing the net economic benefits of the IFQ Program
and increasing harvesting costs to small entities. The analysis in the FRFA also indicates that by reducing consolidation,
the Modified Block Proposal may result in higher levels of harvesting employment. Higher levels of harvesting employment
and maintenance of diversity in fishing operations participating in the IFQ Program are the main goals of the Modified
Block Proposal. A copy of the FRFA is available from the Council (see 

ADDRESSES

). 

This final rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866.

4. Section 676.21 is revised to read as follows: 



 676.21 

Transfer of QS and IFQ. 



Transfer of QS or IFQ means any transaction requiring QS, or the use thereof in the form of IFQ, to pass from one person
to another, permanently or for a fixed period of time, except that transactions requiring IFQ cards to be issued in
the name of a vessel master employed by an individual or a corporation are not transfers of QS or IFQ. 

(a) 

Transfer procedure. 

A person who receives QS by transfer may not use IFQ resulting from that QS for harvesting halibut or sablefish with
fixed gear until an Application for Transfer of QS/IFQ (Application for Transfer) is approved by the Regional Director.
The Regional Director shall provide an Application for Transfer form to any person on request. Persons who submit
an Application for Transfer to the Regional Director for approval will receive notification of the Regional Director's
decision to approve or disapprove the Application for Transfer, and, if applicable, the reason(s) for disapproval,
by mail posted on the date of that decision, unless another communication mode is requested on the Application for
Transfer. QS or IFQ accounts affected by an Application for Transfer approved by the Regional Director will change
on the date of approval. Any necessary IFQ permits will be sent with the notice of the Regional Director's decision.


(b) 

Application for Transfer approval criteria. 

Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, an Application for Transfer will not be approved until the Regional
Director has determined that: 

(1) The person applying for transfer received the QS or IFQ to be transferred: 

(i) By initial assignment by the Regional Director as provided in  676.20(a); or 

(ii) By approved transfer; 

(2) The person applying to receive the QS or IFQ meets the requirements of eligibility in paragraph (c) of this section;


(3) The person applying for transfer and the person applying to receive the QS or IFQ have their notarized signatures
on the Application for Transfer; 

(4) There are no fines, civil penalties, or other payments due and owing, or outstanding permit sanctions, resulting
from Federal fishery violations involving either person; 

(5) The person applying to receive the QS or IFQ currently exists;

(6) The transfer would not cause the person applying to receive the QS or IFQ to exceed the use limits in  676.22
(e) or (f); 
(7) The transfer would not violate the provisions of paragraph (f) of this section; and 
(8) Other pertinent information requested on the Application for Transfer has been supplied to the satisfaction
of the Regional Director. 
(c) 

Eligibility to receive QS or IFQ by transfer.

 All persons applying to receive QS or IFQ must submit an Application for Eligibility to Receive QS/IFQ (Application
for Eligibility), containing accurate information, to the Regional Director. The Regional Director will not approve
a transfer of IFQ or QS to a person until the Application for Eligibility for that person is approved by the Regional
Director. The Regional Director shall provide an Application for Eligibility form to any person on request. 
(1) A person must indicate on the Application for Eligibility whether the eligibility sought is as: 
(i) An individual; or 
(ii) A corporation, partnership, or other entity. 
(2) A person may submit the Application for Eligibility with the Application for Transfer or file the Application
for Eligibility prior to submitting the Application for Transfer. If a person, as described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii)
of this section, files the Application for Eligibility prior to submitting the Application for Transfer, and that
person's status subsequently changes, as described in  676.22(j), that person must resubmit an Application
for Eligibility before submitting, or with, the Application for Transfer. 
(3) The Regional Director's approval of an Application for Eligibility will be mailed to the person by certified mail.

(4) The Regional Director will notify the applicant if an Application for Eligibility is disapproved. This notification
of disapproval will include: 
(i) The disapproved Application for Eligibility; and 
(ii) An explanation why the Application for Eligibility was not approved. 
(5) Reasons for disapproval of an Application for Eligibility may include, but are not limited to: 
(i) Fewer than 150 days of experience working as an IFQ crew member; 
(ii) Lack of compliance with the U.S. citizenship or corporate ownership requirements specified by the definition
of ``person'' at  676.11; 
(iii) An incomplete Application for Eligibility; or 
(iv) Fines, civil penalties, or other payments due and owing, or outstanding permit sanctions, resulting from Federal
fishery violations. 
(d) 

Transfers of QS blocks.

 (1) A QS block must be transferred as an undivided whole, unless the size of the QS block exceeds the use limits specified
at  676.22. If the QS block to be transferred exceeds the use limits specified at 
 676.22, the Regional Director will divide the block into two blocks, one block containing the maximum amount
of QS allowable under the QS use limits and the other block containing the residual QS. 
(2) QS blocks representing less than 1,000 lb (0.5 mt) of IFQ for halibut or less than 3,000 lb (1.9 mt) for sablefish,
based on the factors listed in  676.20(a), for the same IFQ regulatory area and vessel category, may be consolidated
into larger QS blocks, provided that the consolidated QS blocks do not represent greater than 1,000 lb (0.5 mt) of IFQ
for halibut or greater than 3,000 lb (1.4 mt) of IFQ for sablefish based on the factors listed in  676.20(a). A
consolidated QS block cannot be divided and is considered a single block for purposes of use and transferability.

(e) 

Transfer of QS or IFQ with restrictions.

 If QS or IFQ must be transferred as a result of a court order, operation of law, or as part of a security agreement, but
the person receiving the QS or IFQ by transfer does not meet all of the eligibility requirements of this section, the
Regional Director will approve the Application for Transfer with restrictions. The Regional Director will not assign
IFQ resulting from the restricted QS to any person. IFQ with restrictions may not be used for harvesting halibut or
sablefish with fixed gear. The QS or IFQ will remain restricted until: 

(1) The person who received the QS or IFQ with restrictions meets the eligibility requirements of this section and
the Regional Director approves an Application for Eligibility for that person; or 

(2) The Regional Director approves the Application for Transfer from the person who received the QS or IFQ with restrictions
to a person who meets the requirements of this section. 

(f) 

Transfer restrictions.

 (1) Except as provided in paragraph (e) or paragraph (f)(2) of this section, only persons who are IFQ crew members,
or that were initially assigned catcher vessel QS, and meet the other requirements in this section may receive catcher
vessel QS. 

(2) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, only persons who are IFQ crew members may receive catcher
vessel QS in IFQ regulatory area 2C for halibut or in the IFQ regulatory area east of 140
  W. long. for sablefish. 

(3) Catcher vessel QS initially assigned to an individual may be transferred to a corporation that is solely owned
by the same individual. Such transfers of catcher vessel QS in IFQ regulatory area 2C for halibut or in the IFQ regulatory
area east of 140
  W. long. for sablefish will be governed by the use provisions of  676.22(i); the use provisions pertaining
to corporations at  676.22(j) shall not apply. 

(4) The Regional Director will not approve an Application for Transfer of catcher vessel QS subject to a lease or any
other condition of repossession or resale by the person transferring QS, except as provided in paragraph (g) of this
section, or by court order, operation of law, or as part of a security agreement. The Regional Director may request
a copy of the sales contract or other terms and conditions of transfer between two persons as supplementary information
to the transfer application. 

(g) 

Leasing QS (applicable until January 2, 1998).

 A person may not use IFQ resulting from a QS lease for harvesting halibut or sablefish until an Application for Transfer
complying with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section and the lease agreement are approved by the Regional
Director. A person may lease no more than 10 percent of that person's total catcher vessel QS for any IFQ species in any
IFQ regulatory area to one or more persons for any fishing year. After approving the Application for Transfer, the
Regional Director shall change any IFQ accounts affected by an approved QS lease and issue all necessary IFQ permits.
QS leases must comply with all transfer requirements specified in this section. All leases will expire on December
31 of the calendar year for which they are approved. 

5. Section 676.22 is amended by revising paragraph (g) to read as follows: 



 676.22 

Limitations on the use of QS and IFQ. 



* * * * * 



(g) 

Limitations on QS blocks.

 No person, individually or collectively, may hold more than two blocks for each species in any IFQ regulatory area,
except that if that person, individually or collectively, holds unblocked QS for a species in an IFQ regulatory area,
such person may only hold one QS block for that species in that IFQ regulatory area. For purposes of this section, holding,
or to hold, blocks of QS means being registered by NMFS as the person who received QS by initial assignment or approved
transfer.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Coast Guard is requiring all U.S. flag oil tankers of 150 gross tons and above and all other U.S. flag ships of 400
gross tons and above, to carry approved shipboard oil pollution emergency plans. These regulations also require
foreign oil tankers of 150 gross tons and above and other foreign ships of 400 gross tons and above, to carry evidence
of compliance with Regulation 26 when in the navigable waters of the United States. The regulations implement the
requirements of Regulation 26 of Annex I of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships,
1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978, as amended (MARPOL 73/78). The purpose of Regulation 26 is to improve response
capabilities and minimize the environmental impact of oil discharges from ships.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Drafting Information 



The principal persons involved in drafting this document are LTJG Christina Bjergo, Project Manager, and Ms. Jacqueline
L. Sullivan, Project Counsel, OPA 90 Staff. 



Regulatory History 



On March 5, 1993, the Coast Guard released Navigation and Vessel Inspection Circular (NVIC) No. 2-93 to provide
guidance to the affected community on compliance before Regulation 26 became effective for new ships on April 4, 1993.
The NVIC has no regulatory force; it simply provided guidance until the issuance of this regulation. The Coast Guard
also issued Change 1 to NVIC 2-93 on July 28, 1993, providing shipowners with the current list of national operational
contact points adopted by the Marine Environmental Protection Committee (MEPC). On February 17, 1994, the Coast
Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) entitled Shipboard Oil Pollution Emergency Plans in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 8086). The Coast Guard received 36 letters commenting on the proposal. A public hearing was not requested and
one was not held. 



Background and Purpose 



MARPOL 73/78 



The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (33 U.S.C. 1901 

et seq.

) (the Act) authorizes the Coast Guard to administer and enforce Annex I of the International Convention for the Prevention
of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978, as amended (MARPOL 73/78). Annex I of MARPOL 73/78
is entitled ``Regulations for the Prevention of Pollution by Oil'' and is designed to prevent the discharge of oil
into the marine environment. MARPOL 73/78 defines oil as petroleum in any form, including crude oil, fuel oil, sludge,
oil refuse, and refined products; it does not include animal or vegetable based oil or noxious liquid substances.




Regulation 26 



The MEPC of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) adopted Regulation 26 of Annex I of MARPOL 73/78 at its 31st
session in July 1991. Regulation 26 requires every oil tanker of 150 gross tons and above and every other ship of 400
gross tons and above to carry on board a shipboard oil pollution emergency plan approved by its flag state. This requirement
entered into force for party states, including the United States, on April 4, 1993, for new ships and enters into force
on April 4, 1995, for existing ships. 

The 32nd session of IMO in March 1992 adopted a set of guidelines (Resolution MEPC.54(32)) with more specific information
for the preparation of shipboard oil pollution emergency plans. The guidelines are intended to assist parties to
Annex I of MARPOL 73/78 in developing regulations for domestic implementation of Regulation 26, and are the basis
of this rule. 



Shipboard Oil Pollution Emergency Plans 



Regulation 26 requires that plans be prepared according to the guidelines developed by IMO and written in the working
language of the ship's master and officers. Plans must consist at least of_

(1) The procedure to be followed by the master or other persons having charge of the ship to report an oil pollution incident,
as required in article 8 and Protocol I of MARPOL 73/78; 

(2) The list of authorities or persons to be contacted in the event of an oil pollution incident; 

(3) A detailed description of the actions to be taken immediately by persons on board to reduce or control the discharge
of oil following the incident; and

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941007-0-00086 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941007-0-00024 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(4) The procedures and point of contact on the ship for coordinating shipboard activities with national and local
authorities in responding to the pollution.

The Regulation 26 guidelines expand on the four mandatory provisions of Regulation 26, and also address the following
non-mandatory provisions: plans and diagrams, ship-carried response equipment, public affairs, recordkeeping,
plan review, and plan testing.



Discussion of Comments and Changes



Thirty-six public comments were received in response to the NPRM. The Coast Guard has reviewed all of the comments
and, in some instances, revised the rule as appropriate. The comments have been grouped by issue, and are discussed
as follows.



1. Definitions



One comment stated that the term ``oil pollution emergency plan'' should be defined in the rule to include the response
plans required by other Federal agencies under OPA 90. The Coast Guard disagrees that this rulemaking should address
response plans required by other Federal agencies. However, this rule does not prohibit addressing other Federal,
State, or local requirements within the required plan.



2. Applicability



Four comments addressed the issue of applying Regulation 26 provisions to ships operating exclusively on the Great
Lakes or their connecting and tributary waters, or exclusively on the internal waters of the U.S. Three comments stated
that the requirements of Regulation 26 of MARPOL 73/78 should apply to vessels operating exclusively in the Great
Lakes. Because Canada will be requiring an oil pollution emergency plan within all waters under Canadian jurisdiction,
these comments encouraged the U.S. Coast Guard to implement consistent requirements to ensure a comparable level
of environmental protection throughout the Great Lakes. Another comment opposed applying Annexes I and II of MARPOL
73/78 to the Great Lakes arguing that the legislative history clearly indicates that Annexes I and II were intended
to apply to seagoing vessels only and not to vessels operating in internal waters.

The legislative history of the Act demonstrates congressional intent that Annexes I and II not apply to ships operating
exclusively on the Great Lakes. Therefore, the Coast Guard will not apply the requirements to ships operating exclusively
in these waters in this rule. The Coast Guard is still considering all comments received on this issue and is working
with the Canadian government to determine the best approach to resolve inconsistent requirements for ships operating
exclusively on the Great Lakes.

Three comments agreed with the applicability of this rule as it relates to mobile offshore drilling units (MODU's)
and fixed or floating drilling rigs or other platforms. All comments suggested revising the language of this section
to avoid misinterpretations. One suggested changing the format of the applicability section to describe which facilities
are covered rather than those that are exempt from the requirements. Another recommended distinguishing MODUs from
other types of floating rigs. The final comment wanted the Coast Guard to include information concerning other Federal
or State regulations that may be applicable.

In order to remain consistent with IMO Guidelines the Coast Guard will not revise the language of the text. The format
of the applicability section remains consistent with IMO Guidelines (Resolution MEPC.54(32)). However, for clarification,
Regulation 26 requirements apply to MODUs not engaged in their primary mode of operation, and apply to all MODUs while
in transit. In addition, this rulemaking was not intended to include other Federal or State requirements. Rather,
the Coast Guard encourages shipowners to consult other Federal, State, or local laws for additional requirements.

Two comments discussed the application of Regulation 26 to unmanned vessels. One comment recommended that unmanned
vessels be exempted from the requirement to have a shipboard oil pollution emergency plan aboard. The comment pointed
out that there will be no one aboard to use the plan and no place to store it. The other comment questioned whether U.S.
flag manned or unmanned tank barges will be required to carry approved plans. The Coast Guard recognizes the need to
specifically address the requirements for manned and unmanned vessels. Accordingly,  151.27(a) has been
revised. All manned vessels subject to the regulation must carry on board a shipboard oil pollution emergency plan
approved by the Coast Guard. For unmanned vessels subject to the regulation, the notification list required in  151.25(b)(3)
must be carried on board in the documentation container. The remaining sections of the plan must be maintained at the
vessel's home office. 

One comment suggested that language exempting vessels ``constructed or operated in such a manner that no oil can be
discharged from any portion thereof, intentionally or unintentionally * * *'' be deleted because
there is no guarantee that oil will not be spilled. The Coast Guard agrees with this suggestion and has revised  151.09(d)(2)
to state more clearly which vessels are exempted. 

One comment requested clarification on the tonnage to be used in determining the applicability to offshore marine
service vessels. The Coast Guard maintains that tonnage requirements are clearly defined and does not agree that
further clarification is necessary. Another comment pointed out that dedicated oil spill response vessels (OSRVs),
including dedicated tank barges, should be specifically exempted when not carrying cargo in bulk or when operating
in spill response areas as designated by the Federal On-scene Coordinator (FOSC). The Coast Guard does not agree with
this comment because the requirements of Regulation 26 apply to all ships that carry oil. 



3. Ships of Countries not Party to MARPOL



One comment expressed concern that non-party states may be afforded more favorable treatment than party states.
The Coast Guard does not agree with this comment. As discussed in  151.29, ships operating under the authority
of a country that is not a party to MARPOL, must comply with  151.21 of this rule while in the navigable waters of
the United States. However, the Coast Guard has amended the definition of ``shipboard oil pollution emergency plan''
to clarify the requirements for non-party states. 



4. Shipboard Oil Pollution Emergency Plans 





Plan format. 

Two comments addressed the format of the plan. One contended that the format and the language of the plan was too inflexible.
The comment further stated that owners should be permitted to deviate from form as long as the content of the plan satisfied
the requirements. The other comment stressed that the plan would be more useful in an emergency if it were a uniform,
fleetwide plan. To further international consistency and in recognition of such plans, the Coast Guard has adopted
the framework of the plan as set out in the IMO guidelines. The Coast Guard has determined that the plan allows for sufficient
flexibility. However, the material within the required sections can be developed with some flexibility by owners
and operators so they can be designed around their own ship's operations. Furthermore, requiring owners and operators
to create their own plans is preferable to having a uniform plan. The Coast Guard has determined that it helps them become
familiar with their own procedures, making them better prepared for an emergency. 

Two comments suggested that the format proposed in the NPRM should be in accordance with Resolution MEPC.54(32).
One of these comments also suggested that the Coast Guard accept and approve plans formatted in five sections in accordance
with Resolution MEPC.54(32), as well as those formatted in seven sections as specified in the NPRM. The Coast Guard
will continue to require that seven sections be included in the plan. These seven sections contain the same information
as the five sections in the Resolution MEPC.54(32). The Coast Guard has only reorganized the numbering to include
the required ``Introduction'' and ``Appendices'' as additional sections. This organizational change was made
to prevent misinterpretation of the requirements and help ensure that all requirements are incorporated into the
plan. The Coast Guard has added a sample index in Table 151.26(b)(8) of the rule to help the owner or operator properly
prepare the plan.

<TEXT>
 

One comment recommended that the rule specify introductory text for use when a plan complies with both Regulation
26 and the OPA 90 vessel response plan (VRP) requirements. The Coast Guard disagrees; this rule does not establish
requirements for plans required by  155.1030. Shipowners who wish to submit combined Regulation 26 and OPA
90 vessel response plans should refer to 33 CFR 155.1030(j).



Preamble. 

One comment noted that the preamble is not clear on the meaning of ``other shore-based plans.'' Basically, the Coast
Guard wants the owner and operator to be cognizant of existing State plans or other municipal plans, and plans of other
countries which may be applicable. They should consider if their Regulation 26 plan works well with other plans in
the system. Another comment recommends amending the preamble to make Regulation 26 plans consistent with area plans.
The Coast Guard maintains that shipboard oil pollution emergency plans are consistent with separate area plans.
National and local coordination is discussed in  151.26(b)(5) which requires that information be provided
to assist the master initiate action by the coastal state, local government, or other involved party. The plan must
include guidance to assist the master in organizing a response, should there be no organized response by shore authorities.




Reporting Requirements. 

Six comments recommended that the Coast Guard require an Oil Spill Removal Organization (OSRO) or some other type
of approved spill response contractor. They argued that these organizations will respond to an oil pollution incident
more effectively than cooperatives, individually contracted by shipowners. Three comments suggested that ship
owners or operators identify an individual qualified to respond. They contended that it will ensure that someone
is authorized to make decisions for the owner or operator on an immediate basis. The Coast Guard has determined that,
although it can not require this information, inclusion would enhance the plan and make it more effective. Further,
this concept is consistent with guidance contained in IMO Resolution A.741(18). Therefore, the Coast Guard has added
the identification of such persons and equipment to the list of non-mandatory provisions in  151.26(b)(7).

Two comments recommended that the Coast Guard consider an umbrella plan which covers multiple vessels. This approach
would allow incoming vessels to pay a fee to be covered by a State approved contingency plan and to have a primary contractor
immediately available. The Coast Guard disagrees with the concept of a ``model plan'' approach because it is important
for owners or operators to produce their own plans so that they are familiar with the process and the associated risks
involved. However, we agree that owners or operators should be able to utilize a standard plan covering similar types
of ships in their fleet. Accordingly,  151.27(c) has been added to incorporate this change.

Consistent with IMO guidelines, plan writers should consider the many variables in determining whether ships can
be grouped under the same plan. These variables may include type and size of ship, cargo, route, and shore based management
structure. For example single skinned oil tankers could be grouped in one plan, while double hulled tankers should
be grouped in another. It is important to note that although one plan can cover similar ships in an owner or operator's
fleet, an approved plan must be on board each ship.

Because multiple ships can be grouped under a single plan, and consistent with IMO guidelines, each plan must clearly
identify each ship to which the plan applies. The Coast Guard has determined that the ship's name, call sign, official
number, International Maritime Organization (IMO) international number, and principal characteristics are important
details that ensure that the plan applies to the particular ship for which it was intended. Section 151.26(b)(1)(ii)(A)
has been added to incorporate this requirement.

Six comments addressed the notification form in Table 151.26(b)(3)(ii)(A), that contains information to be provided
in the initial and follow-up reports. Two of the comments suggested evaluating the sample report format with respect
to the information required by the National Response Center (NRC). This would facilitate the timely transfer of information
to the NRC when the report is made. The Coast Guard agrees that the information on the form should coordinate with that
required by the NRC. The Coast Guard has worked with the NRC to provide consistent reporting requirements. 

Another comment noted that the information on the form differs slightly from the information required to be reported
under 33 CFR 151.15(e). The Coast Guard has determined that this issue warrants further consideration. The reporting
requirements in 33 CFR part 151 will be updated to reflect amendments to Protocol I of MARPOL 73/78 in a future rulemaking
project. 

The other two comments pointed out that the sample report format should require an estimate of the volume of oil spilled
during the incident. The Coast Guard agrees that there should be a place on the form to give brief details of the pollution
incident; this would include an estimate of the quantity of cargo lost. Block ``RR'' of Table 151.26(b)(3)(ii)(A)
already provides a place for this information to be recorded. Another comment notes that a space for the vessel's ``noun
name'' be included in the report. The Coast Guard agrees and has already provided block ``AA'' as the location for listing
the ship's name, call sign, or flag. Additionally, one comment stated that the incident reports be kept on file with
the plan and summarized with each annual letter. The Coast Guard has determined that there is no basis for establishing
this requirement. 

Three comments stated that qualifications on reportable conditions should be replaced with requirements consistent
with section 155.1035 of the interim final rule (IFR) for vessel response plans (58 FR 7424; February 5, 1993). They
noted that there is no need to add additional qualifiers when either a spill has occurred or there is a threat of a spill.
The Coast Guard disagrees and points out that reporting requirements for this rulemaking reflect the MARPOL standard.
They are not intended to mirror notification requirements described in  155.1035 which were issued under separate
legislation. As a result, the notification requirements will remain consistent with Regulation 26 of Annex I of MARPOL
73/78 as intended. 

One comment received suggested that a note be added to indicate that (for vessels in U.S. waters) a report made in conformance
with 46 CFR 4.04 satisfies the reporting requirements for probable discharges. The Coast Guard disagrees and contends
that regulations issued for marine casualties in 46 CFR part 4 were issued under separate legislation and do not require
notification to the NRC. This comment also suggests that we modify the information provided by MEPC/CIRC.267 to include
the phone number for the NRC. The Coast Guard supports this suggestion and has included the phone number in  151.26(b)(3)(iii)(B).


One comment contended that rather than merely referring to Protocol I of MARPOL 73/78, that the specific required
procedures should be listed. The Coast Guard disagrees, preferring to reference Protocol I of MARPOL which may be
amended periodically by the MARPOL Parties. 

Another comment contended that this rulemaking is redundant with the current requirements of 33 CFR 151.15. This
comment wanted it made clear what relationship and impact the proposed regulations have on current regulations in
33 CFR 151. This rule implements the requirements of Regulation 26 of Annex I of MARPOL 73/78 and will be added to the
existing MARPOL requirements published in 33 CFR 151. The purpose of Regulation 26 is to improve response capabilities
by establishing requirements to carry on board an oil pollution emergency plan.

One comment noted that it is unclear whether all incidents resulting in equipment failure or breakdown should be reported
or only those failures that may cause a probable discharge. They continued that reporting all incidents of equipment
failures may result in an undue burden on shipboard and shoreside response personnel. Further, this comment agrees
that the status and the role of all equipment that relates to the incident should be reported in the case of a probable
discharge. Reporting requirements placed in  151.26(b)(3)(i)(A) require notification of equipment damage
whenever there is a discharge or probable discharge of oil. It is recognized that it is impracticable to lay down a precise
definition of a probable discharge which would warrant an obligation to report. Nevertheless, as a general guideline,
reports should be made in cases of damage, failure, or breakdown which affect the safety of a ship. In addition, notification
should be made in cases of failure or breakdown of machinery or equipment which result in impairment of the safety of
navigation. The Coast Guard does not feel the notification requirements place an undue burden on ship operators.
These requirements are currently in force under Article 8 and Protocol I of MARPOL. Furthermore, the information
could be helpful in preventing a possible spill. The Coast Guard agrees that information on the status and role of all
equipment in the case of probable discharge would be useful. This information can be placed in the supplemental section
of the notification form if desired. However, this information will not be required. Initial notification must not
be delayed pending collection of this information. 



Steps to control a discharge.

 Seven comments addressed the steps to control a discharge section. Generally, all comments supported this section,
but suggested additional requirements be added. One comment was very supportive of the required checklists. This
comment also recommends that a new (C), (D), (E), and (F) be added. The comment suggested that these sections address
contracting with an approved spill response contractor, procedures for handling oily waste and recovered oil, strategies
for protecting the marine environment, and the type of communication system to be used. One comment recommended that
this section include five more parts to be compatible with Washington State requirements. Four comments urged the
Coast Guard to require prevention measures to be identified in the plan. One of the comments noted that prevention
rather than control of an oil spill should be emphasized. Furthermore, one comment requested that leak detection
equipment be required. Two comments noted that the scenarios should include procedures for responding to different
sizes and types of spills. Another comment questioned whether current regulatory requirements exist to ensure the
competency of masters and other key shipboard personnel such as training, prior experience, testing, and licensing.
Additionally, one comment suggested that the Coast Guard require an initial or follow-up report identifying where
damage stability and longitudinal strength information can be located. 

Regulation 26 was intended to require a simple plan. IMO guidelines were designed in part to help reduce error in an
emergency situation. Additional requirements would be beyond the scope of this rulemaking. While most of the information
suggested by the comments are covered by other plans, this information can be included in the non-mandatory section
of the shipboard oil pollution emergency plan at the shipowner's discretion. 



National and local coordination.

 Five comments expressed concerns about national and local coordination. Two comments stated that the requirements
in this section should be eliminated unless there was a specific purpose outside the scope of the international regulations.
Additionally, one of these comments stated that the requirements are ambiguous. It should be understood that the
IMO guidelines, upon which these rules are based, were intentionally designed to be flexible enough to meet the special
needs of various ships operating throughout the world.

One comment stated that coverage under an OPA 90 vessel response plan should satisfy the requirements of  151.26(b)(5),
provided the list of agencies and contacts required in  151.26(b)(6) are included for all of the vessel's operating
areas. Another comment argued that combined shipboard oil pollution emergency plans and vessel response plans required
by this part must be prepared in accordance with 33 CFR part 151. The Coast Guard disagrees with this comment and maintains
that Regulation 26 requirements should remain consistent with international standards. However, the OPA 90 vessel
response plan allows for submission of a combined plan that includes information from both the vessel response plan
and the shipboard oil pollution emergency plan, provided the single plan complies with both sets of requirements.
A combined plan must be prepared in accordance with 33 CFR section 155.1030(j). 

Three comments recommended that the section requiring detailed information for specific areas should be required
and not optional. Another comment suggested that the appendices should include detailed information for specific
areas, including which resources to call and which countries will respond to an incident and which will not. The Coast
Guard disagrees with these comments and will not require detailed information on specific areas. This information
will remain optional in accordance with IMO guidelines. However, the Coast Guard encourages shipowners to voluntarily
include this information to be better prepared in case of an oil spill emergency. 



Appendices.

 Four comments argued that the requirement to list and inform ``all parties with a financial interest in the ship''
should be deleted. One comment suggested that the entire appendix be omitted because the responsibility for informing
parties with a financial interest in the ship usually rests with management. Furthermore, they argue that the master
should only be concerned with notifications and actions necessary to mitigate the emergency, not managing business
that can be handled by the shoreside crisis management team. Another comment stated that the operator's staff should
determine and make the necessary contacts in regard to insurance and salvage interests. One comment believes that
the list required be limited to ship and cargo owners and insurers only. 

The Coast Guard has revised the language of the rule to be more consistent with IMO guidelines. However, the Coast Guard
maintains its position that the plan should provide details of all parties with a ``financial interest'' in the ship
who are to be advised in the event of an incident. The required information should be provided in the form of a contact
list. The Coast Guard recognizes that in the event of a serious incident, ship's personnel will be fully engaged in
saving life and taking steps to minimize the effects of the casualty. The comprehensive list of contacts may be maintained
in the corporate office if so noted in the plan. While procedures may vary between companies it is important that the
plan clearly specifies who will be responsible for informing the various interested parties such as cargo owners,
insurers, and salvage interests. It is also essential that both the ship's plan and its shoreside plan are coordinated
to guarantee that all parties having an interest are advised and to avoid duplication of reports.

One comment noted that the list of agencies or administrations which receive and act upon incident reports contained
in this section should not include areas of the world not traveled such as Asia and Europe for U.S. coastwise vessels.
They believe that only rescue coordination centers should be listed. The Coast Guard requires that ship owners or
operators whose vessels operate exclusively within U.S. coastal waters include in the list of coastal state administrations
the agencies or officials of only those coastal states reasonably expected to be affected in the case of a spill. However,
the Coast Guard has not changed the requirement to provide this list. 


Non-mandatory provisions.

 Five comments indicated that the non-mandatory provisions should remain non-mandatory and in accordance with Regulation
26 of Annex I of MARPOL 73/78. However, six comments argued that the non-mandatory provisions should become mandatory
and not be left to the discretion of the owner or operator. Additionally, one comment noted that plan exercising should
be the only element of these provisions that should be mandatory. One comment contended that the non-mandatory provisions
of Regulation 26 should be completely withdrawn from the final rule. One comment advised the Coast Guard to change
certain terminology to make section 151.26(b) ``advisory'' instead of mandatory. The Coast Guard has determined
to keep the non-mandatory provisions voluntary. To better clarify this point the word ``should'' in  151.26(b)(7)
has been replaced by the word ``may''. The Coast Guard encourages ship owners or operators to include non-mandatory
provisions in their plans. This information is only intended to assist in an emergency. 
One comment, in favor of making these provisions mandatory, made several specific recommendations as to what each
section should describe and include. One other comment recommended that it be made clear that a point of contact must
be established on board to coordinate response activities. Also, according to this comment, the onboard coordinator
should have the authority to commit to the hiring of resources in a timely manner. As previously stated, the Coast Guard
has added designation of an Oil Spill Removal Organization (OSRO) and an Individual Qualified to Respond to the list
of non-mandatory provisions. Additional information can be included in plans submitted if desired. 


5. Plan Submission and Approval. 


Eight comments discussed the time-frame for submission of shipboard oil pollution emergency plans for initial review,
reapproval, or for corrections to deficiencies in the plan. Five of those comments questioned whether 60 days is adequate
time for the Coast Guard to review the plans. Three comments discussed expanding the time limit. Their suggestions
included expanding the deadline from 60 days to 6 months, 120 days, and 60 days prior to April 4, 1995. Two comments urged
the Coast Guard to make provisions to allow vessels that have submitted plans by the required 60 days prior to April
4, 1995, but who have not received Coast Guard approval by April 4, 1995, to continue operating. 
The Coast Guard has modified the time-frame for submission of shipboard oil pollution emergency plans in response
to these comments. The rule has been revised so there will be adequate time for the plans to be reviewed. Plans must be
submitted for new ships 90 days before the ship intends to begin operations. Existing ships are required to submit
plans no later than January 4, 1995 (90 days prior to April 4, 1995). The Coast Guard will make determinations on all
submitted shipboard oil pollution emergency plans meeting this deadline. Because the April 4, 1995 deadline is fixed,
the Coast Guard encourages ship owners or operators to submit their plans as soon as possible, in case subsequent revisions
are required. 
The Coast Guard recognizes that there is a possibility that a plan received by January 4, 1995, may not receive Coast
Guard approval by April 4, 1995. Therefore, the Coast Guard intends to develop a policy of conditional acceptance,
whereby plans having a completed review by April 4, 1995, would be subject to a preliminary review checklist. If the
plan meets the criteria of the preliminary review, a letter would be sent to the shipowner or operator authorizing
continued operations until the Coast Guard completes its final review.

One comment recommended allowing 45 days for correction of deficiencies in the plan. One other comment recommended
a 60-day period for reapproval of the plan. The time period allowed for submitting plan revisions has been changed
from within 45 days of receipt of the notice. Revisions are to be resubmitted within the required time period specified
in the written notice. Although the time period for resubmission will normally be 45 days, this time period could be
lengthened by the Coast Guard when extensive revisions are required. 
Six comments addressed where the plans should be sent for review and approval. Four of the comments specifically stated
that the review process should take place at Coast Guard Headquarters. The other two comments suggested that any single
entity perform the review. The bases for their suggestions are for consistency in review, to avoid misinterpretation
of the regulations, and to avoid the confusion and varying levels of quality that a multiple-authority review system
would cause. The Coast Guard generally agrees with these comments. Therefore,   151.27 and 151.28 have
been revised to reflect that all plans will be submitted to Commandant (G-MEP-6) at U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters.
As a result of this decision, the Coast Guard has changed the final rule to require only one copy of the plan to be submitted
to Headquarters. 
One comment noted that this section should be modified to clarify how operators can submit amendments to their existing
OPA 90 VRP to satisfy these requirements. The provisions for amending existing vessel response plans are located
in 33 CFR section 155.1070. One other comment recommended charging a fee of $55.00 for the review of response plans
to recover the Federal Government's costs associated with the implementation of this rule. Imposition of a ``user
fee'' is outside the scope of this rulemaking. It may be separately addressed in a future rulemaking. 


6. Plan Review and Revision. 


Four comments addressed a specific time limit for plan review or revision. One of these comments noted that a time limit
for submission of revisions or amendments should be in place. The Coast Guard finds that the requirements in  151.28,
that the review must occur within 1 month of the anniversary date of Coast Guard approval of the plan, establishes a
time limit. 
One comment stated that the 5-year approval period for the plan seems excessive. It suggested that the regulations
should require notification to the Coast Guard within 3 months of implementing any changes to the plan, but that the
approval should continue indefinitely. The 5-year approval expiration date was selected to align with the VRP requirements.
The Coast Guard has determined that an indefinite approval is not possible. The Coast Guard finds that the plan validity
needs to be evaluated at least every 5 years. Therefore, the Coast Guard concludes that the 5-year plan approval expiration
date will remain and a formal request must be made to the Coast Guard at that time for reapproval of the existing plan
or approval of a new plan. 
Three comments opposed the requirement to submit an annual letter to the Coast Guard certifying that the review has
been completed. Two comments supported the review, but viewed the letter as unnecessary. Further, one of the comments
stated that the Coast Guard should only require the owner or operator to perform the annual review. They contended
that this would minimize unnecessary paperwork. The other comment suggested that rather than just requiring a review
and a letter to the Coast Guard, a requirement that the letter highlight alterations needed to the plan and discuss
any spill incidents occurring within the past year should be added to this section of the regulation. Additionally,
one comment stated that the annual review letter should be more specific and summarize spill incidents and identify
the preventive measures taken. The Coast Guard has determined that receiving an annual letter certifying that the
annual review has been completed helps keep the Coast Guard abreast of plan revisions on a yearly basis. The Coast Guard
opposes requiring additional information because it might create an unnecessary burden for shipowners or operators.

Four comments addressed the term ``homeport.'' Two of the comments contended that the term is incorrect. They suggested
use of the terms vessel's ``port of certification'' or ``port of record.'' One of the comments stated that the NPRM
should address procedures for plan approval should a vessel change its homeport. As discussed earlier, the Coast
Guard has eliminated the requirements to have plans, revisions, and annual letters submitted to the COTP or OCMI at
the ship's home port. Therefore, the term ``homeport'' is no longer used in the regulations. 
One comment writer found the reference to ``appropriate appendices'' confusing, and suggested that a better approach
would be to use language similar to that contained in  155.1070(a)(3). The Coast Guard agrees that the reference
to ``appropriate appendices'' could be misunderstood. Therefore,  151.28(d) has been revised to specify
that a record of the annual review and changes to the plan must be maintained in the last appendix of section six. 
Four comments expressed concern about consistency with other plans, such as the vessel response plan and the Washington
State contingency planning requirements. Their biggest concern was that the requirements of this plan may cause
major revisions to their existing plans, and that they may not provide for a rational mix of the requirements. The Coast
Guard understands the concerns expressed in these comments. However, this plan does not require extensive revisions
to any plan. The VRP IFR allows for the submission of a vessel response plan which complies with both sets of response
plan requirements. Tank vessel owners or operators may find it helpful to refer to  155.1030 of the VRP IFR for
additional requirements. This rule does not address other State or local requirements. 


7. Foreign Ships


One comment argued that the rule discriminates against foreign flag vessels and, therefore, is not in accordance
with customary international law. Furthermore, the comment states that U.S. vessels should be subject to the same
standards as foreign vessels in the navigable waters of the U.S. Both U.S. ships and foreign ships must carry a shipboard
oil pollution emergency plan on board while in the navigable waters of the United States. 


8. Discussion of Other Comments


One comment supported the Coast Guard's efforts to require a larger segment of the maritime industry to plan for spills
and supports working within the MARPOL Convention to establish international consistency. Furthermore, the comment
stated that consistency in planning requirements is the key to a better and more efficient system. The Coast Guard
agrees that ensuring consistency in planning requirements is one key step towards a more efficient system. The Coast
Guard finds that this plan is consistent on an international level. The comment also urged the Coast Guard to increase
the specificity of the planning requirements. The Coast Guard finds that an appropriate amount of specificity is
included. Therefore, the Coast Guard has concluded that it has provided a sufficient framework to build on. One comment
requested an extension of the comment period. The Coast Guard received comments after the comment period for the notice
of proposed rulemaking had closed. These comments were reviewed and included in the discussion of comments and changes.



Regulatory Evaluation 


This rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action under Section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under Section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has not been reviewed by the Office
of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the
Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). A draft Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph
10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT has been prepared and is available in the docket (CGD 93-030)
for inspection or copying where indicated under 

ADDRESSES.

 The Evaluation is summarized as follows. This rule will not result in annual costs of $100 million or more. It will have
no significant adverse effects on competition, employment, or other aspects of the economy, and will not result in
a major increase in costs and prices.

The Coast Guard assumes that 1,234 existing non-tank vessels will prepare shipboard oil pollution emergency plans
to meet the requirements of Regulation 26. In addition, the Coast Guard assumes that 284 existing tank vessels will
prepare and submit combined shipboard oil pollution emergency plans and OPA 90 vessel response plans. The Coast Guard
estimates that 16 ships will be constructed in the United States between April 4, 1993 and April 4, 1995. Therefore,
the Coast Guard estimates that a total of 1,534 U.S. flag ships must comply with Regulation 26 of Annex I of MARPOL 73/78.

Based on hourly cost data of those required to comply with Regulation 26, it is estimated to cost $4,320.00 to prepare
a shipboard oil pollution emergency plan. It is estimated to cost $855.00 to prepare the additional requirements
of a VRP that complies with MARPOL Regulation 26. The total cost to respondents for initial plan preparation in the
first year (1994) is estimated to be $5,642,820. In following years, the cost to industry will be based upon new vessels
that need to prepare an initial plan and vessels already complying that need to make revisions and obtain annual certification.
Review and revisions will take an average of 2 hours per vessel per year. Because an increasing number of new vessels
will be preparing initial plans each year, the costs will change accordingly. The Coast Guard will review submitted
shipboard oil pollution emergency plans to ensure compliance with Regulation 26. Total government costs associated
with the review of the plans are estimated to be $423,228 in the first year (1994). Review of revisions and certification
is expected to take an average of 0.75 hours per vessel per year. Again, the costs will change each year based on an increasing
number of new vessels coming into service. The net present value of the cost for the first 3 years, discounted at 7 percent,
is $5,626,297.25 to industry and $484,282.92 to the Coast Guard. The total net present value of the regulation for
1994, 1995, and 1996, is $6,110,580.17. 
The dollar value of direct societal benefits derived from the rule are not quantifiable, but may be substantial. Historical
data is insufficient to quantify benefits. However, this program should improve response capabilities and minimize
the environmental impact of oil discharges from ships. If efficiencies in the cleanup of spilled oil go up by only a
small percentage, the savings that would accrue to the maritime industry and to the public would exceed the costs.

Small Entities 


No comments received addressed the effects of this rulemaking on small entities. The Coast Guard expects that few
new costs will be associated with this rule because few small entities own ships of the gross tonnage to which this regulation
will apply. Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.
601 

et seq.

) that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 


Collection of Information 


This rule contains collection-of-information requirements in   151.26, 151.27, and 151.28. The Coast
Guard submitted the requirements to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review under section 3504(h) of
the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

), and OMB has assigned approval number 2115-0610. The Coast Guard has consolidated this information collection
(OMB approval number 2115-0610) into the information collection for response plans (OMB approval number is
2115-0595). The Coast Guard is currently awaiting approval of this consolidated information collection requirement.



Federalism 


The Coast Guard has analyzed this rule under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has
determined that this rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism
Assessment. 


Environment 


The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this rule and concluded that, under paragraph 2.B.2 of Commandant
Instruction M16475.1B, this rule is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. This rule
is expected to contribute to the reduction of the occurrence of ship-generated oil spills in the marine environment.
A Categorical Exclusion Determination is available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under


ADDRESSES.
