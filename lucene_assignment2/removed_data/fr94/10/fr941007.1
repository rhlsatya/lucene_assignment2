 Advance notice of proposed rulemaking.

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On September 8, 1993, the Department of Energy published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (58 FR 47326) regarding
energy conservation standards for three types of consumer products. In that Advance Notice, the Department stated
that it intended to consider more explicitly environmental and energy security externalities associated with alternative
energy efficiency standards. Specifically, the Department expressed the intention to monetize the values of any
externalized benefits (or costs) if a sound analytic basis could be found. 



The purpose of this notice is to solicit public comments on whether and how the Department should evaluate and consider
environmental and energy security externalities that may be associated with alternative, candidate energy efficiency
standards. It has three specific aims: First, it requests focused public input on specific questions related to the
development and use of environmental and energy security externality values. Second, it outlines the Department's
preliminary thinking in several of these issue areas in order to provide stakeholders with maximum available information.
Finally, it solicits public identification of other issues relevant to the application of externality values in
the context of appliance standards, so that these may be considered in appliance standards rulemakings.

I. Introduction



a. Authority



Part B of Title III of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, Pub. L. 94-163, as amended by the National Energy
Conservation Policy Act, Pub. L. 95-619, the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act, Pub. L. 100-12,
and the National Appliance Energy Conservation Amendments of 1988, Pub. L. 100-357,

1

 created the Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products other than Automobiles (Program). The consumer products
subject to the Program (often referred to hereafter as ``covered products'') are: Refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers,
and freezers; dishwashers; clothes washers; clothes dryers; water heaters; central air conditioners and central
air-conditioning heat pumps; furnaces; direct heating equipment; television sets; kitchen ranges and ovens; room
air conditioners; fluorescent lamp ballasts; and pool heaters; as well as any other consumer products classified
by the Secretary of Energy (Secretary) (section 322). To date, the Secretary has not so classified any additional
products.





Under the Act, the Program consists essentially of three parts: testing, labeling, and mandatory energy conservation
standards. DOE, in consultation with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, is required to amend or
establish new test procedures as appropriate for each of the covered products (section 323). The purpose of the test
procedures is to provide for test results that reflect the energy efficiency, energy use, or estimated annual operating
costs of each of the covered products (section 323(b)(3)).

The Federal Trade Commission is required by the Act to prescribe rules governing the labeling of covered products
for which test procedures have been prescribed by DOE (section 324(a)). These rules require that each particular
model of a covered product bear a label that indicates its annual operating cost and the range of estimated annual operating
costs for other models of that product class (section 324(c)(1)). At the present time, there are Federal Trade Commission
rules requiring labels for the following products: room air conditioners, furnaces, clothes washers, dishwashers,
water heaters, freezers, refrigerators and refrigerator-freezers, central air conditioners and central air-conditioning
heat pumps, and fluorescent lamp ballasts. 44 FR 66475, November 19, 1979; 52 FR 46888, December 10, 1987; and 54 FR
28031, July 5, 1989.

For each of 12 of the covered products, the Act prescribes an initial Federal energy conservation standard (section
325(b)-(h)). The Act establishes effective dates for the standards in 1988, 1990, 1992 or 1993, depending on the product,
and specifies that the standards are to be reviewed by DOE within three to ten years, also depending on the product (Ibid.).
After the specified three- to ten-year period, DOE may promulgate new standards for each product; however, the Secretary
may not prescribe any amended standard that increases the maximum allowable energy use or decreases the minimum required
energy efficiency of a covered product (section 325(l)(1)).

With regard to television sets, the Act allows DOE to prescribe an applicable standard. (section 325(i)(3)).

Three products (central air conditioners and central air-conditioning heat pumps; furnaces; and refrigerators,
refrigerator-freezers and freezers) are the subject of this rulemaking proceeding. For central air conditioners
and central air-conditioning heat pumps, the Act directs DOE to review each legislated standard for possible amendment
and to issue final rules as follows: for the seasonal energy efficiency ratio, no later than January 1, 1994, for units
manufactured after January 1, 1999; and for the heating seasonal performance factor, no later than January 1, 1994,
for units manufactured after January 1, 2002. For furnaces, the Act directs DOE to review the previously established
standard for small gas furnaces (54 FR 47916, November 17, 1989), the pending standard for mobile home furnaces, and
the legislated standards for all other covered furnaces for possible amendment and to issue final rules no later than
January 1, 1994, for units manufactured after January 1, 2002. For refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, and freezers,
the Act directs DOE to review the previous final rule, published November 17, 1989, for possible amendment and to issue
final rules no later than November 17, 1994, for units manufactured after January 1, 1998.

Any new or amended standard is required to be designed so as to achieve the maximum improvement in energy efficiency
that is technologically feasible and economically justified (section 325(l)(2)(A)).

Section 325(l)(2)(B)(i) provides that before DOE determines whether an energy conservation standard is economically
justified, it must first solicit comments on the proposed standard. After reviewing comments on the proposal, DOE
must then determine that the benefits of the standard exceed its burdens based, to the greatest extent practicable,
on a weighing of the following seven factors:

(1) The economic impact of the standard on the manufacturers and on the consumers of the products subject to such standard;

(2) The savings in operating costs throughout the estimated average life of the covered product in the type (or class)
compared to any increase in the price, initial charges, or maintenance expenses for the covered products that are
likely to result directly from the imposition of the standard;

(3) The total projected amount of energy savings likely to result directly from the imposition of the standard;

(4) Any lessening of the utility or the performance of the covered products likely to result from the imposition of
the standard;

(5) The impact of any lessening of competition, as determined in writing by the Attorney General, that is likely to
result from the imposition of the standard;

(6) The need for national energy conservation; and

(7) Other factors the Secretary considers relevant.

Section 327 of the Act addresses the effect of Federal rules concerning testing, labeling, and standards on State
laws or regulations concerning such matters. Generally, all such State laws or regulations are superseded by the
Act (section 327(a)-(c)). Exceptions to this general rule include the following: (1) State standards prescribed
or enacted before January 8, 1987, and applicable to appliances produced before January 3, 1988, may remain in effect
until the applicable energy conservation standard begins (section 327(b)(1)); (2) State procurement standards
which are more stringent than the applicable Federal standard (section 327(b)(2) and (e)) and certain building code
requirements for new construction, if certain criteria are met, are exempt from Federal preemption (sections 327(b)(3)
and (f)(1)-f(4)); (3) State regulations banning constant burning pilot lights in pool heaters; and (4) State
standards for television sets effective on or after January 1, 1992, may remain in effect in the absence of a Federal
standard for such products (sections 327(b)(6) and (c)).

The Act directs DOE to publish an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in advance of DOE consideration of prescribing
a new or amended standard.



b. Background



In the Advance Notice to which this is a supplement, the Department indicated its intention more explicitly to consider
environmental and energy security externalities associated with alternative energy efficiency standards. The
Department also noted that it would attempt to establish monetary values for externalities if a sound analytical
basis could be found for doing so.
 If the Department finds that a sound analytical basis exists, externalities may be incorporated in its analysis of
the net national benefits of alternative levels for the appliance efficiency standards covered by this rulemaking.





Externalities arise when the production or consumption of goods and services imposes costs or confers benefits on
members of society external to the transaction that are not reflected in market prices. Environmental externalities
reflect the net national reductions in the adverse health effects or other damages associated with a reduction in
emissions of pollutants due to reductions in energy use as appliance efficiency is increased. Energy security externalities
reflect the net national reductions in energy security vulnerability associated with reduced reliance on external
energy sources.

Many comments received in response to an earlier ANOPR in the appliance standards program
 indicated a high level of public interest in this issue.





 The American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy (ACEEE) suggested that DOE account explicitly for environmental
costs in its economic analysis. (ACEEE, No. 6 at 6).
 In addition, Public Citizen stated that the Department should include in its analyses all external costs and benefits,
e.g., environmental quality, national security, and reduced energy imports. (Public Citizen, No. 7 at 4).





 The Sierra Club stated that the difference between ``Consumer Analysis'' and ``Life Cycle Cost Analysis''
is difficult to ascertain. They urged DOE to evaluate, as part of the Consumer Analysis: (a) Environmental external
costs; and (b) national security and balance of payments costs of increased/decreased oil consumption. (Sierra
Club, No. 43 at 2).

 The Ohio Office of the Consumers Council (OOCC) said that the consumer and utility analyses should include
monetization of externalities (environmental and security). Environmental externalities include sulfur oxides,
carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate, and other air, water, and land use impacts of energy
production and use. Such considerations should be consistent with current trends in state utility regulations.
(OOCC, No. 60 at 2).

Recognizing that the specification of monetary values for such environmental and energy security externalities
is a complex analytical effort, the Department is now supplementing its original Advance Notice for the three-product
rulemaking. This supplement provides an indication of the Department's intent in this area, identifies a range of
specific issues for public comment, and solicits identification of additional relevant issues.

As indicated in the 1993 Advance Notice, the Department will attempt to develop analytically sound estimates of the
values of energy and environmental externalities. Provided that such values can be calculated, the Department intends
to use them in the analyses supporting the proposed and final rules establishing the standards for the products covered
by this notice. Estimates of such externalities would be considered in conjunction with the estimates of the total
net national benefits (or costs) of the standard, rather than in the analysis of consumer life-cycle costs. The life-cycle
cost analysis is intended to estimate the actual cost impacts on consumers. So long as externalities are not internalized,
individual consumers would not incur these benefits (or costs) directly.

The Department believes that the relationship between price and marginal cost, including the marginal cost of emission
controls, bears significantly on the size of the incremental adjustments to be made in the analysis in order to incorporate
environmental and energy security externalities into the assessment of net national benefits. The Department will
consider this relationship in determining the monetary values (if any) that should be placed on the external or marginal
environmental and energy benefits likely to result from appliance efficiency standards. The consideration of marginal
costs in this context also raises the question of whether the Department should use marginal electricity prices,
rather than estimates of average retail prices, for the calculation of net national benefits. The Department invites
comments on these issues. 

c. The potential impact of externalities on the determination of appliance efficiency standard levels. 

As noted above, the net national benefits estimated by the Department to result from appliance efficiency standards
have, in the past, excluded environmental and energy security externalities. The Department recognizes that the
approach taken for including these benefits in economic analyses of alternative appliance standards may vary, depending
on issues and variables that are specific to each standard under consideration. 

Any estimates of environmental externalities would reflect ranges of uncertainties and be considered with other
national benefits associated with appliance efficiency standards. The consideration of externality values may
or may not influence the appliance efficiency standards selected for one or more appliances, depending on the quantitative
externality estimates and their relationship to the costs of higher efficiency and other elements of the analysis.


d. The structure of the Department's analysis.

The Department intends to adopt a consistent approach in the treatment of externalities and the development of externality
values throughout these rulemakings. Therefore, this analysis starts with consideration of crosscutting issues
that are likely to bear on all standards and all types of externalities. This analysis of crosscutting questions provides
a framework for an analysis specific to each type of externality. 

The following discussion is framed around a series of focused issues for public comment. For convenience, the main
issues addressed are numbered consecutively throughout the entire notice. The numbered set provides a convenient
summary of the Department's current view regarding the issues that bear on the development and use of externality
values in the appliance standards analysis. 

Issues related to toxins, solid waste, and discharges affecting waste quality are not discussed in detail in this
notice. However, the Department invites comment on the potential importance of these emissions pathways to the determination
of externality values. Comments that are structured so as to address the same generic and externality-specific issues
raised in this notice, while also identifying other issues unique to particular pollutants or media, would be particularly
helpful. 

Finally, it is worth emphasizing that the Department's current positions on many issues outlined below is not yet
firm. Responses to issues in this supplemental Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking could substantially alter
the Department's approach as the rulemaking progresses. Parties are also encouraged to raise, and comment on, additional
issues related to evaluating externalities and the use of such estimates in determining appliance standard levels.




II. Crosscutting Issues 



a. Relationship to Existing Environmental Regulation and Existing Uses of Externality Values in the Resource Planning
Process 



Issue I: The relationship between existing environmental regulations or the use of externality values in the resource
planning process and the use of externality values in setting appliance standards. 

Based on its current information, the Department does not believe that existing programs of environmental regulation
or existing uses of externality adders in the resource planning process preclude the use of externality values in
analyses considered in setting appliance standards.

<TEXT>
 

The relationship between externality adders and environmental regulation has been extensively studied. One key
finding is that proper use of externality adders does not turn on whether there is ``overcontrol'' or ``undercontrol''
in existing environmental regulation. Rather, taking the environmental control regime as given, the use of externality
adders can improve net national welfare by moving ``private'' decisionmaking within the existing regulatory regime
closer to ``social'' decisionmaking. For example, even if there is ``overcontrol'', it is still desirable that the
external impacts of differences in residual damage resulting from differing emissions levels associated with alternative
energy supply and end-use efficiency options be reflected in private decision-making. 
 
Based on its current understanding, the Department also believes that existing uses of externality values in the
resource planning process do not present a barrier to the use of externality values in setting appliance standards.
The former are largely focused on bringing social costing considerations into capacity planning decisions, while
the latter is focused on reducing marginal electricity demand. The Department also notes that the use of externality
values in the capacity planning process is far from universal. According to a recent report of the Consumer Energy
Council of America Research Foundation (July 1993) only seven States and the Bonneville Power Administration use
quantitative externality values. 

Issue 2: The impact if any, of existing environmental regulations on the determination of externality values for
use in the appliance standards analysis. 

Based on its current understanding, the Department believes that the emission-reducing effects of existing programs
will affect externality values in two distinct ways. 

First, the form of current environmental regulations can influence the net emissions impact of changes in energy
use associated with alternative appliance standards. This net emissions impact reflects both the direct impact
of changes in energy use_emissions associated with changes in primary energy either directly or to generate additional
electricity_and indirect impacts that may arise due to emission caps, offset requirements, non-attainment rules,
or other features of existing regulations. 

For example, if regulation takes a form that fully ``internalizes'' environmental externalities on all of the relevant
margins, including, in the case of electricity, not only utility decisions related to capacity, but those related
to dispatch and additions to capacity, as well as consumer demand decisions, the role for a supplemental externality
value is difficult to identify. An emission tax equal to marginal damage that was reflected in the market price is one
example of a policy instrument (albeit not one in widespread use) that would align private and social decision-making
on all three margins.

<TEXT>
 

Second, current regulatory programs, whatever their form, have a significant influence on ambient concentrations
of pollutants. In general, the marginal damage associated with changes in net emissions due to alternative appliance
standards is sensitive to base level of pollutant loading. 

The Department notes that existing programs, notably implementation of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, could
result in significant changes in emissions loadings, and therefore change marginal damages, before the standards
promulgated pursuant to this rulemaking take effect. Economic growth over time would, in itself, tend to have the
opposite effect. The Department is currently considering how best to assess the marginal damages that should be associated
with any variation in emissions due to alternative appliance standards under these changing circumstances.

Issue 3: The geographic scope of environmental externalities that will be considered within the analysis.

Environmental externalities associated with energy-related emissions arise on all geographic scales. For example,
attainment of ambient air quality standards for criteria pollutants is assessed at the level of an air quality control
region, generally a county or regional metropolitan area airshed. Concentrations of the criteria pollutants Nitrous
Oxide (NO

X

), Sulfur Oxide (SO

X

), and ozone, the latter for which non-attainment remains a widespread problem, may be influenced by emissions of
Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), NO

X

 and SO

X

 from the energy sector.

Acid precipitation, for which NO

X

 and SO

X

 emissions from the utility sector are important precursors, is a pollution issue in which regional transport plays
a major role. In some parts of the country, the same is also true for smog.

Some issues involving energy-related emissions can even transcend national boundaries. Increasing attention
has turned to the possibility of climate change due to increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions. Carbon dioxide, primarily from the combustion of fossil fuels, is the single most important greenhouse
gas. Because atmospheric concentrations are driven by global emissions trends, concern with greenhouse gas emissions
is truly global in nature.

The Department believes that emissions impacts on all geographic scales are relevant to the development of externality
values for use in the context of this rulemaking. However, because appliance efficiency standards are implemented
at the national level, environmental externalities should be evaluated from a net national perspective. Thus, for
example, based on our current understanding, if variation in a standard increases environmental damage in some areas
while reducing it in others, only the change in net damage to the nation would be relevant to the comparison of alternative
standards. 



b. The Role of Damage-based and Cost-based Measures



Issue 4: The role of damage-based and cost-based measures in the development of externality values.

The Department believes that both types of measures may play a role in estimating the net national benefits of selecting
alternative energy efficiency standards. The Department does not view itself as facing a choice between damage-based
and cost-based measures; rather, different measures are applicable in different cases. Three different cases are
described below.

Regardless of which case applies, in all cases the Department's aim is to use economic analyses to quantify the change
in net national benefits attributable to different appliance efficiency standards.

Case 1: Changes in the efficiency standard selected will change national emission levels.

In this case, selecting a more energy-efficient standard will reduce emissions into the environment. The Department
believes that damage-based measures are the preferred means of valuing the external effects of these reductions.
Damaged-based estimates are a direct measure of the external effect of variations in emissions levels. Reductions
in damage due to reduced emissions could encompass reduced human morbidity or illness, reduced property damage,
and/or improved environmental resources.

The Department recognizes that, for many pollutants, the literature on the damages caused by additional emissions
is not well developed. When information on damages is lacking, the Department may consider the use of information
related to the costs of emissions reduction in its effort to values externalities. The rationale for this approach
is that control costs convey information about social willingness-to-pay for emissions reduction. If legislative
and regulatory actions to limit emissions were economically rational (i.e., control measures were adopted in strictly
increasing order of marginal cost, stopping at the point where marginal control cost and marginal benefits were equated),
marginal control costs would provide an indirect measure of marginal damages. It is generally recognized, however,
that actual regulatory practice often diverges significantly from these conditions. Therefore, the Department
proposes to consider the use of control cost information to estimate externality values in situations where changes
in efficiency standards affect emission levels only in those cases where direct damage information is unavailable.

Case 2: The pollutant is subject to a binding emissions cap and changes in the efficiency standard selected will not
change national emission levels.

With a binding, national emissions cap in place, the aggregate level of emissions will not be affected by the appliance
efficiency standard selected. Because of the cap, there is no net change in emissions and, therefore, there are usually
no environmental externalities.

Although in the case of an emissions cap there is usually no net environmental change on a national level, and therefore
no external environmental effect, the level of appliance efficiency standard selected may affect the net national
cost of meeting the emissions cap. For example, such a situation could arise from the need to meet progress requirements
under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. In such a case, adoption of a less stringent efficiency standard could trigger
adjustments in the State Implementation Plan to impose additional controls on other sources to compensate for higher
emissions from electricity generation or fuel combustion. If a more stringent appliance standard were adopted,
States might avoid the imposition of additional controls on other parties. 

The Department seeks comments on whether and how the net change in environmental control costs attributable to variation
across alternative appliance standards should be included as an external effect. In this regard, DOE notes that the
effect on control costs of lower energy demand resulting from a more stringent appliance standard will vary according
to the structure of pre-existing regulatory programs. In the case of sulfur dioxide, for example, control obligations
of each emission source will remain fixed, but total compliance costs will fall. In the case of NO

X

 and of VOCs, however, lower energy demand could reduce the extent to which State Implementation Plans must ratchet
down control requirements or expand the set of sources subject to emissions controls. The Department solicits comment
as to whether it is appropriate to differentiate these two situations, and how to calculate appropriate values of
net external cost savings.

It is worth noting that a binding national emissions cap may become non-binding over time, for example, through technology
improvements.

Case 3: The pollutant is subject to regional emission caps and changes in the efficiency standard selected will change
emission levels in some areas of the country, but not others.

For situations that fall into this category, DOE would propose to use a combination of the previous two cases for computing
external effects. Comments on how to combine these two approaches would be particularly helpful.

Issue 5: The use of cost information to provide a basis for determining society's willingness-to-pay for emissions
reduction.

As noted above, the preferred method for computing damages from a change in emissions is to rely on direct information
from damage-based studies. When damage-based studies are not available, however, the Department will consider
using control cost information to develop indirect estimates of externality values. 

The Department notes that existing environmental programs may embody an extremely wide range of marginal costs for
emission reductions for the same pollutant. Costs within existing programs may vary by an order of magnitude or more
across regions, and even across sources in a given region. For example, some areas have failed to implement advanced
inspection and maintenance programs costing $100 per ton, while choosing to implement other standards to reduce
the same pollutants costing $3,000 to $10,000 per ton. One issue is whether the cost of the most expensive option adopted,
the least expensive option rejected, or some other value between the two should be considered as most representative
of revealed societal willingness-to-pay for an emissions reduction.

<TEXT>
 

Externality values used in state resource planning processes may provide another expression of revealed willingness-to-pay
for emissions reductions. The Department recognizes that the values used in resource planning processes are not
actually ``paid'' by either consumers or utilities. However, the use of these values appears to be directly analogous
to that contemplated by the Department in the setting of appliance standards. As noted above, only seven states applied
monetary externality values as of July 1993. Other jurisdictions applied qualitative externality values or no such
values at all. If externality values used by state regulators were to be considered as an expression of willingness-to-pay,
the Department would need to develop a national average measure that fairly characterizes a widely disparate set
of policies across the fifty states. The Department now believes that any such average should reflect differences
in the size of residential electricity markets across states. We solicit comment and suggestions regarding how averaging
across different policy types could be implemented. 

Another issue related to the possible use of externality values from the resource planning process is that some states
have applied them in a manner that allows for the application of offsets for some or all pollutants. With offsets, sources
can reduce the quantity of emissions to which externality values are applied by securing cost-effective emissions
reductions (or emissions sequestration), often at a cost that is far below the official externality value. In such
cases, the product of actual emissions and the official externality value would significantly overstate the ``effective''
externality adjustment actually used in the planning process. The Department is considering how, if at all, offset
policies in the application of ``official'' externality values in the resource planning process bear on the relevance
of these values to the setting of appliance standards, where offset opportunities would not be available. 

Issue 6: The role of damage assessments implicit in official decisions, such as the setting of ambient air quality
standards on damage estimates used in the appliance standards analysis. 

The Department notes that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other Federal agencies have the statutory
responsibility to establish standards that reflect their assessment of damages from environmental externalities.
For example, EPA is required to set primary ambient air quality standards at levels that protect the public health,
including the health of sensitive populations, with an adequate margin of safety. 

On the one hand, the Department could rely on existing standards in determining that emissions that do not contribute
to a standards violation do not impact human health in any way. Such reliance would not, of course, preclude the finding
of other types of environmental externalities, such as ecosystem or crop damages, for emissions that do not contribute
to standards violations. 

Alternatively, the Department, recognizing that appliance standards promulgated today will have their primary
effect five to ten years into the future, and that processes for setting environmental standards often engender significant
lags, might wish to consider studies pointing to adverse health effects at concentrations below currently applicable
standards in assessing health damages. How the Department could decide which evidence is credible and relevant without
duplicating the review process for setting environmental standards, which is clearly infeasible in terms of resource
requirements, is an open issue. 



C. Utility Pricing and Incremental Externality Values 



Issue 7: The impact of the utility sector pricing practices on the use of externality adders in the appliance standards
analysis. 

State utility regulatory commissions, motivated by the historical natural monopoly features of electric and natural
gas production, transportation, and distribution systems (although production systems are now increasingly seen
as allowing for competition), generally set regulated prices for electricity based on embedded rather than marginal
cost. Based on its present understanding, the Department believes that the relationship between price and marginal
cost can have a major bearing on the application of externality values in setting appliance standards. 

Some background is helpful. In the absence of externalities, the theoretical economic conditions for social welfare
maximization are met when price equals marginal cost (a pricing condition enforced by competition in perfectly competitive
industries) and each consumer sets demand to equate this marginal cost with his/her own marginal private benefit
(or marginal utility). With externalities, this private market solution diverges from the necessary conditions
for a social optimum because external costs imposed on others are not reflected in decision-making. An appropriate
externality tax or adder can move private decision-making towards the social optimum. 

Within this context, consideration of the effects of a gap between price and marginal cost on the size of incremental
externality values is straightforward. Suppose, for example, that the price charged to end-users exceeds the marginal
private cost of producing and delivering electricity (or natural gas) to them. Then, in terms of private decision-making,
the positive gap by which price exceeds marginal cost would have the same effect as a tax in reducing electricity consumption
(and, implicitly, the emissions and the environmental externalities associated with production to meet incremental
demand).

Because a positive difference between price and marginal cost functions as if it were a tax, it bears significantly
on the size of the additional externality adder the Department could justifiably employ when calculating the net
national benefit of alternative standards. For example, if the price of a marginal kilowatt were to exceed its marginal
cost by an amount equal to the value of the marginal externality damage, the pricing distortion in utility markets
and the externality would together create a situation where utility-customer decision-making would satisfy the
marginal conditions for social optimality without any further adjustments. An additional externality adder in
this situation would move away from the alignment of the private and social decision-making problems that motivates
concern with externalities in the first place. Based on this reasoning, DOE believes that application of an additional
externality adder in any situation where the price of a marginal kilowatt exceeds marginal cost by more than the value
of the marginal externality damage would be inconsistent with the objective of maximizing net national benefits.
In fact, for this latter case, one can envision arguments in favor of applying ``subtractors'' to utility rates used
in a calculation of net national benefits. 

The Department recognizes that real-world utility pricing systems are quite complex. Many systems employ a fixed
connection or service charge, together with prices to meet incremental demand that may vary with the class of service,
time of day, or level of demand within a billing period. The analysis that supports the appliance standards rulemakings
does not reflect this complexity. Rather, a national average is used to represent current and forecasted consumer
prices. Based on its present information, the Department believes that the difference between this ``analysis price''
and marginal cost, rather than the difference between some true marginal price and marginal cost, is relevant to establishing
the gap between price and cost that bears on the incorporation of incremental externality values in the Department's
analysis. The Department seeks comment on alternatives to national averages that would better reflect local and
regional differences in consumer prices, as well as the other sources of price variation mentioned above. 

Finally, in some circumstances, the price facing end-users may be less than marginal cost. The same principles would
apply. Even ignoring externalities, prices below marginal cost encourage demand whose value to users is less than
the cost of production to meet it. To correct this situation and at the same time reflect externalities that may also
be present, it would be necessary to apply adders larger than the marginal damage from emissions associated with increased
energy demand. 

Given the above, the relationship between price and marginal cost is clearly central to the determination of externality
values for use in setting appliance standards.

First, the Department recognizes that the price/marginal cost relationship can vary significantly across utilities.
Given the national applicability of appliance standards, we will seek to estimate a price/marginal cost relationship
that characterizes national average conditions. The rationale here is identical to that for focusing on national
average emission impacts. 
Second, the relationship between price and marginal cost may vary across appliances because of the differences in
load shapes. For example, refrigerators that run continuously might be considered as contributing to ``base load'',
while air conditioners, which are used most intensively on hot afternoons, contribute primarily to ``peak load.''
The Department solicits comment on the need to develop information on the relationship between price and marginal
cost, relevant to each individual appliance. 
Finally, there are several different marginal cost concepts. Short run marginal cost may, in systems with excess
capacity, include only fuel and incremental fuel and operation and maintenance costs. A long-run marginal cost concept
would also include the capital costs of generating facilities. To the extent that transmission and distribution
infrastructure costs also vary with marginal demand, these too can be included in marginal cost. 
The Department has not yet developed quantitative estimates of the relationship between price and marginal cost,
or determined which marginal cost concept is relevant to the question of externality adders. Evidence that would
be relevant to such a quantification includes: 
(1) The gap between prices to industrial and residential consumers. Assuming that PUC's do not permit sales to industrial
users at prices below marginal cost (to do so would force residential and commercial customers to pick up 100 percent
of system fixed costs plus a portion of variable costs incurred for utility customers), the price of power to industrial
customers with an adjustment for any difference in marginal transmission and distribution costs between the residential
and industrial classes, could be taken as an upper bound on marginal supply costs to residential customers. 
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported national average electricity rates in 1992 for residential
and industrial consumers of $0.082 per kilowatt hour (kWh) and $0.048 per kilowatt hour (kWh), respectively. For
natural gas, EIA reports average rates in 1992 of $5.87 per thousand cubic feet and $2.82 per thousand cubic feet for
residential and industrial consumers, respectively.
 




(2) The capital and operating cost of incremental capacity. If meeting marginal demand requires new capacity, the
relevant marginal cost should include capacity cost. Current estimates of fully-loaded marginal costs for natural
gas combined cycle plants or pulverized coal plants are $0.035/kwh to $0.045/kwh. Again, marginal transmission
and distribution costs, if any, would also need to be considered. 
(3) The marginal cost of dispatching the least efficient capacity in systems with excess capacity. One insight into
these costs can be gained by examining the operation and maintenance costs, on a per kilowatt basis, of combustion
turbines used for peaking purposes on some systems. Another perspective may be provided by the cost per kilowatt hour
of peak-shaving, demand-side management programs approved by various public utility regulatory commissions.
Public comments providing information related to these measurement approaches and their qualification would be
especially helpful. 
The Department solicits comment on the relevance of the categories of evidence cited above, as well as other types
of evidence, in establishing a reasoned estimate of the relationship between price and marginal cost. 


III. Environmental Externalities 


Issue 9: The types of environmental emissions from the energy sector to be included in the Department's consideration
of the use of externality values in the context of appliance standards.

In this section, the Department builds on the crosscutting analysis presented above to outline an approach for analysis
of three types of energy-related emissions_sulfur oxides (SO

X

), nitrous oxides (NO

X

), and carbon dioxide (CO

2

). The focus on these three emission categories reflects a similar focus in recent U.S. legislation and international
agreements, most notably the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and the Framework Convention on Climate Change. 
The Department recognizes that there are other types of emissions, such as particulates, carbon monoxide, air toxins,
volatile organic compounds, solid wastes, and water discharges associated with energy use. Moreover, consideration
of the entire fuel cycle may reveal additional environmental externalities at the extraction or transportation
stages of the cycle. The Department welcomes comment and evidence regarding the importance of other types of externalities
that may arise through these and other emissions pathways that are not discussed below. Comments that are structured
so as to address the same generic- and externality- specific issues raised in this notice, while also identifying
other issues unique to particular pollutants or media, would be particularly helpful. Each of the discussions of
the individual pollutants addresses a common set of issues as well as points specific to that emissions category.
The common issues are: 
Issue 10: The local, regional, national, and global externalities associated with each type of emission. 
Issue 11: The impact of a change in appliance efficiency standards on emissions, taking account of both direct impacts
and the indirect effects arising from existing regulatory structures. 
Issue 12: Evidence regarding the impact of change in emissions on the level of environmental damage to external parties.
Alternatively, if damage cannot be estimated directly, evidence regarding cost-based measures available as surrogates.

Issue 13: The impact and relevance of a change in appliance efficiency standards on the emission control obligations
of external parties. 
Finally, it is important to note that the relationship between price and marginal cost discussed as a crosscutting
issue will be relevant to the determination of whether an application of an incremental externality value is appropriate
in those cases where an environmental or energy security externality is identified. 


a. Sulfur Dioxide 


Sulfur dioxide emissions are implicated in environmental effects at the local, regional, and global level. At the
local level, sulfur dioxide is one of the criteria pollutants for which ambient air quality standards are established
under the Clean Air Act. At the regional level, sulfur dioxide is a precursor of acid rain, an issue addressed in Title
IV of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. At the global level, the 1992 Supplementary Scientific Assessment of Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change identifies sulfate aerosols as a potentially significant offset to greenhouse warming that
may be caused by increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. 
Based on its present information, the Department believes that attention in this rulemaking should focus on externalities
related to the acid precipitation pathway, and therefore on the regional effects. On the local level, there is already
widespread attainment with ambient air quality standards for sulfur dioxide. On the global level, the effect of sulfur
dioxide emissions as an offset to greenhouse warming remains speculative, and its value may be undercut by its extremely
short duration relative to warming from greenhouse gases. 
The acid precipitation issue is addressed in Title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. Beginning in the year
2000, its provisions implement a national cap on utility sulfur dioxide emissions of 8.9 million tons together with
a system of tradable allowances for allocating the burden of emissions reduction in a cost-effective manner. The
cap reflects a reduction of roughly 50 percent from 1980 emission levels. 
The Department expects that the national emissions cap will be binding and, concomitantly, that allowance prices
will be positive. The Department notes that allowance transactions at positive prices are being recorded in increasing
number, and there are no known projections that suggest a non-binding cap. 
Under a binding cap, reductions in SO

2

 emissions at one location due to reductions in electricity demand would free up emissions allowances, the use of which
could increase allowable emissions at other locations, unless allowances were ``banked''. With no change in overall
emissions, the Department has no basis for assuming that alternative appliance standards would cause any change
in environmental damage levels. However, a net national environmental externality benefit could occur if the pattern
of emissions changes across alternative standards is one that systematically reallocates emissions from locations
where they inflict low marginal damage to locations where they inflict high marginal damage. Based on its current
information, the Department would assume that emissions reallocation from reduced electricity demand is environmentally
neutral. 
If the Department were to determine that emissions reallocation was not environmentally neutral, the development
of damage estimates would become an issue. In this case, the Department would rely heavily on the current criteria
document for sulfur dioxide, and on the report of the recent National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program (NAPAP),
a 10-year, $500 Million assessment effort. The Department welcomes comment on these and other potential sources
of damage information.

<TEXT>
 

The Department also solicits comment on the possibility that the current binding national cap on SO

2

 emissions will become non-binding during the time period affected by appliance standards as a result of technology
improvements or cost reduction. 

With regard to economic externalities, the Department notes that changes in electricity demand could affect the
market price of allowances. A change in allowance prices might affect the manner in which external parties elect to
meet their control obligations, but would not affect the obligations themselves. 



b. Nitrogen Dioxides 



Nitrogen oxide (NO

X

) emissions are implicated in environmental effects at both the local and regional levels. NO

X

 is a precursor of tropospheric (ground-level) ozone, one of the Clean Air Act criteria pollutants. NO

X

 is also an acid rain precursor. Finally, changes in tropospheric ozone levels, by changing total column ozone, may
affect the amount of ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation reaching the earth's surface. 

Based on its present information, the Department believes that attention in this rulemaking should address all three
of these externality pathways. According to EPA (1993), the primary ambient air quality standard for tropospheric
ozone is violated more than one time per year in areas where 66 million Americans live. As noted in the discussion of
sulfur dioxide, acid precipitation is another issue of significant national and international concern. The potential
importance of the UVB issue is underlined by the fact that concern surrounding the potential damages from a projected
increase in UVB at the earth's surface was the major reason motivating the phaseout of chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's),
required by the Montreal Protocol to the Vienna Convention and the CAAA of 1990. 

With respect to acid precipitation, the Department would consider the same factors and information sources as outlined
above for sulfur dioxide. However, the regulatory structure for NO

X

 emissions outlined in Title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 is built around low NO

X

 burner technology requirements rather than an emissions cap. Therefore, the Department would not presume that national
NO

X

 emissions were insensitive to changes in electricity demand. 

With respect to the ambient air quality standards, the Department believes that three main issues must be considered.


 The regulatory structure and damages from emissions changes in attainment areas (those areas not violating
the ambient air quality standards) 

 The regulatory structure and damages from emissions changes in non-attainment areas. 






</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941007-1-00015 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941007-1-00001 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 The impact of NO

X

 transport from outside of an area on ambient air quality conditions in non-attainment areas. 

With respect to the first and second points, the Department notes that roughly one-third of the nation's coal-fired
power plants and one-half of its gas- and oil-fired power plants are located in non-attainment areas. These are the
types of generating plants that, together with non-utility stationary sources and vehicles, are the sources of NO

X

 emissions. 

Attainment areas: Abstracting from the issue of transport into non-attainment areas, the Department would rely
heavily on the information underlying the existing ambient standards for tropospheric ozone. These standards were
issued in early 1993. However, at the time the standards were issued, EPA noted that new studies, done after finalization
of the criteria document on which the standards were based, might suggest health effects at lower concentration levels.
The Department welcomes comment on whether and how these newer studies, which have yet to be formally evaluated by
the EPA, should be reflected in a damage assessment. The Department's damage assessment will also consider non-health
impacts drawing on studies included in the criteria document underlying the latest standards. 

Non-attainment areas: In non-attainment areas, reductions in electricity demand affect the level of NO

X

 emissions in several ways. Any new generating plants in ozone non-attainment areas that are needed to meet growing
electricity demand would, under the regulatory structure of Title I of the Clean Air Act, be required to fully offset
their NO

X

 emissions before they could begin operation. Alternatively, changes in electricity demand could simply affect
the operation rate of existing plants, without triggering offset requirements for the operating company. In this
latter case, the initial effect would be an increase in emissions. However, Title I also specifies milestones, or
progress requirements, for emissions reduction in non-attainment areas. These requirements are applicable to
NO

X

 in serious and severe non-attainment areas. If these progress requirements were binding, a change in the level of
emissions from the operation of existing power plants could affect the level of reductions that State Implementation
Plans would require from other types of sources in order to meet these requirements. From this perspective, a change
in appliance efficiency standards could change the control obligations of parties unrelated to appliance purchase
decisions. 

To develop its analysis on a national scale, DOE will try to develop information regarding the extent to which each
of the cases described above characterizes prevailing conditions. In order to develop an acceptable basis for estimating
the external benefits associated with NO

X

 emission reductions in both attainment and non-attainment areas, DOE will be seeking more information on the likely
marginal effects of appliance standards on net emissions and the marginal control costs required to meet non-attainment
area progress requirements. DOE will also be seeking better data on how damages and control costs might vary seasonally,
which may increase or decrease the estimated benefits of particular types of appliance efficiency standards. 

In addition, DOE recognizes the concern that transport of NO

X

 emissions from attainment areas may affect ozone concentrations in non-attainment areas, even though they do not
trigger offsets either through the new source program or via progress requirements. DOE welcomes information and
analysis regarding the importance of this issue for a national evaluation of externality damage, and recommended
approaches for incorporating it into the quantitative analysis. 

Finally, the effect of increased tropospheric ozone concentrations on the level of UVB at the surface, represents
a potentially favorable externality. The Department welcomes comment on the inclusion of this pathway in the externality
analysis, and on the use of information developed in the context of various rulemakings and assessments related to
the impacts of stratospheric ozone depletion to estimate marginal damages from reduced ozone. 



c. Carbon Dioxide 



The Department believes that the potential for climate change due to an enhanced greenhouse effect, a global scale
issue, is the only relevant externality pathway for carbon dioxide emissions. Clearly, this is a high priority issue.
In 1992, the world community completed negotiations for a Framework Convention on Climate Change. This convention
has already been signed by 152 nations and should achieve a sufficient number of ramifications to enter into force
by the spring of 1994.

Within the United States, President Clinton and Vice-President Gore have both identified the threat of climate change
as the environmental issue having the highest priority for the nation and the world. The President, on Earth Day 1993,
announced our nation's commitment to return its emissions of greenhouse gases to their 1990 levels by the year 2000.
On October 19, 1993, the Administration released a 

Climate Change Action Plan

 outlining a set of specific programs to achieve that objective. However, unlike SO

X

 and NO

X

 emissions, energy-related emissions of carbon dioxide are not presently subject to formal regulatory requirements
that go beyond emissions monitoring and reporting. The Administration's action plan does not include proposals
for any such requirements. 

Carbon dioxide emissions in the energy sector are proportionally related to the level of use and type of fossil fuel.
For electricity, the Department intends to estimate the effect of a change in electricity use on carbon dioxide by
evaluating the ``average'' fuel mix used to supply marginal changes in electricity demand throughout the country.
The Department welcomes comments and suggestions regarding these calculations. While the absence of existing regulatory
programs and the simple relationships between primary energy use and emissions simplify the externality analysis
compared to that applicable to SO

X

 and NO

X

, the evaluation of marginal damages is far more challenging for CO

2

. The effect of domestic emissions levels on changes in the global emissions trends that determine atmospheric concentrations
of CO

2

, the effect of these concentrations on the both the global climate and the U.S. climate, and the timing of any such effects
are all highly uncertain. The effects of changes in climate on human activities and unmanaged ecosystems are even
more uncertain. 

Given the difficulties in estimating the impacts of global climate change, which is a necessary preliminary step
in estimating marginal damages from emissions changes, only the most rudimentary calculations have been made. Studies
made by the EPA (1989), Nordhaus (1991 and 1992) and Cline (1992) are particularly noteworthy. These authors candidly
admit the preliminary and often speculative nature of their calculations, and their inability to estimate impacts
for important categories of damages, such as impacts on unmanaged ecosystems. 

Based on its present evaluation, the Department believes that the existing literature does not provide a sufficient
basis for developing estimates of marginal damage. Therefore, the Department is considering using revealed willingness-to-pay
for emissions reductions as a proxy to represent the social value of emissions reduction. 

The October 1993 

Climate Change Action Plan

 represents the most aggressive national policy statement on emissions reductions to date. The major portion of energy-related
actions in the plan aim to increase end-use efficiency. These programs are generally voluntary in nature, and rely
on the attractive economics of the targeted energy-efficiency improvements to attract public participation. It
is projected that reprogramming federal expenditures of $1.9 billion into these areas will encourage private investments
of approximately $61 billion (undiscounted 1991 dollars) through the end of the decade. These investments are projected
to reduce energy costs (undiscounted 1991 dollars) by $60 billion through the end of the decade, and by an additional
$207 billion though 2010. 

Because the plan calls only for investments in efficiency projects that have a high rate of return, and generally does
not mandate these investments in the event that private parties judge them to be unattractive, it should not impose
any net costs on the private sector. The exclusion of measures that would impose net costs on the private sector could
itself suggest that, at present, the willingness to pay for emission reductions is at or near zero. The Department
notes, however, that the plan reflects only those actions taken to achieve a near-term objective. The President and
Vice-President have noted that the plan is only a first step. Moreover, it is not clear what amendments or protocols
may be made to the Climate Convention, and on what timescale. For these reasons, an evaluation of willingness-to-pay
implicit in the action plan may not provide an adequate basis for evaluating the longer term willingness-to-pay for
sustained emissions reduction. The Department notes that estimates of the long-run cost of emissions reduction
varies widely, with bottom-up engineering models generally providing much lower cost estimates than top-down economic
models. 
 

The Department also notes that utility regulators in several states employ quantitative externality values for
carbon dioxide in the resource planning process. The Department invites comments on the relevance of these values
to the present rulemaking. Comments that provide a basis for determining how a national average ``effective'' value
might be calculated, taking account of states with and without CO

2

 externality values and varying offset provisions, would be especially helpful. 

The Department invites public comment on the most appropriate methods for estimating the monetary value of reducing
CO

2

 emissions, recognizing the many uncertainties involved. 



IV. Energy Security Externalities 



Issue 14: The major components of energy security externalities associated with oil consumption that DOE should
consider in this rulemaking.

determinants of energy security.

<TEXT>
 

The literature on this subject identifies five main avenues through which energy security externalities can be generated.
Authors generally reach widely varying conclusions about their significance. DOE intends to study each of these
five areas and invites comments on their significance. 

The importance of several of the pathways listed below depends partially or wholly on the amount oil prices rise in
response to an oil supply disruption. Thus, as a part of its study of energy security externality values, DOE will consider
the likelihood of a disruption, its size, excess production capacity in other regions of the world, and how the price
shock associated with the disruption might be mitigated by drawing down strategic petroleum stockpiles. DOE invites
comments on the best approach to study these issues. 

With the exception of externalities 

#

3 and perhaps 

#

5 listed below, the external effects of oil consumption are more closely associated with the total amount of oil consumed
in the U.S. economy, and 

not

 oil imports. 

(1) 

Gross Domestic Product losses resulting from oil price shocks:

 Increased world oil prices caused by supply disruptions may cause macroeconomic shocks to the economy that result
in unemployment and Gross Domestic Product losses. Different studies reach different conclusions regarding the
significance of oil price shocks on macroeconomic performance. For example, a DOE study (1987) cites macroeconomic
stabilization as one justification for energy security policy. In contrast, a study by Bohi (1991) finds little,
if any, link between oil price shocks and macroeconomic performance. 

(2) 

Inflationary losses that accompany oil price rises:

 If oil prices rise, then the rate of inflation in the economy increases. Policies to fight inflation can cause increased
unemployment and heighten Gross Domestic Product losses. Further, because many government payments are indexed
to inflation, oil price shocks can increase the size of the budget deficit. DOE intends to treat these inflationary
losses as part of the Gross Domestic Product loss component cited previously. 

(3) 

Monopsony price effects:

 Some economists argue that decreased domestic oil consumption will lower world oil prices and reduce payments for
imported oil. The reduced U.S. payments for imported oil benefit U.S. and foreign consumers, but they hurt domestic
and foreign producers. From a U.S.-centric accounting stance, this outcome would be beneficial because the U.S.
consumes more oil than it produces. 

Adopting a U.S.-centric stance might be problematic in light of continuing U.S. policies to encourage free trade.
For example, U.S. exports of products other than oil to both oil exporting countries and other countries could be reduced
as the effects of a reduction in the value of oil imports work through the trading system. 

Recognizing that monopsony-like arguments could be raised to justify externality values for many types of imported
goods, DOE intends to consider whether there is anything special about oil that justifies an externality for it, while
excluding one for other products.

<TEXT>
 

(4) 

Terms of trade effect: 

Decreased oil imports would improve the balance of trade and strengthen the U.S. dollar. This would leave U.S. consumers
unambiguously better off. This balance-of-trade effect is not considered in private decision-making. However,
like the monopsony effect, counting this as an externality raises broader issues regarding free trade. DOE intends
to consider whether there is anything special about oil that justifies an externality value for it, while excluding
one for other products. 
(5) 

Financing of government strategic stockpiles and military operations associated with oil: 

Some analysts have suggested that the costs of stocking the strategic petroleum reserve and, more importantly, maintaining
the military power needed to minimize oil supply disruptions are an additional source of externalities. DOE intends
to study this source of externality in more detail, with particular emphasis on whether the size of the change in import
dependence that might be attributed to alternative appliance efficiency standards would have any effect on government
expenses. 
In addition to these quantifiable aspects of energy security externalities, some analysts contend that reduced
oil consumption will increase U.S. flexibility in conducting foreign policy. DOE intends to consider this issue,
recognizing that any benefit here would again relate to the size of the impact of the efficiency standards. 
Issue 19: The impact of incremental appliance efficiency standards on oil consumption. 
A central issue in trying to estimate the energy security value to reduced oil imports is the quantitative effect of
incremental efficiency standards on domestic oil consumption. The appliances being considered in this rule affect
oil consumption either directly, as is the case with oil-fired furnaces, or indirectly by reducing the use of oil to
generate electricity. 
In 1990, according to the 

Annual Energy Outlook for 1993 (AEO93), 

about 2 percent of total U.S. oil consumption was used for residential space heating. By 2010, the same source projects
that oil used for residential space heating will decrease significantly, and account for only about 1 percent of a
higher total oil consumption. 
The current efficiency standard for residential oil-fired furnaces is 78 percent. Moving from the current standard
to 95 percent, for example would after complete stock replacement, reduce oil consumption in this category by less
than 20 percent, and by less if there is a ``rebound'' effect. Marginal changes in this standard could have only an extremely
small effect on total oil consumption. 
In the case of appliance standards that affect electricity consumption, the amount by which oil consumption is reduced
depends upon the fuels used to generate electricity. According to the AEO93, about 4 percent of the primary energy
consumption used for electricity generation in 1990 was oil-based. That percentage is projected to remain approximately
constant through 2010. Because oil's share of electricity generation is so small, changes in appliance efficiency
standards for electric appliances will not significantly alter total oil consumption in the nation. 
Based on the national fuel mix used in 1990, each kilowatt hour of electricity saved will reduce oil consumption by
0.000072 barrels. Given this ratio, each dollar of externality value attached to a barrel of oil translates into only
0.007 cents per kilowatt hour on a national average basis. 
Oil-based electricity might be significant in some regions of the country. Additionally, oil tends to be used for
peaking power. DOE intends to study whether regional and peak-load considerations might cause significant divergences
from the national ratio of barrels of oil per kilowatt hour. However, because the national ratio is so low, it seems
unlikely that even taking into account regional and peak-load considerations could result in large energy security
externality values for electric appliances even if a high per-barrel externality value were deemed appropriate.

Issue 17: The impact of efficiency standards on domestic oil production and oil imports.

DOE believes that the preponderant share of reduced oil consumption caused by incremental appliance efficiency
standards, will come from imports. The price of oil is set in a world market and domestic energy producers supply as
much oil as is profitable given that world price. Unless appliance efficiency standards significantly affect the
world oil price, domestic production will remain largely unchanged and imports will fall. 
The Department has considered, in several recent policy exercises, the impact of changes in domestic oil consumption
on world market prices. The change in price determines how reduced consumption is split between reduced imports and
reduced domestic production. Current modeling generally shows that domestic production falls by only about ten
percent of the decrease in domestic consumption. The Department of Interior's Minerals Management Service also
studied this issue in detail as a part of their 1992 5-Year Leasing Program, and reached similar conclusions.

Issue 18: The possibility of energy security externalities associated with non-oil fuels. 
The Department does not believe that there are comparable energy security externalities associated with fuels other
than oil. That is because non-oil fuels consumed in the U.S. are obtained primarily from domestic sources. The prices
of these fuels are primarily determined in national markets, and are not particularly susceptible to price spikes
caused by supply disruptions in other areas of the world. Because of these factors, DOE does not intend to consider
energy security externalities for fuels other than oil. 
Finally, it is important to note that the generic issue of the relationship between price and marginal cost outlined
in the Crosscutting Issues section must be considered in the determination of whether an application of an incremental
externality value is appropriate in those cases where an energy security externality related to the use of oil in electricity
generation is identified. However, given the competitive market structure of the fuel oil industry, the Department,
based on its current information, presumes that oil sold directly to residential end-users is competitively priced.



V. Review under Executive Order 12866

Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Boeing Model
747 series airplanes. This proposal would require modification of the fire extinguishing system in the number two
engine strut. This proposal is prompted by reports of chafing of the fire extinguishing tubes in a certain inboard
strut to wing area. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent chafing of the fire extinguishing
tube; such chafing could cause cracking of the tube and consequently produce a hole in the fire extinguishing tube,
which could prevent the proper distribution of the fire extinguisher agent within the nacelle in the event of a fire.

Availability of NPRMs



Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM-103,
Attention: Rules Docket No. 94-NM-119-AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055-4056.



Discussion



On June 17, 1992, the FAA issued AD 92-14-07, amendment 39-8289 (57 FR 31433, July 16, 1994), applicable
to certain Boeing Model 747 series airplanes, to require repetitive inspections to detect damage of the tubes of the
engine fire extinguishing system in the number two and number three engine struts; replacement or repair, if necessary;
and reorientation of the clamp. That Ad also requires modification of the engine fire extinguishing system in the
number two and number three engine struts, which, when accomplished, terminates the inspection requirements. The
modification was required to be accomplished on all affected airplanes no later than February 20, 1993. That action
was prompted by multiple reports of the support clamps in the number two and number three engine struts chafing a hole
in the tubes of the engine fire extinguishing system. The requirements of that AD are intended to prevent inadequate
distribution of the fire extinguishing agent within the nacelle in the event of a fire.

Since the issuance of that AD, the FAA has received reports of chafing of the tubes and/or cracking of the rubber blocks
that are an integral part of the clamps in the inboard strut to wing area in the number two engine strut. (The tube and
the rubber blocks were installed as part of the modification required by AD 92-14-07.) As a result of the
chafing, one of the tubes on one airplane cracked approximately six inches from the forward end. Investigation revealed
that the cracked tube had a notch near the cracked area of the tube that had been formed due to contact with a ground stud.
This notch may have initiated the crack in the tube. Further investigation revealed that the rubber blocks, which
support the tubes, were cracked between the stand-off spacers and the tubes.
The cause of such chafing and cracking has been attributed to movement between the spacer and the tube. This movement
exceeded the flexibility of the rubber and stressed the rubber block, which subsequently pinched and tore the rubber
block of the clamp. Such pinching and tearing could cause the clamp to fail and could lead to chafing of the fir extinguishing
tube.

Chafing of the fire extinguishing tube, if not corrected, could result in cracking of the fire extinguishing tube
and consequently produce a hole in the fire extinguishing tube, which could prevent the proper distribution of the
fire extinguishing agent within the nacelle in the event of a fire.

The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747-26A2226, dated June 30, 1994, which describes
procedures for modification of the fire extinguishing system in the number two engine strut. This modification entails
removing and replacing the fire extinguishing tube with a new, improved tube (for Group 1 and 2 airplanes); removing
and reinstalling the existing fire extinguishing tube (for Group 3 airplanes); and replacing the channel and rubber
blocks; and reworking the forward bracket (for Group 1, 2, and 3 airplanes). This modification would revise the geometry
of the rubber block and the tube, which would increase the flexibility of the rubber block and would increase the clearance
between the tube and the adjacent ground studs.

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would require modification of the fire extinguishing system in the number two engine strut.
The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the alert service bulletin described previously.

There are approximately 145 Boeing Model 747 series airplanes equipped with General Electric CF6-80C2 engines
of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 2 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected
by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 3 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions,
and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would be supplied by the manufacturer at no cost
to the operators. Based on thee figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be
$330, or $165 per airplane.
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted.
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES

Approval and Promulgation of a New Source Review Implementation Plan; Indiana 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA).

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The USEPA proposes to approve the State implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Indiana to satisfy
Federal requirements for an approvable nonattainment area new source review (NSR) SIP. The USEPA is proposing to
approve the recodified version of the Indiana permitting rules to replace those in the existing SIP. The USEPA is also
proposing to remove references in the Code of Federal Regulations to the construction ban imposed in Lake and Porter
Counties for failure to have an approved ozone plan since the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 removed this ban. In the
final rules section of this 

Federal Register

, the USEPA is approving these actions as a direct final rule without prior proposal because USEPA views these as noncontroversial
actions and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval is set forth in the direct final
rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to that direct final rule, no further activity is contemplated
in relation to this proposed rule. If USEPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and
all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on the proposed rule. USEPA will not
institute a second comment period on this notice. Any parties interested in commenting on this document should do
so at this time.

Revision to NASA FAR Supplement Coverage on Contracting and Subcontracting Policies and Procedures To Achieve Goals
for Designated Entities


<AGENCY>
agency:

 Office of Procurement, Contract Management Division, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
action:

 Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary:

 NASA proposes to provide further implementation of the statutory goal to make at least eight percent of the funding
for prime contracts and subcontracts available to small business concerns or other organizations owned or controlled
by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, which include women, Historically Black Colleges and
Universities, and other minority educational institutions. These categories of entities listed in the applicable
statutes are collectively identified as ``designated entities.''


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background


This rule establishes major policies with respect to contracting and subcontracting with designated entities.
With respect to prime contracting, it ensures that designated entities are fully considered for awards. Also, the
consolidation or bundling of contract requirements is controlled. With respect to subcontracting, it requires
specifying mandatory goals in solicitations for subcontracting with designated entities, evaluating designated
entity subcontracting goals proposed by offerors, and including in contracts the designated entity subcontracting
goals in addition to the goals included in the subcontracting plan required by 15 U.S.C. 637(d) as implemented in FAR
Subpart 19.7. NFS Subpart 1819.70 and the clause at 1852.219-76 are substantially revised. A new subsection
is added to NFS 1815.608. NFS 1870.303, Appendix I, Chapter 301, is amended to cover proposal evaluation.


Availability of NASA FAR Supplement


The NASA FAR Supplement, of which this proposed coverage will become a part, is codified in 48 CFR chapter 18, and is
available in its entirety on a subscription basis from the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office,
Washington, DC 20402. Cite GPO Subscription Stock Number 933-003-00000-1. It is not distributed
to the public, whether in whole or in part, directly by NASA.


Executive Order 12866


The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has determined that this rule is significant under E.O. 12866. This
regulation is needed, because it provides the NASA policy regarding contracting and subcontracting with designated
entities. Regarding prime contract awards, the policy ensures that designated entities are fully considered for
awards. Regarding subcontracting issues, the policy requires specifying mandatory goals in solicitations for
subcontracting with designated entities, evaluating designated entity subcontracting goals proposed by offerors,
and including in contracts the designated entity subcontracting goals in addition to the goals included in the subcontracting
plan required by 15 U.S.C. 637(d) as implemented in FAR Subpart 19.7. Current regulations do not address these prime
contracting and subcontracting policies. The potential costs for this regulatory action are nominal and are not
quantifiable. Because the subcontracting goals are included in the contract, costs for contracting with or subcontracting
to designated entities would normally be charged to the Government. The potential benefits are the increased direct
awards or subcontracting awards to designated entities which will broaden the base of NASA contractors. The value
of increasing the contract and subcontract opportunities to designated entities cannot be measured, because it
involves not only increases to NASA's business base of qualified and eligible contractors but also additional opportunities
for designated entities to receive a fair proportion of NASA awards to the maximum extent practicable.


Regulatory Flexibility Act


NASA certifies that this proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

).


Paperwork Reduction Act


This rule does not impose any information collection subject to 44 U.S.C. chapter 35.

NASA subcontracting goal.


In all solicitations which contain the clause at 1852.219-76, NASA Subcontracting Goal, the contracting officer
is required to prescribe a mandatory goal for the use of ``designated entities'' as subcontractors (See 1819.7005).
Offers will be evaluated on the proposed designated entity subcontracting goal, in comparison to the goal specified
in the solicitation, and on the offeror's proposed method of achieving the goal. Evaluation of the designated entity
subcontracting goal shall be accomplished, at a minimum, as a separate element under a management subfactor under
the Mission Suitability factor so that it may have an impact on the source selection decision.

1819.7001 

Scope of subpart.


This subpart implements legislative provisions (Public Laws 101-144, 101-507, and 102-389) which
require the NASA Administrator to ensure, to the fullest extent possible, that at least eight percent (8%) of Federal
funding for prime and subcontracts awarded in support of authorized programs, including the space station by the
time operational status is obtained, be made available to small business concerns or other organizations owned or
controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals (within the meaning of section 8(a)(5) and (6)
of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a) (5) and (6)), including Historically Black Colleges and Universities
and minority educational institutions. For purposes of this subpart, socially and economically disadvantaged
individuals shall be deemed to include women.


 1819.7002


Definitions.




Designated entities,

 as used in this subpart, means small business concerns or other organizations owned and controlled by socially and
economically disadvantaged individuals, which include women, Historically Black Colleges and Universities,
and other minority educational institutions.


Historically Black Colleges and Universities,

 as used in this subpart, means institutions determined by the Secretary of Education to meet the requirements of 34
CFR 608.2 and listed therein.


Minority educational institutions

 as used in this subpart, means institutions determined by the Secretary of Education to meet the requirements of 34
CFR 637.4.

Socially and economically disadvantaged individuals 

has the meaning given such terms in section 8(a)(5) and (6) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637 (a)(5) and (6)).
Public Law 101-507 designated that for purposes of NASA's 8% goal, economically and socially disadvantaged
individuals shall be deemed to include women.



1819.7003 

General policy.



(a) The Congress has indicated its desire to increase the participation of designated entities in the aerospace industry,
particularly as NASA contractors and subcontractors. The agency's goal is to award to such entities at least 8% of
the funding provided for prime contracts and subcontracts in support of authorized programs by the end of fiscal year
1994. The participation of NASA prime contractors, through their subcontracting practices, is essential to meeting
this goal.

(b) The 8% goal applies to the annual dollar obligations of the agency. It is not an absolute goal for each center or program
or an absolute percentage to be placed in each contract containing a subcontracting plan. While some procurement
requirements (contracts) offer subcontracting opportunities for designated entities equal to 8% of the contract
value, others will offer greater, and some less, subcontracting opportunities. The aggregate comprises the agency's
total accomplishment in response to the legislative mandate.



1819.7004



Prime contracting policy.



(a) Contracting officers must seek out designated entities as sources and give full consideration to these entities
to satisfy requirements in all NASA procurements. Since contracts with eligible 8(a) firms under the Small Business
Administration section 8(a) program count toward the attainment of NASA's goal, contracting officers must make
maximum use of this program in awarding prime contracts (see procedures set forth in (FAR) 48 CFR Subpart 19.8).

(b) Existing contracts or options will normally not be reduced in scope or otherwise restructured to increase opportunities
for designated entities at the prime contract level. In rare instances, taking such action may be accomplished with
approval of the Associate Administrator for Procurement.

(c) 

Consolidated Contracts.

 Prior to effecting a contracting consolidation valued at $5 million or more, including options, which will not be
exclusively reserved for small or 8(a) firms, an impact assessment on the effects of consolidation on present and
future contracting and subcontracting opportunities of designated entities shall be prepared by the center, submitted
to Headquarters Code HS, concurred in by Code K and the cognizant Associate Administrator, and approved by the Associate
Deputy Administrator (Technical).

(d) Protests involving size status and those involving designated entity status for other than women-owned businesses
shall be referred to the U.S. Small Business Administration for handling. Protests to NASA regarding women-owned
businesses claiming designated entity status shall be resolved by the agency.

(e) Public Laws 101-144, 101-507, and 102-389 state that the status of a small business concern or
other organization as a designated entity is determined by whether the entity is owned or controlled by socially and
economically disadvantaged individuals, including women. To provide consistency with section 8(a)(4) of the Small
Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a)(4)), NASA applies a restrictive interpretation of this legislation by requiring
ownership and control by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.



1819.7005



Subcontracting policy.



(a) All contracts which are required to include a subcontracting plan (see (FAR) 48 CFR 19.702) must contain a separate
percentage goal for using designated entities as subcontractors. This separate goal will not be entered on the subcontracting
plan but will be specified in the clause at 1852.219-76, NASA Subcontracting Goal. The total dollars planned
to be subcontracted to small disadvantaged business concerns stated in the subcontracting plan will be included
in determining the designated entity subcontracting goal. The designated entity subcontracting goal also includes
planned subcontracts with small business concerns owned and controlled by women, Historically Black Colleges and
Universities, and other minority educational institutions.

(b) After a careful assessment of the statement of work associated with each procurement, contracting officers would
insert in solicitations that have subcontracting opportunities an appropriate subcontracting goal for designated
entities. The contracting officer shall confer with the small business specialist during the assessment stage since
the specialist has knowledge and information regarding the pool of designated entities available to fulfill the
subcontracting opportunities. The goals should be set at a level that can be reasonably achieved by the contractor
expending good faith efforts to use designated entities as subcontractors to the maximum practicable extent. The
designated entity subcontracting goals will be stated as mandatory goals in solicitations.

(c) Contracting officers shall include the mandatory designated entity subcontracting goal in the presolicitation
notice (see (FAR) 48 CFR 5.204) and in any draft Request for Proposal that is issued. The contracting officer and the
small business specialist will consider all comments received in response to either the presolicitation notice
or the draft Request for Proposal prior to determining the mandatory goal in the formal solicitation.
(d) In negotiated acquisitions, an initial proposal will not be rejected as unacceptable solely as a result of an offeror
proposing a goal that is less than the mandatory goal. Subsequent to the evaluation of proposals, in which the proposed
goal shall be evaluated as a separate element under a management subfactor under the Mission Suitability factor,
consistent with NFS 1815.608-72, the contracting officer shall negotiate with the apparently successful
offeror(s) to establish the designated entity subcontracting goal to be inserted in the contract.
(e) If a bidder, in response to a sealed bid solicitation, takes exception to the specified mandatory subcontracting
goal, the bid shall not be rejected as nonresponsive. If the bidder is selected for award, the contracting officer
may request the bidder to offer a revised designated entity subcontracting goal by a specified date. If the bidder's
response indicates that the bidder does not intend to use its best efforts to provide the designated entities the maximum
practicable opportunity to participate in performance of the contract, the contracting officer may find the bidder
nonresponsible.
(f) In solicitations, proposals, and resulting contracts, the designated entity subcontracting goal should be
stated as a percentage of the total contract value rather than as a percentage of the total planned subcontracting
dollars. Subcontracting plans shall conform to the requirements of (FAR) 48 CFR 52.219-9, i.e., the goals included
in the plans shall be expressed in terms of percentages of total planned subcontracting dollars. Also, SF 294 and SF
295 reports shall continue to be completed in accordance with the instructions on these forms.


1819.7006


Solicitation provisions and contract clauses.


(a) The contracting officer shall insert the provision at 1852.219-73, Small Business and Small Disadvantaged
Business Subcontracting Plan, in solicitations containing the clause at (FAR) 48 CFR 52.219-9. Insert in the
last sentence the number of calendar days after the contracting officer's request that the offeror must submit a complete
plan. When offerors are to include subcontracting plans in their initial offers as contemplated by (FAR) 48 CFR 19.705-2(d),
or if a noncompetitive solicitation will be issued, the contracting officer may use the provision with its Alternate
I.
(b) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.219-75, Small Business and Small Disadvantaged
Business Subcontracting Reporting, in solicitations and contracts containing the clause at (FAR) 48 CFR 52.219-9.
Those current contracts containing subcontracting plans and designated by NASA Headquarters (Code HC) shall be
amended to require quarterly submission of the SF 295.
(c) In all solicitations and contracts which contain the clause at (FAR) 48 CFR 52.219-9, Small Business and
Small Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Plan, the contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.219-76,
NASA Subcontracting Goal, when contracting by negotiation. In all solicitations and contracts which contain the
clause at (FAR) 48 CFR 52.219-9, the contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.219-76 with its
Alternate I, when contracting by sealed bidding.
(1) In solicitations and contracts which do not contain the clause at (FAR) 48 CFR 52.219-9, and when the contract
value is expected to exceed the small purchase limitation, the contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.219-76
with its Alternate II, except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
(2) In solicitations and contracts which do not contain the clause at (FAR) 48 CFR 52.219-9, and when the contract
value is expected to exceed $500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction), and the contractor is a small business which
is not a designated entity, the contracting officer may use the clause at 1852.219-76 instead of the clause at
1852.219-76 with its Alternate II. The basic clause should be used when the contracting officer determines
that the procurement offers subcontracting opportunities with designated entities.

includes women for purposes of this clause.

(b) The NASA Administrator is required to ensure, to the fullest extent possible, that at least 8% of the funding provided
for prime and subcontracts awarded in support of authorized programs, including the space station by the time operational
status is obtained, is made available to designated entities.

(c)(1) A mandatory goal of 

XX

 percent [the Contracting Officer shall insert the goal] for the use of designated entities as subcontractors is established
for this acquisition. This designated entity subcontracting goal is stated as a percentage of the total contract
value, not the total planned subcontracting dollars. The goal shall include the value of subcontracts with designated
entities that contribute directly to contract performance.

(2) The offeror should make an independent assessment of its subcontracting opportunities and is encouraged to propose
a goal higher than that specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this clause. The designated entity subcontracting goal proposed
by the offeror, and the methods for achieving the proposed goal, will be evaluated as indicated in the solicitation.

(3) To effectively achieve the goal specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this clause consistent with efficient contract
performance, the Contractor shall perform the functions listed in paragraph (e) of the clause at (FAR) 48 CFR 52.219-9,
Small Business and Small Business Disadvantaged Subcontracting Plan, for all designated entities which may become
potential subcontractors.

(d) The Contractor may rely in good faith on a written representation of a subcontractor that such subcontractor has
the status of a designated entity.

(e) Failure of the Contractor to comply in good faith with the requirements of this clause shall constitute a material
breach of the contract.




(End of clause)



Alternate I (XXX 1994)



When contracting by sealed bidding rather than by negotiation, substitute the following paragraph (c)(2) for paragraph
(c)(2) of the basic clause:

(c)(2) Failure of the bidder to accept the goal specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this clause may make the bidder ineligible
for award.



Alternate II (XXX 1994)



When the solicitation and contract do not contain the clause at (FAR) 48 CFR 52.219-9, Small Business and Small
Disadvantaged Business subcontracting Plan, and when the contract amount is expected to exceed the small purchase
limitation, substitute the following paragraph (c) for paragraph (c) of the basic clause:

(c) The Contractor agrees to assist NASA to achieve the statutory goal described in paragraph (b) of this clause by
using its best efforts to award subcontracts to designated entities to the fullest extent consistent with efficient
contract performance.

301 Mission Suitability



1. Evaluation subfactors



a. Evaluation subfactors are the weighted areas within the Mission Suitability factor that further identify, for
proposal preparation and evaluation purposes, the content of the factor. Examples of Mission Suitability subfactors
found by experience to be relevant to many procurements are: understanding of the Requirement; Management Plan;
Key Personnel; Corporate or Company Resources; and Excellence of Proposed Design for hardware procurements. Citation
of these specific subfactors is not intended to be restrictive or all inclusive. However, as stated in NFS 1815.608-72,
evaluation of the designated entities subcontracting goal shall be accomplished, at a minimum, as a separate element
under a management subfactor under the Mission Suitability factor. The nature and thrust of the requirements and
objectives of the procurement may logically call for the use of some subfactors titled and described in a somewhat
different manner than those described below:



* * * * * 



5. In Appendix I to section 1870.303, chapter 3, paragraph 301.1.e.(1) is revised to read as follows:

Chapter 3_Evaluation Factors, Subfactors and Elements



* * * * * 



301 Mission Suitability



1. * * * 

e. (1) In structuring evaluation subfactors and elements, emphasis should be placed on identification of significant
discriminators, or ``key swingers''_the essential information required to support a source selection decision.
Too many subfactors and elements are detrimental to effective evaluation of proposals and may result in a leveling
or averaging out of scores over all proposals. To avoid this negative effect, the number of subfactors under Mission
Suitability shall be no more than 4 and the number of elements no more than 8 except for the separate evaluation of designated
entities either as a separate element or a separate subfactor under Mission Suitability (See NFS 1815.608-72).
Other evaluation factors shall also be limited to only essential subfactors and elements. Further, care should be
taken to avoid overlap and redundancy by clearly defining each evaluation subfactor and element. Avoiding such overlap
assures an offeror is not scored in two or more areas for the same work.

Alternate Standards for Open Head Fiber Drum Packaging 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA), DOT. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM). 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On August 29, 1994, the President signed the ``Hazardous Materials Transportation Authorization Act of 1994'' (the
Act). Section 122 of the Act requires RSPA to examine requirements that pertain to open head fiber drum packaging in
domestic transportation. Specifically, RSPA is to determine whether there are standards other than the performance-based
standards adopted under RSPA's rulemaking Docket No. HM-181, that will provide an equal or greater level of
safety for the transportation of liquid hazardous materials. The purpose of this ANPRM is to solicit comments and
proposals for alternate standards for open head fiber drum packaging. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Section 122 of the Act (Pub. L. 103-311) reads as follows: 



SEC. 122. USE OF FIBER DRUM PACKAGING. 
(a) INITIATION OF RULEMAKING PROCEEDING._Not later than the 60th day following the date of enactment of this Act,
the Secretary of Transportation shall initiate a rulemaking proceeding to determine whether the requirements of
section 5103(b) of title 49, United States Code (relating to regulations for safe transportation) as they pertain
to open head fiber drum packaging can be met for the domestic transportation of liquid hazardous materials (with respect
to those classifications of liquid hazardous materials transported by such drums pursuant to regulations in effect
on September 30, 1991) with standards other than the performance-oriented packaging standards adopted under docket
number HM-181 contained in part 178 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations. 
(b) ISSUANCE OF STANDARDS._If the Secretary of Transportation determines, as a result of the rulemaking proceeding
initiated under subsection (a), that a packaging standard other than the performance-oriented packaging standards
referred to in subsection (a) will provide an equal or greater level of safety for the domestic transportation of liquid
hazardous materials than would be provided if such performance-oriented packaging standards were in effect, the
Secretary shall issue regulations which implement such other standard and which take effect before October 1, 1996.

(c) COMPLETION OF RULEMAKING PROCEEDING._The rulemaking proceeding initiated under subsection (a) shall be completed
before October 1, 1995. 
(d) LIMITATIONS._
(1) The provisions of subsections (a), (b), and (c) shall not apply to packaging for those hazardous materials regulated
by the Department of Transportation as poisonous by inhalation under chapter 51 of title 49, United States Code. 
(2) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the Secretary of Transportation from issuing or enforcing
regulations for the international transportation of hazardous materials. 




Detailed comments and proposals are requested that will assist RSPA in developing an appropriate regulatory proposal
consistent with the requirement quoted above. Of particular importance is the determination called for in paragraph
(b) of Section 122 that a packaging standard to be adopted provide an equal or greater level of safety for domestic transportation
of liquid hazardous materials than would be provided if the performance-oriented packaging standards specified
in 49 CFR part 178 subparts L and M were applied. Any interested person is invited to present a proposal, preferably
in the form of a draft standard, that would assist RSPA in accomplishing the intended effect of this law. The proposal
should include a methodology for evaluating comparative levels of safety and estimates, where available, of cost
differences between present and proposed packaging.

In addition, comments are invited on the issue of whether alternate standards for open head fiber drums should be limited
to domestic transportation of liquid hazardous materials. If packagings authorized by alternate standards would
cost less than the performance standard packaging adopted under HM-181, but were not authorized for international
shipments, an unfair competition issue could be raised in relation to international trade agreements.

Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards; Occupant Crash Protection 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), 
DOT. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice proposes to allow manufacturers the option 
of installing a manual device that motorists could use to 
deactivate the front passenger-side air bag in a vehicle without 
rear seats for the purpose of allowing them to place rear-facing 
infant restraints in the front seat. NHTSA research indicates 
that rear-facing infant restraints should not be placed in the 
front seat of a vehicle equipped with a passenger-side air bag. 
This poses a problem because manufacturers are beginning to 
install, and soon will be required to install, passenger-side air 
bags in passenger cars and light trucks, some of which have only 
front seats. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Background 


This notice proposes to allow manufacturers the option of 
installing a manual device (hereafter referred to as a ``cutoff 
device'') that motorists could use to deactivate the front 
passenger air bag in a vehicle without rear seats for the purpose 
of allowing them to place rear-facing infant restraints in the 
front seat. (``Rear-facing infant restraint,'' as used in this 
notice, refers to an infant restraint system (except a car bed) 
which is positioned in a vehicle so that the restrained infant 
faces the rear of the vehicle.) NHTSA is issuing this proposal 
because one particular type of child restraint, i.e., a rear-facing infant restraint, should not be placed in the
front seat 
of a vehicle equipped with a passenger air bag. This poses a 
problem because manufacturers are beginning to install, and soon will be required to install, passenger air bags
in vehicles, some 
of which have only front seats. 
On September 2, 1993, NHTSA published a final rule amending 
Standard No. 208, 

Occupant Crash Protection, 

to specify that 
manufacturers must install air bags to satisfy the standard's 
automatic crash protection requirements (58 FR 46551). This rule 
was required by 49 U.S.C. 30127 (recently codified and previously 
cited as Section 2508 of the Intermodal Surface Transportation 
Efficiency Act of 1991). These requirements for driver and 
passenger air bags are phased-in for both passenger cars and 
other vehicles. The phase-in percentage for passenger cars is 95 
percent by model year 1997, and all passenger cars beginning with 
model year 1998. The phase-in percentage for trucks, buses, and 
multipurpose passenger vehicles (other than walk-in van-type 
trucks and vehicles designed to be exclusively sold to the United 
States Postal Service) with a gross vehicle weight rating of 
8,500 pounds or less and an unloaded vehicle weight of 5,500 
pounds or less (collectively referred to as ``light trucks'' 
throughout the remainder of this preamble) is 80 percent by model 
year 1998 and all light trucks beginning with model year 1999. 
NHTSA has already released several documents and completed 
several rulemaking actions addressing the air bag/infant 
restraint interaction problem. Based on the preliminary results 
of the testing done regarding this problem, NHTSA issued a 
Consumer Advisory on December 10, 1991, warning owners of rear-facing infant restraints not to use such a restraint
in the front 
seat of a vehicle equipped with a passenger air bag.

Since issuing the 1991 Consumer Advisory, NHTSA has 
intensified its efforts to work closely and cooperatively with 
interested parties on this issue. For example, NHTSA has worked 
to bring about a better understanding of rear-facing infant 
restraint/air bag interaction through the auspices of the Society 
of Automotive Engineers (SAE) and its technical committees on 
child safety issues. As a result of mutual concerns on the part 
of government and industry, the SAE was able to publish consensus 
guidelines dealing broadly with the interaction of child 
restraint systems (including rear-facing infant restraints) and 
air bags. The agency worked with State and local governments to 
disseminate the information about the latest, mutually arrived 
at, recommendations concerning rear-facing infant restraint/air 
bag interaction. NHTSA has also worked with the American Academy 
of Pediatrics (AAP), a group of doctors who specialize in the 
care of children. As a result, the AAP has disseminated the 
warnings about air bags and rear-facing infant restraints to its 
40,000 members through its newsletter and Family Shopping Guide 
for Car Seats. 
In addition, the agency has reemphasized its commitment to 
educating the public on this issue. In April 1992, the agency 
reissued its Consumer Information Bulletin, ``Transporting Your 
Children Safely.'' This bulletin provides several pages of 
guidelines on the use of child restraints in vehicles, including a chart depicting the optimum restraint type for
various sizes 
and weights for children. For example, the bulletin recommends 
that from birth to 9-12 months or 20 pounds, a rear-facing infant 
restraint be used. The bulletin also states: ``Rear-facing child 
safety seats should always go in the rear seat in cars equipped 
with passenger-side air bags.'' 
In October 1992, based on the final results of the testing 
mentioned above, NHTSA published a final report describing child 
restraint/passenger air bag interactions (Child 
Restraint/Passenger Air Bag Interaction Strategies, DOT HS 808-004, October 1992). The report concluded
that rear-facing infant 
restraints should not be placed in the front seat of a vehicle 
with a passenger air bag. 
In response to the October 1992 final report, NHTSA amended 
several safety standards to require warnings concerning the 
interaction of air bags and rear-facing infant restraints. In 
the September 1993 final rule, as described above, the agency 
required that specified information, including information about 
the proper placement of rear-facing infant restraints, be placed 
on labels in vehicles equipped with air bags. This warning label 
must be on the sun visor of any vehicle equipped with an air bag 
manufactured after September 1, 1994. It also required that 
additional, more detailed information about air bags be provided 
in the owner's manual. Consumers were again cautioned by the 
Department not to use rear-facing infant restraints in seating positions protected by air bags in an October 28, 1993
news 
release. 
On February 16, 1994, the agency took a further step to try 
to alert parents to the issue of air bag/rear-facing infant 
restraint interaction. It published in the 

Federal Register

 a 
final rule amending Standard No. 213, 

Child Restraint Systems

 (59 
FR 7643). The amended Standard No. 213 requires that the warning 
label for a rear-facing infant restraint include a warning 
against using the restraint in any vehicle seating position 
equipped with an air bag. It also requires that the printed 
instructions for a rear-facing infant restraint include safety 
information about air bags. 
Believing that steps in addition to providing consumers with 
information were needed, members of the American Automobile 
Manufacturers Association (AAMA) met with NHTSA on January 24, 
1994. AAMA asked for the meeting to explore the possibility of 
installing an air bag cutoff device to allow rear-facing infant 
restraints to be placed in air bag-equipped passenger seating 
positions. AAMA representatives discussed the general concept of 
an air bag cutoff device, which could be either automatic or 
manual. However, the representatives emphasized that the 
industry is not quite ready to install automatic devices because 
automatic cutoff technology is not yet ready for production. At 
the meeting, AAMA asked whether Standard No. 208 would permit 
such devices and, if not permitted, whether the agency would 
consider initiating rulemaking to permit such devices.

II. Scope of this Notice




NHTSA is concerned that despite its efforts to provide warnings to not place an infant in a rear-facing infant restraint
in the right front seat of a vehicle that has a passenger air bag, these warnings will provide minimal benefit if a parent
chooses to transport his/her infant in a vehicle that is physically unable to accommodate a child any place other than
the front seat, e.g., a vehicle that has no rear seat. Examples of such vehicles are a two-seater sports car and a light
duty truck with only a front seat. It is exclusively for this minority of vehicles that this notice is intended. NHTSA
believes that allowing manufacturers the option to install a manual cutoff device would not unduly diminish the ability
of these vehicles to provide crash protection to the adult population and would avoid the potential problem of air
bag/infant seat interaction. 


III. Legality of Air Bag Cutoff Devices 


After the January 1994 meeting with AAMA, the agency examined whether Standard No. 208 currently permits a vehicle
to be equipped with an air bag cutoff device. 
Standard No. 208 currently requires the front outboard seating positions in passenger cars and light trucks to be
equipped with automatic crash protection systems which protect their occupants by means that require no action by
vehicle occupants. Compliance with the automatic crash protection requirements of Standard No. 208 is determined
in a dynamic crash test. That is, a vehicle must comply with specified injury criteria, as measured on a test dummy,
in a 30 mph barrier crash test. The two types of automatic crash protection currently offered are automatic safety
belts (whose automatic nature helps to assure belt use) and air bags (which supplement safety belts and offer some
protection even when safety belts are not used). The September 1993 final rule will require manufacturers to comply
with the automatic crash protection requirements by installing air bags. 
Two types of cutoff devices are possible. The first type involves manual technology such as an ``on-off'' switch to
disable the operation of the passenger air bag by moving the switch to the ``OFF'' position. To reactivate, the switch
is then moved to the ``ON'' position. This reactivation may take place manually or it may occur automatically, e.g.,
after deactivation the system reactivates the next time that the ignition is turned on or when a door is opened. The
second type of cutoff device is one that automatically deactivates and reactivates the air bag. 
In past agency interpretations of the safety standards, NHTSA has stated that if (1) there are two possible conditions
during a compliance test (e.g., whether a particular device is in the ``ON'' or ``OFF'' position), and (2) the standard
does not specify which test condition is to be used, and (3) the language of the standard as a whole and the standard's
purpose do not imply a limit that would make one of those conditions inappropriate, there is a presumption that the
requirements have to be met in both test conditions.

With regard to automatic cutoff devices, the agency expects that manufacturers would design these devices so that
they would automatically ensure that the front passenger air bag is activated during the barrier crash test because
a 50th percentile adult male dummy is in the seat. Thus, there would not be two possible test conditions under those
circumstances. Therefore, if so designed, automatic cutoff devices would be allowed by Standard No. 208. 
With regard to manual cutoff devices, two test conditions are possible. In one, the device is in the ``ON'' position
and the air bag is deactivated. In the other, the device is in the ``OFF'' position and the air bag is activated. The position
of a cutoff device is not specified in Standard No. 208, so the presumption arises that the Standard must be met regardless
of whether the device is in the ``ON'' or ``OFF'' position. 
However, before reaching such a conclusion, the agency considers the language and purpose of the standard to see if
any limits on the test condition are implied. In the past, the agency has found such limits when one or more of the possible
conditions could not occur under normal driving conditions. The purpose of Standard No. 208 is for a vehicle to provide
automatic protection for vehicle occupants at all times when the vehicle is operating. Therefore, if the cutoff device
could be used when the vehicle is being operated, there is no implied limit on the position of the device during the test.
Since the injury criteria presumably would not be met when the air bag has been deactivated, the device would result
in a noncompliance with Standard No. 208. Therefore, the agency concludes that manual cutoff devices are not currently
permitted by Standard No. 208. 
The above conclusion about manual cutoff devices applies only to vehicles that comply with the automatic protection
requirement by means of air bags. If a vehicle is voluntarily equipped with air bags, as some light trucks are, the installation
of a manual cutoff device is permitted. 


IV. Decision to Allow Manual Cutoff Devices 


NHTSA believes that a regulatory dilemma now exists because drivers of two-seater vehicles, i.e., vehicles which
have no designated rear seating positions, might be forced to ignore the cautions against placing an infant in the
front seat. Although some manufacturers may be able to devise an air bag system that would accommodate an infant in
a rear-facing infant restraint placed in close proximity to the dashboard of a vehicle equipped with a passenger air
bag, concerns voiced by the AAMA indicate that, in general, most vehicle manufacturers are concerned that existing
air bag designs do not currently provide the special type of protection needed to avoid injury to infants in rear-facing
infant restraints placed on the front seat. 
Because the automatic technologies now under consideration appear too immature for immediate application to the
problem, the agency is proposing to amend Standard No. 208 to permit a manual cutoff device. NHTSA has concluded that
manual cutoff devices should be optional; they should not be mandated. A mandatory installation requirement could
penalize manufacturers that have produced, or intend to produce, a passenger air bag that is not harmful to infants
in rear-facing infant restraints. The agency believes that a mandatory requirement would needlessly stifle innovations
and could impede future advances in air bag technology. In addition, the agency believes that some vehicles with only
one row of seats may allow the seat to be moved far enough rearward so that the combination of air bag type and design and
vehicle seat position does not pose a threat to a child in a rear-facing infant restraint. Thus, a cutoff device would
not be necessary in the vehicle. 


V. Details of Proposal 


A. Affected Vehicles 


NHTSA is proposing to allow manual cutoff devices in passenger cars and light trucks since, as noted above, these vehicles
are required to have passenger air bags by the late 1990s. NHTSA has also tentatively concluded that manual cutoff
devices should be allowed only in passenger cars and light trucks which do not have forward-facing rear seats. If vehicles
are equipped with at least one rear seating position, that position can be used for a rear-facing infant restraint.
Even in vehicles without air bags, NHTSA recommends the rear seat as the optimum location for any child restraint.
Accordingly, NHTSA does not believe that manual cutoff devices should be allowed in vehicles with a forward-facing
rear seat.


B. Means of Activation

<DOCNO> FR941007-1-00040 </DOCNO>

<TEXT>
 

NHTSA is proposing to require the use of a key to activate 
the cutoff device. This would make the device simple and easy to 
use, but still require conscious thought and deliberate action on 
the part of the user. The agency is proposing use of the 
ignition key to ensure that the driver of the vehicle is the 
person most likely to activate the cutoff device, and thereby 
minimize the likelihood of accidental activation. This approach 
is similar to that used in Standard No. 118, 

Power Operated 
Window, Partition and Roof Panel Systems

, to ensure the safe 
operation of electrically operated devices. NHTSA requests 
comments on mandating the use of the ignition key. 
NHTSA requests comments on other means that would guard 
against the inadvertent deactivation of the air bag, while 
avoiding the possible complexity or inconvenience of the ignition 
key based approach. Examples of other means include a separate 
key from the ignition key, ``keyless'' entry technology responding 
to personal identification numbers, the use of ``protected'' 
switches that require removing or re-positioning a special safety 
cap in two or more steps, or other such devices. NHTSA will 
consider all comments regarding the means to deactivate the 
passenger air bag, and will adopt the most practicable approach 
possible which is consistent with the philosophy that the device 
be as simple and easy to use as possible, consistent with the 
goal of preventing inadvertent deactivation. 


C. Air Bag Reactivation 


NHTSA is proposing to require that manual cutoff devices be 
designed so that, once the cutoff device has been used to 
deactivate the air bag, the air bag will remain deactivated until 
it is manually reactivated. Mandating manual reactivation would 
ensure that once an air bag has been deactivated for the safety 
of an infant being transported in a rear-facing child restraint 
in the front seat, it would remain deactivated for subsequent 
trips with the child. NHTSA is concerned, for example, that if 
it instead allowed a manually deactivated air bag to be 
automatically reactivated, motorists making stop-and-go shopping 
trips with infants might forget, after making one of their stops, 
that the air bag has been automatically reactivated and needs to 
be manually deactivated again. The infants would then be at risk 
if the vehicles were involved in crashes that deployed the air 
bags. 
At the same time, the agency is concerned that the air bag 
be operational whenever it is needed by a non-infant occupant. 
In an attempt to ensure that air bag protection would be ready 
when needed, NHTSA also proposes to require a yellow warning 
light which would be clearly visible to the driver and any adult 
passenger (see Section D, Warning Light, below). It would 
illuminate the words, ``AIR BAG OFF,'' whenever the air bag has 
been manually deactivated. This warning light would serve as a 
reminder that the cutoff device should be reset whenever the 
vehicle is no longer carrying an infant.

Notwithstanding its proposal to require that manually 
deactivated air bags reactivate by manual means only, NHTSA 
requests comments on whether it should address the problem of 
ensuring both infant and non-infant safety by mandating that a 
manually deactivated air bag be automatically reactivated upon 
the occurrence of some subsequent event. The subsequent event 
that triggers the automatic reactivation of the air bag could be 
the next restarting of the vehicle. However, such a design could 
pose an unnecessary burden and risk in the example given above of 
motorists making stop-and-go shopping trips. The motorists must 
restart their vehicles numerous times on such trips. The 
combination of that fact and the automatic reactivation of the 
air bag each time the vehicles are restarted would multiply the 
occasions on which the motorists might forget to protect their 
infants by deactivating the air bag. To address this problem, 
NHTSA requests comments on whether, if it were to adopt a 
requirement for automatic reactivation, it should qualify that 
requirement further, by requiring that the air bag be reactivated 
only when the restarting of the vehicle occurs after the ignition 
has been off for more than some minimum period, perhaps a period 
of several hours. 

The ultimate decision whether to mandate manual or automatic 
reactivation of the air bag will depend in large measure on the 
agency's assessment of the relative effects of each method of 
reactivation on the safety of the infant and non-infant occupants 
of the front right passenger seating position in the vehicles affected by this rulemaking. Using data from the National

Accident Sampling System (NASS) and Fatal Accident Reporting 
System (FARS), the agency has attempted to quantify the potential 
safety trade-offs in its preliminary regulatory evaluation for 
this rulemaking. NHTSA seeks comments and information that would 
enable the agency to refine its estimates of those trade-offs. 



D. Warning Light 



NHTSA is proposing to require a telltale light on the 
dashboard that is clearly visible from both the driver and front 
passenger seating positions and that is illuminated whenever the 
passenger air bag has been deactivated by means of the cutoff 
device. This light would be separate from the air bag readiness 
indicator already required by Standard No. 208. NHTSA is 
proposing that the color of the telltale be yellow, with the 
words ``AIR BAG OFF'' clearly visible on the telltale when the 
passenger side air bag has been deactivated. 

NHTSA believes that the indicator should be visible to the 
driver as a reminder that the passenger air bag is, or is not, 
functioning. NHTSA believes that the indicator should be also 
visible from the passenger seating position as a warning to non-infant occupants that they are not protected by their
air bag. 

While the agency is requiring a warning light that is 
visible to the passenger, its effectiveness may be limited by 
whether a passenger actually looks at, or for, the light, and 
understands its message. The agency seeks comment on whether a 
supplemental or additional warning for passengers would minimize instances in which the air bag was unintentionally
not 
reactivated. 

NHTSA is concerned that the level of illumination should be 
consistent with the ambient light condition, and is therefore 
requiring that the warning light indicator provide at least two 
levels of brightness, one of which is barely discernible to a 
driver who has adapted to dark ambient roadway conditions. In 
addition, NHTSA is specifying that the warning light indicator 
shall not be adjustable under any driving condition to a level 
that is invisible. 



E. Air Bag Readiness Indicator 



Currently, S4.5.2 of FMVSS No. 208 requires that every 
vehicle equipped with an air bag also be equipped with an air bag 
readiness indicator that informs the driver about the operational 
status of the air bag system. Specifically, S4.5.2 states: 




An occupant protection system that deploys in the event 
of a crash shall have a monitoring system with a 
readiness indicator. The indicator shall monitor its 
own readiness and shall be clearly visible from the 
driver's designated seating position. * * * 




NHTSA is not aware of any manufacturer which complies with this 
requirement by installing separate readiness indicators, one for 
the driver air bag and another for the passenger air bag. If a 
single readiness indicator for two air bags were used on a 
vehicle with an air bag cutoff device, the indicator would 
indicate the non-functioning of an air bag whenever the passenger 
air bag was deactivated. NHTSA is concerned that, under those 
circumstances, the driver would have no means of knowing the operational status of the driver air bag. NHTSA considered

proposing to amend S4.5.2 to require separate readiness 
indicators for the driver and passenger side air bags. Instead, 
NHTSA is proposing to amend S4.5.2 to limit the operation of a 
single readiness indicator when the cutoff device is ``on'' so that 
the indicator monitors only the air bag that is not deactivated, 
i.e., the driver air bag. When the cutoff device is ``off,'' the 
passenger air bag would be activated, and the readiness indicator 
would monitor the readiness of both the driver air bag and the 
passenger air bag. 



F. Owner's Manual 



NHTSA is also proposing to require that manufacturers 
include information concerning the cutoff device in the owner's 
manual. NHTSA is not proposing specific language which must be 
included in the owner's manual. NHTSA is proposing to require 
the owner's manual to include instructions on the operation of 
the cutoff device, a statement that the cutoff device should only 
be used when a rear-facing infant restraint is installed in the 
front passenger seating position, and a warning about the safety 
consequences of using the cutoff device at other times. 



G. Labels 



Currently, Standard No. 208 requires that by September 1, 
1994, air bag-equipped vehicles will bear a label on the sun 
visor that warns, in part: 




DO NOT INSTALL REARWARD-FACING CHILD SEATS IN ANY FRONT PASSENGER SEAT POSITION 








</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941007-1-00042 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941007-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Also, Standard No. 213 has been amended to require either of the 
following labels on rear-facing infant seats or on child 
restraints that can be converted for use in a rear-facing infant 
mode:




WARNING: PLACE THIS RESTRAINT IN A VEHICLE 
SEAT THAT DOES NOT HAVE AN AIR BAG

 

or

 

WARNING: WHEN YOUR BABY'S SIZE REQUIRES THAT THIS 
RESTRAINT BE USED SO THAT YOUR BABY FACES 
THE REAR OF THE VEHICLE, PLACE THE RESTRAINT 
IN A VEHICLE SEAT THAT DOES NOT HAVE AN AIR BAG

 


The first warning is to be used for child seats that are rear-facing only, and the second warning is to be used for infant

seats that convert from forward-facing to rear-facing. 

NHTSA has tentatively concluded that the language of these 
labels need not be amended. Manufacturers of child restraint 
systems are required to state in the printed instructions 
accompanying the restraint that the safest location for any child 
restraint is in the rear seat, regardless of whether the vehicle 
has an air bag. In addition, NHTSA is concerned that changing 
the language to clarify that the warning does not apply when the 
air bag can be deactivated will lessen the impact of the message 
on the public. Since not all vehicles may be equipped with 
cutoff devices, NHTSA is concerned that the result of lessening 
the impact of the message would be the placement of an infant in 
a seating position with an air bag that cannot be deactivated. 



VI. Phase-out of Manual Cutoff Devices 



The agency has tentatively concluded that use of manual 
cutoff devices should not be permitted indefinitely. The agency 
has also tentatively concluded that vehicles with air bags having 
manual cutoff devices should not be counted toward compliance 
with the phase-in for air bags. Further, manual cutoff devices 
should be prohibited in all passenger cars manufactured on or 
after September 1, 1997, and all light trucks manufactured on or 
after September 1, 1998. These are the dates on which 100 
percent compliance is required by 49 U.S.C. 30127. To implement 
these proposals, NHTSA would amend S4.1.5.1(b)'s definition of 
an ``inflatable restraint system,'' a term used in the paragraphs 
relating to the air bag requirements, to state that it does not 
include an air bag that can be deactivated by a manual cutoff 
device. 

This several year period would give manufacturers time to 
develop and introduce automatic devices. Automatic technology 
would reduce the potential problem with either intentional or 
accidental misuse of these devices to deactivate an air bag at 
times other than when a rear-facing infant restraint is in the 
seat. The agency is optimistic that new automatic sensing 
technology will soon be available to deactivate an air bag in 
certain situations, or to modify the deployment rate of the air 
bag according to the speed of the impact or the distance between 
the air bag and the occupant to be protected. NHTSA encourages 
vehicle manufacturers and suppliers to continue and accelerate 
their efforts to develop such technology.

VII. Automatic Cutoff Devices 



As discussed previously, NHTSA has concluded that Standard 
No. 208 currently allows automatic cutoff devices. NHTSA 
requests comments on whether the agency should regulate automatic 
cutoff devices. As part of this rulemaking proceeding, NHTSA 
requests comments on whether any or all of the proposals in this 
notice relating to warning lights, readiness indicators, owner's 
manuals, and labels should also apply to vehicles equipped with 
automatic cutoff devices. NHTSA believes that the vehicle 
manufacturers, in developing automatic cutoff devices, will 
attempt to guard against the possibility of air bags being 
automatically deactivated when they should be providing 
protection. Nevertheless, for the purpose of possible future 
rulemaking, the agency requests comments on the necessity for 
NHTSA's taking steps to ensure that air bag protection remains 
activated at all appropriate times. 



VIII. Consumer Education 



The agency actively works with consumer groups to promote 
child safety, and has been instrumental in reversing the stance 
long held by the American Academy of Pediatrics that infant 
restraints may be placed in the front seat. Additional consumer 
education is a necessary ingredient toward a successful 
attainment of the philosophy embodied in this rulemaking. Toward 
that end, NHTSA will work actively with the interested parties to 
further promote infant safety and to minimize any risk to infants from passenger side air bag. NHTSA invites comments
in this 
important area. 



IX. Proposed Effective Date



If adopted, the proposed amendments would become effective 30 days following publication of the final rule.



X. Rulemaking Analyses and Notices 



A. Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and 
Procedures 



NHTSA has considered the impact of this rulemaking action 
under E.O. 12866 and the Department of Transportation's 
regulatory policies and procedures. This rulemaking document was 
reviewed under E.O. 12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review.'' 
This action has been determined to be ``significant'' under the 
Department of Transportation's regulatory policies and 
procedures. 

Absent this rulemaking, and given a vehicle population in 
which all cars and light trucks are equipped with driver and 
passenger air bags, an estimated 1,050 air bag deployments a year 
will occur in pickup trucks and two-seater vehicles when a front 
passenger seat is occupied by an infant in a rear-facing infant 
seat. The level of the injuries resulting from these deployments 
are uncertain, but may well be severe. In an effort to assess 
the potential for safety trade-offs resulting from the failure to 
reactivate the air bag after it has been deactivated for the 
benefit of infant passengers, the agency estimated that only 
about one percent of the vehicles which would be permitted to 
have a cutoff device are likely to be carrying an infant. If one 
assumes for the purpose of analysis that the older occupants of 
10 percent of these vehicles did not reactivate the air bag for the benefit of non-infant passengers, approximately
3 occupants 
who are at least one year old may receive AIS 2-5 (survivable) 
injuries. In addition, for every one percent of all affected 
vehicles in which the older occupants deliberately turn off the 
air bag, 1-3 fatalities and 23-32 additional injuries could occur 
each year. Since the agency believes that the percentage of 
vehicles in which the passenger air bag is inadvertently or 
deliberately deactivated would be fairly small, the number of 
infants who would avoid potentially serious injury far exceeds 
the number of non-infants who might be injured. 

NHTSA estimates that the per vehicle price impact for the 
addition of a passenger air bag cutoff device is $10.15 in 1993 
dollars. This cost reflects a cost of $5.15 for the cutoff 
device and $5.00 for the light sensor that allows the warning 
light to have variable levels of brightness. NHTSA has not 
estimated the annual costs of this proposal, as that figure is 
dependent on the number of vehicles voluntarily equipped with 
manual cutoff devices.

A preliminary regulatory evaluation has been prepared for 
this rulemaking. A more detailed explanation of the costs and 
benefits can be found in that document. 



B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 



NHTSA has also considered the impacts of this notice under 
the Regulatory Flexibility Act. I hereby certify that this 
proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities. As explained above, NHTSA does not anticipate a significant economic impact
from this 
rulemaking action. 



C. Paperwork Reduction Act 



In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (P.L. 
96-511), there are no requirements for information collection 
associated with this proposed rule. 



D. National Environmental Policy Act 



NHTSA has also analyzed this proposed rule under the 
National Environmental Policy Act and determined that it would 
not have a significant impact on the human environment. 



E. Executive Order 12612 (Federalism) 



NHTSA has analyzed this proposal in accordance with the 
principles and criteria contained in E.O. 12612, and has 
determined that this proposed rule would not have significant 
federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a 
Federalism Assessment. 



F. Civil Justice Reform 



This proposed rule would not have any retroactive effect. 
Under 49 U.S.C. 30103, whenever a Federal motor vehicle safety 
standard is in effect, a State may not adopt or maintain a safety 
standard applicable to the same aspect of performance which is 
not identical to the Federal standard, except to the extent that 
the state requirement imposes a higher level of performance and 
applies only to vehicles procured for the State's use. 49 U.S.C. 
30161 sets forth a procedure for judicial review of final rules 
establishing, amending or revoking Federal motor vehicle safety standards. That section does not require submission
of a 
petition for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings 
before parties may file suit in court. 



XI. Submission of Comments 



Interested persons are invited to submit comments on the 
proposal. It is requested but not required that 10 copies be 
submitted. 

All comments must not exceed 15 pages in length. (49 CFR 
553.21). Necessary attachments may be appended to these 
submissions without regard to the 15-page limit. This limitation 
is intended to encourage commenters to detail their primary 
arguments in a concise fashion. 

If a commenter wishes to submit certain information under a 
claim of confidentiality, three copies of the complete 
submission, including purportedly confidential business 
information, should be submitted to the Chief Counsel, NHTSA, at 
the street address given above, and seven copies from which the 
purportedly confidential information has been deleted should be 
submitted to the Docket Section. A request for confidentiality 
should be accompanied by a cover letter setting forth the 
information specified in the agency's confidential business 
information regulation. 49 CFR Part 512. 

All comments received before the close of business on the 
comment closing date indicated above for the proposal will be 
considered, and will be available for examination in the docket 
at the above address both before and after that date. To the extent possible, comments filed after the closing date
will also 
be considered. Comments received too late for consideration in 
regard to the final rule will be considered as suggestions for 
further rulemaking action. Comments on the proposal will be 
available for inspection in the docket. The NHTSA will continue 
to file relevant information as it becomes available in the 
docket after the closing date, and it is recommended that 
interested persons continue to examine the docket for new 
material. 

Those persons desiring to be notified upon receipt of their 
comments in the rules docket should enclose a self-addressed, 
stamped postcard in the envelope with their comments. Upon 
receiving the comments, the docket supervisor will return the 
postcard by mail.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation, and the Office of Thrift Supervision, (collectively, the Federal 
financial supervisory agencies or agencies) propose to revise their regulations concerning the Community Reinvestment
Act (CRA). The agencies published a joint notice of proposed rulemaking on this issue on December 21, 1993 (December
proposal). The revised proposal published today reflects comments received on the December proposal and the agencies'
further internal 
considerations. 



The purpose of the CRA regulations is to implement the continuing 
and affirmative obligation of regulated financial institutions to help meet the credit needs of their communities,
including low- and moderate-income 
neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound operations and to provide 
guidance on how the agencies assess the performance of institutions in meeting 
that obligation. 

The revised proposal would provide guidance to financial institutions on the nature and extent of their CRA obligation
and the methods by which the obligation will be assessed and enforced. The proposed procedures seek to emphasize performance
rather than process, promote consistency in assessments, permit more effective enforcement against institutions
with poor performance, and reduce unnecessary compliance burden while stimulating improved performance. As compared
to the December proposal, the revised proposal broadens the examination of performance, more explicitly considers
community development activities, and makes other modifications and clarifications.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Introduction 



The Federal financial supervisory agencies are jointly proposing to 
revise their regulations implementing the CRA (12 U.S.C. 2901 

et seq.

). The proposed regulations would replace the existing regulations in their entirety. 

The CRA is designed to promote affirmative and ongoing efforts by regulated financial institutions to help meet the
credit needs of their entire communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with safe
and sound operations. Despite the CRA's notable successes, bank and thrift industry, community, consumer and other
groups maintain that its full 
potential has not been realized, in large part, because compliance efforts have focused on process rather than performance.


In accordance with a request by the President, the Federal financial 
supervisory agencies have undertaken a comprehensive effort to reform their 
evaluation standards and examination procedures. The proposed regulations 
would implement one part of this reform effort by substituting a new system 
that would rate institutions based on their actual performance in helping to meet community credit needs. 

In addition to this rulemaking, the agencies will work together to 
improve examiner training and to increase interagency coordination regarding 
application of standards, performance of examinations, assignment of ratings, 
and use of enforcement procedures. These efforts should produce a CRA 
assessment process that is less burdensome for many institutions yet yields 
better results for the local communities the law is intended to benefit.

Background 



In 1977, the Congress enacted the CRA to encourage banks and thrifts to help meet the credit needs of low- and moderate-income
communities, consistent with safe and sound lending practices. In the CRA, the Congress found that regulated financial
institutions are required to demonstrate that their deposit facilities serve the convenience and needs of the communities
in which they are chartered to do business, and that the convenience and needs of communities include the need for credit
as well as deposit services. The CRA has come to play an increasingly important role in improving access to credit among
under-served communities_both rural and urban_across the country. Under the impetus of the CRA, many banks and thrifts
opened new branches, provided expanded services, and made substantial commitments to increase lending to all segments
of society. 

Despite these successes, the CRA examination and enforcement system has been criticized. Financial institutions
have complained that policy guidance from the supervisory agencies on the CRA is unclear and that examination standards
are applied inconsistently. Financial institutions have also complained that the CRA examination process encourages
them to generate excessive paperwork at the expense of providing loans, services, and investments. 

Community, consumer, and other groups have agreed with the industry that there are inconsistencies in CRA evaluations
and current examinations overemphasize process and underemphasize performance. Community and consumer groups
also have criticized the regulatory agencies for failing to aggressively penalize banks and thrifts for poor performance.


Believing that the CRA examination and enforcement process can be improved, the President requested in July 1993
that the Federal financial supervisory agencies reform the CRA examination and enforcement system. The President
asked the agencies to consult with the banking and thrift industries, Congressional leaders, and leaders of community-based
organizations across the country to develop new CRA regulations and examination procedures that ``replace paperwork
and uncertainty with greater performance, clarity, and objectivity.'' 

Specifically, the President asked the agencies to refocus the CRA examination system on more objective, performance-based
assessment standards that minimize compliance burden while stimulating improved performance. He also asked the
agencies to develop a well-trained corps of examiners who would specialize in CRA examinations. In undertaking this
effort, the President requested that the agencies promote consistency and even-handedness, improve CRA performance
evaluations, and institute more effective sanctions against institutions with consistently poor performance.


To implement the President's initiative, the four agencies held a series of seven public hearings across the country
in 1993. At those hearings, the agencies heard from over 250 witnesses. Nearly 50 others submitted written statements.
The preamble to the December proposal reviewed the results of those hearings. 



The December Proposal 



The December proposal (58 FR 67466) would have eliminated the twelve assessment factors in the present CRA regulation
and substituted a performance-based evaluation system. Under the December proposal, a financial institution would
not have been assessed on its efforts to meet community credit needs, nor on its methods for determining the credit
needs of its community. Rather, the agencies would have evaluated institutions based on their actual lending, service,
and investment performance. 

Generally, independent institutions with at least $250 million in assets and affiliates of holding companies with
at least $250 million in bank and thrift assets would have been evaluated based on some combination of lending, service,
and investment tests. Institutions would have had to report to the agencies and make available to the public data on
the geographic distribution of their loan applications, denials, originations and purchases. Small banks and thrifts
could have elected to be evaluated under a streamlined method that would not have required them to report this data.
Every institution would have had the option to have its performance evaluated based on a pre-approved strategic plan
that had been subjected to review and comment by community-based organizations and the rest of the public. However,
the strategic plan option would not have relieved an institution of its data reporting obligations.

There would have been five ratings_``outstanding,'' ``high satisfactory,'' ``low satisfactory,'' ``needs to
improve,'' and ``substantial noncompliance''_under each of the lending, investment, and service tests so as to
measure with more refinement the variations in performance among institutions. The agencies proposed to have only
four overall ratings, however, as required by statute_``outstanding,'' ``satisfactory,'' ``needs to improve,''
and ``substantial noncompliance.'' 

The December proposal was originally published with a 60-day comment period. This period was extended for 30 additional
days in view of the magnitude of the proposed changes, the complexity of the issues, the level of interest in the subject,
and delays resulting from the holiday season (59 FR 5138). After considering the thousands of comments received,
the agencies produced the revised regulations proposed today, which respond to suggestions in the comments while
preserving the December proposal's goal of emphasizing performance over process. 



Overview of Comments on the December Proposal 



Collectively, the agencies received over 6700 comment letters on the December proposal. The agencies received comment
letters from representatives of banks and thrifts, consumer and community groups, Congress, state and local governments,
and others as shown in the following table: 



 


The agencies reviewed and considered all of the above-described comments concerning the December proposal. Comments
are discussed in greater detail in the section-by-section analysis of the revised proposal. As a general matter,
the vast majority of commenters expressed support for the agencies' goal of developing more objective, performance-based
assessment standards that minimize burden while stimulating improved performance. Many commenters believed that,
under the existing CRA regulations, the agencies focus too closely on documentation of CRA performance and too little
on actual performance. These commenters felt the present documentation requirements are overly burdensome. Many
commenters also supported the agencies' goal of ensuring consistency and evenhandedness among the agencies in CRA
evaluations. Commenters supported enhanced CRA examiner training to increase consistency. While most commenters
generally supported the agencies' goals in amending their CRA regulations, many expressed concern over some aspects
of the December proposal.

The Revised Proposal 



In General 



The revised proposal retains, to a significant extent, the principles and structure underlying the December proposal
but makes significant changes to the details in order to respond to many of the concerns raised in the comments. Like
the December proposal, the revised proposal would eliminate the existing regulation's twelve assessment factors
and substitute a performance-based evaluation system. 

In order to take into account community characteristics and needs, 
the revised proposal would make explicit the assessment context against which 
the tests and standards set out in the proposed regulation would be applied. 
This assessment context would include consideration of: (1) Demographic data 
about the community; (2) information about community characteristics and 
needs; (3) information about the institution's capacity and constraints; 
(4) information about the institution's product offerings and business strategy; (5) data on the prior performance
of the institution; and (6) data on the performance of similarly-situated lenders. The agencies, rather than the
institution, would develop the assessment context for each institution. The agencies will neither require nor request
an institution to provide data for this assessment context, although any data offered by an institution would be considered.


As in the December proposal, the agencies would give particular attention to the institution's record of helping
to meet credit needs in low- and moderate-income geographies. However, the revised proposal would further emphasize
the institution's performance with respect to low- and moderate- income individuals, and other individuals and
areas where appropriate, given community characteristics and needs. The agencies also have modified the definitions
of low- and moderate-income geographies in response to concerns that the definitions in the December proposal were
too low for high cost areas. Under the revised proposal, the qualifying income levels would be adjusted to reflect
prevailing housing construction costs or significant anomalies in family income levels. The agencies would make
available annually a list of qualifying income levels by geographic area. 

The lending, service and investment tests would continue to constitute the primary method by which the agencies would
assess the CRA performance of independent retail institutions with at least $250 million in assets and affiliates
of holding companies with at least $250 million in bank and thrift assets. However, the revised proposal changes how
an institution's ratings on the three tests would be combined to produce the institution's overall composite rating.
The revised proposal would give primacy to lending performance by requiring an institution to receive a ``satisfactory''
or better rating on the lending test in order to receive a ``satisfactory'', or better, overall rating. At the same
time, the rating system would increase the importance of the service and investment tests, because the effect of those
tests on the overall rating would no longer be limited to situations in which an institution had extraordinarily strong
or weak performance on one of the tests. 

The agencies also have made modifications to the details of the 
lending, service and investment tests in order to broaden their scope. Rather 
than rely presumptively on a few quantitative measures that could then be 
adjusted or rebutted by other considerations, the tests would be based from the outset on a broader range of quantitative
and qualitative criteria that would include both those criteria that formed the basis for the presumptive ratings
in the December proposal and those additional considerations contained in the adjustment and rebuttal sections
of the December proposal. The revised proposal therefore would not use rebuttable presumptions and adjustments.


These revisions to the lending, investment and service tests would increase, rather than reduce, the number of judgments
that examiners would be required to make in the examination process. The agencies believe that a CRA evaluation system
eliminating all examiner judgment would not be desirable, even if it were achievable. Preservation of examiner judgment
to take into account the characteristics and needs of an institution's community and the capacity and constraints
of the institution is critical.

At the same time, the agencies believe that consistency in evaluations, reduction in compliance burden, and focus
on performance are fully consistent with the necessary degree of examiner judgment. The agencies believe that the
revised proposal, which entails a series of examiner decisions in reliance on detailed data concerning an institution's
actual lending, service and investment performance, would provide the proper balance between objective analysis
and subjective judgment. In order to minimize unnecessary subjectivity, the agencies have attempted to provide
more guidance in the revised proposal as to the standards that examiners would apply to make the required judgments.


In addition to identifying the data that would form the basis for their performance analysis, the information that
would provide the background assessment context, and the criteria that would guide the assessments, the agencies
have proposed detailed performance rating profiles for each rating level of the lending, service, and investment
tests. An institution's performance need not fit every performance aspect of the typical profile in order to receive
a certain rating. Exceptionally strong performance on some aspects can compensate for weak performance on others.
However, the institution would receive a rating which is generally consistent with the institution's overall performance
on the various aspects of the profile. 

The December proposal based its presumptive ratings on comparative terms, for example whether an institution's
qualified investments were significant as compared to its capital, or whether an insignificant percentage of an
institution's branches were located in or readily accessible to low- and moderate-income geographies in the institution's
service area. While many comments stated that these terms should be further defined, few 
commenters, despite a specific request in the December proposal, actually suggested what these definitions should
be. 

The ratings profiles in the current proposal continue to use comparative terms, such as excellent, significant,
and poor, without further specification. Many comments agreed that the mechanical application of numerical ratios
would not foster fair and appropriate CRA assessments. The agencies continue to believe, given the wide diversity
of institutions and communities, that it is inadvisable to provide such specific numerical ranges or ratios. The
agencies expect the current proposal to increase the consistency and clarity of the examination process. By identifying
a set of performance-based assessment criteria, and expanding the objective performance data available to examinations,
institutions and the public will be better able to evaluate the basis on which examiner judgments are made. In addition,
by providing more detailed profiles that involve several criteria, assessment under the current proposal will not
turn on the evaluation of a single factor. 

The revised proposal also modifies the lending and service tests for retail institutions to emphasize the importance
of community development activities in the assessments of performance under those tests. In addition, the revised
proposal replaces the investment test with a community development test for wholesale or limited purpose institutions.
The proposal incorporates into this community development test both community development lending and community
development services in addition to qualified investments. Therefore, under the revised proposal, wholesale or
limited purpose institutions would be subject only to the community development test. 
The revised proposal would reduce data reporting burdens by streamlining reporting requirements to coincide more
closely with existing requirements and eliminating unnecessary reporting. The one significant new data reporting
requirement would be that small business and small farm loan data reported to the agencies would include information
on the race and gender of small business and farm borrowers to respond to concerns that the December proposal did not
give enough weight to the fair lending aspect of an institution's CRA performance. This concern is also reflected
in the revision of the provisions regarding consideration of illegal discrimination to conform them more closely
to existing regulatory language.

Smaller banks and thrifts would continue to be evaluated under a 
streamlined assessment method that would not require reporting of additional 
lending data. However, the streamlined method would be the presumptive 
method for evaluating small institutions and would be applied to every 
qualifying institution unless the institution affirmatively requests an alternative assessment method. The agencies
have also altered the description of the streamlined assessment method in order to make clear that this assessment
is not intended to operate as an exemption from the CRA rules. 

The streamlined assessment method would continue to focus on the 
institution's loan-to-deposit ratio, degree of local lending, record of lending to 
borrowers and geographies of different income levels, and record of responding 
to complaints. The institution's fair lending record would still be taken into 
account in assigning a final rating. In response to comments, the agencies have 
eliminated the provision in the December proposal that made a loan-to-deposit 
ratio of 60% or more presumptively satisfactory. The revised proposal would 
consider an institution's size, financial condition, and credit needs of its service 
area in evaluating whether its loan-to-deposit ratio is reasonable. The 
evaluation would further consider, as appropriate, other lending-related 
activities, such as originations for sale on the secondary market and community 
development lending and investment. 

Every institution would continue to have the option to be evaluated 
pursuant to a pre-approved strategic plan. The strategic plan option would not 
relieve an institution from any reporting obligations that it otherwise would 
have. The revised proposal clarifies, however, that small institutions would not 
subject themselves to any data reporting responsibilities by electing the strategic 
plan option. The agencies also have provided more detail as to how the 
proposed strategic plan option would operate in practice. 

The revised proposal has eliminated provisions that some comments 
interpreted as ``safe harbors'' from examination or enforcement action. The 
revised proposal would not make substantive modifications to the December 
provisions governing what types of institutions are subject to the proposed 
regulations, although the agencies have clarified that bankers banks would not 
be covered. The revised proposal continues to provide that uninsured branches 
of foreign banks would not be covered by the proposed regulations. However, 
the agencies are aware that the Interstate Banking Efficiency Act would address 
the CRA coverage of certain uninsured branches of foreign banks. Should this 
Act be signed into law, the agencies would modify the revised proposal to 
reflect the new legal requirements. 


The December proposal would have made an institution with an 
assigned rating of ``substantial noncompliance'' subject to an enforcement action 
under 12 U.S.C. 1818. A number of commenters questioned the legal authority 
of the agencies under the CRA to use assigned ratings as the basis for an 
enforcement action. Other commenters endorsed taking enforcement action 
against institutions with poor CRA ratings. 

The revised proposal includes the enforcement provisions from the 
December proposal while the agencies continue to analyze the issues raised by 
the comments. The agencies invite further comment on these issues before 
issuing a final rule. 



The Lending Test 



The lending test in the December proposal would have evaluated_
on the basis of its performance in relation to other lenders subject to CRA and 
on an independent basis_the extent to which a retail institution was making 
loans in the low- and moderate-income portions of its service area. The test 
would have evaluated an institution's lending performance relative to other 
lenders by comparing the institution's market share of housing, small business, 
small farm, and consumer loans in the low- and moderate-income geographies 
of its service area with its share of such loans in the other parts of its service 
area. The test would have evaluated performance on an independent basis by 
examining the ratio of reported loans made (both number and amount) by the 
institution in the low- and moderate-income geographies of its service area to 
the reported loans made throughout its entire service area and the geographic 
distribution of its reported loans across the low- and moderate-income 
geographies of its service area. 

At the election of the institution, the agencies would have 
considered indirect loans under the lending test. Indirect loans were defined to 
include loans made by third parties, such as lending consortia, subsidiaries of 
the institution, non-chartered affiliates funded by the institution, and other 
lenders that lent to low- and moderate-income individuals or geographies and in 
which the institution had made lawful investments. The agencies would have 
attributed indirect loans to an institution in proportion to the size of the 
institution's investment in or funding of the third party lender or participation in 
the third party's loans, provided the institution reported the indirect loans.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941007-1-00053 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941007-1-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The December proposal would have made a distinction between the ability of an institution to claim credit under the
lending test for indirect loans by its subsidiaries and funded non-chartered affiliates and its ability to claim
credit for indirect loans made by other lenders. An institution would have been able to claim credit for lending by
its subsidiaries or non-chartered affiliates if the institution either invested in the entity or made a loan to it.
For third party lenders, however, the institution would have been required to make an investment in the entity (as
opposed to making a loan to the entity) in order to claim credit under the lending test for the third party loans. The
purpose of this distinction was to recognize the unique relationship between an institution and its subsidiaries
and affiliates, and to give institutions and their parent corporations greater flexibility to structure their lending
as they saw fit. 
While the foregoing factors would have served as the basis for a rating under the lending test, the December proposal
would have allowed the agencies to adjust an institution's assessment upward, and, in exceptional cases, downward.
Upward adjustment might have been warranted if the institution made, for example, a substantial amount of loans requiring
innovative underwriting or loans for which there was special need, such as loans for multifamily housing construction
and rehabilitation, loans for start-up or very small businesses, loans to community development organizations
or facilities, or loans to very low-income individuals and geographies. An institution's assessment also could
have been increased if it operated a ``second look'' program to reevaluate loan applications that, based on an initial
review, the institution had planned to deny. On the other hand, a downward adjustment could have been warranted if,
for example, the quantitative measures inaccurately portrayed the institution's actual lending to low- or moderate-income
geographies or individuals. 
Commenters from both the banking industry and the public believed the lending test contained in the December proposal
was too narrow in its focus. In particular, some believed the test gave insufficient emphasis to community development
lending and innovative underwriting. Other commenters noted that the proposed lending test placed undue emphasis
on the location of the borrower rather than on the borrower's individual characteristics (

e.g.,

 income). Some commenters believed the December proposal would have given institutions a greater incentive to make
loans to high-income borrowers located in low-income geographies than to make loans to low-income borrowers located
in high-income geographies. 
In response to commenters who believed the December proposal underemphasized the importance of community development
lending, the revised proposal would treat such lending as a principal component of an institution's lending performance,
not merely an adjustment factor. The revised proposal also defines community development loans. Such loans are loans
(including lines of credit, commitments and letters of credit) that address affordable housing or other community
economic development needs not being met by the private market, provided such loans (1) Principally benefit low-
or moderate-income individuals, businesses or small farms with annual revenues less than or equal to $1 million,
or businesses or farms that qualify as small businesses under a Small Business Administration program; (2) have not
been reported or collected by the bank or one of its affiliates as home mortgage loans, small business loans, small
farm loans, or consumer loans for CRA purposes, unless the loans are for multifamily dwellings (as defined in the Home
Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) (12 U.S.C. 2801 

et seq.

) regulations); and (3) except in the case of a wholesale or limited purpose bank, benefit the bank's service area(s)
or a broader statewide or regional area that includes the bank's service area(s). This definition clarifies that
community development loans deserving of favorable consideration are those that fill a void left by the ordinary
operation of the private market. In addition, it is designed to prevent double-counting of all loans except for multifamily
housing loans, which the agencies believe should be considered both in the distribution analyses of an institution's
home mortgage lending and for evaluation of its community development lending in order to properly evaluate the value
of the loans for CRA purposes. Finally, the definition also provides that an institution will get favorable consideration
for a community development loan if it is in the institution's service area or is in a broader region that includes the
institution's service area. This broader geographic scope would recognize the nature of some lending programs and
consortia that produce these loans. An institution would be evaluated based on the number, amount, complexity, and
innovativeness of its community development loans.

The agencies also have revised the lending test in response to comments that the December proposal placed undue emphasis
on the geography of the borrower rather than on the borrower's individual characteristics. Under the revised proposal,
while the agencies would continue to place a heavy emphasis on the geographic distribution of an institution's lending,
they also would consider favorably loans made to low- and moderate-income individuals regardless of where the borrowers
reside. The agencies would evaluate the number and amount of home mortgage loans to low-, moderate-, middle-, and
upper-income individuals; the number and amount of loans to small business and small farms with annual revenues less
than or equal to $1 million; the number and amount of loans to small businesses and small farms by size of loan; and, at
the institution's option, the number and amount of consumer loans to low-, moderate-, middle-, and upper-income
individuals. The revised proposal provides that distribution of borrower characteristics would be examined with
particular reference to the institution's service area, but need not be limited to the institution's service area.
Institutions would receive favorable consideration for lending to low- and moderate-income individuals and small
businesses and farms outside of their service area, so long as they have not neglected these borrowers inside their
service area. The agencies have also created an assessment criterion regarding an institution's use of innovative
and flexible lending practices to recognize those programs and products that might have been cause for upward adjustments
in the December proposal. 
The agencies received numerous comments on the market share component of the lending test. Many banks and thrifts
felt the market share test was misleading in that, among other things, it overlooked loans by institutions that do
not have any reporting obligations under HMDA or CRA. Further, institutions could have had service areas that overlapped
partially, but not completely, in ways that would distort the measurement of their lending performance under the
test. Many also were concerned that if one bank increased its market share, another necessarily would lose market
share; hence, the commenters suggested that the market share test could promote a price war among institutions trying
to make loans in low- and moderate-income areas, potentially leading to unsafe and unsound banking practices. Banks
and thrifts frequently stated that the lending test in the December proposal was a form of credit allocation. On the
other hand, many community groups and government officials liked the market share test because it provided an objective
and quantitative standard for measuring an institution's CRA performance. At the same time, a number of community
groups expressed concern that the formula did not take into account qualitative differences among loans.

In light of these comments, the lending test has been modified. The lending test would continue to give significant
weight to the geographic distribution of an institution's lending; and, as part of the assessment context, examiners
would consider, among other considerations described earlier in this preamble, the performance of other similarly-situated
lenders where appropriate. In this regard, examiners would use market share and other analyses to assist in evaluating
the geographic distribution of an institution's lending where such analyses would provide accurate insight. However,
the proposed regulation does not require examiners to use any single type of analysis, and would not link a particular
market share ratio, or any ratio, with a particular lending test rating. 
In considering the geographic distribution of an institution's loans, the agencies, under the revised proposal,
would evaluate the number and amount of an institution's loans in the low-, moderate-, middle-, and upper-income
geographies of the institution's service area. They also would assess the dispersion of the institution's lending
throughout its service area. In response to concerns expressed by some commenters that an institution might limit
the size of its service area to obtain a better performance rating, the revised proposal would penalize an institution
if too little of its lending were made inside its service area. 
While agreeing with the concept of including affiliate and third-party lending at the institution's option, many
industry commenters criticized the December proposal_which would not have considered lending by chartered or non-funded
affiliates_as unduly restrictive and inconsistent with the corporate funding practices of certain institutions.
Also, some community and consumer groups expressed concern that institutions could use third-party lending to avoid
their direct lending obligations and, in effect, ``buy out'' of their CRA obligations.

Like the December proposal, the revised proposal would allow 
institutions, at their option, to include affiliate and third-party lending in their 
lending record but would make certain changes to the December proposal in 
this regard. First, the revised proposal would consider indirect lending by any 
of an institution's affiliates_regardless of whether the affiliate is chartered or 
how it is funded. The revised proposal would not impose restrictions on the 
corporate structures of institutions and their affiliates. 

Second, the rules regarding the allocation of loans among affiliates 
have been simplified. The revised proposal would also include several new 
provisions designed to prevent an institution from selectively including (or 
excluding) its affiliate lending. Under the revised proposal, the agencies would 
evaluate an institution's affiliate lending when assessing the institution's overall 
lending performance, provided the institution (or its affiliate) chooses to collect 
and report the data pertaining to such lending. If an institution chooses to 
report some of its affiliate loans in a service area for a particular lending 
category, such as home mortgages, or small business loans, it would be 
required to report all of its affiliate loans of that category for that specific 
service area. An agency would be able to consider the lending of an 
institution's affiliate, notwithstanding whether the institution wants the agency 
to consider its affiliate lending, if the agency were to determine that such 
lending is integral to the institution's business. An affiliate's lending would be 
integral to an institution's business if the institution's operations closely involve 
or support the marketing, management, or other operation of the affiliate's 
lending. Lending would not be considered integral to an institution's business 
merely because the institution had a financial interest in the affiliate. 

Third, the revised proposal would no longer allow an institution to 
include third party loans with its direct and affiliate loans for purposes of 
assessing the geographic distribution of the institution's lending or the 
distribution of its lending across borrower characteristics. Under the revised 
proposal, third party loans could be attributed to an institution only if they meet 
the definition of community development loans. This change responds to 
comments from community and consumer groups who expressed concern that 
institutions could use third-party lending to avoid their direct lending obligations 
and, in effect, ``buy out'' of their CRA obligations. The revised proposal also 
would operate to relieve third party lenders of the burden of reporting the 
geographic location of their loans that could have been placed on them by the 
December proposal. 



The Investment Test 



In the December proposal, retail institutions as well as wholesale or 
limited purpose institutions would have been evaluated under the investment test 
based on the amount of assets they had devoted to ``qualified investments'' in 
comparison to their risk-based capital. The focus of the investment test would 
have been on the ultimate impact of an institution's investment rather than the 
investment per se. Therefore, qualified investments would not have been 
credited under the test unless they had a demonstrable impact, e.g., in 
providing loans or community development projects that benefit low- and 
moderate-income individuals and geographies. 

Qualified investments would have included lawful investments that 
benefit low- and moderate-income geographies or individuals in an institution's 
service area. Examples of such investments would have included those: (1) in 
support of local affordable housing and community, economic, or small 
business development; (2) in community development financial institutions, 
community development corporations, community development projects, small 
business investment companies (including specialized small business investment 
companies), and minority- and women-owned financial institutions and other 
community development financial intermediaries; (3) in consortia or other 
entities serving low- and moderate-income individuals and areas; and (4) in 
state and local government agency housing bonds or state and local government 
revenue bonds specifically aimed at helping low- and moderate-income areas 
and individuals. Eligible grants and the donation or sale on favorable terms of 
branches to minority- or women-owned financial institutions also would have 
counted as qualifying investments.

The agencies could have adjusted an institution's rating upward 
under the investment test to take into account whether the institution's 
investments were particularly innovative or met a special need or whether the 
institution's activities in connection with the investments were particularly 
complex or intensive. The agencies also would have been able to adjust an 
institution's rating upward if the institution had made a large amount of 
investments that would have been qualified investments except that they failed 
to benefit the institution's service area. Downward adjustments would have 
been justified only in exceptional cases. 

Commenters criticized several aspects of the proposal. Most 
notably, many banking industry commenters expressed dissatisfaction with the 
test's focus on the amount of qualified investments relative to an institution's risk-based capital. They felt reliance
on any such investment-to-capital ratio would unfairly penalize well-capitalized institutions. Community groups
commented on various aspects of how the term ``qualified investments'' was defined and the banking industry criticized
the restriction that qualified investments must benefit the institution's service area. 

The investment test in the revised proposal has been modified to 
address the principal concerns raised in the comments. The reliance on the 
ratio of qualified investments to risk-based capital has been eliminated. Rather, under the revised proposal, the
agencies would focus on the dollar amount of the institution's qualified investments (independent of the institution's
capital), the innovativeness and complexity of the qualified investments and their connection to credit needs,
and the institution's responsiveness to credit and community economic development needs. 

Further, the revised proposal clarifies the definition of ``qualified 
investments.''
 Qualified investments are lawful investments, deposits, 
membership shares in a credit union, and grants that primarily benefit low- or 
moderate-income individuals or businesses or farms with under $1 million in 
annual revenues or that qualify as small businesses under SBA regulations; and 
that address affordable housing (including multifamily rental housing) or other community economic development
needs that are not being met in the normal course of business by the private market. The agencies intend the limitation
regarding needs not being met by the private market to exclude untargeted municipal bonds and standard mortgage-backed
securities. The revised proposal also would clarify that grants, membership shares in a credit union, and other non-loan
financial support can qualify as qualified investments. Under the definition, a qualified investment would not
otherwise be disqualified because an institution receives favorable treatment (for example as a tax deduction or
credit) for them under the Internal Revenue Code. In addition, under the revised proposal, qualified investments
no longer would need to benefit an institution's service area, provided the investments benefit a broader statewide
or regional geographic area that includes the institution's service area. This change would conform with the broader
geographic scope permitted for community development loans discussed previously. 





The revised proposal deletes the definition of small business from 
the December proposal that some commenters criticized as too complicated. 
Instead, the qualified investment and community development loan definitions 
refer to investments and loans that benefit businesses with annual revenues 
under $1 million or that would qualify as small businesses under a Small 
Business Administration program. The $1 million figure was chosen because it 
is used in Regulation B to differentiate among borrowers for requirements 
concerning adverse action notices and application retention. The new proposed 
definitions also maintain a treatment of small business that conforms to the SBA 
definitions, as required by law for federal agencies.

As described more fully later in this preamble, under the revised 
proposal, wholesale or limited purpose banks would be subject to evaluation 
under the new community development test rather than under the investment 
test. 



The Service Test 



The December proposal would have evaluated an institution's CRA 
service performance primarily on the basis of the percentage of its branches 
located in or readily accessible to low- and moderate-income geographies. The 
percentage of branches that an institution would have been expected to have in 
or readily accessible to low-and moderate-income geographies in each service 
area would have depended, in part, on the number of such geographies in the 
service area. Under the December proposal, institutions would not have been 
required to expand the size of their branching network or to operate branches at a loss. 

The agencies would have been able to adjust an institution's service 
record upward or downward to reflect more accurately its branch service to lowor moderate-income geographies or
individuals, but downward adjustments 
would have been made only in exceptional cases. In determining the 
appropriateness and degree of any adjustment, the agencies would have 
considered: (1) the institution's record of opening and closing branches; 
(2) whether branches_wherever located_were actually serving low- and 
moderate-income individuals; (3) any significant differences in the quality, 
quantity or types of services offered to low- or moderate-income individuals or geographies; and (4) similar factors.
The agencies also could have adjusted an institution's rating upward to reflect a strong record of providing or supporting
other services that promote credit availability for low- and moderate-income individuals or geographies. Particular
weight would have been given to credit and home-ownership counseling, small and minority-owned business counseling,
low-cost check-cashing, and low-cost deposit services. 

The service test contained in the revised proposal would change the 
service test contained in the December proposal in response to comments 
received by the agencies. In crafting the December proposal, the agencies were 
guided by a belief that ready access to branches is a critical factor in the 
availability of credit and deposit services in a community. However, many 
banking industry representatives commented that the service test placed too 
much emphasis on ``brick and mortar'' branches (i.e., permanent staffed banking facilities). The commenters noted
that although branches are still valuable, present technology has made the need for branches less imperative to the
provision of banking services. On the other hand, many consumer groups 
stressed that, despite changes in technology, brick and mortar branches continue to have symbolic and practical
relevance to credit availability. A number of commenters emphasized, however, that evaluations based on the mere
presence of brick and mortar facilities is not sufficient. Rather, the agencies must consider the actual services
that are provided. 

In light of these comments, the agencies have decided to modify 
the service test so that ``brick and mortar'' branches no longer would serve as the overwhelming factor in assessing
an institution's service performance, 
although they still would receive prominent consideration. Under the revised 
proposal, equal weight would be given to the actual services provided to low- 
and moderate-income geographies. 

Under the revised proposal, the agencies would evaluate an 
institution's systems for delivering retail banking services (where the term 
``systems'' includes, among other things, branches, automated teller machines 
(ATMs), loan production offices, banking by telephone or computer, mobile 
branches, and bank-at-work or by-mail programs) by: (1) assessing the 
distribution of the institution's branches and ATMs among low-, moderate-, middle-, and upper-income geographies;
(2) reviewing the institution's record of opening and closing branches and ATMs; (3) assessing the range of services

provided in low-, moderate-, middle-, and upper-income geographies; and 
(4) evaluating the availability of alternative systems for delivering retail banking services.

In addition, the agencies would evaluate the extent to which an 
institution provides community development services and the innovativeness and 
responsiveness of such services, given the needs of the institution's community and the capacity and constraints
of the institution. The revised proposal defines community development services as services that primarily benefit
low- and moderate-income individuals, businesses or farms with annual revenues less than or equal to $1 million,
or businesses or farms that qualify as small businesses under a Small Business Administration program and that address
affordable housing (including multifamily rental housing) or other community economic development needs that
are not being met by the private market.






The Community Development Test for Wholesale or Limited Purpose Institutions 



Under the December proposal, wholesale or limited purpose 
institutions were defined as insured depository institutions that are in the 
business of extending credit to the public but do not make a significant amount of reportable loans (

i.e., 

home mortgage, consumer, small farm and small business loans). These would have included institutions that make
primarily large commercial loans, as well as credit card banks, and similar institutions. The December proposal
would have required an evaluation of the CRA performance of these institutions primarily under the proposed investment
test. 

Performance under that test would have been measured based on 
the amount of an institution's assets devoted to qualified investments as 
compared to its risk-based capital. Qualified investments would have consisted 
of lawful investments that benefited low- and moderate-income geographies or 
individuals in an institution's service area, including investments that supported local affordable housing and
community, economic, or small business 
development. Eligible grants and loans that would have constituted a qualified 
investment also would have been included within the investment test. In 
assigning the overall rating for wholesale or limited purpose institutions, the institution's investment test
rating could have been increased one level for outstanding performance and decreased one level for a ``substantial

noncompliance'' rating on the service test. 

In light of the comments received, the revised proposal would 
replace the investment test with the community development test as the primary 
test for wholesale or limited purpose institutions. A number of commenters 
considered the investment test too narrowly focused to use as a tool for 
assessing the CRA performance of wholesale or limited purpose institutions and 
suggested replacing the test with a test that focused on community development 
activities more generally. 

The community development test in the revised proposal would 
focus on a wholesale or limited purpose institution's record in helping to meet 
the credit needs of its service area through qualified investments, community 
development lending, and community development services. In general, these 
community development-related activities would be similar to the community 
development aspects of the lending and service tests, and would adopt the 
definition of qualified investments used in the investment test in the revised 
proposal. The community development test also would consider small business 
and small farm loans as well as loans to low- and moderate-income individuals 
and geographies as community development loans, whether or not reported or 
collected under the data collection requirements of the revised proposal. 

Several commenters believed the December proposal's definitions 
of wholesale or limited purpose institutions did not clearly distinguish between 
these types of institutions and retail institutions. Some commenters also 
suggested that these institutions be permitted to conduct a certain amount of 
incidental retail lending without losing their wholesale or limited purpose 
institution status. Several comments suggested that an institution should have 
the opportunity to confirm its status as a wholesale or limited purpose 
institution with the agencies in advance of being examined.

In response to these comments, the revised proposal would clarify 
which institutions would be considered wholesale or limited purpose institutions 
for purposes of CRA. The definition for institutions eligible for wholesale or 
limited purpose designation would be as follows: (1) wholesale institutions are 
institutions that are not in the business of extending home mortgage, small 
business, small farm, or consumer loans to retail customers; and (2) limited 
purpose institutions are institutions that offer only a narrow product line (such 
as credit cards or automobile loans) to a national or regional market. An 
institution would not be considered in the business of extending loans to retail 
customers if it does not hold itself out to the retail public as providing such 
loans and the institution's revenues from extending such loans are insignificant 
when compared to its overall lending operations. An institution could conduct 
some incidental retail lending if the retail activity would not cause the 
institution to exceed these limitations. However, a so-called ``niche institution'' 
(an institution that is in the business of lending to the public but which 
specializes in certain types of retail loans or extending credit to a class of 
borrowers with, for example, certain financial or professional characteristics) 
would not generally qualify as a wholesale or limited purpose institution. 
The revised proposal also would require an institution that elects to 
be evaluated as a wholesale or limited purpose institution to file a written 
request with the appropriate agency and receive confirmation of its status before 
the commencement of the examination. The agencies will issue guidelines 
regarding how long in advance of a scheduled examination an institution must 
file its request, and under what circumstances an institution will have to reapply 
to retain wholesale or limited purpose status. An institution whose request for 
wholesale or limited purpose status has been denied by the appropriate agency 
would be evaluated under the tests applicable to retail institutions, small 
institutions, or an institution with approved strategic plans, as appropriate. 

The OTS did not include provisions for wholesale or limited 
purpose thrifts in its version of the December proposal. In response to 
comments, the OTS's revised proposal includes provisions that would allow 
thrifts the opportunity to request designation as a wholesale or limited purpose 
institution. 



Small Institution Assessment Option 


The December proposal would have offered small banks and thrifts 
the option of choosing to be evaluated under a streamlined assessment method. 
The regulations would not have imposed upon small institutions the data 
collection requirements imposed on other institutions. The agencies stressed in 
the preamble to the December proposal that, notwithstanding the different 
assessment methods, examinations of small banks and thrifts would have been 
meaningful examinations and would not have been implemented as de facto 
exemptions. 

Small banks and thrifts were defined in the December proposal as 
independent institutions with assets of less than $250 million or members of 
holding companies the total banking and thrift assets of which are less than 
$250 million. A small institution's CRA rating under the December proposal 
would have been based primarily on its lending record. An institution would 
have been presumed to receive a ``satisfactory'' rating if it had a reasonable 
loan-to-deposit ratio, made the majority of its loans locally, had a good loan 
mix (i.e., made a variety of loans to the extent permitted by law and regulation 
and lent across economic levels), had no legitimate, bona-fide complaints from 
community members, had not committed an isolated act of illegal discrimination 
of which it had knowledge that it had not corrected fully or was not in the 
process of correcting fully, and had not engaged in a pattern or practice of 
illegal discrimination that it had not corrected fully. If an institution was 
required to report loans under the HMDA, the institution also would have been 
required to have a reasonable geographic distribution of reported loans.

A small institution that met each of the standards for a 
``satisfactory'' rating and exceeded some or all of those standards could have 
received an overall rating of ``outstanding'' depending on the degree to which it 
exceeded the criteria for a ``satisfactory'' rating and, at its option, its record of 
making qualified investments and its record of providing services. If a small 
institution failed to meet or exceed all of the standards for a ``satisfactory'' 
rating, the relevant agency would have conducted a more extensive examination 
of the institution, including, at the option of the institution, an examination of 
its investment and service performance. Also, if a small institution operated in 
more than one service area, the relevant agency would have evaluated the 
institution's performance in all of those service areas. 
Many community and consumer group commenters asked the 
agencies to eliminate the small institution assessment method because they 
believed that it would operate as an exemption for qualifying institutions. 
However, many banks and thrifts, as well as the weight of Congressional 
comments, supported the streamlined approach. The agencies have retained the 
streamlined assessment method as modified in the revised proposal. The 
agencies also have retained the December proposal's exemption of small 
institutions from the new data collection and reporting requirements for small 
business, small farm and community development loans, although the agencies 
have clarified that small institutions would not be subjected to those 
requirements because they request to be evaluated under the strategic plan 
assessment option. 
The agencies reiterate, however, that they do not intend by the 
proposal to exempt small institutions from the CRA or subject them to a less 
demanding standard of performance. The revised proposal has been redrafted 
so that the format of the small institution approach is more straightforward. 
The revised proposal first states the criteria that the agencies would use to 
assess the performance of a small institution, and then describes the 
performance levels that correspond to satisfactory performance. As under the 
tests for large retail institutions, the agencies have eliminated the structure of 
rebuttable presumptions and have proposed a rating profile. A small 
institution's performance need not fit every aspect of the rating profile 
describing ``satisfactory'' performance for it to receive that rating. 
Exceptionally strong performance on some aspects can compensate for weak 
performance on others provided the institution's overall performance is 
consistent with the rating profile. Small institutions that do not meet the 
standards for a ``satisfactory'' record would be given the appropriate rating 
without the necessity of a ``closer review.'' 
Some commenters expressed concern that under the December 
proposal an institution would be required to affirmatively elect to be examined 
under the streamlined assessment method and suggested that the streamlined 
method be the default examination procedure unless a qualifying institution 
elects another assessment method. The agencies agree and have drafted the 
revised proposal accordingly. 
Commenters representing holding companies and small institutions 
that are affiliates of holding companies with total banking and thrift assets over 
$250 million urged that the $250 million asset limit take into consideration only 
the assets of the subject bank or thrift and not the aggregate amount of bank 
and thrift assets held by the holding company or, alternatively, that the asset 
limit be raised. Many community and governmental groups, on the other hand, 
believed that the asset limit should be lowered. After considering all of the 
comments, the agencies have decided to retain the definition of small institution 
set forth in the December proposal. No compelling evidence was presented to 
support a change of the asset limit. Further, the revised proposal reflects the 
notion that the CRA performance of a small independent institution or small 
affiliate institution of a small holding company should be measured against 
different standards than a small institution affiliate of a larger holding company. 
The consideration of assessment context added in the revised proposal will 
permit the agencies to make this differentiation. The larger holding company 
could be expected to provide support and assistance to a degree not available to 
a small independent institution or to an affiliate institution of a small holding 
company.

Many commenters from small institutions criticized the presumption 
in the December proposal that a 60% loan-to-deposit ratio was reasonable. 
These commenters pointed out that economic conditions, institutional capacity 
and other constraints may result in loan-to-deposit ratios significantly below this 
figure. Although the agencies did not intend the December proposal to suggest 
that a loan-to-deposit ratio below 60% would have been presumed less than 
reasonable, the agencies have eliminated the use of any fixed percentage. 
Instead, the revised proposal would require that an institution's loan to deposit 
ratio, adjusted for seasonal variation and, as appropriate, other lending related 
activities, must be reasonable given the institution's size, financial condition, 
and the credit needs of its service area. The adjustment for lending related 
activities, such as secondary market sales and community development lending 
and investment, is new in the revised proposal. This provision responds to 
concerns that institutions that package and sell their loans would be 
disadvantaged, compared to portfolio lenders, by a strict loan-to-deposit ratio 
test. The proposed adjustment also addresses concerns raised by commenters 
that the small institution assessment method in the December proposal would 
have ignored the community development lending performance of small 
institutions. 
Many industry commenters also criticized the requirement in the 
December proposal that, to be presumed to be performing satisfactorily, an 
institution would have needed a good loan mix, which would have included 
offering, to the extent permitted by law, a variety of loans to customers across 
economic levels. These commenters were concerned that an institution would 
have been required to offer all permissible loan products to all customers. The 
agencies agree that the focus on the types of products offered was inconsistent 
with the tenor of the proposed regulation as a whole and have altered the 
criterion in the revised proposal to eliminate any requirement concerning the 
types of products that an institution offers. The revised proposal would retain 
the aspect of the criterion focussing on lending to customers across economic 
levels. 
In a related change, the revised proposal would broaden the 
criterion in the December proposal concerning the distribution of loans by 
institutions required to report loan data under HMDA. The revised proposal 
would explicitly provide that the agencies would consider the geographic 
distribution of loans of all small institutions, not just these subject to HMDA. 
The agencies believe this consideration was implicit in the December proposal, 
which required lending across economic levels. In any event, the agencies do 
not intend this change to result in any increased documentation burden on small 
institutions. The geographic analysis would be performed by the agencies' 
examiners and would not be required of the institutions. 

The agencies also received comments questioning the meaning of 
the criterion in the December proposal focussing on the complaint record of 
small institutions. Because of concerns by commenters that a ``legitimate, bona- 
fide complaint'' was not adequately defined, the agencies have now proposed a 
criterion that would focus on the institution's record of taking appropriate 
action, as warranted, in response to written complaints about its CRA 
performance. 

Many commenters expressed concern that the December proposal 
was unclear regarding the circumstances under which a small institution could 
have earned an ``outstanding'' or less than ``satisfactory'' rating. The changes in 
the revised proposal clarify and conform the treatment of small banks to the 
requirement proposed for large retail institutions_that lending performance 
must be ``satisfactory'' for an institution to receive an overall satisfactory rating. 
Under the revised proposal, the agencies would consider a small institution's 
investment and service performance in order to determine whether it is eligible 
for an ``outstanding'' rating. Strong investment or service performance could 
help boost a small institution's rating to the ``outstanding'' level. Poor 
investment or service performance would not lower a small institution's rating 
below ``satisfactory'' but could prevent the institution from receiving an 
``outstanding'' rating. The agencies would not consider investment and service 
performance to offset less than ``satisfactory'' performance by a small institution 
on the basic assessment criteria. 
The revised proposal also reflects minor changes to clarify the 
treatment of small institutions. The agencies have eliminated the criterion in 
the December proposal relating to discrimination because the issue is addressed 
in the section on the assignment of overall ratings. In addition, consistent with 
the changes in the proposal for large institutions, the discussion of the 
examination procedures for small institutions with multiple service areas has 
been eliminated.

Strategic Plan Assessment 


The December proposal would have provided that, as an alternative 
to being rated under the lending, service, and investment tests, or the small 
institution assessment standards, an institution could submit to its supervisory 
agency for approval a strategic plan detailing how the institution proposed to 
meet its CRA obligation. The December proposal would have required that the 
plan be submitted three months in advance of its effective date, and that the 
institution solicit public comment on the plan at the time the plan is submitted 
to the agency. No plan would have been approved unless it provided 
measurable goals for proposed performance and those goals constituted at least 
satisfactory performance under the standards of the regulation. No plan could 
have had a term beyond two years, and the institution could have petitioned the 
agency to amend the plan on the grounds that a material change of 
circumstances made the plan no longer appropriate. The agency would have 
assessed the CRA performance of the institution under the plan. If the 
institution failed to meet or exceed the preponderance of its goals, its 
performance would have been evaluated against the lending, service and 
investment tests or the small institution assessment method, as applicable. The 
preamble to the December proposal stated that an institution operating under an 
approved strategic plan would not be relieved of its obligation to report data 
under the regulation. 

The concerns regarding the strategic plan option most consistently 
raised by the comments were the December proposal's lack of details 
concerning important aspects of how the plan option would operate and the 
nature of public input into the process. The revised proposal would provide 
substantially more detail about the operation of the plan option than the 
December proposal, and would modify the December proposal in other respects 
as well. In the revised proposal, the agencies have attempted to provide a real 
alternative to the standard lending, investment, and service tests through the 
strategic plan option, while assuring that those operating under a plan are 
subject to a CRA assessment that is no less stringent and performance-based 
than the proposed standard tests. 
The revised proposal would substantially revise the provisions in 
the December proposal regarding public participation in the plan process. An 
institution would be required to informally seek suggestions from the public 
while developing the plan. Once the institution had developed the plan, the 
institution would be required to formally solicit public comment on the plan for 
at least 30 days. The agencies have decided not to extend the minimum 
comment period to avoid unduly lengthening the plan process. After the 
comment period, the institution would submit the plan to its regulator, along 
with any comments received, and, if the plan was revised in light of the 
comments received, the plan in the form released for public comment. Under 
the revised proposal, a submitted plan would be approved if the agency fails to 
act on the plan within 60 days after submission, unless the agency extended the 
review period for good cause. Until a plan was approved, an institution would 
be subject to the standard performance tests. 
These changes would increase the opportunity for productive 
community input in the plan process. By requiring an institution to seek 
informal suggestions in formulating a plan, and then to solicit formal comment 
before submitting a plan to the agency, this process will encourage consultation 
between an institution and its community, including local government, 
community leaders, and the public. There would not be a further comment 
period after the institution submits its proposed plan to the agency because such 
a comment period could undermine the direct communication and consultation 
between an institution and its community that is most beneficial to the process. 
The revised proposal would provide that, in evaluating a plan, the agency 
would consider the public's involvement in formulating the plan and any 
response by the institution to public comment on the plan. 
Several comments appeared to misunderstand why the strategic plan 
would provide for input from the public. The plan option would provide 
institutions an opportunity to tailor their CRA objectives to the needs of their 
community and their capacity and expertise. Few comments suggested that an 
institution would be able to determine the needs of its community without 
consulting in some fashion with those in the community. Several industry 
comments were concerned that under the strategic plan option, community 
organizations would play an inappropriate role in an institution's operations. 
However, the purpose of the consultation would be for the institution to develop 
information about the needs of its community and how they might be met so 
that it can make better judgments when formulating its plan objectives. The 
decision regarding how the institution is to meet those needs would remain with 
the institution. In reviewing the public participation, the agencies would not 
consider whether community organizations unanimously supported the plan, but 
whether the institution made an appropriate investigation to determine the needs 
of its community, and whether, considering the information about community 
credit needs that the institution received in the comments, the plan goals are 
appropriate. The agencies would evaluate strategic plans and their proposed 
measurable goals in the assessment context against which the tests and standards 
of the proposed regulation would be applied.

The revised proposal also would provide significantly more 
guidance regarding the standards for approval of a plan. Commenters on the 
December proposal were divided over the standards for approval. Some 
commenters thought the regulation should state that the standards for approval 
of a plan are the same as the standards on the lending, service, and investment 
tests, or that the plan should require no less lending than the lending test. In 
contrast, some industry commenters thought that the plan would not provide a 
real alternative unless it permitted an institution to depart from the standard 
tests in responding to local needs. Under the revised proposal, a plan would 
have to specify measurable goals for helping to meet the credit needs of the 
institution's service area, particularly the needs of low- and moderate-income 
geographies and low- and moderate-income individuals. These goals would 
have to reflect the institution's capacity and constraints, product offerings, and 
business strategy. 
The revised proposal would require that the plan specify 
measurable goals in lending, investment, and the provision of services, as 
appropriate to the circumstances. The proposal would specify the broad criteria 
in lending, investment, and services that should be the framework for the plan 
goals. At the same time, however, the proposal would make clear that an 
institution has great flexibility to fashion its program within those parameters. 
An institution would not be required to set levels of performance in all three 
categories. In order to maintain the focus on lending for retail institutions 
operating under a plan, a retail institution's goals would have to emphasize 
lending and lending-related activities, unless a different emphasis were 
appropriate given the credit needs of the service area, public comment, and the 
institution's capacity and constraints. 
The agencies intend through these provisions to provide guidance to 
the industry and the community regarding the standards for plan approval, 
while preserving substantial flexibility for institutions to tailor their CRA 
programs. The purpose of the plan is not to provide institutions operating 
under a plan with a different or lesser obligation to help meet the needs of their 
community; it is to provide more certainty and flexibility for those institutions 
that wish to meet their obligation in a fashion that they believe may not be 
appropriately assessed by the standard performance tests. 

The revised proposal would require that each plan specify 
measurable goals, the satisfaction of which, the institution believes, would 
warrant a ``satisfactory'' rating. An institution also would have the option of 
identifying a separate set of goals that, if met, would warrant an ``outstanding'' 
rating. An institution would not be considered for a rating of outstanding 
unless its plan contained outstanding goals that had been approved by the 
relevant agency. 

The revised proposal also would clarify how performance would be 
assessed under the plan. The agencies believe that the standard of performance 
in the December proposal should be strengthened, and the revised proposal 
would require an institution to substantially achieve its plan goals to receive that 
rating. This would apply to the satisfactory rating and, if the plan contained 
such approved goals, to the outstanding rating. 

Some commenters believed that the possibility of being considered 
under the standard tests, as contemplated by the December proposal, made the 
plan a less attractive alternative to the standard tests. The revised proposal 
would, unless the institution chose otherwise, rate an institution's performance 
under an approved plan solely in relation to its plan goals. An institution would 
have the option, however, to elect in its plan to be subject to the standard tests 
should its performance under the plan goals be less than satisfactory. The 
agencies intend that an institution operating under an approved plan would, 
during the period of the plan, never be subject to assessment under the standard 
tests, unless the institution so chose. 
In response to industry comments that said the two year plan term 
in the December proposal was too short to warrant the expense of preparing a 
plan and to permit institutions to initiate activities with a longer view, the 
agencies have lengthened the possible plan term to 5 years, but would require 
the plan to have annual interim measurable goals. The agencies agree that it is 
beneficial to provide institutions the opportunity for long-range planning, and 
the interim goals should enable effective examinations during the plan period. 
The proposal also would permit an institution to develop a single plan for one 
or more or all of its service areas and allow affiliated institutions to prepare 
joint plans.

A number of industry commenters indicated that the possibility of public disclosure of confidential information
presented a major disincentive to their use of the strategic plan alternative. The revised proposal would allow institutions
to submit additional information to the relevant agency on a confidential basis. However, the publicly available
information would have to be sufficiently specific to enable the public and the agency to judge fairly the merits of
the plan's goals. 

The revised proposal also would provide more detail regarding plan amendment. An institution would be able to petition
for an amendment on the grounds that a material change in circumstances had made the plan no longer appropriate. In
order to preserve the integrity of the public participation in the plan process, any proposed amendment would have
to go through the public consultation and comment process described earlier in this preamble. 

Despite industry comments to the contrary, the revised proposal continues to provide that approval of a plan would
not affect an institution's data collection responsibilities. The data are useful to the agencies in assessing overall
lending in communities, and would also be of value to the public. Since the institution's plan would be in its public
file, the public would have the appropriate context in which to evaluate the lending data. 

The revised proposal also clarifies that evidence of discrimination would affect an institution's rating based
on plan performance in the same manner as such evidence would affect an institution's rating calculated pursuant
to the standard tests. 



Assigned Ratings 



Under the December proposal, institutions would have been assigned one of four overall, or composite, ratings, as
required by the statute: ``outstanding'', ``satisfactory'', ``needs to improve'', and ``substantial noncompliance''.
In the December proposal, ratings on the lending, investment, and service test were combined into a composite rating.
For a retail institution, the institution's rating under the lending test would have served as the base rating. This
base rating would then have been increased by two levels in the case of outstanding investment performance or by one
level in the case of high satisfactory investment performance. For a wholesale or limited-purpose institution,
the institution's rating under the investment test would have served as the basis for the overall rating. For any institution,
the rating would have been increased by one level in the case of an ``outstanding'' rating for service and decreased
by one level in the case of a ``substantial non-compliance'' rating for service. 

Because the lending, service and investment tests had five rating levels rather than four, the rating would then have
been converted to the statutorily-required four level rating system, with ``high satisfactory'' and ``low satisfactory''
both scored as ``satisfactory''. An institution that would otherwise have received a ``needs to improve'' rating
would have been rated in ``substantial noncompliance'' if the institution received no better than a ``needs to improve''
rating on each of its two previous examinations. Finally, the rating would have been adjusted to take into account
any illegal lending discrimination by the institution to arrive at a final composite rating. 

Many commenters, particularly community and consumer groups, were concerned that the rating system proposed in
December permitted a retail institution with poor lending performance to achieve a satisfactory or outstanding
overall rating through outstanding performance on the investment and service tests. These commenters asked that
no retail institution be permitted to achieve a satisfactory overall rating unless it received a satisfactory rating
on the lending test. The revised proposal would ensure that lending performance receives sufficient weight by weighing
a retail institution's rating on the lending test so as to count for at least 50 percent of its overall rating. Furthermore,
a retail institution would be required to achieve a rating of satisfactory on the lending test in order to receive an
overall rating of satisfactory. 

Some commenters were concerned that investment and service performance only affected an institution's overall
rating at the margins_if investment or service performance was extraordinarily strong or weak. The revised proposal
would allow investment and service performance to boost an institution's rating provided the institution had achieved
a rating of satisfactory on the lending test. Poor performance on either the investment or service test could negatively
affect an institution's overall performance.

These principles would be implemented through the process described in paragraph (b) of Appendix A for assigning
a rating for retail institutions assessed under the lending, service and investment tests. Points would be assigned
to an institution's performance on each of the underlying tests. The total number of points would determine the composite
rating, unless the total exceeds twice the number of points attributable to the institution's performance under
the lending test. In that case, the composite rating would be determined using twice the number of points attributable
to the institution's lending performance to ensure that lending performance accounts for at least 50 percent of the
overall rating. 

Small institutions, wholesale or limited purpose institutions, or institutions with an approved strategic plan
would be rated as described in paragraphs (c) through (e) of Appendix A. 

As in the December proposal, the revised proposal would require the agencies to adjust ratings for all institutions,
regardless of the method of CRA evaluation, to take evidence of discrimination or other illegal credit practices
into consideration. In addition, the revised proposal, as in December's proposal, provides that an institution
that otherwise would receive a needs to improve rating would be rated in substantial noncompliance if it received
no better than a needs to improve rating on each of its two previous examinations. 



Lending Discrimination 



Under the December proposal, an institution would presumptively have received a final CRA rating of less than satisfactory
if the institution (1) committed an isolated act of illegal discrimination of which it had knowledge that it had not
corrected fully or was not in the process of correcting fully or (2) engaged in a pattern or practice of illegal discrimination
that it had not corrected fully. The presumption could have been rebutted in the case of technical or de minimis violations,
for example, if an institution violated the Equal Credit Opportunity Act by offering a preferential credit program
for individuals over age 55 (rather than limiting the program to individuals over age 62 as the law requires). 

Many community and consumer groups criticized this proposal as a retreat from current practice. They pointed out
that the existing regulation provides that the agencies will consider any evidence of discriminatory or other illegal
credit practices. Although the agencies did not intend in the December proposal to reduce the weight given evidence
of illegal discrimination in the CRA evaluation process, they believe that the commenters' concerns should be addressed.
The revised proposal conforms with the language of the existing regulation. Also, the discrimination provisions
in the revised proposal would avoid the use of a rebuttable presumption consistent with the elimination of presumptions
throughout the proposal. 

Under the revised proposal, any evidence of discriminatory or other illegal credit practices would adversely affect
the agencies' evaluation of an institution's CRA rating. In determining the effect on an institution's rating, the
agencies would consider the nature and extent of the evidence, the policies and procedures that the institution has
in place to prevent discriminatory or other illegal credit practices, any corrective action that the institution
has taken or has committed to take, particularly voluntary corrective action resulting from self-assessment, and
other relevant information, such as the institution's past fair lending performance. 

There was also some confusion regarding whether the December proposal intended that illegal discrimination would
have the same effect for all institutions regardless of the assessment method that they chose. The revised proposal
makes clear that evidence of discrimination would be considered in assigning a rating to all banks and thrifts, regardless
of whether they were evaluated under the lending, service, and investment tests, the community development test
for wholesale or limited purpose banks, the small institution assessment method, or the strategic plan option.

Multiple Service Areas 



The preamble to the December proposal stated that an institution's CRA rating should reflect its performance in all
the local communities in which it does business. However, the proposed regulatory language provided that the agencies
would conduct full lending, service, and investment tests (or the other appropriate assessments) in a sample of the
service areas in which the institution operated. The agencies would then assign separate composite ratings for each
area. The institution's overall rating would reflect the performance of the institution in all service areas studied.


Some commenters urged the agencies to conduct assessments in every one of an institution's service areas, because
every institution has an obligation to help meet the credit needs of all of its service areas. These commenters and
others also expressed concern that the regulation did not provide clear rules as to how performance in each of the service
areas assessed would be combined to arrive at an overall rating for the institution. 

An institution is obligated to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including all of the institution's
service areas. However, ensuring that institutions fulfill this responsibility does not necessarily require that
an institution's performance in each of its service areas must be examined. Questions of how many service areas should
be examined during an examination and how performance in different service areas should be weighed are more appropriately
handled through examination procedures than through regulatory language. The agencies have therefore omitted
from the revised proposal all discussion of examination treatment of multiple service areas. 

The agencies note that the Interstate Banking Efficiency Act would establish requirements for the examination of
multi-state and other institutions. This proposal and examination procedures will be modified as necessary to comply
with that Act if it becomes law. 



Effect of Ratings on Applications 



The CRA requires the agencies to consider an institution's CRA performance record when considering an application
by the institution to establish a deposit facility (

e.g.

, branch). The December proposal specified how CRA ratings would be considered in applications. For example, an application
from an institution with a ``substantial noncompliance'' CRA rating would have generally been denied, whereas an
application from an institution with an ``outstanding'' rating would have been given extra weight. A ``satisfactory''
rating generally would have been consistent with approval of an application and a ``needs to improve'' rating, absent
other evidence, generally would have resulted in a denial or conditional approval of an application. The agencies
emphasized, however, that the CRA examination rating is not conclusive and recognized that other information related
to CRA performance and the convenience and needs of communities, including information collected through public
comment and reports, is also relevant and would be considered. 

Although not intended as such, a number of the commenters believed these provisions would have provided institutions
with a ``safe harbor'' from challenges to their performance record in the applications process if they achieved an
``outstanding'' CRA examination rating. Those commenters were concerned that they could be prevented from effectively
commenting on the CRA performance aspects relevant to applications and urged that those provisions be dropped. 

The discussion of the effect of particular ratings on applications in the December proposal was not intended to alter
the agencies' policy of considering examination ratings and public comment during the applications process and
has been deleted. As stated in the December proposal, the agencies have consistently recognized that materials relating
to CRA performance received during the applications process from public comments and other sources, can and do provide
relevant and valuable information. The revised proposal explicitly states that interested parties would have the
opportunity to comment on applications and that the agencies would take their views into account in considering the
CRA performance of an institution in the applications process. The agencies continue to believe, as provided in the
Interagency Policy Statement Regarding the Community Reinvestment Act, that information from an examination is
a particularly important consideration in the applications process because it represents the on-site evaluation
of an institution's CRA performance by its primary federal regulator. The revised proposal also would specify that
an institution's record of CRA performance would be considered in an institution's expansion proposals (as defined
in the CRA) and may be the basis for approving, denying, or conditioning approval of an application.

Definition of Service Area 



The December proposal would have replaced the concept of ``delineated community'' in the existing regulation with
the concept of service area. The December proposal would have defined service area as the area around each institution's
office or group of offices where the preponderance of direct reportable loans made through those offices are located.
A service area would have been presumed acceptable if it was broad enough to include low- and moderate-income geographies
and did not arbitrarily exclude such geographies. An institution had the opportunity to show there were no low- and
moderate-income geographies within a reasonable distance given its size and financial condition, and the supervisory
agency could reject an otherwise acceptable service area if the service area did not account for the true effective
lending territory of the institution or if it reflected past redlining or illegal discrimination. The proposal would
have required an institution to delineate multiple service areas if the geographies it served extended substantially
across state boundaries or the boundaries of a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). An institution serving military
customers would have been permitted to delineate a ``military community'' consisting of those customers. Each institution
would also have been required to compile and maintain a list of all the geographies within its service area or areas
and a map of each service area. The December proposal would not have required wholesale or limited purpose institutions
to delineate a service area, but would have treated all low- and moderate-income geographies in the country as the
service area for wholesale or limited purpose institutions. 

As a result of numerous comments received on this issue, the revised proposal makes several changes to the definition.
Several commenters suggested that the proposed regulation adopt concepts from the existing regulation, including
the equidistance provision that requires an institution to include those areas around its offices where it makes
a substantial portion of its loans and all other areas equidistant from its offices as those areas. The revised proposal
would adopt the equidistance principle from the current regulation in slightly modified form. The equidistance
requirement is an effective tool to assure that the delineation of a service area is consistent with the purposes of
the statute and that institutions do not draw their service areas too narrowly. This modification clarifies the service
area requirement and builds on concepts with which the industry and community already have experience. This change
does not significantly modify the substance of the December proposal, since the December proposal preamble stated
that a service area conforming to the equidistance concept would generally have been acceptable. 

The revised proposal also incorporates the concept of ``local area'' from the current regulation. This responds
to comments expressing concern that loans made a substantial distance from a branch might inappropriately expand
the scope of a service area. 

The revised proposal would delete the requirement that a service area be broad enough to include low- and moderate-income
areas. The necessity for this requirement was unclear, given the provision preventing institutions from arbitrarily
excluding low- and moderate-income geographies. The proposal would clarify that the requirement that low- or moderate-income
geographies not be arbitrarily excluded would take into account the institution's size, financial condition, and
the extent of its branching network. An institution's performance evaluation would include an account of how many
low- and moderate-income geographies are included in the institution's service area(s). 

The revised proposal would clarify that an institution's service area is derived from its direct lending in relation
to its branches and proprietary deposit-taking ATMs, rather than its other non-deposit-taking offices. This appropriately
links an institution's CRA obligations to where it takes deposits, while enabling the agencies to review whether
the institution is serving the needs of its entire community in the manner in which it extends credit. 

Industry commenters were particularly concerned that the December proposal meant that lending conducted by non-branch
offices, such as loan production offices, would expand an institution's service area. The revised proposal would
not require an institution to include geographies where an institution has made loans through a loan production office,
unless those geographies are in the local area around a deposit-taking branch or ATM. However, an institution would
be free to include such geographies if it wishes, and the regulation would provide some incentive to do so. Under the
revised proposal, if an agency determined that lending by an institution's affiliate(s) was integral to the business
of the institution, then it would include the lending by that affiliate in its assessment of the institution's lending
performance, even if the institution had not requested the agency to do so. In addition, by limiting the size of its
service area, an institution would increase the likelihood that it would perform poorly on the criterion of the lending
test that considers the proportion of the institution's total lending in its service area(s).

Rather than requiring the service area to include those geographies accounting for a ``preponderance'' of the institution's
loans, as in the December proposal, or the areas accounting for a ``substantial portion'' of the institution's loans,
as in the existing regulation, the revised proposal would require the service area to include those geographies in
which the institution has made ``a significant number and amount of loans.'' The agencies intend the meaning of ``significant''
to be broad, and to include all geographies around its branches and proprietary deposit-taking ATMs where an institution
has made more than a handful of loans. Because of this change in the proposal, the criterion in the small institution
assessment method that requires a majority of an institution's loans to be in its service area(s) for a satisfactory
rating would not be redundant as it might have been in the December proposal.

Under the revised proposal, as in the December proposal, the agencies would consider whether the delineation reflects
illegal discrimination, and thus would, as some commenters suggested, consider the racial composition of geographies
in reviewing an institution's delineation. The agencies have eliminated the term ``redlining'' because the agencies
believe that term is included in the term ``illegal discrimination.'' In this regard, illegal discrimination includes
the practice of refusing to lend to an area or neighborhood on the basis of race or other prohibited bases.

Some commenters thought that the agencies should require institutions to justify the methodology for delineations,
and that the regulation expressly provide for community input into the delineation. Under the revised proposal,
examiners would review whether the service area meets the requirements of the regulation, but the agencies would
not prescribe or review the method by which an institution defines its service area. Rather than having the agencies
determine whether a delineation is ``reasonable,'' it is simpler and more effective in meeting the purposes of the
statute to focus on the lending patterns of the institution, whether low- and moderate income areas are excluded,
and whether the service area reflects illegal discrimination. Furthermore, the revised proposal would not expressly
provide for community input into the delineation. As part of the assessment context, agency staff would review comments
from the community with regard to the performance of an institution, including its delineation of its service area(s).

The revised proposal would retain the requirement from the December proposal that institutions delineate multiple
service areas, with clarifying modifications. The revised proposal would not require institutions to delineate
an MSA or other political boundary. The requirements that would govern under the revised proposal should prevent
institutions from inappropriately limiting their service area(s) in order to exclude certain geographies.

Some commenters suggested requiring the service area to include full census tracts and block numbering areas to facilitate
data collection and reporting. The agencies agree, and the revised proposal would contain such a requirement.

While comments generally supported the separate treatment of wholesale or limited purpose institutions, many commenters
questioned whether wholesale or limited purpose institutions should have nationwide service areas and suggested
that more consideration should be given to qualified investments in the institution's local area. Some commenters
claimed that permitting wholesale banks to define a ``national community'' violated the ``local community'' orientation
of the statute. The revised proposal would eliminate a mandatory nationwide service area for wholesale or limited
purpose institutions. Such institutions have chosen to locate in particular communities, and it is appropriate
that their CRA performance reflect their location. The revised proposal would therefore require that a wholesale
or limited purpose institution designate as its service area the area or areas around its offices, or a broader statewide
or regional area that includes such areas. The institution would have a broad scope in preparing this designation,
so long as the area meets the purposes of the CRA and does not arbitrarily exclude low and moderate income geographies.
Performance under the community development test would focus on qualified investments, community development
loans outstanding and community development services that benefit the areas within the institution's service area.
Qualifying activities that benefit areas outside the institution's service area would be considered up to an amount
equal to the amount of qualifying activities within the institution's service area. However, if the institution
could demonstrate only a limited need or opportunity to provide qualifying activities within its service area, the
appropriate agency could modify or eliminate this limitation.

Data Collection and Reporting



The December proposal would have required institutions that were not eligible for the small institution streamlined
assessment method to collect and report to the agencies data showing the geographic distribution of written applications,
application denials, originations and purchases for home mortgage, small business and small farm, and consumer
loans. Home mortgage loans would have included all mortgage loans reportable under HMDA and its implementing regulations.
The proposal would have required institutions to report separately information covering loans for home purchase,
home improvement, multifamily dwellings, and refinancings. Small business loans would have included all loans
to private, for-profit organizations that in the fiscal year preceding the making of the loan had gross receipts of
less than $10 million (for a firm providing services), or up to 500 employees (for a manufacturing firm). As proposed,
institutions would have had to separate such loans into in four categories based on the sales volume of the business.
Small farm loans would have been defined to include all loans to private organizations engaged in farming operations
with gross receipts of less than $500,000 in the fiscal year preceding the making of the loan. Consumer loans would
have been defined to include all closed-end loans, secured and unsecured, extended to a natural person primarily
for personal, family, or household purposes, except for credit card loans and motorized vehicle loans and those loans
included in the definition of home mortgage loans.

The December proposal would also have required institutions to report data in summary form by geography for each of
the three major loan categories_mortgages, small businesses and small farms, and consumer_by January 31 of each
calendar year. The data would have covered the related lending activity that took place in the preceding calendar
year.

Some commenters raised general concerns regarding the data collection requirements in the December proposal. As
discussed later in this preamble, the agencies have streamlined requirements to reduce burden. In addition, the
agencies plan to make software available to institutions to facilitate compliance with the proposed requirements.
The agencies have proposed the data collection and reporting requirements in this revised proposal as a means for
permitting the agencies to fulfill their responsibilities under the CRA of assessing each institution's record
of helping to meet the credit needs of the community. This proposal has also been made to permit the agencies to discuss
the facts supporting the agencies' conclusions regarding the institution's record of lending.

The comments on the proposed data collection raised five principal concerns, all of which have been addressed in the
revised proposal. First, many commenters indicated that the proposed rules would be overly burdensome and, in the
case of home mortgage loans, would have required duplicative tracking of data. Under the revised proposal, the agencies
would base their analysis of mortgage lending on the data already reported pursuant to HMDA. To acquire more geographic
detail on home mortgage lending, the agencies propose to amend the HMDA regulation to require that institutions other
than small banks and thrifts report the geography of applications, approvals, and denials for loans secured by properties
outside the institution's MSA, data that is already reported on a voluntary basis.

Second, some commenters questioned whether the need for consumer loan data justified the burden of mandatory reporting.
However, many of the same commenters suggested that if consumer loan data were to be required, the data should include
all consumer loans, including credit card loans and motor vehicle loans, which were not included in the collection
and reporting requirements of the December proposal. Some institutions indicated that consumer lending was an important
aspect of their CRA performance that should be considered by the agencies. The revised proposal would offer institutions
the option of collecting data on the amount outstanding, the location of the borrower, and the income of the borrower
for each open-end and closed-end consumer loan outstanding as of the end of the calendar year. Such data is typically
required by all institutions as an integral part of their loan underwriting procedures. If an institution selected
this option, the foregoing data would be reviewed during the institution's CRA examination but would not be reported
to the agencies.

Third, many lenders criticized the December proposal's inclusion of information on small business applications
and application denials. Those commenters indicated that reporting should be limited to loan outstandings or loan
originations. The revised proposal would simplify the definition of small business and small farm loans, by adopting
the definition of those terms now used by institutions for purposes of completing, in the case of banks, their Reports
of Condition and Income (Call Reports), and in the case of thrifts, the Thrift Financial Report (TFR). Under the revised
proposal, institutions would collect and report data on a loan-by-loan basis for all loans included in the aggregate
small business and small farm loan figures on the institution's Call Report or TFR, which includes business loans
with original amounts under $1 million and farm loans with original amounts under $500,000. These data would include
the outstanding balance as of December 31 of each year, the location of the business or farm or the location where the
loan proceeds would be applied (as indicated by the borrower), an indication of whether the borrower has annual revenues
of less than or equal to $1 million, and an indication of whether the borrower (if not publicly traded) is more than 50
percent owned by one or more minority individuals or by one or more women. The loan register information would be required
to be submitted at the same time and in accordance with the provisions for submitting HMDA data as provided in 12 CFR
Part 203 (Regulation C). In addition, the revised proposal would change the date on which Call Report or TFR data on
small business and small farms loans would be required to be submitted from June 30 to December 31 of each year to coincide
with the calendar year reporting requirements of HMDA.

Fourth, many commenters criticized the failure of the December proposal to require the collection of data on the race
and gender of borrowers except to the extent such data was required by current law. These commenters were particularly
interested in the reporting of race and gender data for small business loans in order to support the fair lending component
of the CRA assessment. In response to these comments, the revised proposal would require institutions to collect
certain race and gender data in connection with their small business and small farm lending. Each institution would
be required to request, either in connection with a written application or, if the institution did not use written
applications, at an appropriate point in the lending process, that an applicant or borrower indicate the percentage
of the business or farm owned by men and by women as well as the percentages owned by members of different racial and ethnic
categories. If the institution neither takes a written application nor originates the loan, the institution would
not be required to request the information. To protect the privacy of individual borrowers, this detailed information
would not be included on loan registers, which, as noted earlier in this preamble, would only indicate whether an individual
loan was to a business or farm that was more than 50 percent women-owned or more than 50 percent minority-owned. The
institution would also retain but not report or disclose the information on applicants who did not receive a loan.
To further safeguard privacy, the loan registers would not be disclosed to the public but the institutions would include
aggregate information about the loans in their public CRA files.

Finally, some commenters were concerned that because community development loans were not required to be reported,
examiners would not give them sufficient weight in evaluating an institution's lending performance. The revised
proposal would require institutions to report on their Call Reports and TFRs the aggregate number and dollar amount
of community development loans outstanding as of December 31 of each year.



Public File and Disclosure



The December proposal would have required institutions to make available for public inspection: (1) a file containing
all the signed, written comments that it had received from the public for the past two years; (2) its performance data
for that period; (3) maps of its service areas (with lists of the census tracts or block numbering areas that make up
each service area); and (4) a copy of the public section of its most recent CRA Performance Evaluation. If an institution
elected to be assessed under the strategic plan option, it would have been required to include a copy of its plan in the
public file. The December proposal would have required the institution to maintain the public file at its main office
and to make available copies of the file at cost to members of the public. Materials relating to a given service area
would have been maintained at each branch in that service area, and every institution would have been required to post
in the public lobby of each branch a notice of its CRA obligation and the public's opportunity to comment on and review
data concerning that performance.

Commenters generally favored the public disclosure of an institution's CRA-related activities, and the revised
proposal retains all the relevant public disclosure provisions of the December proposal. The revised proposal modifies
the required contents of the public file to reflect proposed changes in the various assessment tests and the proposed
data collection requirements for small business and small farm loans. For example, consistent with the proposed
service test, the revised proposal would require an institution to maintain a list of its branches and ATMs along with
their locations and the services generally available at such facilities.

To protect the privacy of borrowers and the competitive information of institutions, the revised proposal would
not require an institution to include the small business or small farm loan registers containing information on individual
applicants in its public file. Instead, the revised proposal would require the public disclosure of aggregated information
on small business and small farm loans for the past two calendar years by every institution (other than a small institution).
Loan registers would be available to agency examiners to confirm the accuracy of the aggregated data but the agencies
do not intend to make unaggregated information publicly available.

Under the revised proposal, the following aggregated loan data for small business and small farm loans would be placed
in the public file: (1) the number and amount of loans in low-,


moderate-, middle-, and upper-income geographies; (2) a list of the geographies in which an institution made at least
one loan; (3) the number and amount of loans inside and outside the institution's service area; (4) the number and amount
of loans to minority- and women-owned businesses; and (5) the number and amount of loans to businesses and farms with
annual revenues equal to or less than $1 million. Institutions would also be required to disclose the number and amount
of community development loans outstanding. Institutions may elect to disclose publicly the number and amount of
consumer loans to individuals and geographies by various income levels, and the number and amount of these loans made
within and outside its service area(s). However, to protect the privacy interests of borrowers, an institution may
not place in its public file any loan information described above for a particular year if special circumstances,
such as a small number of loans or a limited number of geographies in the designated categories, could reasonably be
expected to disclose the borrower's identity.



A small institution would be required to include its loan-to-deposit ratio computed at the end of the most recent calendar
year. The institution could include other data on its loan-to-deposit ratio if it believed the data would give a more
accurate picture of its lending and lending-related activities. If a small institution elects to be rated under the
lending, investment, and service tests applicable to larger institutions, it would be required to include in its
public file all of the lending information described earlier in this preamble. An institution electing to be assessed
under an approved plan would continue to provide a copy of its plan in the public file but would not have to disclose information
submitted to the agencies on a confidential basis.

In response to comments, the agencies have modified the provisions regarding the location of the public file. The
complete public file would be required to be maintained at the institution's main office. In addition, at least one
branch in each service area would be required to have copies of the bank's HMDA Disclosure Statements and all materials
in the public file relating to the service area in which the branch is located. If a member of the public requested to
review a bank's public file at a branch that did not have a copy, the bank would have to make a complete copy of the file
for that service area available for review at the branch within 5 business days at no cost.



Public Notice



The December proposal would have required that institutions provide the Community Reinvestment Act Notice ``in
the public lobby of its head office and each branch,'' and it would have set forth the Notice. The revised proposal makes
minor changes to the Notice requirements. The term ``head office'' is changed to ``main office'' for clarity. Within
the Notice, the statement of what is included in the CRA performance file would be expanded to describe more accurately
the contents of the file. In addition, the revised proposal would require that the file include a map identifying the
institution's service area, a list of its branches and ATMs in its service area, and a list of services the institution
provides at each of the foregoing locations.



Publication of Examination Schedule



The December proposal would have required that each agency publish a list of the banks scheduled for CRA exams in each
calendar quarter at least 30 days before the beginning of the quarter, and permitted members of the public to submit
comments about a bank's CRA performance. The revised proposal would leave intact the provision concerning timing
of publication, but delete as redundant the provision concerning public comment.

Transition 


The December proposal would have established a transition period 
from July 1, 1994, to April 1, 1996. Institutions subject to data collection and 
reporting requirements would have been required to begin collecting home 
mortgage, small business, and consumer loan data on July 1, 1994. The data 
would have been reported to the agencies no later than January 31, 1995, and 
annually thereafter. Evaluations under the proposed standards would have 
begun April 1, 1995. However, any institution could have elected to be 
evaluated under the existing twelve assessment factors rather than the proposed 
standards until July 1, 1995, and any institution showing cause could have 
requested evaluation under the existing standards up to April 1, 1996. The 
agencies would have accepted strategic plans for approval at any time after the 
publication of the final rule. 


The December proposal, in addition, would have insulated some 
institutions from supervisory sanctions until they had been subject to at least 
two examinations under the proposed standards. Specifically, the agencies 
would not have disapproved corporate applications or taken any enforcement 
action against an institution whose initial CRA rating under the proposed 
standards dropped by more than one level, if the agencies determined that the 
drop in ratings occurred despite a good faith effort to achieve at least a 
satisfactory level of performance. 
Many of the commenters criticized the transition period in the 
December proposal for being too short. Those commenters were particularly 
critical of the proposal to begin collection of data on July 1, 1994. Several 
commenters suggested that the proposed data collection be delayed as much as 
12 months after the publication of a final rule. Some also criticized the 
proposal to begin conducting examinations in 1995 using a partial year's data 
from the second half of 1994. 
Other commenters criticized the proposal to insulate certain 
institutions from supervisory actions until they had gained more experience with 
the proposed standards. Those commenters were generally concerned that the 
proposal would have protected institutions whose performance ratings would 
have suffered as a result of more objective, performance-based assessments.

In developing the revised proposal, the agencies sought to address 
these concerns in two principal ways. First, despite substantial simplification in 
data collection compared to the December proposal, the revised proposal would 
provide institutions additional time before the data collection would begin. 
Under the revised proposal, collection of new data elements would not be 
required until July 1, 1995. 
Second, compared to the December proposal, the revised proposal 
eliminates the grace period and instead would provide institutions with 
additional time before assessments under the proposed standards would become 
mandatory. 
The revised proposal would also provide institutions with 
assessment options prior to full implementation of the rule. Even though 
assessments under the proposed standards would not be mandatory until 
July 1, 1996, small institutions would have the opportunity to be examined, at 
their option, under the small bank assessment method anytime after 
July 1, 1995. Anytime on or after July 1, 1995, an institution could also elect 
to submit for approval a strategic plan to achieve satisfactory or better CRA 
performance. Examinations under approved strategic plans could begin 
July 1, 1996. 
Under the proposed transition schedule, the current regulation 
would be repealed in its entirety on July 1, 1996. 


Review 


The agencies recognize that the revised proposal, like the 
December proposal, represents a significant change in existing practices and 
that cautious administration is therefore required. Consultation by financial 
institutions with the agencies on compliance with the new standards and 
procedures will be encouraged, as will liberal use of agency appeals processes. 
The supervisory agencies will engage in an internal review of the effectiveness 
of the new regulations. The agencies contemplate reconsideration of the 
regulations to improve their effectiveness within the next several years. The 
agencies intend for the proposed regulations to require demonstrated 
performance but to impose as little unnecessary compliance burden as possible, 
and the agencies will review the regulations to determine whether they are 
advancing these goals. 


Other Efforts 


In addition to this rulemaking, the agencies will work together to 
improve examiner training and to increase interagency coordination regarding 
application of standards, performance of examinations, assignment of ratings, 
and use of enforcement tools. The agencies will work together to make 
examinations as short in duration as possible, to minimize unnecessary 
compliance burden, and to ensure consistency and reliability in the rating 
process. 


Benefit and Burden of Administrative Compliance Requirements 


With respect to the reporting, disclosure, and other administrative 
compliance requirements in the proposal, the agencies invite comment on 
(1) any administrative burdens that these requirements in the revised proposal 
would place on depository institutions, including small depository institutions 
and customers of depository institutions; and (2) the benefits of these 
requirements in the revised proposal for depository institutions, their customers, 
and their communities.

Regulatory Flexibility Act





OCC:

 It is hereby certified that this proposed rule, if adopted as a final rule, will not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small banks. Accordingly, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required. This proposal
would enable most small banks to avoid the data collection requirements in 12 CFR Part 25 and will encourage greater
small business lending by banks of all sizes.



Board:

 For all the reasons discussed in the joint preamble, it is hereby certified that this proposed rule, if adopted as a
final rule, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small banks. This proposal would
enable most small banks to avoid the data collection requirements in 12 CFR Part 228 and will encourage greater small
business lending by financial institutions of all sizes. Accordingly, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not
required. The Board invites comment on this matter.



FDIC:

 It is hereby certified that this proposed rule, if adopted as a final rule, will not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small banks. This proposal would enable most small banks to avoid the data collection requirements
in 12 CFR Part 345 and will encourage greater small business lending by financial institutions of all sizes. Accordingly,
a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required.



OTS:

 It is hereby certified that this proposed rule, if adopted as a final rule, will not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small savings associations. This proposal provides an alternative means of evaluating
a small savings association's CRA requirements that would enable most such savings associations to avoid the data
collection requirements in 12 CFR Part 563e and will encourage greater small business lending by savings associations
of all sizes.



Executive Order 12866





OCC:

 It has been determined that this document is a significant regulatory action. The proposal would clarify existing
requirements and would exempt small banks from many of the requirements in 12 CFR Part 25. Further, the proposal will
encourage greater small business lending by banks of all sizes.



OTS:

 It has been determined that this document is a significant regulatory action. The proposal sets forth a more focused
and streamlined method of evaluating savings associations' compliance with existing statutory requirements;
moreover it would exempt small savings associations from many of the requirements in 12 CFR Part 563e. Further, the
proposal will encourage greater small business lending by savings associations of all sizes.

small farm lending, and (at the bank's option) consumer lending to reflect the 
relative importance of each category of lending to the bank's overall business.

OCC determines that this lending is integral to the business of the bank. 
(3) Consideration of affiliate lending shall be subject to the following 
constraints: 
(i) No affiliate may claim the same loan as another institution; and 
(ii) If the OCC considers loans within a particular lending category (

participation or investment) of the total loans made by the consortium or third 
party.

(ii) A bank shall address all three performance categories and, unless the 
bank has been designated as a wholesale or limited purpose bank, shall 
emphasize lending and lending-related activities. Nevertheless, a different 
emphasis, including a focus on one or more performance categories, may be

 A bank shall specify in its plan 
measurable goals that constitute ``satisfactory'' performance. A plan may 
specify measurable goals that constitute ``outstanding'' performance. In order to 
be considered for an ``outstanding'' performance rating, the bank shall submit 
both ``satisfactory'' and ``outstanding'' performance goals. 

(f) 

Plan approval

_(1)

Timing.

 The OCC shall act upon a plan within 
60 days after the complete plan and required accompanying material are 
submitted. If the OCC fails to act within this time period, the plan shall be 
deemed approved unless the OCC extends the review period for good cause. 

(2) 

Public participation.

 In evaluating the plan's goals, the OCC shall 
consider the public's involvement in formulating the plan, public comment on 
the plan, and any response by the bank to public comment on the plan. 

(3) 

Criteria for evaluating plan.

 The OCC shall evaluate a plan's 
measurable goals using the following criteria, as appropriate: 

(i) The extent and breadth of lending or lending-related activities, including, 
as appropriate, the distribution of loans among different geographies, businesses 
and farms of different sizes, and individuals of different income levels, the 
extent of community development lending, and the use of innovative or flexible 
lending practices to address credit needs; 

(ii) The amount and innovativeness, complexity, and responsiveness of the 
bank's qualified investments, as defined in  25.23 of this part; and

evidence, the policies and procedures that the bank has in place to prevent 
discriminatory or other illegal credit practices, any corrective action that the 
bank has taken or has committed to take, particularly voluntary corrective 
action resulting from self-assessment, and other relevant information, such as 
the bank's past fair lending performance. 

(d) 

Effect of successive ``needs to improve'' ratings.

 A bank that would 
otherwise receive an assigned rating of ``needs to improve'' shall receive an 
assigned rating of ``substantial noncompliance'' if the bank received no better 
than a ``needs to improve'' rating on each of its two previous examinations.

Subpart E_Interpretations 


 25.101 

Applicability of the Community Reinvestment Act to certain 
special purpose banks. 


In response to its July 1978 proposed regulation, 12 CFR Part 25, to 
implement the CRA, the OCC received several inquiries from institutions that, 
although they are chartered as national banks, do not perform commercial or 
retail banking services. These institutions serve solely as correspondent banks, 
or as trust companies, or as clearing agents, and they do not extend credit to 
the public for their own account. The OCC concludes that the CRA is not 
intended to cover these institutions. It is the purpose of the CRA to require the 
OCC to encourage banks to meet the credit needs of their local communities. 
To this end, the OCC must assess banks' records of performance and take those 
records into account in acting on certain applications affecting the banks. The 
OCC believes that these provisions were intended to cover all banks that are in 
the business of extending credit to the public, including both wholesale and 
retail banks. The lending activities of these banks affect the economic health of 
the communities in which they are chartered. However, the OCC believes it 
would be pointless to encourage or to assess the credit granting record of 
institutions that are not organized to grant credit to the public in the ordinary 
course of business, other than as an incident to their specialized operations. 
Accordingly, the term national bank as used in this part does not include banks 
that engage solely in correspondent banking business, trust company business, 
or acting as a clearing agent.

(1) 

Eligibility for a satisfactory rating.

 The OCC shall rate a bank's 
performance ``satisfactory'' if, in general, the bank demonstrates: 
(i) A reasonable loan-to-deposit ratio (considering seasonal variations) 
given the bank's size, financial condition, the credit needs of its service area(s), 
and taking into account, as appropriate, lending-related activities such as loan 
originations for sale to the secondary markets and community development 
lending and investment; 
(ii) A majority of its loans and, as appropriate, other lending-related 
activities are in its service area(s); 
(iii) A distribution of loans to and, as appropriate, other lending related-activities for individuals of different

reasonable given the demographics of the bank's service area(s); 
(iv) A record of taking appropriate action, as warranted, in response to 
written complaints, if any, about the bank's performance in meeting the credit 
needs of its service area(s); and

(2) 

Eligibility for an outstanding rating.

 A small bank that meets each of 
the standards for a ``satisfactory'' rating under this paragraph and exceeds some 
or all of those standards may warrant consideration for an overall rating of 
``outstanding''. In assessing whether a small bank's performance is 
``outstanding'', the OCC shall consider the extent to which the bank exceeds 
each of the assessment standards for a ``satisfactory'' rating and its performance 
in making qualified investments (as defined in  25.23 of this part) and its 
performance in providing branches, ATMs or other services and delivery 
systems that enhance credit availability in its service area(s). 
(3) 

Needs to improve or substantial noncompliance ratings.

 A small bank 
also may receive a rating of ``needs to improve'' or ``substantial noncompliance'' 
depending on the degree to which its performance has failed to meet the 
standards for a ``satisfactory'' rating. 
(e) 

Strategic plan assessment and rating.

 (1) 

Satisfactory goals.

 The OCC 
shall approve as ``satisfactory'' measurable goals that adequately help meet the 
credit needs of each of a bank's service area(s). 
(2) 

Outstanding goals.

 If the plan identifies a separate group of measurable 
goals that substantially exceed the levels approved as ``satisfactory,'' the OCC 
shall approve those goals as ``outstanding.'' 
(3) 

Rating.

 The OCC shall assess the performance of a bank operating 
under an approved plan to determine if the bank has met its plan goals: 
(i) If the bank substantially achieves its plan goals for a satisfactory rating, 
the OCC shall rate the bank's performance under the plan as ``satisfactory.'' 
(ii) If the bank exceeds its plan goals for a satisfactory rating and 
substantially achieves its plan goals for an outstanding rating, the OCC shall 
rate the bank's performance under the plan as ``outstanding''. 
(iii) If the bank fails to substantially meet its plan goals for a satisfactory 
rating, it shall be rated as either ``needs to improve'' or ``substantial 
noncompliance,'' depending on the extent to which it falls short of its plan 
goals, or if the bank so elected at the time it first submitted its plan, it shall be 
rated under the lending, investment and service tests (as described in   25.22 
through 25.24 of this part), the community development test (as described in 
 25.25 of this part), or the small bank assessment standards (as described in 
 25.26 of this part), as appropriate.

Appendix C to Part 25_CRA Loan Data Format 


Instructions for the Small Business and Small Farm Loan Register 


This form contains the instructions for completion of the Loan Register for Small Business and 
Small Farm Loans. This register is used in conjunction with the reporting of this information 
as part of the CRA data collection process. The register and these instructions are to be used 
to provide the format in which the data should be reported. The actual data are to be submitted 
in machine-readable form in accordance with the instructions for submission of data pursuant 
to 12 CFR Part 203 (Regulation C). 


I. Who Must File a Register 


All independent insured banks and thrifts with $250 million or more in total assets and all 
insured banks and thrifts that are members of holding companies with $250 million or more in 
bank and thrift assets must report this information for small business and small farm loans 
outstanding beginning December 31, 1995. Banks and thrifts with fewer assets that wish to be 
evaluated under 12 CFR   25.22 through 25.24 must also report this information. Only 
provide information on business or farm location and borrower information for loans for which 
applications were submitted after July 1, 1995. For loans for which applications were submitted before that date,
enter ``N/A'' for all information relating to location 
or borrower. 


II. Types of Loans to be Reported 


The loan register should contain individual loan data on each small business or small farm loan 
as defined on schedule RC-C of the December 31 Report of Condition and Income. Include data 
on individual small business loans with original loan amounts of $1 million or less and individual 
small farm loans with original loan amounts of $500,000 or less that had an outstanding balance 
as of December 31. 


III. Submission of Data 


The data must be submitted in machine-readable form consistent with requirements for 
submission of data pursuant to 12 CFR Part 203 (Regulation C). The format must conform 
exactly to the form, including the order of columns, column headings, etc. Contact your federal 
supervisory agency for information regarding procedures and technical specifications for 
automated data submission. 
Your institution should decide on the procedure it wants to follow for collection of the data 
consistent with the Supplemental Instructions For Collection Of Data In Connection with Small 
Business and Small Farm Loans. Keep in mind that data reported on the register are 
outstandings as of December 31 and not originations as are reported for some other regulatory 
purposes. Your institution may collect the data on separate registers at different branches or on 
separate registers for different loan types (small business or small farm), but make sure each 
loan number is unique. Entries need not be grouped on your registers by MSA, or 
chronologically, or by census tract, or in any other particular order. 


IV. Instructions for Completion of Register 


Loan Information 


1. Loan Number_Enter an identifying number that can be used to retrieve the loan file. 
It can be any number (not exceeding 25 characters). Use letters, numerals, or a combination 
of both. Make sure that all numbers are unique within the institution. If registers contains data 
for branch offices, for example, use a letter or a numerical code to identify the loans of different 
branches or assign a certain series of numbers to particular branches to avoid duplicate numbers. 
The use of the borrower's tax-payer identification number or social security number is strongly 
discouraged for privacy reasons. 
2. Outstanding Loan Amount_Enter the outstanding loan amount (balance) as of 
December 31. Show the amount in thousands rounding to the nearest thousand. Do not report 
loans with balances below $500. For example, a loan with a balance of $500 would be rounded

would be rounded to $16,000.

Supplemental Instructions for Collection of Data in Connection With Small 
Business and Small Farm Loans 



A. Format 


Beginning July 1, 1995, financial institutions required to report small business and small farm 
loan registers are to collect information on the racial, ethnic, and gender make-up of applicants 
or borrowers in connection with small business and small farm loans. If you take a written 
application, you should list questions regarding the percent of minority and gender ownership 
on your loan application form or on a separate form completed by the applicant in conjunction 
with an application. If you do not take a written application, you should request the information 
at an appropriate time during the application or origination process; you must request the 
information for each loan you originate even if you did not take a written application. If you 
neither take a written application nor originate the loan, you do not have to request the 
information. See the sample form for recommended format and language. This information is 
to be maintained in the institution's in-house loan files. This information is not to be reported 
to the agency, but is to be used to complete the small business and small farm loan register. 



B. Procedures 


1. You must ask for this information, but cannot require the applicant or borrower to 
provide it. You may not consider whether or not an applicant or borrower has provided this 
information in making your decision whether to extend credit or in setting the terms of credit. 
2. If the applicant or borrower chooses not to provide the information, note this fact on the 
form. 
3. Inform the applicant or borrower that the Federal government is requesting this 
information in order to monitor compliance with Federal statutes that prohibit lenders from 
discriminating on these bases.

(1) 

Lending, investment, and service tests

. The Board shall apply these three tests, as described in   228.22 through 228.24 of this part, in evaluating

. In evaluating the performance of small banks (as defined in  228.12 of this part), the Board shall apply the
assessment standards for small banks as provided in  228.26 of this part. However, a small bank may elect instead
to be assessed as provided in paragraphs (a) (2) and (4) of this section, or it may elect to be evaluated under paragraph

of this part. 

(4) 

Strategic plan

. Any bank may elect not to be assessed by any tests described in paragraphs (a)(1), (2) and (3) of this section by submitting

(d) 

Submission of plan.

covered by the plan, particularly the needs of low- and moderate-income geographies and low- and moderate-income
individuals, through lending, investment, and the provision of services, as appropriate. 


(ii) A bank shall address all three performance categories and, unless 
the bank has been designated as a wholesale or limited purpose bank, shall 
emphasize lending and lending-related activities. Nevertheless, a different 
emphasis, including a focus on one or more performance categories, may be

Ratings in general. 

Subject to paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of 
this section, the Board shall assign to a bank a rating of ``outstanding,'' 
``satisfactory,'' ``needs to improve,'' or ``substantial noncompliance'' based on the bank's performance under
the lending, investment and service tests, the 
community development test, the small bank assessment standards, or an approved strategic plan, as applicable.


(b) 

Lending, investment, and service tests. 

The Board shall assign a 
rating for a bank assessed under the lending, investment, and service tests in 
accordance with the procedures provided in Appendix A of this part and the 
following principles: 

(1) A bank's rating on the lending test shall be weighed so as to 
count for at least 50 percent of its assigned rating; 

(2) A bank that receives an ``outstanding'' rating on the lending test 
shall receive an assigned rating of at least ``satisfactory''; 

(3) A bank that receives an ``outstanding'' rating on the lending test 
and an ``outstanding'' rating on either the service test or the investment test shall receive an assigned rating of
``outstanding''; 

(4) A bank that receives an ``outstanding'' rating on both the service 
test and the investment test and a rating of at least ``high satisfactory'' on the lending test shall receive an assigned
rating of ``outstanding''; and 

(5) No bank may receive an assigned rating of ``satisfactory'' unless 
it receives a rating of at least ``low satisfactory'' on the lending test. 

 (c) 

Effect of evidence of discriminatory or other illegal credit 
practices. 

Evidence of discriminatory or other illegal credit practices shall adversely affect the Board's evaluation of a
bank's performance. In determining the effect on the bank's assigned rating, the Board shall consider the nature
and extent of the evidence, the policies and procedures that the bank has in place to prevent discriminatory or other
illegal credit practices, any corrective action that the bank has taken or has committed to take, particularly voluntary
corrective action resulting from self-assessment, and other relevant information, such as the bank's past fair
lending performance. 

(d) 

Effect of successive ``needs to improve'' ratings.

subsidiary bank, in considering any application: 

(1) By a state member bank for the establishment of a domestic

(4) By a bank holding company to acquire ownership or control of 
shares or assets of a bank, or to merge or consolidate with any other bank 
holding company.

parties which are submitted in 
accordance with the Board's Rules of Procedure set forth in part 262 of this 
chapter.

Denial or conditional approval of application. 

A bank's record 
of performance may be the basis for denying or conditioning approval of an 
application described in paragraph (a) of this section.

Subpart E_Interpretations 


 228.100 

Applicability of the Community Reinvestment Act to certain 
 special purpose banks. 
 

In response to its July 1978 proposed regulation, 12 CFR Part 228, 
to implement the CRA, the Board received several inquiries from institutions 
that, although they are chartered as banks, do not perform commercial or retail 
banking services. These institutions serve solely as correspondent banks, or as 
trust companies, or as clearing agents, and they do not extend credit to the public 
for their own account. The Board concludes that the CRA is not intended to 
cover these institutions. It is the purpose of the CRA to require the Board to 
encourage banks to meet the credit needs of their local communities. To this 
end, the Board must assess banks' records of performance and take those records 
into account in acting on certain applications affecting the banks. The Board 
believes that these provisions were intended to cover all banks that are in the 
business of extending credit to the public, including both wholesale and retail 
banks. The lending activities of these banks affect the economic health of the 
communities in which they are chartered. However, the Board believes it would 
be pointless to encourage or to assess the credit-granting record of institutions 
that are not organized to grant credit to the public in the ordinary course of 
business, other than as an incident to their specialized operations. Accordingly, 
the term 

State member bank 

as used in this part does not include banks that 
engage solely in correspondent banking business, trust company business, or 
acting as a clearing agent.

improve'' ratings. 

(2) A bank's performance need not fit each aspect of a particular 
rating profile in order to receive that rating, and exceptionally strong 
performance with respect to some aspects may compensate for weak performance 
in others. The bank's overall performance, however, should generally be 
consistent with the appropriate profile stated below.

some or all of those standards may warrant consideration for an overall rating of 
``outstanding''. In assessing whether a small bank's performance is 
``outstanding'', the Board shall consider the extent to which the bank exceeds each 
of the assessment standards for a ``satisfactory'' rating and its performance in 
making qualified investments (as defined in  228.23 of this part) and its 
performance in providing branches, ATMs or other services and delivery systems 
that enhance credit availability in its service area(s). 

(3) 

Needs to improve or substantial noncompliance ratings.

 A small 
bank also may receive a rating of ``needs to improve'' or ``substantial 
noncompliance'' depending on the degree to which its performance has failed to 
meet the standards for a ``satisfactory'' rating. 

(e) 

Strategic plan assessment and rating.

 

(1) 

Satisfactory goals.

 The Board shall approve as ``satisfactory'' 
measurable goals that adequately help meet the credit needs of each of a bank's service area(s). 

(2) 

Outstanding goals.

 If the plan identifies a separate group of 
measurable goals that substantially exceed the levels approved as ``satisfactory,'' 
the Board shall approve those goals as ``outstanding.'' 

(3) 

Rating.

 The Board shall assess the performance of a bank 
operating under an approved plan to determine if the bank has met its plan goals: 

(i) If the bank substantially achieves its plan goals for a satisfactory 
rating, the Board shall rate the bank's performance under the plan as 
``satisfactory.'' 

(ii) If the bank exceeds its plan goals for a satisfactory rating and 
substantially achieves its plan goals for an outstanding rating, the Board shall rate 
the bank's performance under the plan as ``outstanding''. 

(iii) If the bank fails to substantially meet its plan goals for a 
satisfactory rating, it shall be rated as either ``needs to improve'' or ``substantial 
noncompliance,'' depending on the extent to which it falls short of its plan goals, 
or if the bank so elected at the time it first submitted its plan, it shall be rated 
under the lending, investment and service tests (as described in   228.22 
through 228.24 of this part), the community development test (as described in 
 228.25 of this part), or the small bank assessment standards (as described in 
 228.26 of this part), as appropriate.

Appendix C to Part 228_CRA Loan Data Format 


Instructions for the Small Business and Small Farm Loan Register 


This form contains the instructions for completion of the Loan Register for Small Business and Small Farm Loans. This
register is used in conjunction with the reporting of this information as part of the CRA data collection process.
The register and these instructions are to be used to provide the format in which the data should be reported. The actual
data are to be submitted in machine-readable form in accordance with the instructions for submission of data pursuant
to 12 CFR Part 203 (Regulation C). 



I. Who Must File a Register 


All independent insured banks and thrifts with $250 million or more in total assets and all insured 
banks and thrifts that are members of holding companies with $250 million or more in bank and 
thrift assets must report this information for small business and small farm loans outstanding 
beginning December 31, 1995. Banks and thrifts with fewer assets that wish to be evaluated under 
12 CFR 228.22 through 228.24 must also report this information. Only provide information 
on business or farm location and borrower information for loans for which applications were 
submitted after July 1, 1995. For loans for which applications were submitted before that date, 
enter ``N/A'' for all information relating to location or borrower. 



II. Types of Loans To Be Reported 


The loan register should contain individual loan data on each small business or small farm loan 
as defined on schedule RC-C of the December 31 Report of Condition and Income. Include data 
on individual small business loans with original loan amounts of $1 million or less and individual 
small farm loans with original loan amounts of $500,000 or less that had an outstanding balance 
as of December 31. 


III. Submission of Data 


The data must be submitted in machine-readable form consistent with requirements for submission 
of data pursuant to 12 CFR Part 203 (Regulation C). The format must conform exactly to the 
form, including the order of columns, column headings, etc. Contact your federal supervisory 
agency for information regarding procedures and technical specifications for automated data 
submission. 
Your institution should decide on the procedure it wants to follow for collection of the data 
consistent with the Supplemental Instructions For Collection Of Data In Connection with Small 
Business and Small Farm Loans. Keep in mind that data reported on the register are outstanding as of December 31 and
not originations as are reported for some other regulatory purposes. Your 
institution may collect the data on separate registers at different branches or on separate registers 
for different loan types (small business or small farm), but make sure each loan number is unique. 
Entries need not be grouped on your registers by MSA, or chronologically, or by census tract, or 
in any other particular order. 



IV. Instructions for Completion of Register 


Loan Information 


1. 

LOAN NUMBER_

Enter an identifying number that can be used to retrieve the loan file. 
It can be any number (not exceeding 25 characters). Use letters, numerals, or a combination of 
both. Make sure that all numbers are unique within the institution. If registers contain data for 
branch offices, for example, use a letter or a numerical code to identify the loans of different 
branches or assign a certain series of numbers to particular branches to avoid duplicate numbers. 
The use of the borrower's tax-payer identification number or social security number is strongly 
discouraged for privacy reasons. 

2. 

OUTSTANDING LOAN AMOUNT_

Enter the outstanding loan amount (balance) as of 
December 31. Show the amount in thousands rounding to the nearest thousand. Do not report 
loans with balances below $500. For example, a loan with a balance of $500 would be rounded 
to $1,000; a loan balance of $50,300 would be rounded to $50,000; and a balance of $15,700 
would be rounded to $16,000.

Supplemental instructions for collection of data in connection with small 
business and small farm loans 



A. Format 


Beginning July 1, 1995, financial institutions required to report small business and small farm loan 
registers are to collect information on the racial, ethnic, and gender make-up of applicants or 
borrowers in connection with small business and small farm loans. If you take a written 
application, you should list questions regarding the percent of minority and gender ownership on 
your loan application form or on a separate form completed by the applicant in conjunction with 
an application. If you do not take a written application, you should request the information at an 
appropriate time during the application or origination process; you must request the information 
for each loan you originate even if you did not take a written application. If you neither take a 
written application nor originate the loan, you do not have to request the information. See the 
sample form for recommended format and language. This information is to be maintained in the 
institution's in-house loan files. This information is not to be reported to the agency, but is to be 
used to complete the small business and small farm loan register. 



B. Procedures 


1. You must ask for this information, but cannot require the applicant or borrower to provide 
it. You may not consider whether or not an applicant or borrower has provided this information 
in making your decision whether to extend credit or in setting the terms of credit. 
2. If the applicant or borrower chooses not to provide the information, note this fact on the 
form. 
3. Inform the applicant or borrower that the Federal government is requesting this information 
in order to monitor compliance with Federal statutes that prohibit lenders from discriminating on 
these bases.

Consumer Loans and Closed-End Consumer Loans. These registers are used in conjunction with 
the collection of this information as part of the CRA data collection process. The registers and

If you collect and maintain information on your consumer loans for consideration in your CRA 
evaluation, you must provide data on all consumer loans outstanding included in the aggregate 
consumer loan figure on your December 31 Report of Condition and Income. 
Your institution should decide on the procedure it wants to follow for collection of the data. 
Keep in mind that data recorded on the registers are outstandings as of December 31 and not 
originations as are reported for some other regulatory purposes. Your institution may collect 
the data on separate registers at different branches, but is required to maintain the data on

bank that benefit areas outside the bank's service area(s) only up to an amount 
equivalent to the amount of investments, loans, and services considered under

which a small bank is helping to meet the credit needs of its service area(s) 
under the assessment standards described in this section. 

(b) 

Assessment criteria.

 The FDIC shall evaluate a small bank's 
CRA performance pursuant to the following criteria:

and, as appropriate, other lending-related activities, such as loan originations 
for sale to the secondary markets or community development lending or 
investment; 

(2) The percentage of loans and, as appropriate, other lending-related activities located in the bank's service
area(s);

in other lending-related activities for borrowers of different income levels and 
businesses and farms of different sizes; 

(4) The geographic distribution of the bank's loans given its service 
area(s); and 

(5) The bank's record of taking action, if warranted, in response to 
written complaints about its performance in meeting the credit needs of its 
service area(s). 

(c) 

Small bank performance rating.

bank's performance as provided in Appendix A of this part. 



 345.27

Strategic plan assessment. 



(a)

 Alternative election.

 A bank may request to be rated under a 
strategic plan rather than under the lending, service, and investment tests 
(  345.22 through 345.24 of this part), the community development test 
( 345.25 of this part), or the small bank assessment standards ( 345.26 of this 
part), by submitting to the FDIC a strategic plan as provided for in this section. 
A bank's request to be rated under a strategic plan is not approved until the 
FDIC approves the plan. The FDIC's approval of a strategic plan does not 
affect the bank's obligation, if any, to report data as required by  345.42 of 
this part. 

(b) 

Strategic plans in general.

 (1) A plan may have a term of no 
more than five years, and any multi-year plan shall include annual interim 
measurable goals according to which the FDIC shall evaluate the bank's 
performance. 

(2) A bank with more than one service area may prepare a single 
plan for all of its service areas or a plan for one or more but not all of its 
service areas. 

(3) Affiliated institutions may prepare joint plans if the plans 
provide measurable goals for each institution. 

(c) 

Public participation in strategic plan development.

 Before 
submitting a plan to the FDIC for approval, the bank shall: 

(1) Informally seek suggestions from the public in its service 
area(s) while developing the plan; 

(2) Once the bank has developed a plan, formally solicit public 
comment on the plan for at least 30 days by publishing notice in a newspaper of 
general circulation in each of its service areas; and

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941007-1-00136 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941007-1-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(3) During the period of formal public comment, make copies of the plan available for review at all offices of the bank
in any service area covered by the plan.

(d) 

Submission of plan._

The bank shall submit its plan to the FDIC at least three months prior to the proposed effective date of the plan. The
bank shall also submit with its plan any public comments received, and, if the plan was revised in light of the comments
received, the initial plan as released for public comment.

(e) 

Plan content.

_(1) 

Measurable goals. 

(i) A bank shall specify in its plan measurable goals for helping to meet the credit needs of each of its service area(s)
covered by the plan, particularly the needs of low- and moderate-income geographies and low- and moderate-income
individuals, through lending, investment, and the provision of services, as appropriate.

(ii) A bank shall address all three performance categories and, unless the bank has been designated as a wholesale
or limited purpose bank, shall emphasize lending and lending-related activities. Nevertheless, a different emphasis,
including a focus on one or more performance categories, may be appropriate if responsive to the characteristics
and credit needs of its service area, considering public comment and the bank's capacity and constraints, product
offerings, and business strategy.

(2) 

Confidential information. 

The bank may submit additional information to the FDIC on a confidential basis, but the goals stated in the plan shall
be sufficiently specific to enable the public and the FDIC to judge fairly the merits of the plan.

(3) 

Satisfactory and outstanding goals. 

A bank shall specify in its plan measurable goals that constitute ``satisfactory'' performance. A plan may specify
measurable goals that constitute ``outstanding'' performance. In order to be considered for an ``outstanding''
performance rating, the bank shall submit both ``satisfactory'' and ``outstanding'' performance goals.

(f) 

Plan approval._(1) Timing. 

The FDIC shall act upon a plan within 60 days after the complete plan and required accompanying material are submitted.
If the FDIC fails to act within this time period, the plan shall be deemed approved unless the FDIC extends the review
period for good cause.

(2) 

Public participation. 

In evaluating the plan's goals, the FDIC shall consider the public's involvement in formulating the plan, public
comment on the plan, and any response by the bank to public comment on the plan.

(3) 

Criteria for evaluating plan. 

The FDIC shall evaluate a plan's measurable goals using the following criteria, as appropriate:

(i) The extent and breadth of lending or lending-related activities, including, as appropriate, the distribution
of loans among different geographies, businesses and farms of different sizes, and individuals of different income
levels, the extent of community development lending, and the use of innovative or flexible lending practices to address
credit needs;

(ii) The amount and innovativeness, complexity, and responsiveness of the bank's qualified investments, as defined
in  345.23 of this part; and

(iii) The extent and availability of the bank's services, including, as appropriate, the accessibility of retail
delivery systems and the extent and innovativeness of community development services, as defined in  345.24
of this part.

(g) 

Plan amendment._

During the term of a plan, the bank may petition the FDIC to approve an amendment to the plan on grounds that a material
change in circumstances has made the plan no longer appropriate. Any amendment proposed shall be developed in accordance
with the public participation requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.

(h) 

Strategic plan assessment._

The FDIC shall approve the goals and assess performance under a strategic plan as provided for in Appendix A of this
part.

Assigned ratings.


(a) 

Ratings in general. 

Subject to paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, the FDIC shall assign to a bank a rating of ``outstanding,''
``satisfactory,'' ``needs to improve,'' or ``substantial noncompliance'' based on the bank's performance under
the lending, investment and service tests, the community development test, the small bank assessment standards,
or an approved strategic plan, as applicable.
(b) 

Lending, investment, and service tests. 

The FDIC shall assign a rating for a bank assessed under the lending, investment, and service tests in accordance with
the procedures provided in Appendix A of this part and the following principles:
(1) A bank's rating on the lending test shall be weighed so as to count for at least 50 percent of its assigned rating;
(2) A bank that receives an ``outstanding'' rating on the lending test shall receive an assigned rating of at least
``satisfactory'';
(3) A bank that receives an ``outstanding'' rating on the lending test and an ``outstanding'' rating on either the
service test or the investment test shall receive an assigned rating of ``outstanding'';
(4) A bank that receives an ``outstanding'' rating on both the service test and the investment test and a rating of at
least ``high satisfactory'' on the lending test shall receive an assigned rating of ``outstanding''; and
(5) No bank may receive an assigned rating of ``satisfactory'' unless it receives a rating of at least ``low satisfactory''
on the lending test.
(c) 

Effect of evidence of discriminatory or other illegal credit practices. 

Evidence of discriminatory or other illegal credit practices shall adversely affect the FDIC's evaluation of a bank's
performance. In determining the effect on the bank's assigned rating, the FDIC shall consider the nature and extent
of the evidence, the policies and procedures that the bank has in place to prevent discriminatory or other illegal
credit practices, any corrective action that the bank has taken or has committed to take, particularly voluntary
corrective action resulting from self-assessment, and other relevant information, such as the bank's past fair
lending performance.
(d) 

Effect of successive ``needs to improve'' ratings. 

A bank that would otherwise receive an assigned rating of ``needs to improve'' shall receive an assigned rating of
``substantial noncompliance'' if the bank received no better than a ``needs to improve'' rating on each of its two
previous examinations.


 345.29


Effect of ratings on applications.


(a) 

CRA performance. 

Among other factors, the FDIC shall take into account a bank's record of performance under the CRA in considering applications
for approval of:
(1) The establishment of a branch or other facility with the ability to accept deposits;
(2) The relocation of a bank's main office, a branch office or other facility with the ability to accept deposits;
(3) The merger, consolidation, acquisition of assets, or assumption of liabilities; and
(4) Deposit insurance for an operating non-insured financial institution.
(b) 

New banks. 

A newly chartered bank shall submit a description of its proposed CRA performance when an application for deposit
insurance is made. In considering the application, the FDIC shall take into account the bank's proposed CRA performance.
(c) 

Interested parties. 

In considering CRA performance in an application described in paragraph (a) of this section, the FDIC shall take into
account any views expressed by interested parties which are submitted in accordance with the FDIC's procedures and
rules of practice set forth in Part 303 of this chapter.

Subpart E_Interpretations 


 345.100 

Applicability of the Community Reinvestment Act to certain 
special purpose banks. 


In response to its July 1978 proposed regulation, 12 CFR Part 345, to 
implement the CRA, the FDIC received several inquiries from institutions that, 
although they were chartered as banks, did not perform commercial or retail 
banking services. These institutions served solely as correspondent banks, or as trust companies, or as clearing
agents, and they did not extend credit to the public for their own account. The FDIC concludes that the CRA is not intended
to cover these institutions. It is the purpose of the CRA to require the FDIC to encourage banks to meet the credit needs
of their local communities. To this end the FDIC must assess banks' records of performance and take those records into
account in acting on certain applications affecting the banks. The FDIC believes that these provisions were intended
to cover all banks that are in the business of extending credit to the public including both 

wholesale

 and 

retail

 banks. The lending activities of these banks affect the economic health of the communities in which they are chartered.
However, the FDIC believes it would be pointless to encourage or to assess the credit granting record of institutions
that are not organized to grant credit to the public in the ordinary course of business, other than as an incident to
their specialized operations. Accordingly the term 

bank

 as used in the FDIC's regulation, part 345 (12 CFR part 345), does not include banks that engage solely in correspondent
banking business, trust company business, or acting as a clearing agent.

Appendix A to Part 345_Ratings 


(a) 

Ratings in general.

 (1) In assigning a rating, the FDIC shall 
evaluate a bank's performance under the applicable assessment criteria in this 
part, subject to  345.28 of this part, which provides for adjustments on the 
basis of evidence of discriminatory or other illegal credit practices and prior 
``needs to improve'' ratings. 
(2) A bank's performance need not fit each aspect of a particular 
rating profile in order to receive that rating, and exceptionally strong 
performance with respect to some aspects may compensate for weak 
performance in others. The bank's overall performance, however, should 
generally be consistent with the appropriate profile stated below. 
(b) 

Banks that are not wholesale or limited purpose banks or small 
banks.


(1) 

Lending performance rating.

 The FDIC shall assign each 
bank's lending performance one of the five ratings described below. 
(i) 

Outstanding.

 The FDIC shall rate a bank's lending performance 
``outstanding'' if, in general, it demonstrates: 
(A) Excellent responsiveness to credit needs in its service area(s); 
(B) A substantial majority of its loans are made in its service 
area(s); 
(C) An excellent geographic distribution of loans throughout its 
service area(s); 
(D) An excellent distribution, particularly in its service area(s), of 
loans among individuals of different income levels and businesses (including 
farms) of different size given the product lines offered by the bank;

(1) 

Eligibility for a satisfactory rating.

 The FDIC shall rate a bank's performance ``satisfactory'' if, in general, the bank demonstrates: 
(i) A reasonable loan-to-deposit ratio (considering seasonal variations) given the bank's size, financial condition,
the credit needs of its service area(s), and taking into account, as appropriate, lending-related activities such
as loan originations for sale to the secondary markets and community development lending and investment; 
(ii) A majority of its loans and, as appropriate, other lending- related activities are in its service area(s); 
(iii) A distribution of loans to and, as appropriate, other lending related-activities for individuals of different
income levels (including low- and moderate-income individuals) and businesses and farms of different sizes that
is reasonable given the demographics of the bank's service area(s); 
(iv) A record of taking appropriate action, as warranted, in response to written complaints, if any, about the bank's
performance in meeting the credit needs of its service area(s); and 
(v) A reasonable geographic distribution of loans given its service area(s). 
(2) 

Eligibility for an outstanding rating.

 A small bank that meets each of the standards for a ``satisfactory'' rating under this paragraph and exceeds some or
all of those standards may warrant consideration for an overall rating of ``outstanding''. In assessing whether
a small bank's performance is ``outstanding'', the FDIC shall consider the extent to which the bank exceeds each of
the assessment standards for a ``satisfactory'' rating and its performance in making qualified investments (as
defined in  345.23 of this part) and its performance in providing branches, RSFs or other services and delivery
systems that enhance credit availability in its service area(s). 
(3) 

Needs to improve or substantial noncompliance ratings.

 A small bank also may receive a rating of ``needs to improve'' or ``substantial noncompliance'' depending on the degree
to which its performance has failed to meet the standards for a ``satisfactory'' rating. 
(e) 

Strategic plan assessment and rating.

 (1) 

Satisfactory goals.

 The FDIC shall approve as ``satisfactory'' measurable goals that adequately help meet the credit needs of each of
a bank's service area(s). 
(2) 

Outstanding goals.

 If the plan identifies a separate group of measurable goals that substantially exceed the levels approved as ``satisfactory,''
the FDIC shall approve those goals as ``outstanding.'' 
(3) 

Rating.

 The FDIC shall assess the performance of a bank operating under an approved plan to determine if the bank has met its
plan goals: 
(i) If the bank substantially achieves its plan goals for a satisfactory rating, the FDIC shall rate the bank's performance
under the plan as ``satisfactory.'' 
(ii) If the bank exceeds its plan goals for a satisfactory rating and substantially achieves its plan goals for an outstanding
rating, the FDIC shall rate the bank's performance under the plan as ``outstanding''. 
(iii) If the bank fails to substantially meet its plan goals for a satisfactory rating, it shall be rated as either ``needs
to improve'' or ``substantial noncompliance,'' depending on the extent to which it falls short of its plan goals,
or if the bank so elected at the time it first submitted its plan, it shall be rated under the lending, investment and
service tests (as described in   345.22 through 345.24 of this part), the community development test
(as described in  345.25 of this part), or the small bank assessment standards (as described in  345.26
of this part), as appropriate.

Appendix C to Part 345_CRA Loan Data Format



Instructions for the Small Business and Small Farm Loan Register



This form contains the instructions for completion of the Loan Register for Small Business and Small Farm Loans. This
register is used in conjunction with the reporting of this information as part of the CRA data collection process.
The register and these instructions are to be used to provide the format in which the data should be reported. The actual
data are to be submitted in machine-readable form in accordance with the instructions for submission of data pursuant
to 12 CFR Part 203 (Regulation C).



I. Who Must File a Register



All independent insured banks and thrifts with $250 million or more in total assets and all insured banks and thrifts
that are members of holding companies with $250 million or more in bank and thrift assets must report this information
for small business and small farm loans outstanding beginning December 31, 1995. Banks and thrifts with fewer assets
that wish to be evaluated under 12 CFR   345.22 through 345.24 must also report this information. Only
provide information on business or farm location and borrower information for loans for which applications were
submitted after July 1, 1995. For loans for which applications were submitted before that date, enter ``N/A'' for
all information relating to location or borrower.



II. Types of Loans to be Reported



The loan register should contain individual loan data on each small business or small farm loan as defined on schedule
RC-C of the December 31 Report of Condition and Income. Include data on individual small business loans with original
loan amounts of $1 million or less and individual small farm loans with original loan amounts of $500,000 or less that
had an outstanding balance as of December 31.



III. Submission of Data



The data must be submitted in machine-readable form consistent with requirements for submission of data pursuant
to 12 CFR Part 203 (Regulation C). The format must conform exactly to the form, including the order of columns, column
headings, etc. Contact your federal supervisory agency for information regarding procedures and technical specifications
for automated data submission.

Your institution should decide on the procedure it wants to follow for collection of the data consistent with the Supplemental
Instructions For Collection Of Data In Connection with Small Business and Small Farm Loans. Keep in mind that data
reported on the register are outstandings as of December 31 and not originations as are reported for some other regulatory
purposes. Your institution may collect the data on separate registers at different branches or on separate registers
for different loan types (small business or small farm), but make sure each loan number is unique. Entries need not
be grouped on your registers by MSA, or chronologically, or by census tract, or in any other particular order.



IV. Instructions for Completion of Register



Loan Information



1. Loan Number_Enter an identifying number that can be used to retrieve the loan file. It can be any number (not exceeding

If registers contains data for branch offices, for example, use a letter or a numerical code to identify the loans of
different branches or assign a certain series of numbers to particular branches to avoid duplicate numbers. The use
of the borrower's tax-payer identification number or social security number is strongly discouraged for privacy
reasons.

2. Outstanding Loan Amount_Enter the outstanding loan amount (balance) as of December 31. Show the amount in thousands
rounding to the nearest thousand. Do not report loans with balances below $500. For example, a loan with a balance of
$500 would be rounded to $1,000; a loan balance of $50,300 would be rounded to $50,000; and a balance of $15,700 would
be rounded to $16,000.

Supplemental Instructions for Collection of Data in Connection With Small 
Business and Small Farm Loans 



A. Format 



Beginning July 1, 1995, financial institutions required to report small business and small farm 
loan registers are to collect information on the racial, ethnic, and gender make-up of applicants 
or borrowers in connection with small business and small farm loans. If you take a written 
application, you should list questions regarding the percent of minority and gender ownership 
on your loan application form or on a separate form completed by the applicant in conjunction 
with an application. If you do not take a written application, you should request the information 
at an appropriate time during the application or origination process; you must request the 
information for each loan you originate even if you did not take a written application. If you 
neither take a written application nor originate the loan, you do not have to request the 
information. See the sample form for recommended format and language. This information is 
to be maintained in the institution's in-house loan files. This information is not to be reported 
to the agency, but is to be used to complete the small business and small farm loan register. 



B. Procedures 



1. You must ask for this information, but cannot require the applicant or borrower to 
provide it. You may not consider whether or not an applicant or borrower has provided this 
information in making your decision whether to extend credit or in setting the terms of credit. 

2. If the applicant or borrower chooses not to provide the information, note this fact on the 
form. 

3. Inform the applicant or borrower that the Federal government is requesting this 
information in order to monitor compliance with Federal statutes that prohibit lenders from 
discriminating on these bases.

If you collect and maintain information on your consumer loans for consideration in your CRA evaluation, you must
provide data on all consumer loans outstanding included in the aggregate consumer loan figure on your December 31
Report of Condition and Income. 

Your institution should decide on the procedure it wants to follow for collection of the data. Keep in mind that data
recorded on the registers are outstandings as of December 31 and not originations as are reported for some other regulatory
purposes. Your institution may collect the data on separate registers at different branches, but is required to maintain
the data on separate registers for each of the different consumer loan types (open-end and closed-end). Make sure
the loan numbers are unique. 



III. Instructions for Completion of Register 



Loan Information 



1. 

Loan Number_

Enter an identifying number that can be used to retrieve the loan file. It can be any number (not exceeding 25 characters).
Use letters, numerals, or a combination of both. Make sure that all numbers are unique within the institution. If registers
contains data for branch offices, for example, use a letter or a numerical code to identify the loans of different branches
or assign a certain series of numbers to particular branches to avoid duplicate numbers. The use of the borrower's
tax-payer identification number or social security number is strongly discouraged for privacy reasons. 


2. 

Outstanding Loan Amount

_Enter the outstanding loan amount (balance) as of December 31. Show the amount in thousands rounding to the nearest
thousand. Do not report loans with balances below $500. For example, a loan with a balance of $500 would be rounded to
$1,000; a loan balance of $50,300 would be rounded to $50,000; and a balance of $15,700 would be rounded to $16,000.




Borrower Information 



For each loan, identify the location of the borrower. Consumer loans are located in the census tract or block numbering
area where the borrower resides. 

1. 

MSA

_For each loan in a MSA, indicate the location of the loan by the four digit MSA number. Enter only the MSA number, not
the MSA name. Use MSA boundaries that were in effect on January 1 of the calendar year for which you are reporting. A listing
of MSAs is available from your regional supervisory agency. (In these instructions, the term MSA refers to metropolitan
statistical area or primary metropolitan statistical area.) For loans outside MSAs, enter ``N/A''. 

2. 

State & County_

Use the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) two-digit numerical code for the state and the three-digit
numerical code for the county. These codes are available from your regional supervisory agency. Do not use the letter
abbreviations used by the United States Postal Service. 

3. 

Census Tract/Block Numbering Area_

Enter the census tract number or block numbering area from the U.S. Census Bureau's Census Tract/Street Index for
the most recent census reporting period. For addresses not listed in the index, consult the Census Bureau's census
tract outline maps. 

4. 

Gross Annual Income

_Enter the gross annual income upon which your institution relied in making the credit decision. Round all dollar
amounts to the nearest thousand.

association as follows: 

(1) 

Lending, investment, and service tests.

 The OTS shall apply these three tests, as described in   563e.22 through 563e.24 of this part, in evaluating
the performance of savings associations, except as provided in paragraphs (a)(2), (3) and (4) of this section.

as provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section. 

(3) 

Assessment standards for small savings associations.

 In evaluating the performance of small savings associations (as defined in  563e.12 of this part), the OTS shall
apply the assessment standards for small savings associations as provided in  563e.26 of this part. However,
a small savings association may elect instead to be assessed as provided in paragraphs (a)(2) and (4) of this section,
or it may elect to be evaluated under paragraph (a)(1) of this section if it has collected and reported the data required
for other savings associations under  563e.42(a)(1) of this part. 

(4) 

Strategic plan.

 Any savings association may elect not to be assessed by any tests described in paragraphs (a)(1), (2) and (3) of this
section by submitting to the OTS and receiving approval of a strategic plan as described in  563e.27 of this part.


(b) 

Assessment context.

 The OTS shall apply the tests and standards in paragraph (a) of this section in the context of the following information:

costs, and other relevant data pertaining to a savings association's service area(s); 

(2) Examiner-developed information regarding the credit needs of the savings association's service area(s) obtained
from community-based organizations, state and local governments, economic development agencies, and from any
information the savings association may choose to provide; 

(3) The savings association's product offerings and business strategy as determined from data provided by the savings
association; 

(4) Institutional capacity and constraints, including the size and financial condition of the institution, the
economic climate (national, regional and local), safety and soundness limitations, and any other factors that significantly
affect the savings association's ability to lend to the different parts of its service area(s); 

(5) The savings association's past performance and the performance of similarly-situated lenders;

and apply flexible underwriting standards, consistent with safe and sound banking operations, for loans that benefit
low- or moderate-income geographies or individuals. 

(e) 

Compliance with community reinvestment obligation.

 The assigned ratings reflect the extent of compliance or noncompliance with the community reinvestment obligation
described in  563e.11(b) of this part. A savings association that receives an assigned rating of ``substantial

the lending test will also evaluate the savings association's consumer loans outstanding and any other loan distribution
data the savings association may choose to provide, such as data on extensions of lines of credit, commitments, and
letters of credit.

 563e.27 

Strategic plan assessment. 
 

(a) 

Alternative election. 

A savings association may request to be rated 
under a strategic plan rather than under the lending, service, and investment 
tests (  563e.22 through 563e.24 of this part), the community development test 
( 563e.25 of this part), or the small savings association assessment standards 
( 563e.26 of this part), by submitting to the OTS a strategic plan as provided 
for in this section. A savings association's request to be rated under a strategic 
plan is not approved until the OTS approves the plan. The OTS's approval of a 
strategic plan does not affect the savings association's obligation, if any, to 
report data as required by  Part 563e.42 of this part. 
 (b) 

Strategic plans in general. 

(1) A plan may have a term of no more 
than five years, and any multi-year plan shall include annual interim measurable 
goals according to which the OTS shall evaluate the savings association's 
performance. 
 (2) A savings association with more than one service area may prepare a 
single plan for all of its service areas or a plan for one or more but not all of 
its service areas. 
 (3) Affiliated institutions may prepare joint plans if the plans provide 
measurable goals for each institution. 
 (c) 

Public participation in strategic plan development. 

Before submitting 
a plan to the OTS for approval, the savings association shall: 
 (1) Informally seek suggestions from the public in its service area(s) 
while developing the plan; 
 (2) Once the savings association has developed a plan, formally solicit 
public comment on the plan for at least 30 days by publishing notice in a 
newspaper of general circulation in each of its service areas; and 
 (3) During the period of formal public comment, make copies of the plan 
available for review at all offices of the savings association in any service area 
covered by the plan. 
 (d) 

Submission of plan. 

The savings association shall submit its plan to 
the OTS at least three months prior to the proposed effective date of the plan. 
The savings association shall also submit with its plan any public comments 
received, and, if the plan was revised in light of the comments received, the 
initial plan as released for public comment. 
 (e) 

Plan content_

(1) 

Measurable goals. 

(i) A savings association shall 
specify in its plan measurable goals for helping to meet the credit needs of each 
of its service area(s) covered by the plan, particularly the needs of low- and 
moderate-income geographies and low- and moderate-income individuals, 
through lending, investment, and the provision of services, as appropriate. 
 (ii) A savings association shall address all three performance categories 
and, unless the savings association has been designated as a wholesale or 
limited purpose savings association, shall emphasize lending and lending-related 
activities. Nevertheless, a different emphasis, including a focus on one or more 
performance categories, may be appropriate if responsive to the characteristics 
and credit needs of its service area, considering public comment and the savings 
association's capacity and constraints, product offerings, and business strategy. 
 (2) 

Confidential information. 

The savings association may submit 
additional information to the OTS on a confidential basis, but the goals stated in 
the plan shall be sufficiently specific to enable the public and the OTS to judge 
fairly the merits of the plan. 
 (3) 

Satisfactory and outstanding goals. 

A savings association shall 
specify in its plan measurable goals that constitute ``satisfactory'' performance. 
A plan may specify measurable goals that constitute ``outstanding'' performance. 
In order to be considered for an ``outstanding'' performance rating, the savings 
association shall submit both ``satisfactory'' and ``outstanding'' performance 
goals. 
 (f) 

Plan approval_

(1) 

Timing. 

The OTS shall act upon a plan within 
60 days after the complete plan and required accompanying material are 
submitted. If the OTS fails to act within this time period, the plan shall be 
deemed approved unless the OTS extends the review period for good cause. 
 (2) 

Public participation. 

In evaluating the plan's goals, the OTS shall 
consider the public's involvement in formulating the plan, public comment on 
the plan, and any response by the savings association to public comment on the 
plan. 
 (3) 

Criteria for evaluating plan. 

The OTS shall evaluate a plan's 
measurable goals using the following criteria, as appropriate: 
 (i) The extent and breadth of lending or lending-related activities, 
including, as appropriate, the distribution of loans among different geographies, 
businesses and farms of different sizes, and individuals of different income 
levels, the extent of community development lending, and the use of innovative 
or flexible lending practices to address credit needs;

(ii) The amount and innovativeness, complexity, and responsiveness of 
the savings association's qualified investments, as defined in  563e.23 of this part; and 
(iii) The extent and availability of the savings association's services, 
including, as appropriate, the accessibility of retail delivery systems and the extent and innovativeness of community
development services, as defined in 
 563e.24 of this part. 
(g) 

Plan amendment.

 During the term of a plan, the savings association may petition the OTS to approve an amendment to the plan on grounds
that a material change in circumstances has made the plan no longer appropriate. Any amendment proposed shall be developed
in accordance with the public participation requirements of paragraph (c) of this section. 
(h) 

Strategic plan assessment. 

The OTS shall approve the goals and 
assess performance under a strategic plan as provided for in Appendix A of this part. 


 563e.28 

Assigned ratings. 



(a) 

Ratings in general.

 Subject to paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, the OTS shall assign to a savings association a rating of ``outstanding,''
``satisfactory,'' ``needs to improve,'' or ``substantial noncompliance'' based on the savings association's
performance under the lending, investment and service tests, the community development test, the small savings
association assessment standards, or an approved strategic plan, as applicable. 
(b) 

Lending, investment, and service tests. 

The OTS shall assign a 
rating for a savings association assessed under the lending, investment, and 
service tests in accordance with the procedures provided in Appendix A of this 
part and the following principles: 
(1) A savings association's rating on the lending test shall be weighed so 
as to count for at least 50 percent of its assigned rating; 
(2) A savings association that receives an ``outstanding'' rating on the 
lending test shall receive an assigned rating of at least ``satisfactory''; 
(3) A savings association that receives an ``outstanding'' rating on the 
lending test and an ``outstanding'' rating on either the service test or the 
investment test shall receive an assigned rating of ``outstanding'';

<PARENT> FR941007-1-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(4) A savings association that receives an ``outstanding'' rating on both the service test and the investment test
and a rating of at least ``high satisfactory'' on the lending test shall receive an assigned rating of ``outstanding'';
and 
(5) No savings association may receive an assigned rating of 
``satisfactory'' unless it receives a rating of at least ``low satisfactory'' on the lending test. 
(c) 

Effect of evidence of discriminatory or other illegal credit practices.

 Evidence of discriminatory or other illegal credit practices shall adversely affect 
the OTS's evaluation of a savings association's performance. In determining 
the effect on the savings association's assigned rating, the OTS shall consider 
the nature and extent of the evidence, the policies and procedures that the 
savings association has in place to prevent discriminatory or other illegal credit practices, any corrective action
that the savings association has taken or has committed to take, particularly voluntary corrective action resulting
from self-assessment, and other relevant information, such as the savings association's past fair lending performance.

(d) 

Effect of successive ``needs to improve'' ratings. 

A savings 
association that would otherwise receive an assigned rating of ``needs to 
improve'' shall receive an assigned rating of ``substantial noncompliance'' if the savings association received
no better than a ``needs to improve'' rating on each of its two previous examinations. 


 563e.29 

Effect of ratings on applications. 


(a) 

CRA performance. 

Among other factors, the OTS shall take into 
account the record of performance under the CRA of each applicant savings 
association, and for applications under section 10(e) of the Home Owners' Loan 
Act, of each subsidiary of an applicant, and of each proposed subsidiary savings 
association, in considering any application: 
(1) For establishment of a domestic branch or other facility that would be 
authorized to take deposits;

application is made. In considering the application, the OTS shall take the 
description into account and may deny or condition approval on that basis. 
(c) 

Interested parties. 

In considering CRA performance in an application 
described in paragraph (a) of this section, the OTS shall take into account any 
views expressed by State or other Federal financial supervisory agencies or 
other interested parties which are submitted in accordance with the applicable 
public comment procedures. 
(d) 

Denial or conditional approval of application. 

An applicant's record 
of performance may be the basis for denying or conditioning approval of an 
application described in paragraph (a) of this section.

(2) 

Eligibility for an outstanding rating.

other services and delivery systems that enhance credit availability in its service 
area(s). 
(3) 

Needs to improve or substantial noncompliance ratings.

 A small 
savings association also may receive a rating of ``needs to improve'' or

 Satisfactory goals.

 The 
OTS shall approve as ``satisfactory'' measurable goals that adequately help meet 
the credit needs of each of a savings association's service area(s).

Outstanding goals.

 If the plan identifies a separate group of 
measurable goals that substantially exceed the levels approved as ``satisfactory,'' 
the OTS shall approve those goals as ``outstanding.'' 
(3) 

Rating. 

The OTS shall assess the performance of a savings 
association operating under an approved plan to determine if the savings 
association has met its plan goals: 
(i) If the savings association substantially achieves its plan goals for a 
satisfactory rating, the OTS shall rate the savings association's performance 
under the plan as ``satisfactory.'' 
(ii) If the savings association exceeds its plan goals for a satisfactory 
rating and substantially achieves its plan goals for an outstanding rating, the 
OTS shall rate the savings association's performance under the plan as 
``outstanding''. 
(iii) If the savings association fails to substantially meet its plan goals for 
a satisfactory rating, it shall be rated as either ``needs to improve'' or 
``substantial noncompliance,'' depending on the extent to which it falls short of 
its plan goals, or if the savings association so elected at the time it first 
submitted its plan, it shall be rated under the lending, investment and service 
tests (as described in   563e.22 through 563e.24 of this part), the community 
development test (as described in  563e.25 of this part), or the small savings 
association assessment standards (as described in  563e.26 of this part), as 
appropriate.

Appendix C to Part 563e_CRA Loan Data Format 



Instruction for the Small Business and Small Farm Loan Register 



This form contains the instructions for completion of the Loan Register for Small Business and Small Farm Loans. This
register is used in conjunction with the reporting of this information as part of the CRA data collection process.
The register and these instructions are to be used to provide the format in which the data should be reported. The actual
data are to be submitted in machine-readable form in accordance with the instructions for submission of data pursuant
to 12 CFR Part 203 (Regulation C). 



I. Who Must File a Register 



All independent insured banks and thrifts with $250 million or more in total assets and all insured banks and thrifts
that are members of holding companies with $250 million or more in bank and thrift assets must report this information
for small business and small farm loans outstanding beginning December 31, 1995. Banks and thrifts with fewer assets
that wish to be evaluated under 12 CFR 563e.22 through 563e.24 must also report this information. Only provide information
on business or farm location and borrower information for loans for which applications were submitted after July
1, 1995. For loans for which applications were submitted before that date, enter ``N/A'' for all information relating
to location or borrower. 



II. Types of Loans to be Reported 



The loan register should contain individual loan data on each small business or small farm loan as defined on schedule
SB of the December 31 Thrift Financial Report. Include data on individual small business loans with original loan
amounts of $1 million or less and individual small farm loans with original loan amounts of $500,000 or less that had
an outstanding balance as of December 31. 



III. Submission of Data 



The data must be submitted in machine-readable form consistent with requirements for submission of data pursuant
to 12 CFR Part 203 (Regulation C). The format must conform exactly to the form, including the order of columns, column
headings, etc. Contact your federal supervisory agency for information regarding procedures and technical specifications
for automated data submission. 

Your institution should decide on the procedure it wants to follow for collection of the data consistent with the Supplemental
Instructions For Collection Of Data In Connection with Small Business and Small Farm Loans. Keep in mind that data
reported on the register are outstandings as of December 31 and not originations as are reported for some other regulatory
purposes. Your institution may collect the data on separate registers at different branches or on separate registers
for different loan types (small business or small farm), but make sure each loan number is unique. Entries need not
be grouped on your registers by MSA, or chronologically, or by census tract, or in any other particular order. 



IV. Instructions for Completion of Register 



Loan Information 



1. Loan Number_Enter an identifying number that can be used to retrieve the loan file. It can be any number (not exceeding
25 characters). Use letters, numerals, or a combination of both. Make sure that all numbers are unique within the institution.
If registers contains data for branch offices, for example, use a letter or a numerical code to identify the loans of
different branches or assign a certain series of numbers to particular branches to avoid duplicate numbers. The use
of the borrower's tax-payer identification number or social security number is strongly discouraged for privacy
reasons. 

2. Outstanding Loan Amount_Enter the outstanding loan amount (balance) as of December 31. Show the amount in thousands
rounding to the nearest thousand. Do not report loans with balances below $500. For example, a loan with a balance of
$500 would be rounded to $1,000; a loan balance of $50,300 would be rounded to $50,000; and a balance of $15,700 would
be rounded to $16,000.

the loan proceeds will be applied (as indicated by borrower) is located. 

1. MSA_For each loan in a MSA, indicate the location of the loan by the four digit MSA number. Enter only the MSA number,
not the MSA name. Use MSA boundaries that were in effect on January 1 of the calendar year for which you are reporting.
A listing of MSAs is available from your regional supervisory agency. (In these instructions, the term MSA refers
to metropolitan statistical area or primary metropolitan statistical area.) For loans outside MSAs, enter ``N/A''.

Supplemental Instructions 
for Collection of Data In Connection With Small Business and Small Farm Loans





A. Format 



Beginning July 1, 1995, financial institutions required to report small business and small farm 
loan registers are to collect information on the racial, ethnic, and gender make-up of applicants 
or borrowers in connection with small business and small farm loans. If you take a written 
application, you should list questions regarding the percent of minority and gender ownership 
on your loan application form or on a separate form completed by the applicant in conjunction 
with an application. If you do not take a written application, you should request the information 
at an appropriate time during the application or origination process; you must request the 
information for each loan you originate even if you did not take a written application. If you 
neither take a written application nor originate the loan, you do not have to request the 
information. See the sample form for recommended format and language. This information is 
to be maintained in the institution's in-house loan files. This information is not to be reported 
to the agency, but is to be used to complete the small business and small farm loan register. 



B. Procedures 



1. You must ask for this information, but cannot require the applicant or borrower to 
provide it. You may not consider whether or not an applicant or borrower has provided this 
information in making your decision whether to extend credit or in setting the terms of credit. 

2. If the applicant or borrower chooses not to provide the information, note this fact on the 
form. 

3. Inform the applicant or borrower that the Federal government is requesting this 
information in order to monitor compliance with Federal statutes that prohibit lenders from 
discriminating on these bases.

Instructions for Completion of the Open- and Closed-End Consumer Loan Registers



This form contains the instructions for completion of the Loan Registers for Open-End Consumer Loans and Closed-End
Consumer Loans. These registers are used in conjunction with the collection of this information as part of the CRA
data collection process. The registers and these instructions are to be used to provide the format in which the data
should be maintained. The data must be maintained in machine-readable form. If you wish to maintain the data in an alternative
format, you must obtain approval from your primary supervisory agency.



I. Who May Maintain A Register



Any insured bank or thrift may, at the institution's option, collect and maintain this information for loans outstanding
beginning December 31, 1995. You need only provide information on borrower location and gross annual income for loans
for which applications were submitted after July 1, 1995. For loans for which applications were submitted before
that date, you may enter ``N/A'' for borrower location and gross annual income.



II. Types of Loans To Be Recorded



If you collect and maintain information on your consumer loans for consideration in your CRA evaluation, you must
provide data on all consumer loans outstanding included in the aggregate consumer loan figure on your December 31
Thrift Financial Report.

Your institution should decide on the procedure it wants to follow for collection of the data. Keep in mind that data
recorded on the registers are outstandings as of December 31 and not originations as are reported for some other regulatory
purposes. Your institution may collect the data on separate registers at different branches, but is required to maintain
the data on separate registers for each of the different consumer loan types (open-end and closed-end). Make sure
the loan numbers are unique.



III. Instructions for Completion of Register



Loan Information



1. Loan Number_Enter an identifying number that can be used to retrieve the loan file. It can be any number (not exceeding
25 characters). Use letters, numerals, or a combination of both. Make sure that all numbers are unique within the institution.
If registers contains data for branch offices, for example, use a letter or a numerical code to identify the loans of
different branches or assign a certain series of numbers to particular branches to avoid duplicate numbers. The use
of the borrower's tax-payer identification number or social security number is strongly discouraged for privacy
reasons.

2. Outstanding Loan Amount_Enter the outstanding loan amount (balance) as of December 31. Show the amount in thousands
rounding to the nearest thousand. Do not report loans with balances below $500. For example, a loan with a balance of
$500 would be rounded to $1,000; a loan balance of $50,300 would be rounded to $50,000; and a balance of $15,700 would
be rounded to $16,000.



Borrower Information



For each loan, identify the location of the borrower. Consumer loans are located in the census tract or block numbering
area where the borrower resides.

1. 

MSA

_For each loan in a MSA, indicate the location of the loan by the four digit MSA number. Enter only the MSA number, not
the MSA name. Use MSA boundaries that were in effect on January 1 of the calendar year for which you are reporting. A listing
of MSAs is available from your regional supervisory agency. (In these instructions, the term MSA refers to metropolitan
statistical area or primary metropolitan statistical area.) For loans outside MSAs, enter ``N/A''.

2. State & County_Use the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) two-digit numerical code for the state
and the three-digit numerical code for the county. These codes are available from your regional supervisory agency.
Do not use the letter abbreviations used by the United States Postal Service.

3. Census Tract/Block Numbering Area_Enter the census tract number or block numbering area from the U.S. Census Bureau's
Census Tract/Street Index for the most recent census reporting period. For addresses not listed in the index, consult
the Census Bureau's census tract outline maps.

4. Gross Annual Income_Enter the gross annual income upon which your institution relied in making the credit decision.
Round all dollar amounts to the nearest thousand.

Home Mortgage Disclosure



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.





</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Board is publishing for public comment proposed changes to Regulation C (Home Mortgage Disclosure) and to the
instructions that financial institutions must use to comply with the annual reporting requirements under the regulation.
The amendments reflect revisions proposed by the Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of Thrift Supervision to their regulations implementing the Community
Reinvestment Act (CRA). Under the joint CRA proposal, banks or savings associations that report data about their
home mortgage lending pursuant to HMDA_and that have assets of $250 million or more, or that are subsidiaries of a holding
company with total banking and thrift assets of $250 million or more_would collect and report geographic information
on loans and loan applications relating to property located outside the MSAs in which the institution has a home or
branch office. Currently, geographic identification is required only within MSAs where these lenders have an office.
Data would be collected and reported in accordance with the instructions in Regulation C. The agencies believe that
these data would provide more geographic detail on home mortgage lending that would facilitate complete CRA assessments
for institutions that do not qualify as small banks or thrifts.





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background



The Board's Regulation C (12 CFR Part 203) implements the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975 (HMDA) (12 U.S.C. 2801


et seq

). HMDA requires most mortgage lenders located in metropolitan areas to collect data about their housing-related
lending activity. Annually, lenders must report that data to their federal supervisory agencies and disclose the
data to the public. The reports and disclosures cover loan originations, applications that do not result in originations
(for example, applications that are denied or withdrawn), and loan purchases. Information reported includes the
location of the property to which the loan or application relates; the race or national origin, gender, and gross annual
income of the borrower or applicant; and the type of purchaser for loans sold in the secondary market.

The federal financial regulatory agencies have proposed amendments to the CRA. The CRA proposal would require banks
or savings associations that report data about their home mortgage lending pursuant to HMDA_and that have assets
of $250 million or more, or that are subsidiaries of a holding company with total banking and thrift assets of $250 million
or more_to collect and report geographic information on loans and applications relating to property located in metropolitan
areas whether or not the institution has a home or branch office there. They will also report geographic information
for property located outside any MSA. (This proposal does not affect the current exemption in  203.3 of Regulation
C for banks and savings associations; for example, institutions whose assets are $10 million or less remain exempt.)
Currently, lenders have the option of collecting this information but are not required to do so. The agencies believe
that these data would provide more geographic detail on home mortgage lending that would facilitate complete CRA
assessments for institutions that do not qualify as small banks or thrifts. The revised final rules would apply to
loan and application data beginning July 1, 1995.

II. Summary of Proposed Amendments 


Set forth below is a section-by-section discussion of the proposed amendments to the regulation. 


Section 203.4_Compilation of Loan Data 


Paragraph (e)_Data Reporting Under CRA 


The proposal would add a new paragraph to implement proposed revisions to the agencies' CRA regulations. Under the
joint CRA proposal, banks or savings associations that report data about their home mortgage lending pursuant to
HMDA_and that have assets of $250 million or more, or that are subsidiaries of a holding company with total banking
and thrift assets of $250 million or more_would collect and report geographic information for all loans and applications,
not just for property in MSAs where the institution has a home or branch office. The requirement also would apply to
property located outside any MSA. The agencies believe that incorporating these reporting requirements in Regulation
C would facilitate compliance for lenders. 


Appendix A_Form and Instructions for Completion of HMDA Loan/Application Register 


V. Instructions for Completion of Loan/Application Register Paragraph C


The Board proposed to add a new paragraph to reflect the proposed CRA reporting requirements for banks and savings
associations with assets of $250 million or more and banks and savings associations that are subsidiaries of a holding
company with total banking and thrift assets of $250 million or more. 


III. Economic Impact Statement 


The Board's Division of Research and Statistics has prepared an economic impact analysis of the proposed amendments.
A copy of the analysis may be obtained from Publications Services, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,
Washington, DC 20551, or by telephone at (202) 452-3245. 


IV. Benefit and Burden of Administrative Compliance Requirements 



With respect to the reporting, disclosure, and other administrative compliance requirements in the proposal, the
Board invites comment on (1) Any administrative burdens that these requirements in the proposal would place on depository
institutions, including small depository institutions and customers of depository institutions; and (2) the benefits
of these requirements in the proposal for depository institutions, their customers, and their communities. 


List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 203 


Banks, Banking, Consumer protection, Federal Reserve System, Mortgages, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.

that have total assets of $250 million or more on the preceding December 31, or are subsidiaries of a holding company
with total banking and thrift assets of $250 million or more, shall also report the location for property located outside
the MSAs in which the institution has a home or branch office.

 

3. Appendix A to part 203 would be amended by adding a new section V.C.7., to read as follows:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Secretary proposes to amend the regulations governing the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program. The
FFEL regulations govern the Federal Stafford Loan Program, the Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (Federal
SLS) Program, the Federal PLUS Program, and the Federal Consolidation Loan Program, collectively referred to as
the Federal Family Education Loan Program. The Federal Stafford Loan, the Federal SLS, the Federal PLUS and the Federal
Consolidation Loan programs are hereinafter referred to as the Stafford, SLS, PLUS and Consolidation Loan programs.
These amendments are needed to conform the FFEL Program regulations to reflect policy decisions made by the Secretary
during development of regulations for the Federal Direct Student Loan Program, hereinafter referred to as the ``Direct
Loan Program.'' 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



The Secretary is proposing to amend 34 CFR Part 682 of the Department's regulations to reflect certain policy decisions
made during development of regulations for the Direct Loan Program. 
As required by section 492(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, (HEA) the Secretary convened a negotiated
rulemaking committee to develop proposed rules for the second and subsequent years of the Direct Loan Program. During
the negotiated rulemaking process, the Department, at the request of the negotiators, agreed to make changes in the
FFEL Program to conform to policies and procedures adopted in the Direct Loan Program, wherever possible, to provide
a consistent approach in both programs. In addition, some of these changes are necessary to ensure that the terms,
conditions and benefits of FFEL Program loans and Direct Loans are the same, in accordance with Section 455(a)(1)
of the HEA. These proposed regulations reflect those changes that would affect the FFEL Program. In addition, the
Secretary invites comments on other provisions of the FFEL Program regulations that should be revised to conform
with the Direct Loan Program provisions. The proposed Direct Loan Program regulations were published as a separate
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on August 18, 1994, 59 FR 42646. 

This NPRM also proposes to delete certain regulatory provisions in 34 CFR Part 682 which duplicate or conflict with
other regulations. Specifically, the Secretary proposes to delete regulations governing the determination of
a student's withdrawal date and institutional refund policies.

These regulations will improve the efficiency of the Federal student aid programs and, by so doing, improve their
capacity to enhance opportunities for postsecondary education. Encouraging students to graduate from high school
and to pursue high quality postsecondary education are important elements of the National Education Goals. 

The student aid programs also enable both current and future workers to have the opportunity to acquire both basic
and technologically advanced skills needed for today's and tomorrow's workplace. They provide the financial means
for an increasing number of Americans to receive an education that will prepare them to think critically, communicate
effectively, and solve 
problems efficiently, as called for in the National Education Goals. 



Proposed Regulatory Changes 



The Secretary proposes to amend the following sections of the regulations to reflect changes needed to conform the
FFEL Program to the proposed regulations for the Direct Loan Program. Those changes not related to the Direct Loan
Program are otherwise noted. 



Section 682.200 Definitions 





Estimated cost of attendance

_The Secretary proposes to delete this definition from this section. This definition will be added as an appendix
to the Student Assistance General Provisions regulations at 34 CFR Part 668. 



Estimated financial assistance

_Language that was inadvertently deleted from the FFEL Program final regulations published on June 28, 1994 (59 FR
33334) has been restored and slightly revised. This change would make the regulations consistent with the current
definition in the Direct Loan Program NPRM and the definition previously included in the December 18, 1992 FFEL regulations,
with a minor revision to reflect the 1993 statutory change that includes the amount of the origination fee and the insurance
premium in calculating the student's cost of attendance. 



Section 682.201 Eligible borrowers 



Section 682.201(a)(4)(i)_The Secretary proposes to remove the requirement that, to receive a new loan, a borrower
must reaffirm any FFEL loan amount that previously was canceled due to the borrower's total and permanent disability.




Section 682.205 Disclosure requirements for lenders 



Section 682.205(a)(2)(ix)_The Secretary proposes to amend the regulations to require a lender to answer questions
from borrowers regarding the loan application process and provide information about the terms and conditions for
consolidating FFEL Program loans and the types of loans that may be consolidated. The Secretary believes that borrower
access to this information is critical in light of the expanded repayment options available to consolidation loan
borrowers. This proposed change is also consistent with the obligation assumed by the Direct Loan servicer in the
Direct Loan Program that, although not specified in Direct Loan Program regulations, is assumed by the servicer as
part of its contract with the Department. 



Section 682.207 Due Diligence in Disbursing a Loan 



Section 682.207(d)(2)(iii)_With regard to late disbursements, the Secretary proposes to permit a lender in certain
circumstances to make a late disbursement more than 60 days after the student ceases to be enrolled at the school on
at least a half-time basis, or after the end of the period of enrollment, as applicable. However, a lender may make a
late disbursement within 30 days after the standard 60-day period provided for in  682.207 only in documented
exceptional circumstances, such as a student's serious, unexpected illness, 
with the prior approval of the guaranty agency. The Secretary has proposed a comparable provision in the Direct Loan
Program. 



Section 682.402 Death, Disability, Closed School, False Certification, and Bankruptcy Payments 



Section 682.402(e)(13)(iii)_The NPRM proposes to simplify the language of this provision to conform to the Direct
Loan Program proposed regulations. 



Section 682.602 Schedule Requirements for Courses of Study by Correspondence 



Section 682.602(a)_The Secretary has modified the language in this section to conform to the Direct Loan Program
proposed regulations. 



Section 682.604 Processing the Borrower's Loan Proceeds and Counseling Borrowers 



Section 682.604(d)(1)(ii)(B)_The Secretary proposes to modify the requirement that the school, as a fiduciary
for the benefit of the student, must retain loan proceeds held at the student's request to assist the student in budgeting,
in a designated trust account. Instead, the regulations propose to allow the school to maintain these funds in a separately-designated
subsidiary account under its general bank account. The Secretary has proposed a comparable provision for the Direct
Loan Program.

<TEXT>
 

Section 682.604(e)(4)_The Secretary proposes to allow a school no more than 45 days after the school's receipt of

a late disbursement of loan proceeds to deliver those loan proceeds to the borrower. 

Section 682.604(f)(1)_The Secretary proposes to change the requirement for counseling first-time borrowers.
A school will not be required to administer initial counseling to a student who has already borrowed under the FFEL
or Direct Loan Program. 



Section 682.605 Determining the Date of a Student's Withdrawal 



Section 682.605_The Secretary proposes to revise this section to clarify that a school must determine the date of
a student's withdrawal by following the procedures in 34 CFR 668.22(i). The Secretary proposes to delete the provisions
regarding leaves of absence. The Secretary's regulations now provide in  668.22 that a student on a leave of
absence is considered to have withdrawn for purposes of the refund calculation. Therefore, the Secretary believes
that, for consistency, such a student should be considered withdrawn for all purposes. 



Section 682.606 Refund Policy 



Section 682.606_The Secretary proposes to delete this section from the FFEL regulations. A school is required to
follow the procedures in 34 CFR 668.22 regarding refund policies for all of the Federal Title IV Student Financial
Assistance Programs. 



Section 682.607 Payment of a Refund to a Lender 



Section 682.607(c)_The Secretary proposes to revise the timely payment requirement to require a school to pay a refund
to the lender within 30 days after the date the school determines that the student has withdrawn under 34 CFR 668.22(i).
This change is proposed in order to conform to existing General Provisions Regulations. 



Executive Order 12866 



1. Assessment of Costs and Benefits. 



These proposed regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order
the Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this regulatory action. 

The potential costs associated with the proposed regulations are those resulting from statutory requirements and
those determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering this program effectively and efficiently. Burdens
specifically associated with information collection requirements, if any, are identified and explained elsewhere
in this preamble under the heading 

Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. 

In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both quantitative and qualitative_of these proposed regulations,
the Secretary has determined that the benefits of the regulations justify the costs. 

The Secretary has also determined that this regulatory action does not unduly interfere with State, local, and tribal
governments in the exercises of their governmental functions. 

To assist the Department in complying with the specific requirements of Executive Order 12866, the Secretary invites
comment on whether there may be further opportunities to reduce any potential costs or increase potential benefits
resulting from these proposed regulations without impeding the effective and efficient
