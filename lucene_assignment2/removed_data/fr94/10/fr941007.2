ACTION:

 Notice of Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty 
Administrative Review. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In response to requests by petitioner, respondents, and a domestic interested party, the Department of Commerce
(the Department) is conducting an administrative review of the antidumping duty order on granular polytetrafluoroethylene
(PTFE) resin from Italy. The review period is August 1, 1992, through July 31, 1993. The review covers one manufacturer/exporter
of this merchandise to the United States, Ausimont S.p.A. As a result of this review, the Department preliminary has
determined that dumping margins exist for this firm. 




We preliminarily have determined that sales have been made below the foreign market value (FMV). If these preliminary
results are adopted in our final results of administrative review, we will instruct U.S. Customs to assess antidumping
duties equal to the difference between the United States price (USP) and the FMV. 


We invite interested parties to comment on these preliminary results.

 </SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 




On August 3, 1993, the Department published in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of ``Opportunity to Request Administrative Review'' (58 FR 41239) of the antidumping duty order on granular
PTFE resin from Italy (53 FR 33163; August 30, 1988). On 
August 27, 1993, E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Company, petitioner in this case, requested an administrative review
of this order in accordance with 19 CFR 353.22(a)(1993). On August 31, 1993, Ausimont S.p.A. and Ausimont U.S.A.,
respondents in this review, and ICI Americas Inc., a domestic interested party, also requested an administrative
review of this order. On 
September 30, 1993, the Department published in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of initiation of this review (58 FR 51053), which covers the period August 1, 1992, through July 31, 1993. The
Department is conducting this administrative review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended
(the Act). The final results of the last administrative review of this order were published in the 

Federal Register

 on 
November 15, 1991 (56 FR 58031). 


Scope of the Review 




Imports covered by the order under review are shipments of granular PTFE resin. This order also covers PTFE wet raw
polymer exported from Italy to the United States (

see Granular Polytetrafluoroethylene Resin from Italy; Final Determination of Circumvention of Antidumping Duty
Order

 (58 FR 26100). This merchandise is classifiable under item number 3904.61.00 of the 

Harmonized Tariff Schedule

 (HTS). Polytetrafluoroethylene dispersions in water and fine powders are not covered by this order. The HTS item
number is provided for convenience and Customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive. 


The review covers one manufacturer/exporter of Italian granular PTFE resin to the United States, Ausimont S.p.A.
The review period is August 1, 1992, through July 31, 1993. 


United States Price 





The Department based United States price (USP) on exporter's sales price (ESP), in accordance with section 772(c)
of the Act, because all sales to unrelated parties were made after importation of the subject merchandise into the
United States. We calculated ESP based on the packed, delivered prices to unrelated purchasers in the United States.
We adjusted these prices for billing adjustments and rebates. We made deductions, where appropriate, for foreign
inland freight and ocean freight, marine insurance, brokerage and handling charges, U.S. duty, U.S. inland freight
from port to warehouse, and U.S. inland freight to customers, in accordance with section 772(d)(2)(A) of the Act.
We made further deductions, where appropriate, for credit expenses, warranties, technical services, and indirect
selling expenses pursuant to section 772(e)(2) of the Act. For sales of granular PTFE resin finished in the United
States from PTFE wet raw polymer imported from Italy, we also deducted, pursuant to section 772(e)(3) of the Act, the
value added in the United States, which consisted of the costs of further processing in the United States and that portion
of the profit on sales of further processed merchandise attributable to the additional processing. 



When comparisons were made to home market sales to which a value-added tax (VAT) was added or in which a VAT was included,
we made an addition to USP for the VAT not collected or rebated on export in accordance with section 772(d)(1)(C) of
the Act and our practice as set forth in 

Silicomanganese from Venezuela; Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value, 


59 FR 31204 (June 17, 1994) (

Silicomanganese

). 


Foreign Market Value 




Based on a comparison of the volume of home market and third-country sales, we determined that the home market was viable.
Therefore, in accordance with section 773(a)(1)(A) of the Act, we based foreign market value (FMV) on the packed,
delivered prices to unrelated customers in Italy or, where appropriate, on constructed value (CV).

We calculated FMV on a monthly, weighted-average basis. Where possible, we compared sales of identical merchandise
in the two markets. For each instance in which identical merchandise was not sold in Italy during the relevant contemporaneous
period, we used as FMV contemporaneous home market sales of the product that was the most similar to the merchandise
involved in the U.S. sale, in accordance with section 771(16) of the Act. Because filled and unfilled resins generally
are not similar in terms of their physical characteristics, we compared, whenever possible, home market sales of
filled resins to U.S. sales of filled resins, and home market sales of unfilled resins to U.S. sales of unfilled resins.
We matched filled resins in the U.S. and home markets according to the amounts and types of fillers in the products sold
and the percentages of those fillers. 

See 
Antidumping Duty Order on Granular Polytetrafluoroethylene Resin from Italy_Analysis Memorandum for Preliminary
Results of Fifth Review,

 August 5, 1994. 
We made adjustments to home market prices for rebates. To adjust for differences in circumstances of sale between
the home market and the United States in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(a), we deducted post-sale inland freight, inland
insurance, and credit expenses from FMV. Where applicable, we made adjustments for differences in the physical characteristics
of the merchandise. We also deducted from FMV indirect selling expenses, in an amount not exceeding the amount of indirect
selling expenses incurred in the United States, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(b)(2). 
In order to adjust for differences in packing between the two markets, we deducted home market packing from FMV and
added U.S. packing to FMV. We also adjusted the amount of the Italian VAT included in FMV in accordance with our decision
in 

Silicomanganese.

 No other adjustments were claimed or allowed. 
In accordance with section 773(a)(2) of the Act, we used CV as the basis for FMV when there were no usable sales of such
or similar merchandise in the home market. 
We calculated CV in accordance with section 773(e) of the Act. We included the cost of materials, fabrication, general
expenses, profit, and packing. To calculate CV we used: (1) actual general expenses, or the statutory minimum of 10
percent of materials and fabrication, whichever was greater; (2) actual profit or the statutory minimum of 8 percent
of materials, fabrication, and general expenses, whichever was greater; and (3) packing costs for merchandise exported
to the United States. Where appropriate, we made adjustments to CV, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56, for differences
in circumstances of sale. We deducted home market direct selling expenses, and home market indirect selling expenses
not exceeding the amount of U.S. indirect selling expenses in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(b)(2). 


Preliminary Results of the Review 


As a result of our comparison of USP with FMV, we preliminarily determine that the following weighted-average dumping
margins exist:

Parties to the proceeding may request disclosure within five days of the date of publication of this notice. Interested
parties may submit a written request for a hearing not later than 10 days after publication of this notice. In accordance
with 19 CFR 353.38(c)(1)(ii), interested parties may submit written comments or arguments in case briefs on these
preliminary results within 30 days of the date of publication. Rebuttal comments, or rebuttal briefs, limited to
arguments raised in written comments or case briefs, may be submitted not later than 37 days after the date of publication.
Any hearing, if requested, will be held approximately 44 days after the date of publication. Copies of written comments
(case briefs) and rebuttal comments (rebuttal briefs) must be served on interested parties in accordance with 19
CFR 353.38(e). 
The Department will publish the final results of this administrative review including the results of its analysis
of issues raised in any case or rebuttal brief or at a hearing. 
The Department shall determine, and the Customs Service shall assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate entries.
Individual differences between USP and FMV may vary from the percentage stated above. Upon completion of this review,
the Department will issue appraisement instructions directly to the Customs Service.

Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective for all shipments of the subject merchandise
entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of the final results of this
administrative review, as provided for by section 751(a)(1) of the Act: (1) the cash deposit rate for the reviewed
company will be the rate established in the final results of this administrative review; (2) for previously reviewed
or investigated companies not listed above, the cash deposit rate will continue to be the company-specific rate published
for the most recent period; (3) if the exporter is not a firm covered in this review, a prior review, or the original less-than-fair-value
(LTFV) investigation, but the manufacturer is, the cash deposit rate will be the rate established for the most recent
period for the manufacturer of the merchandise; and (4) if neither the exporter nor the manufacturer is a firm covered
in this or any previous review conducted by the Department, the cash deposit rate will be the ``all others'' rate, as
set forth below. 

On March 25, 1993, the Court of International Trade (CIT), in 

Floral Trade Council

 v. 

United States,

 822 F. Supp. 766 (CIT 1993), and 

Federal-Mogul Corporation

 v. 

United States,

 822 F. Supp. 782 (CIT 1993), decided that once an ``all others'' rate is established for a company, it can only be changed
through an administrative review. The Department has determined that in order to implement this decision, it is appropriate
to reinstate the original ``all others'' rate from the LTFV investigation (or that rate as amended for correction
of clerical errors or as a result of litigation) in proceedings governed by antidumping duty orders. In proceedings
governed by antidumping findings, unless we are able to ascertain the ``all others'' rate from the original LTFV investigation,
the Department has determined that it is appropriate to adopt the ``new shipper'' rate established in the first final
results of administrative review published by the Department (or that rate as amended for correction of clerical
errors or as a result of litigation) as the ``all others'' rate for the purposes of establishing cash deposits in all
current and future administrative reviews. Because this proceeding is governed by an antidumping duty order, the
``all others'' rate for the purposes of this review will be 46.46 percent, the ``all others'' rate established in the
LTFV investigation (50 FR 26019; June 24, 1985). 

These deposit requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next
administrative review. 

This notice also serves as a preliminary reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file
a certificate regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during
this review period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement
of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties. 
This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1))
and 19 CFR 353.22.

Specifically excluded from the scope of this investigation are plastic and vinyl covered paper clips, butterfly
clips, binder clips, or other paper fasteners that are not made wholly of wire of base metal and are covered under a separate
subheading of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS).

The products subject to this investigation are classifiable under subheading 8305.90.3010 of the HTSUS. Although
the HTSUS subheading is provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this
investigation is dispositive.



Period of Investigation



The period of investigation (POI) is May 1, 1993, through October 31, 1993.



Best Information Available



As stated in the preliminary determination, we have based the duty deposit rate for all exporters other than the three
identified above (the ``all others'' rate) on best information available (BIA). One exporter, Abel Industries,
indicated that it would not participate in the investigation. Further, given that information has not been presented
to the Department to demonstrate otherwise, Abel and all other PRC companies not participating in this investigation
are not entitled to separate dumping margins. As such, because Abel decided not to participate in this investigation,
we are basing the ``All Others'' rate, which will also apply to Abel, on BIA. This is similar to our use of the BIA-based
``All Others'' rate in other recent antidumping duty investigations. (See, e.g., Final Determination of Sales at
Less-Than-Fair-Value: Silicon Carbide From the People's Republic of China (59 FR 22585, May 2, 1994) (Silicon Carbide)).

In determining what to use as BIA, the Department follows a two-tiered methodology, whereby the Department normally
assigns less adverse margins to those respondents that cooperated in an investigation and margins based on more adverse
assumptions for those respondents that did not cooperate in an investigation. As outlined in the Final Determination
of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Hot-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products, Certain Cold-Rolled Carbon Steel
Flat Products, and Certain Cut-to-Length Carbon Steel Plate From Belgium (58 FR 37083, July 9, 1993), when a company
refuses to provide the information requested in the form required, or otherwise significantly impedes the Department's
investigation, it is appropriate for the Department to assign to that company the higher of (a) the highest margin
alleged in the petition, or (b) the highest calculated rate of any respondent in the investigation. Here, since at
least one PRC exporter failed to respond to our questionnaire, and because we presume all exporters to be centrally
controlled absent verified information to the contrary, we are assigning a margin of 126.94 percent (the highest
margin in the petition, as recalculated by the Department for methodological inconsistencies at the time of the initiation
of this case) as BIA to all exporters other than those responding exporters which have shown their independence from
control in common with one or more other exporters of the subject merchandise.



Separate Rates



The three participating exporters, ZMEC, ZLIP and Lansheng, have each requested a separate rate. ZMEC and ZLIP are
companies owned by ``all the people'' and for five of the six months of the POI, Lansheng also was owned by ``all the people.''
In the sixth month, Lansheng was restructured into a share company. To establish whether a firm is sufficiently independent
to be entitled to a separate rate, the Department employs the criteria developed in the Final Determination of Sales
at Less Than Fair Value: Sparklers from the People's Republic of China (56 FR 20588, May 6, 1991) (Sparklers) and amplified
in 

Silicon Carbide.

 Under this analysis, the Department assigns a separate rate only when an exporter can demonstrate the absence of both


de jure


 and 

de facto


 governmental control over export activities.

De Jure Analysis



The PRC laws placed on the record of this case establish that the responsibility for managing companies owned by ``all
the people'' has been transferred from the government to the enterprise itself. These laws include: ``Law of the People's
Republic of China on Industrial Enterprises Owned by the Whole People,'' adopted on April 13, 1988 (1988 Law); ``Regulations
for Transformation of Operational Mechanism of State-Owned Industrial Enterprises,'' approved on August 23, 1992
(1992 Regulations); and the ``Temporary Provisions for Administration of Export Commodities,'' approved on December
21, 1992 (Export Provisions). The 198l8 Law states that enterprises have the right to set their own prices (

see

 Article 26). This principle was restated in the 

1992 Regulations

 (

see

 Article IX). The Export Provisions list those products subject to direct government control. Paper clips do not appear
on the Export Provisions list and are not, therefore, subject to the constraints of these provisions.

Consistent with Silicon Carbide, we determined that the existence of these laws demonstrates that ZMEC and ZLIP,
companies owned by ``all the people,'' are not subject to 

de jure

 control.

Since Lansheng was initially a company owned by ``all the people,'' the laws cited above establish that the government
devolved control over Lansheng by law. The only additional law that may be pertinent to the 

de jure

 analysis of Lansheng as a share company is the Company Law (effective July 1, 1994). While Lansheng indicated that
it was organized consistent with the Company Law, the law did not enter into force until nine months after the POI. In
any event, this law does not alter the government's 

de jure

 devolution of control that occurred when the company was owned by ``all the people.'' Therefore, we have determined
that Lansheng is not subject to 

de jure

 control. 

In light of reports
 indicating that laws shifting control control from the government to the enterprises themselves have not been implemented
uniformly, an analysis of 

de facto

 control is critical to determining whether respondents are, in fact, subject to governmental control.






De Factor Control Analysis



We analyze below the issue of 

de factor

 control based on the criteria set forth in 

Silicon Carbide.





ZMEC



In the course of verification, we confirmed that ZEMC's export prices are neither set by, nor subject to approval,
by any government authority. This point was supported by ZMEC's sales documentation and company correspondence.
We also confirmed, based on examination of documents related to sales negotiations, written agreements and other
correspondence, that ZMEC has the authority to negotiate and sign contracts and other agreements independent of
government authority. We further found that ZMEC retained proceeds from its export sales and made independent decisions
regarding disposition of profits and financing of losses. ZMEC's financial and accounting records as well as joint
venture and purchase contracts supported this conclusion. Finally, we have determined that ZMEC has autonomy from
the central government in making decisions regarding the selection of management. Although ZMEC's appointment
of management is acknowledged by the Zhejiang Machinery Bureau (ZMB), we have concluded that this does not constitute
control by ZMB. Based on our examination of minutes of management nomination meetings, appointment announcements
and correspondence between ZMEC and ZMB, verification established that the ZMB's involvement in ZMEC's management
appointment process reflects nothing more than an administrative formality
. Furthermore, based on examination of correspondence files, we found no evidence of involvement by Zhejiang Commission
of foreign and Economic cooperation (ZCOFTEC), or any other government authority, in any aspect of ZMEC's operations.
For these reasons, we have determined that ZMEC is not subject to 

de facto

 control by governmental authorities.

ZLIP



During verification, our examination of correspondence and sales documentation revealed no evidence that ZLIP's
export prices are set, or subject to approval, by any governmental authority. That ZLIP has the authority to negotiate
and sign contracts and other agreements independent of any government authority was evident from our examination
of correspondence and written agreements and contracts. We also confirmed that ZLIP retained proceeds from its export
sales and made independent decisions regarding disposition of profits and financing of losses (based on our examination
of bank account records, financial records, and purchase contracts).

Based on our examination of management appointment announcements and other correspondence, we have determined
that ZLIP had autonomy from the central government in making decisions regarding the selection of management. According
to ZLIP's company charter, both the general manager and the deputy general manager are appointed by the local administering
authority, the ZCOFTEC. While this may indicate that ZLIP is subject to the control of ZCOFTEC, there is no evidence
that any other exporter of the subject merchandise, is currently under the control of ZCOFTEC. Therefore, we have
concluded that ZLIP is entitled to a separate rate.






Lansheng



In conducting a 

de facto

 analysis of Lansheng, we have examined the factors set forth in 

Silicon Carbide,

 and whether the change in corporate structure alters our conclusion regarding those factors. Lansheng's sales documentation
and correspondence supports the conclusion that no government entity exercises control over Lansheng's export
prices. Additionally, our examination of numerous contracts with domestic and foreign trading companies demonstrates
that Lansheng has the authority to negotiate and sign contracts and other agreements without interference from any
governmental entity. We confirmed during verification that this situation did not change after Lansheng became
a share company.

Before Lensheng became a share company, the general manager of its predecessor company, Shanghai Stationery &
Sporting Goods Import and Export Company (Shanghai Stationery), was elected on February 27, 1993. The election proceeded
in the following manner. First, for every ten employees, there was one elected representative. Second, the representatives
then elected the general manager. Third, once the general manager was elected, the company sent a letter, announcing
the election to the Shanghai Commission of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (Shanghai COFTEC). Shanghai COFTEC
then approved the manager and sent a letter of congratulation to the company. While Shanghai COFTEC technically had
the authority to reject an elected manager, it reportedly had never done so. After Lansheng became a share company,
the same manager continued to lead the company. At the first general shareholder's meeting, when Lansheng's Board
of Directors was elected, the shares held by the State Assets Management Bureau (SAMB) were voted by the general manager
of the former company, Shanghai Stationery. Subsequently, the newly elected Board of Directors appointed the former
general manager as Chairman of the Board for Lansheng (

see

 the Final Concurrence Memorandum in this proceeding, which attaches the Department's report of its verification
of Lansheng in the Antidumping Investigation of Certain Cased Pencils from the PRC). There is no evidence that any
government entity participated in the election of the Board of Directors or the decision to retain current management.

We also found that Lansheng retained proceeds from export sales and made independent decisions regarding the disposition
of profits and financing of losses both before and after becoming a share company. This point was supported through
examination of Lansheng's bank account records and bank loan applications. (

See 

Lansheng's verification report.)

As indicated above, Lansheng's change to a share company did not have any effect on the actual day-to-day operations.
The record shows that, following its conversion to a share company, 25.1 percent of Lansheng's shares were sold publicly,
with the proceeds returning to the company as new capital investment. The remaining 74.9 percent of the shares represents
the value of the assets in the original company, Shanghai Stationery (which was owned by ``all the people''). Evidence
on the record indicates that these remaining shares are held in trust by the SAMB, just as its assets were held in trust
when Lansheng was owned by ``all the people.'' The company's management, which has remained the same throughout its
transition to a share company, votes these shares at the general shareholders' meetings of Lansheng. This evidence
supports the conclusion that, under the new corporate structure, the government has not exerted control over Lansheng
through the exercise of shareholder rights or otherwise; operational control remains in the hands of company management.

Conclusion


In the case of ZMEC and Lansheng, the record demonstrates an absence of 

de jure

 and 

de facto

 government control. With respect to ZLIP, we have determined that ZLIP is not controlled by the central government
and that, although ZLIP may be controlled by ZCOFTEC, ZCOFTEC does not control any other PRC exporter of paper clips.
Accordingly, we determine that each should receive a separate rate.


Fair Value Comparisons


To determine whether sales by the three responding exporters of paper clips from the PRC to the United States were made
at less-than-fair-value prices, we compared the United States price (USP) to the foreign market value (FMV), as specified
in the ``United States Price'' and ``Foreign Market Value'' sections of this notice.


United States Price


USP and ZMEC, ZLIP and Lansheng was calculated on the same basis as in the preliminary determination. The following
adjustments were made to the reported U.S. sales of these exporters pursuant to our findings at verification (

see

 Calculation Memorandum, on file in room B-099 of the Main Commerce Department Building, for details on these
adjustments):
* We adjusted foreign inland freight for ZMEC based on verified distances between factory and port of exportation.
* Minor adjustments were also made to ZMEC's reported ocean freight and marine insurance charges.
* We adjusted ZLIP's and ZMEC's respective USP for unreported bank transactions fees based on findings at
verification.
* In the case of ZMEC, three unreported sales were discovered at verification which were verified and included
in the final determination. Commission fees related to these unreported sales were verified and also included in
the final determination.
* Several CIF sales reported by ZMEC were clarified and verified as C&F sales and considered as such for
the final determination.
* The reported quantity for one of Lansheng's transactions was adjusted.


Foreign Market Value


We calculated FMV based on factors of production cited in the preliminary determination, making adjustments based
on verification findings (

see

 Calculation Memorandum). To calculate FMV, the verified factor amounts were multiplied by the appropriate surrogate
values for the different inputs. We have used the same surrogate values used in the preliminary determination with
the exception of nickel and sodium hydroxide. Instead of using the value for non-alloy nickel bar, we used for this
final determination the value for unwrought nickel, which was found to be the form of nickel used for plating purposes.
We also used a surrogate value for sodium hydroxide in liquid (rather than solid flake) form based on verification
findings. We correctly valued two other proprietary factors whose names had been incorrectly reported.
Based on verification, we adjusted certain factors' values to reflect the actual purity used in the production of
subject merchandise.
We have adjusted the surrogate inland freight charge for transporting factor inputs from supplier to factory to reflect
the surrogate value for the actual quantity being transported. We recalculated inland freight distances between
factory and input supplier based on verified distances for Jiaxing and Fengbin.
For Wuyi and Jiaxing, we used verified packing factor amounts to calculate packing cost for the final calculations.

In the case of Fengbin, three additional proprietary factors of production were identified after the preliminary
determination. These factors were verified and considered for the final determination. In addition, factors of
production, labor and energy used in electroplating subject merchandise were adjusted to reflect allocation based
on actual electroplating process time.

In the case of Jiaxing, verification findings made it possible to calculate type-specific FMVs for No. 1 and Giant
paper clips for the final determination. Reported direct labor was adjusted based on verification findings.

In the case of Wuyi, total reported clip production was found to be overstated at verification and adjustments to factors
of production were made accordingly. For certain factors, adjustments were made to reflect actual amounts consumed
during the POI instead of simple averages. Adjustments were also made to material, labor and electricity factors
used in electroplating subject merchandise, to reflect actual quantities consumed for paper clip plating during
the POI. We also made a downward adjustment to reported electricity usage in the clip production process based on verification
findings.



Surrogate Country



Section 773(c)(4) of the Act requires the Department to value the factors of production, to the extent possible, in
one or more market economy countries that are (1) at a level of economic development comparable to that of the non-market
economy country, and (2) significant producers of comparable merchandise. The Department has determined that India
and Pakistan are the countries most comparable to the PRC in terms of overall economic development. (See memorandum
from the Office of Policy to the file, dated November 29, 1993.) Although India is the preferred surrogate country
for purposes of calculating the factors of production, we have resorted to Pakistan for certain surrogate values
where Indian values were either unavailable or significantly outdated. We have obtained and relied upon published,
publicly available information, wherever possible.



Verification



As provided in section 776(b) of the Act, we verified the information submitted by respondents for use in our final
determination. We used standard verification procedures, including examination of relevant accounting and production
records and original source documents provided by respondents.



Interested Party Comments



Comment 1: PRC Exporters and Separate Rates


ZMEC and ZLIP



Petitioners argue that ZLIP and ZMEC are both subject to control by one or more government agencies in the Zhejiang
Province. Since the ZCOFTEC has the authority under the company charter to appoint ZLIP's general manager and deputy
general manager, petitioners contend that ZLIP's operations are overseen by ZCOFTEC. Petitioners argue that ZMEC
also is under the supervision of the ZCOFTEC since ZCOFTEC communicates with ZMEC, an export trading company located
in the Zhejiang province. Petitioners also note that ZMEC's appointment of its general manager is subject to approval
by another Zhejiang province government agency, the ZMB.

Respondents counter that little evidence is provided to support Petitioners' claim that ZMEC and ZLIP are both subject
to the control of the ZCOFTEC and the ZMB. The fact that the ZCOFTEC communicates to all export trading companies in
the Zhejiang province does not evince governmental control over the companies' operations. with respect to ZMB,
respondents argue that the ZMB's role is also limited to the communication of market information, and statistical
services to companies in the machinery industry. Even though the ZMB has the right under law to object to any general
manager nomination, respondents state that this responsibility does not allow the ZMB total control over ZMEC's
operations. In fact, no evidence was found to indicate that the ZMB has ever actually exercised that right in the case
of ZMEC. Furthermore, respondents note that evidence on the record regarding other aspects of 

de facto

 control demonstrates that both ZLIP and ZMEC clearly are independent from central or provincial government control.
Both companies act independently without governmental interference in setting their own export prices, negotiating
contracts and agreements, and disposing of profits and financing of losses. Respondents argue that the ``totality
of information'' contradicts petitioners' assertions that ZLIP and ZMEC are controlled by the governmental body
and therefore, should not be assigned company-specific, separate rates.

Lansheng



Petitioners contend that the record in this investigation reflects no 

de facto

 evidence of Lansheng's independence from government control. The fact that the SAMB holds 74.5 percent of the shares
in Lansheng allows the SAMB to have absolute control over the selection of the company board of directors and the appointment
of the company's general managers and chairman of the board. Because the SAMB, a governmental agency, has control
over the company's operations, petitioners argue, Lansheng should not be considered for a separate rate.

Respondents argue that the record shows the role of the SAMB in the operation of Lansheng to be extremely limited. The
shares held by the SAMB are ``entrusted'' to the management of the company and, therefore, the SAMB's role is similar
to that of an ``inactive investor'', or title holder. Respondents point to the fact that Lansheng will be free to sell
all of its shares to the public within three years as an indication of the limited role of the SAMB during Lansheng's
transition from a state-owned company to a share company. Respondents state that the functions of the board of directors
and general manager are not governed by the SAMB but are defined in the company's articles of association. Respondents
contend that petitioners fail to recognize that the Department considers evidence relating to all aspects of 

de facto

 control and does not necessarily preclude a respondent from a separate rate based on information dealing with one
aspect of governmental control. According to respondents, evidence regarding other factors of 

de facto

 control further demonstrates that Lansheng's operations are not subject to governmental control by the SAMB or any
other governmental entity. Therefore, respondents argue, Lansheng should be given a separate rate.



DOC Position



We agree with respondents, as explained above in the ``Separate Rates'' section, that each exporter should receive
a separate rate.



Comment 2: Universe of Manufacturers/Sellers



Petitioners argue that only a fraction of the manufacturers and sellers of paper clips in the PRC during the POI participated
in the investigation, and cite several firms which were listed in the petition and submissions by respondents that
did not respond to the questionnaire. Two of these firms are reported as being located in Zhejiang Province, where
ZLIP and ZMEC are located. Petitioners cite several cases stating that all PRC firms owned by the same governmental
authority, and which produced or sold the subject merchandise during the POI, must cooperate in the investigation
in order for respondent firms to receive a separate rate from the Department (see, e.g., Final Determination of Sales
at Less Than Fair Value: Helical Spring Lock Washers from the People's Republic of China (HSLW) (58 FR 48833, September
20, 1993)). Because certain firms mentioned in previous submissions did not participate in the investigation, petitioners
assert that it is impossible for the Department to determine that the respondent firms seeking a separate rate are
actually independent and not related to any other, unidentified or non-participating PRC company involved in the
production and sale of the subject merchandise to the United States.

ZMEC, ZLIP and Lansheng argue that the Department should not preclude them from receiving their own company-specific
separate rate simply because other potentially state-owned paper clip manufactures and exporters did not respond
to the Department's questionnaire. Respondents cite Silicon Carbide, wherein ``state-ownership'' is not considered
to be indicative of common control by a single entity. Respondents assert that any state-owned company is entitled
to a separate rate if it can prove absence of 

de facto

 and 

de jure

 control by a government entity. Firms which refuse to participate or which do not satisfy the above-mentioned separate
rates test are assumed to be under central government control and are assigned a country-wide ``all-others'' rate.
Respondents assert that AMEC, ALIP and Lansheng have established that there is an absence of 

de facto

 and 

de jure

 control by the central government and, therefore, that they qualify for company-specific separate rates, even though
other state-owned firms in the PRC did not participate in the investigation.

DOC Position



We agree with respondents that each participating exporter in this investigation (

i.e.,

 ZMEC, ZLIP and Lansheng) is entitled to its company-specific separate rate regardless of whether other potential
PRC exporters and sellers of subject merchandise participated in this investigation. Petitioners' concern that
all firms that produced paper clips during the POI did not participate in the investigation is misplaced. Each of the
three exporters investigated established that they were independent of any central government control and, therefore,
received a company-specific separate rate. The ``all other'' exporters are presumed to be under central government
control and, therefore, received a single rate, which, in this case, was based on BIA due to Abel's failure to respond
to the questionnaire (

see

 ``Best Information Available'' section of this notice, above). Because the ``all other'' exporters are presumed
to be under central government control and the three responding companies have established that they are not under
central government control, the responding firms and the ``all other'' exporters are not within a common sphere of
control.



Comment 3: Choice of ``All-Others'' Rate



Petitioners assert that the Department incorrectly calculated the margin to be used as the ``all-others'' rate in
the preliminary determination by using the information set forth in the October 13, 1993, petition. Petitioners
assert that the Department should have chosen the highest margin (150.00 percent) set forth in the petition, as amended
on January 26, 1994. According to petitioners, the margin resulting from the amended petition is based on Petitioners'
updated values for certain chemicals used to plate paper clips. Petitioners claim that the January 26, 1994, submission
clarified that the values which the Department had disregarded in adjusting the petition for initiation purposes
were not being used as ``surrogate values'' in the manner in which the Department might apply Indian and Pakistani
values. Petitioners state that the values set forth in the amended petition's exhibits reflect the actual experience
of an affiliate of one of the petitioners in producing wire paper clips in Mexico. Those values were provided because,
given the specialized nature of the particular inputs, petitioners were unable to obtain publicly available published
information from an appropriate surrogate country. By basing these values on the actual experience of petitioners'
affiliate, petitioners claim to have followed the established practice of the Department to permit a petitioner
in an antidumping case to base certain values and costs on petitioners' own experience. Petitioners cited to several
past cases to support this argument (e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Sebacic Acid from
the People's Republic of China (Sebacic Acid) (58 FR 37908, May 31, 1994)).

Respondents request that the Department continue to reject petitioners' unsubstantiated and untimely petition
amendments for purposes of determining the ``all others'' rate. According to respondents, the amended data submitted
by petitioners should not be accepted by the Department since the data is from a Mexican affiliate and this does not
satisfy the requirement that costs submitted under the rubric of ``petitioners' data'' be based on U.S. cost. Second,
respondents contend that the amended data should not be considered for the final determination since petitioners
did not demonstrate that Mexico qualifies as a reasonable surrogate country for the PRC. Finally, respondents claim
that petitioners' amendments to the petition were filed in an untimely fashion.



DOC Position



We agree with respondents and will continue to use the highest margin in the petition, as recalculated by the Department
in the initiation notice (126.94 percent). Petitioners failed to provide any explanation or documentation of their
efforts to find surrogate country value information. Moreover, petitioners' use of Mexican values is tantamount
to selecting Mexico as a surrogate country, regardless of how petitioners choose to characterize their intentions.
Petitioners never explicitly stated why their use of Mexican values is appropriate in light of the Department's hierarchy
for selecting surrogate country economies.

Comment 4: Application of BIA/``All Others'' Rate to Respondents Who Did Not Sell Subject Merchandise to the United
States During the POI



Respondents request that the Department not apply the ``all others'' rate based on BIA to the ten PRC companies that
responded to the Department's November 4, 1993, survey advising that they had not shipped the subject merchandise
to the U.S. during the POI. Because the ``no-shipment'' companies responded to the Department's survey and were cooperative,
respondents argue that the Department should modify the ``all others'' rate with respect to these companies. Respondents
note that the Department did not issue further questionnaires to these companies or otherwise indicate that these
responses were considered to be incomplete. Moreover, respondents assert that the Department was not precluded
from verifying the statements of the ``no-shipment'' companies. Respondents cite 

Olympic Adhesive, Inc.

 v. 

United States,

 where the Court of Appeals Federal Circuit held that ``a `No' answer is a complete answer.''

Therefore, respondents contend, these ten companies complied with Department regulations and should not be given
the same BIA rate as respondents which refused to respond to the Department's questionnaires entirely. Respondents
argue that these companies should be considered cooperative respondents and should not be assigned a margin based
on BIA. Instead, respondents request that these ten companies be given a margin based on a weighted-average of the
other participating exporters' margins.

Petitioners assert that respondents' request that the Department modify the ``all others'' rate for the ten ``no-shipment''
companies should not be granted. First, petitioners state that the Department's recent determinations involving
the PRC assigned companies a rate based on the highest margin stated in the petition because the companies in question
were unable to show entitlement to a separate rate. Petitioners contend that claims by these PRC firms that they did
not produce or sell paper clips exported to the U.S. during the POI is not factual information that can be used by the
Department to calculate an appropriate antidumping margin. Petitioners further argue that any reference to the
use in past cases of a weighted-average of other respondents' margins are inapposite, because the cited determinations
do no discuss a method for assigning an antidumping duty rate to companies which did not submit factual information.
In addition, petitioners state the 1991 determinations cited by respondents have been superseded by more recent
decisions by the Department, in which the highest margin alleged in the petition was selected for firms deemed ineligible
for a separate rate. Petitioners also maintain that the respondents' assertion that the application of the highest
margin alleged in the petition to the no-shipping firms constitutes punitive ``BIA'' is incorrect. Petitioners
counter that the Department regulations authorize the reliance on factual information submitted in support of the
petition, if the Department does not receive a complete, accurate, and timely response to its request for factual
information. Given the lack of factual information from the non-shipping firms, petitioners maintain that the Department
properly assigned to those firms an ``all others'' rate based on factual information from the petition. Finally,
petitioners argue that to give the non-participating firms a rate based on an average of separate rates assigned to
the respondent exporters would reward companies that remained outside of the Department's investigation. Such
firms, by not participating, would actually receive a margin that is lower than half of the responding firms which
submitted factual information.



DOC Position



We agree with petitioners. Even though the ten companies reported that they made no sales of subject merchandise to
the U.S. during the POI, the companies did not take the opportunity to answer the ownership and government control
questions presented in the November 3, 1993, survey and/or complete the Separate Rates attachment of the Department's
questionnaire, which the Department issued both to PRC government agencies and directly to all but one
 of the ten companies. The companies did not respond to the Department's requests for factual information in an accurate
and timely fashion. On the contrary, the companies did not submit any factual information pertaining to their respective
ownership and control status to demonstrate that they are eligible for a separate rate. Therefore, we reject respondents'
request to modify the ``all others'' rate for the ten ``no-shipment'' companies.

Comment 5: Double-Counting of Indirect Expenses in Manufacturers' FMV Calculations



Respondents claim that the Department's preliminary calculation includes the cost of chemical factor inputs used
in the electroplating stage of paper clip production both in the cost of manufacture (

i.e.,

 raw material valuation) and in factory overhead (which was based on an industry-specific income statement in the
Reserve Bank of India Bulletin). Respondents believe that all materials, other than steel, nickel and nickel sulfate,
should be treated by the Department in its final determination as indirect, not direct materials, According to respondents,
these remaining chemicals are used to bathe the unfinished products during the electroplating stage and are not actually
incorporated into the finished product and, therefore, are properly included in factory overhead. In support of
this, respondents cite the Final Determination of Extruded Rubber Thread from Malaysia (57 FR 38465, August 25, 1992)
which stated that a particular input ``is properly treated as variable overhead rather than a direct cost because
if is not part of the finished good.'' Specifically, respondents claim that the factory overhead components of the
income statement included the item ``other manufacturing expenses.'' Respondents maintain that although the income
statement includes a separate line for ``raw materials, components, etc. consumed'', it does not contain any similar
category for indirect materials. Respondents cite additional cases to note the treatment of indirect materials
in past NME cases and request the Department to correct its calculation of cost of manufacture by including only direct
materials in the final determination.

Petitioners contend that the chemical materials used in the electroplating process should be treated as direct materials
in the final determination because respondents have failed to provide any evidence that double-counting actually
did occur. Furthermore, petitioners assert that respondents' argument that plating chemicals are indirect materials
is based on a faulty premise that the chemicals are not physically incorporated into the finished product. According
to petitioners, the chemicals which form the bath used to plate the clips are actually incorporated into the clips
by ensuring the nickel remains attached to the wire. Without these chemicals, the nickel would not stay on the wire.
Petitioners further cite several cases involving the PRC where chemicals used in plating were valued as direct materials.
Petitioners request that the Department follow prior determinations and treat plating chemicals as direct materials.



DOC Position



We agree with petitioners that the chemical inputs in the plating process are direct materials because the chemicals
are physically incorporated into, and become part of, the finished product during the plating process (

see HSLW; 

Final Determination of Sales at Less than fair Value: Chrome-Plated Lug Nuts from the People's Republic of China (56
FR 46153, 10 September 1991) and Sparkers). There is no evidence on the record to prove that the chemical inputs used
in the plating process are actually included in the factory overhead category of ``other manufacturing expenses.''
Therefore, we have treated the chemical inputs as direct materials for the calculations in the final determination.

Comment 6: Treatment of Chemical Inputs Having Lower Concentration Levels



If the Department decides to value plating chemicals as direct materials, respondents request the Department to
adjust the surrogate values of those chemicals (which respondents contend represent values for undiluted products)
to reflect verified actual concentration levels of chemicals used by the manufacturers.

Petitioner argue that no authority exists for the Department to adjust its surrogate value calculations to reflect
the concentration levels of chemical inputs used by the manufacturers because the Department would have to make an
assumption regarding the purity level of the surrogate value selected. In this case, petitioners contend that there
is no information on the record to base the percentage of purity of each of the published values.



DOC Position



The Department is faced with three options in determining the appropriate purity concentration of the chemical factors
in the 

Indian Import Statistics:

 assume the value is based on 100 percent purity for all factors; assume it is based on normal commercial strengths for
chemical factors, as stipulated in the 

Condensed Chemical Dictionary;

 or assume the value is based on verified chemical strengths used by the manufacturers in the plating process. Unlike
in 

Sebacic Acid

 (which petitioners cite for the prospect that the Department should not make unsubstantiated assumptions about
the purity of the Indian import statistics for chemicals, information on the record in this investigation provides
us with the basis upon which to infer purity percentages of Indian imports. Therefore, we have applied commercial
strengths based on the Condensed Chemical Dictionary as the most reasonable method for valuing purity concentration
of these chemical factors for commercial use.



Comment 7: Surrogate Country Value for Nickel and Nickel Sulfate



Respondents contend that the surrogate values for nickel and nickel sulfate used in the preliminary determination
are unreasonable because they represent a price which is approximately four times the international market price
of those inputs. Therefore, respondents request the Department to revise its calculations for the final determination
to adjust the surrogate values for nickel and nickel sulfate.

Petitioners assert that respondents have not standing to criticize the use of the surrogate values since respondents
failed to submit any information on publicly available published information in a timely manner, as requested by
the Department. Moreover, petitioners contend that in past cases involving the PRC, the Department has maintained
that to reject Indian surrogate values simply because respondents allege that those values did not reflect world
market prices would be overly subjective on the part of the Department (

HSLW, Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Sulfanilic Acid from the People's Republic of China

 (57 FR 29705, July 6, 1992)).



DOC Position



We used a value for non-alloy nickel bar in the preliminary determination based on 

Indian Import Statistics.

 After consulting with nickel specialists and conducting independent research, it was discovered that unwrought
nickel is the usual input for nickel plating. Accordingly, we have thus use this value for nickel for our final determination.
In order not to overstate the value of nickel used in the plating process of paper clips, we have used the basket category
for unwrought nickel in the Indian Import Statistics, to calculate the surrogate value of nickel used in the plating
process for the final determination. Because we have learned nothing to call into question the surrogate value used
for nickel sulfate, the value used for that factor remains unchanged.



Comment 8: Response Errors of ZMEC and ZLIP



Petitioners note the failure by ZMEC to report relevant sales during the POI and to account for downward adjustments,
such as related bank charges and commission fees, to U.S. price. Specifically, petitioner cite unreported bank transaction
charges and three unreported sales and their accompanying commission fees discovered during ZMEC's verification.
Petitioners request that the Department account for these omissions and draw, when appropriate, adverse inferences
from respondents' failure to submit the aforementioned information prior to verification.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941007-2-00022 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941007-2-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Petitioners also suggest that bank transaction charges discovered during ZLIP's verification require the Department
to draw adverse inferences.

Respondents contend that the omissions are minor and insignificant, and are consistent in nature with minor errors
found in virtually every verification conducted by the Department. Therefore, respondents conclude that there
is no reasonable basis to warrant the use of ``adverse inferences'' in the final determination.



DOC Position



Petitioners are correct that unreported information discovered at verification must be evaluated in terms of the
relative seriousness of the omission itself and to what extent its discovery calls into question the integrity of
the entire response. However, we agree with respondents. The omissions are minor and do not significantly erode our
confidence in the integrity of ZLIP's or ZMEC's response. Accordingly, the verified information related to these
omissions has been used for the final determination.



Comment 9: Use of Semi-Skilled Labor Rates for PRC Production of Subject Merchandise



Petitioners assert that the Department should use the Indian value for semi-skilled labor, rather than that of unskilled
labor, in determining the value of labor used to produce paper clips in the PRC. Furthermore, according to petitioners,
respondents have failed to support their claim that all labor used in the process was unskilled is not supported by
any evidence on the record.

Respondents counter that verification of all three respondent manufacturers revealed no discrepancies regarding
labor in the forming or electroplating workshops. Therefore, respondents conclude that the record does not support
petitioners' assertion that the Department should use semi-skilled labor rates in the final determination.



DOC Position



We agree with respondents. Verification revealed no reason to infer that respondents' used semi-skilled labor in
the production of paper clips. Further, even if we were to determine the use of semi-skilled labor rates to be appropriate,
petitioners provided no basis for calculating a value for semi-skilled labor in the petition.



Comment 10: Use of Verified Packing Data



Respondents request that the Department use the packing amounts verified at the manufacturers when calculating
the manufacturers' packing material expenses in the final determination. While packing material and packing labor
were verified at Jiaxing and Wuyi, only packing labor was verified at Fengbin. Respondents request that the Department
use an average of packing materials data (from the other two manufacturers), rather than punitive data, for the final
determination with respect to Fengbin's packing materials. Respondents assert that the Department should grant
this request since Fengbin provided complete responses to the Department's questionnaires which were substantially
verified. Furthermore, according to respondents, the use of an average of the verified packing material amounts
would more accurately reflect the experiences of the PRC manufacturers.

Petitioners request that the Department base its calculation of packing expenses on surrogate value information
or on information set forth in the petition. In addition, since Fengbin failed to provide verified packing material
data during this investigation, petitioners request that the Department use as BIA the information contained in
the petition for Fengbin's packing materials.



DOC Position



For Jiaxing and Wuyi, we have used the verified packing material data. It is the Department's practice to use partial
BIA to correct minor data deficiencies. Fengbin's omission from its response of packing material data constitutes
such a deficiency. Therefore, we continue to use the petition's packing material value as BIA for Fengbin's packing
expenses in the final margin calculations.

Continuation of Suspension of Liquidation




In accordance with section 733(d)(1) and 735(c)(4)(B) of the Act, we are directing the Customs Service to continue
to suspend liquidation of all entries of paper clips from the PRC that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for
consumption on or after May 18, 1994, which is the date of publication of our notice of preliminary determination in
the 

Federal Register

. The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or posting of a bond equal to the estimated amount by which the FMV
exceeds the USP as shown below. These suspension of liquidation instructions will remain in effect until further
notice.


The weighted-average dumping margins are as follows:






ITC Notification




In accordance with section 735(d) of the Act, we have notified the International Trade Commission (ITC) of our determination.
As our final determination is affirmative, the ITC will determine whether these imports are materially injuring,
or threaten material injury to, the U.S. industry within 45 days. If the ITC determines that material injury, or threat
of material injury does not exist, the proceeding will be terminated and all securities posted will be refunded or
cancelled. If the ITC determines that such injury does exist, the Department will issue an antidumping duty order
directing Customs officials to assess antidumping duties on all imports of the subject merchandise entered, or withdrawn
from warehouse, for consumption on or after the effective date of the suspension of liquidation.


This determination is published pursuant to section 735(d) of the Act of 19 CFR 353.20(a)(4).

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This Notice of Intent is for the preparation of a Draft Environmental Impact Statement/Draft Environmental Impact
Report (DEIS/DEIR) for proposed combined forces training activities, new equipment utilization, and range modernization
program at Camp Roberts, California. The document will address the combined forces training scenario that includes
a brigade directed exercise involving additional organizational and support personnel, the capability to support
the new modern equipment, including the M2/M3 series of infantry fighting vehicle (known as the Bradley Fighting
Vehicle), the M1A1/A2 family of Abrams tank, the AH64 Apache attack helicopters, and the multiple launch rocket systems
(MLRS), along with the modernization of six ranges (small arms, hand grenade, tank gunnery).



The DEIS/DEIR will address environmental considerations of the various alternatives for accomplishing the proposed
action objectives. The document will analyze the direct and indirect environmental impacts that may be both beneficial
and detrimental. Environmental issues to be addressed include effects on air quality, noise, land use, hazardous
materials, water resources, biological and cultural resources, public health and safety, and social and economic
resources.

Various alternatives have been developed for consideration regarding the proposed projects at Camp Roberts. The
following constitutes a list of those alternatives to be considered in the DEIS:


(1) The use of Fort Hunter Liggett in Monterey County, California, for brigade directed training activities and utilization
of new modern equipment.

(2) The use of Fort Irwin in San Bernardino County, California, for brigade directed training activities and utilization
of new modern equipment.


(3) The No-Action Alternative (do not conduct brigade directed training exercises, modernize ranges, or utilize
new equipment at Camp Roberts).




Scoping

: CARRNG Will conduct public scoping meetings relating to the proposed actions. Dates, times, and locations for the
meetings will be announced through letters, public notices, display advertisements, and releases to newspapers
of general circulation at least 15 days prior to the meetings. The purposes of the public scoping meetings are to:

(1) Provide a description of the proposed action.

(2) Discuss the role of the public in the development of the proposed action and DEIS/DEIR.

(3) Identify potential impacts and issues that should be included in the DEIS/DEIR.

(4) Identify and review process, coordination, or permit requirements associated with the proposal.

Interested individuals, governmental agencies and private organizations are invited to submit information and
comments on this proposed action for consideration by the National Guard Bureau. Information that would assist the
National Guard Bureau in analyzing the potential significant environmental consequences are solicited. This includes
information on other environmental studies planned or completed in the area of Camp Roberts, other alternatives,
potential impacts associated with the proposed action, and recommended mitigation measures.



Concerned individuals and agencies may express their views either by writing to the designated point of contact or
participating in public scoping meetings to be held at convenient locations near Camp Roberts. Those wishing to provide
information or data relevant to the environmental analysis of the proposed actions or alternatives are encouraged
to do so at the public scoping meetings.

Upon the completion, the DEIS/DEIR will be available to the public. The availability of these documents will be announced
by means of public notices so that all interested parties may review and comment on the documents.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

A study of the modification of the Kissimmee River Project headquarters is authorized for the ecosystem restoration
of the Kissimmee River, Florida. The studied action is necessary to restore historical flows to the Kissimmee River
Lower Basin while optimizing fish and wildlife habitat in the Upper Basin.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The study, named the Headwaters Revitalization Study, was addressed generally by an integrated feasibility report
and final Environmental Impact Statement filed with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency January 17, 1992 (57
FR 2093). The present study is to formulate a plan to optimize environmental improvements to the Upper Kissimmee Basin
while re-establishing discharges to the Lower Basin that are necessary to restore the ecological integrity of the
Kissimmee River.


Increasing the levels of Lakes Kissimmee, Cypress and Hatchineah is under study. A preliminary proposal is to increase
the controlled upper water level from 52.5 to 54.0 feet NGVD, with the lower level remaining at 48.5 feet NGVD. Additionally,
the scheduled would be zoned to provide discharges based on season and water levels. The revised schedule would seasonally
reflood land between elevations 52.5 and 54.0 feet in the Upper Basin.
The revised schedule is expected to increase seasonal water storage capacity by 100,000 acre-feet, according to
studies by the SFWMD, and to provide for greater, and more natural fluctuations of water levels in the lakes. Additionally,
the studied regulation schedule is expected to provide capability to simulate the historic seasonal flow from Lake
Kissimmee to the Lower Basin. This capability is a prerequisite for successful restoration of the Lower Basin ecosystem.
Alternative plans consist of ``no action,'' i.e., leaving the existing Upper Basin works in place and operating with
the present schedules, and combinations of the following:
Different modifications of the Upper Chain of Lakes regulation schedules, C-34, C-35, C-36, and
C-37 enlargement, and
Acquistion of real estate interests to acquire rights to reflood land below evaluation 54.0 feet.
The study will address the effects of higher water levels on private property, agricultural and commercial interests,
public works, cultural resources including historical structures, recreation, aesthetics, water quality, and
fish and wildlife in the Upper Basin and effects on the Kissimmee River Restoration Plan. Tributary lakes Rosalie,
Tiger and Jackson may be affected by the studied change, and effects on these lakes will also be considered.
Scoping of this study was started with a letter dated July 16, 1992, to all known interested parties, based on responses
to the integrated feasibility report and final EIS cited above. The letter described the studied action and reasonable
alternatives conceived at that time. The public and affected state and federal agencies will be further involved
in scoping through workshops to obtain information and concerns from agencies and the public and to share planning
concepts and procedures. The workshops have not been scheduled, but will be announced through mailings and public
media notices. Additionally, a series of public hearings will be scheduled after circulation of the draft report
and EIS and before completion of the final reports and EIS.
The study is being conducted with the participation of the South Florida Water Management District (local sponsor),
and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission, Florida Department of Natural
Resources, and Florida Department of Environmental Regulation. The U.S. Department of Agricultural Soil Conservation
Service has met with planners and expressed concerns over the potential seasonal loss of wetland pasturage and the
effect on water quality and fish and wildlife habitat. Further participation is invited from federal, state and local
agencies, affected Indian tribes, and other private organizations and parties.
The Project Modification Report and DEIS are scheduled for availability to the public in March 1995.

<DOCTITLE>Record of Decision (ROD) To Approve the Miramar Landfill General Development Plan (GDP) and Phase I Projects Including
the Fiesta Island Replacement Project/Northern Sludge Processing Facility (FIRP/NSPF) and West Miramar Landfill
Overburden Disposal (WMLOD), at Naval Air Station, Miramar, San Diego, CA</DOCTITLE>



Pursuant to Section 102(2)(c) of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 and the Council on Environmental
Quality Regulations (40 CFR part 1500-1508), the Department of the Navy announces its decision to approve the
Miramar Landfill General Development Plan (GDP) proposed to be implemented within the boundaries of Naval Air Station
(NAS) Miramar; and, more specifically, approve a land lease agreement with the City of San Diego. The GDP provides
a comprehensive framework for several related waste management projects which are proposed to be implemented in
three phases over the course of several years.

Consistent with the intent of 40 CFR 1500.4(i), the environmental impact statement (EIS) analysis for the GDP used
a tiered approach to provide: (1) Programmatic consideration of the overall framework of the GDP; and, (2) detailed,
project-specific analysis of the GDP-Phase I elements which are proposed for near-term implementation.

This ROD addresses the Department of the Navy approval of the Preferred Alternative identified in Parts I and II of
the Draft and Final EIS, with some refinements related to the phased implementation of specific elements. Alternatives
to the overall GDP and alternatives to the Phase I project-specific elements were described in the EIS and are summarized
below.



GDP Alternatives



The proposed GDP encompasses a variety of projects including the relocation or modification of several existing
facilities at the Miramar Landfill and the development of several new facilities. Relocated/modified facilities
include: Recycling center, greens/woods recycling operation, landfill entrance fee booth, vehicle maintenance
facility, fuel pipeline, and the landfill access road. New facilities include a sludge processing facility and related
pipelines/utilities, a materials recovery facility, an access road to new facilities, an environmental complex,
a cogeneration plant, a paper processing plant, a household hazardous waste processing station, a public tipping
deck, landfill siltation basins, and a landscaping/revegetation nursery. The GDP also includes projects related
to the mounding of grading overburden at three locations within the study area. The three mounding areas are proposed
on the closed South Miramar Landfill and are referred to by their relative location on the landfill: North, West, and
East Mounding Areas. Approximately six million cubic yards of overburden from excavation of the West Miramar Landfill
is proposed to be placed at the three mounding areas. In addition, approximately 540,000 cubic yards of overburden
from the grading of the proposed sludge processing facility will be mounded at the West Mounding Area. Use of the North
Mounding Area will occur as described in the EIS. Use of the North Mounding Area will occur as described in the EIS. Use
of the East and West Mounding Areas will occur according to project phasing modifications described below.

The Proposed GDP includes elements which are integral parts of a comprehensive program for the management of solid
and liquid waste by the City of San Diego (City). The various elements of the GDP serve to meet specific waste management
needs of the City and to comply with state and federal requirements for wastewater treatment standards, landfill
operation standards, recycling, and hazardous waste collection. A key benefit and emphasis of the GDP relates to
centralized collocation of the GDP elements. Examples of the efficiencies and benefits of the collocation aspect
of the GDP were provided in Part I of the EIS.

The No Action Alternative was considered within the EIS. This alternative was rejected because, without implementation
of the GDP, the objective of an integrated waste management program for the City would not be met. This would result
in inefficiencies and inabilities in dealing with the ongoing waste management needs of the City and would continue
legal, environmental, and regulatory conflicts.

Alternative sites were considered but rejected in favor of the Proposed Project because they failed to meet the basic
siting criteria. Such criteria include the site's ability to support all of the GDP elements so that the collocation
benefits are realized, the site's location being within the solid wasteshed it would serve, the site's location relative
to the ability to pipe/transfer sludge, and the City's current uses on the GDP site.

Alternative technologies for certain elements of the GDP were also considered. In general, they were found to be complimentary
to, rather than alternatives to, the technologies which are proposed within the GDP.

Mitigation measures for the proposed GDP are identified in the EIS. For Phase I elements of the GDP which are proposed
for near-term implementation, and where sufficient design specifications support a detailed examination of impacts,
specific mitigation requirements are identified within the project-specific analysis. For GDP elements which
are still in a conceptual stage, more generalized mitigation criteria are identified. In conjunction with the completion
of future Phase II project specific environmental documentation, a determination will be made whether further mitigation
requirements are warranted.

The Proposed GDP Project is considered to be the environmentally preferred alternative. It is the only alternative
which meets the basic purpose, need, and objectives of the project. The mitigation framework of the Proposed GDP also
serves to substantially lessen potential environmental impacts by identifying specific requirements for the near-term
elements, establishing general mitigation criteria for the conceptual elements, and anticipating the development
of more detailed mitigation measures for future levels of planning.



FIRMP/NSPF and WMLOD Alternatives



Part II of the EIS provided detailed consideration of two projects of the GDP comprising Phase I elements: (1) the Fiesta
Island Replacement Project/Northern Sludge Processing Facility (FIRP/NSPF); and (2) West Miramar Landfill Overburden
Disposal (WMLOD).



FIRP/NSPF



The key components of FIRP/NSPF include: (1) The FIRP/NSPF Site, a 30+ acre site, located northwest of the Convoy/SR-52
interchange, which will be developed with the storage tanks, centrifuges, sludge drying equipment, and associated
facilities for the treatment of sludge and biosolids from the Point Loma Wastewater Treatment Plant and from the North
City Water Reclamation Plant (NCWRP); (2) FIRP/NSPF Overburden Disposal/Mounding_The excavation of approximately
540,000 cubic yards of earth from the FIRP/NSPF site and mounding of the overburden at the nearby west mound site; (3)
Access Road_Construction of a main access road from Convoy Street to the FIRP/NSPF site; and (4) FIRP/NSPF Pipeline
Corridor_A 4-mile pipeline route from Miramar Road to the FIRP/NSPF site for the installation of a parallel pipeline
system (e.g., one pipeline for sludge and one pipeline for reclaimed water) connecting to the NCWRP. Alternatives
for FIRP/NSPF include the No Action Alternative and several alternatives which are particular to the individual
elements of FIRP/NSPF.

The No Action Alternative was rejected in favor of the Proposed Project based on its failure to meet the basic purpose,
need and objectives of the project. It was also rejected because continued reliance on the existing Fiesta Island
sludge processing facility would result in a number of legal, technical, environmental, and land use conflicts.

Alternative sites for the FIRP/NSPF were considered in comparison to the Proposed Project. They were found to be either
more environmentally constrained, less efficient, or not as responsive to the basic project objectives.

Alternatives for dealing with the site grading overburden were considered. They included mounding the overburden
on NAS Miramar and trucking overburden off the station. The onsite mounding alternative is the preferred alternative
based on fewer air quality and traffic impacts and reduced costs as compared to the offsite haul option.

Three alternatives for the site access road were analyzed: Northern Access Route; Central Access Route; and Southern
Access Route. The Southern Access Route with a temporary Central Construction Road is the alignment selected.

<TEXT>
 

Alternative alignments of the FIRP/NSPF Pipeline Corridor were considered. The Proposed Pipeline Project achieves
the best balance of feasibility and environmental sensitivity, especially relative to avoiding coastal sage scrub
and vernal pools.

Overall, the Proposed FIRP/NSPF Project was found to be the only alternative which substantially minimize environmental
degradation and met the basic purpose, need, and objectives of the project. Therefore, it is considered to be the environmentally
preferred alternative.



WMLOD



The Proposed WMLOD Project involves the disposal of approximately 6 million cubic yards of overburden associated
with approved, ongoing excavation at the West Miramar Landfill. The Proposed Project identifies mounding overburden
on three areas (the North, West, and East Mounding Areas) and transporting the overburden from the excavation area
to the mounding areas via an enclosed electric conveyor belt system mounted on steel trusses.

A No Action Alternative was considered and rejected due to potential impacts associated with substantially reducing
or eliminating capacity of the West Miramar Landfill. An alternative of trucking the overburden offsite was considered
and rejected in favor of the Proposed Project based on comparatively greater air quality impacts, traffic impacts,
and costs.

Alternatives for transporting the overburden onsite via scrapers on off-road routes or haul trucks on paved roads
were considered. They were rejected in favor of the Proposed Project based on greater impacts to biological resources
and greater air quality impacts.

Except as discussed below, the proposed WMLOD project is considered to be the environmentally preferred alternative.



FIRP/NSPF and WMLOD Phasing Modification



Since the release of the Final EIS, a modification to the proposed phasing of the FIRP/NSPF and WMLOD projects has occurred.
The modification is a result of consultations between the City, the Department of the Navy, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service (USFWS), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the California Department of Fish and Game relative to potential
direct and indirect impacts to biological resources.

The City, the Department of the Navy, and the resources agencies recognize vernal pools as being a significant biological
resource and agree that impacts to such resources should be avoided when practicable and mitigated/compensated
when impacts are unavoidable. The Final EIS and the USFWS Biological Opinion for the project dated 29 September 1994
establish mitigation measures which address both direct and indirect impacts to vernal pools. Such requirements
include acquiring offsite vernal pools to compensate for the loss of onsite vernal pools and set forth mitigation
ratios based on the specific nature of the impacted vernal pool (i.e., mitigation ratio of 2:1 for impacts to vernal
pools on native soil, a 2:1 ratio for impacts to vernal pools containing San Diego fairy shrimp, a 1:1 ratio for impacts
to vernal pools located on landfill material and having two or more vernal pool indicator species, and a ratio of 0:1
for vernal pools on landfill material having less than two indicator species). The removal of onsite vernal pools
can only occur to the extent that the necessary offsite mitigation has been secured. The phasing modification enhances
the feasibility and timeliness of implementing these mitigation requirements for specific Phase 1 projects.

For the FIRP/NSPF project, the phasing modification will result in the deferral of vernal pool impacts associated
with FIRP/NSPF overburden disposal. The modification would limit the placement of FIRP/NSPF overburden to only
the northeast portion of the West Mounding Area where there are no vernal pools. The modifications would also delete
the East Mound Area from use in Phase I implementation. In conjunction with the reduce ``footprint'' of the FIRP/NSPF
mound, the segment of the Southern Access Road which follows the base of the mound would be realigned to avoid most of
the existing vernal pools. These refinements to the grading program and the associated reduction in vernal pool impacts
enable the City to meet vernal pool mitigation requirements for FIRP/NSPF.

Postponement of WMLOD mounding at the West Mound location will delay the direct impacts to vernal pools and enable
the City to more fully address the vernal pool mitigation requirements currently set forth in the USFWS Biological
Opinion for the project. The ultimate implementation of the vernal pool mitigation requirements for the WMLOD West
Mound may be affected by additional regulatory consideration related to the removal of vernal pools as part of landfill
maintenance; however, any variation from the current Biological Opinion requirements for the WMLOD West Mound would
likely involve a new Section 7 consultation pursuant to the Endangered Species Act.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941007-2-00034 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941007-2-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Reconsideration of mounding at the East Mound location will delay potential direct and indirect impacts to adjacent
vernal pools within the Miramar Mounds Natural Landmark until additional environmental documentation has been
prepared. Such information could be developed within the 3+ years of Phase I WMLOD activity. It is anticipated that
supplemental Section 7 consultation with the USFWS will be required to implement WMLOD activity proposed to occur
as Phase II/III projects.


Biological Opinion


It is the opinion of the USFWS that the Proposed GDP and FIRP/NSPF/WMLOD Projects are not likely to jeopardize the continued
existence of the coastal California gnatcatcher, least Bell's vireo, San Diego fairy shrimp, San Diego button-celery,
or San Diego mesa mint. Mandatory terms and conditions are included in the USFWS Biological Opinion and will be implemented
as part of the Project. The conclusions of the Biological Opinion are made for the following reasons: (1) Direct, indirect,
and cumulative impacts of this proposed action have been minimized and will be compensated; and (2) Direct impacts
to suitable habitat for these species represents a small percentage of the suitable habitat within San Diego County.
Key measures to mitigate impacts to biological resources, as embodied within the EIS and in the Terms and Conditions
of the USFWS Biological Opinion, include, but are not limited to: Resource avoidance measures such as clearly delineating
proposed limits of grading, controlling dust generation and potential erosion/sedimentation, educating construction
personnel about local biological resources and other measures to protect biological resources from direct and indirect
impacts of project development nearby; revegetation requirements for areas of temporary disturbance such as the
FIRP/NSPF pipeline corridor and the overburden disposal mounds; offsite resources acquisition to compensate for
onsite permanent loss of biological resources. This latter requirement particularly relates to vernal pool impacts
and provides for offsite vernal pool acquisition and/or restoration as mitigation for onsite impacts.


Mitigation Monitoring


A comprehensive mitigation monitoring program has been developed in conjunction with the EIS analysis of the GDP
and of the FIRP/NSPF and WMLOD projects and will be implemented through all phases of the project. A copy of the mitigation
monitoring program may be obtained at the address set forth below.


Clean Air Act Conformity Determination


In compliance with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations promulgated through 40 CFR Part 93, the Department
of the Navy included within the EIS an analysis of the project's conformity with the Clean Air Act. The analysis found
that the project emissions, both in terms of emissions for each element of the GDP and for the GDP as a whole (cumulative
emissions), would be below the de minimis levels established by the rule. It should be noted that while the ozone attainment
status for the San Diego Air Basin is currently being revised from ``Severe'' to ``Serious'', the de minimis finding
is based on the more restrictive standard (e.g., project total NOX emissions are less than the 25 tons per year (TPY)
standard for ``Severe'' nonattainment areas; which is well below the 50 TPY standard for ``Serious'' nonattainment
areas).
Questions regarding the action may be directed to: Commanding Officer, NAS Miramar, 45429 Miramar Way, San Diego,
CA 92145-5005 (Attn: Mr. Roger Hillhouse, Staff Civil Engineer, Code 187.RH), telephone (619) 537-1102.

<DOCTITLE>Motor Challenge Showcase Demonstration Projects </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Energy. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice inviting participation. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is interested in obtaining proposals from industrial electric motor system end
users for projects that are intended to demonstrate and ``showcase'' electric motor system energy efficiency, productivity,
and environmental improvement in varied industrial or municipal facilities and settings. Projects selected by
DOE will become ``Showcase Demonstrations'' and are part of a larger, Federally-sponsored (DOE) program that is
an industry-driven collaborative effort called MOTOR CHALLENGE. The experiences and successful results to be gained
from the Showcase Demonstrations will be used to encourage other U.S. industrial companies with similar applications
to adopt efficient electric motor systems, and therefore, to increase the market penetration of efficient electric
motor systems on a widespread basis within the U.S. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The MOTOR CHALLENGE program is designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through increased market penetration
of efficient electric motor systems. It is expected that industry participants will achieve increased electric
motor system efficiency through the system integration of a variety of technology and application options including:
energy efficient electric motors, adjustable speed drives, and motor-driven equipment (e.g., pumps, fans, and
compressors) within industrial operations and processes. DOE is carrying out the MOTOR CHALLENGE program with industrial
and manufacturing companies, municipalities, electric motor and drive manufacturers, original equipment manufacturers
(OEMs), distributors, utilities, energy service companies, research institutes, other Federal agencies, state
energy agencies, public interest groups, and other supporting organizations. DOE will be the Federal agency with
the responsibility of selecting Showcase Demonstration projects, and will then develop an Agreement between the
government and the respective selected companies.

The MOTOR CHALLENGE program was launched on October 19, 1993 by the Federal government (DOE) and industry with the
signing of the MOTOR CHALLENGE Compact (dated October 13, 1993). As stated within the MOTOR CHALLENGE Compact, DOE
would issue an appropriate notice to solicit participants in the MOTOR CHALLENGE Showcase Demonstrations. This
notice satisfies such a commitment by DOE. Projects selected as Showcase Demonstrations by DOE will be those of greater
interest as discussed under the Technical Evaluation Criteria and Review Process section. Project teams selected
to participate will receive a variety of technical assistance from DOE, but will not receive financial assistance
to implement the demonstration projects. Other projects that are evaluated and determined to be technically feasible
and interesting, but are not selected as Showcase Demonstrations, will be recognized by DOE for inclusion as MOTOR
CHALLENGE Case Study Briefs. All Case Study Brief project teams will be encouraged by DOE to continue their efficient
electric motor system deployment. All Case Study Brief teams will be informed of the Showcase Demonstration projects'
progress and experiences. The achievements and successful results from any Case Study Brief project can be recognized
through the voluntary reporting of the energy savings and the associated greenhouse gas emission reductions into
the DOE Electric Motor Systems Database by the industrial end-user project team. 
As one condition of proposing to be a Showcase Demonstration, DOE requires that each company, organization, and/or
agency of a proposing team, simultaneously join the MOTOR CHALLENGE Partnership by submitting an appropriately
completed application. (The availability of application forms is discussed in For Further Information Contact
section above). 


Benefits of Industry Participation 


Industry will receive many benefits to participating as a MOTOR CHALLENGE Showcase Demonstration project team.
The principal benefit of participation is for an individual company to achieve energy efficiency, productivity,
and environmental performance goals faster than otherwise. This will primarily be accomplished by the adoption
of a ``systems approach'' in the way electric motor and drives are utilized within industrial operations and processes.
Participation in the Showcase Demonstration projects provides leveraged access to technical assistance, and more
reliable information. Participants will use the experiences of the Showcase Demonstrations to replicate opportunities
within similar applications. In addition, participants will gain national recognition for taking a leadership
role in a unique industry/government partnership. A secondary benefit of participation is to catalyze and to solidify
strategic alliances among team members that otherwise would be more difficult to initiate and/or to maintain. 
Specifically, the MOTOR CHALLENGE Showcase Demonstration project teams will be provided the following technical
assistance and special access to DOE-funded activities: 


(1) Input to Development of Technical Tools and Best Practices 


DOE will support the development of design-decision tools, best practices, and guidelines on various electric motor
system application topics (e.g., motors, adjustable speed drives, pumps, fans, compressors, etc.). Teams will
provide input to DOE to ensure that the tools, materials, and procedures developed, appropriately meet industry's
design and decision-making, needs and requirements. 


(2) Performance Validation 


DOE will pay for appropriate engineering consulting assistance to advise Showcase Demonstration teams on performance
validation issues. Working jointly with individual teams, the consultants will assist and advise teams on the development
and design of reliable experimental and performance measurement techniques so that the demonstration's costs and
benefits can be validated. At the completion of each project the engineering consultants will prepare an independent
performance validation. 


(3) Case Study Documentation and Dissemination 


DOE will pay for the development and documentation of a comprehensive case history for each Showcase Demonstration,
and will disseminate the case study results subject to team member's and independent performance validator's review
and approval. Likewise, DOE will provide a compendium of Case Study Briefs. 


(4) Access to Experts Group 


Through Oak Ridge National Lab, DOE will assemble an Experts Group of consultants, comprising of experts in, for example,
electric motors, drives, fluid handling equipment, specific process industries, power systems, etc. Reasonable
access to the Experts Group will be provided to the teams to acquire technical assistance and advice. 


(5) Participation in Showcase Demonstration Workshops 


Team members will be invited to DOE-sponsored workshops where all Showcase Demonstration teams will be provided
the opportunity to exchange valuable information and to discuss common implementation experiences with industry
counterparts. These workshops will also serve to inform participants of the latest available technology. 



Benefits to the Government 


The knowledge and experiences of the Showcase Demonstrations will be used in future DOE efforts to assist industry
in replicating and implementing efficient electric motor systems. DOE intends that the long-term result of highlighting
the exemplary and cost-effective benefits of the Showcase Demonstrations is the accelerated and increased market
penetration of efficient electric motor systems within U.S. industry. The deployment of efficient industrial electric
motor systems will contribute significantly to greater energy efficiency, reduced primary/source energy consumption,
deferred new power generation capacity, improved industrial productivity and competitiveness, and enhanced environmental
protection for the United States. 


Eligible Project Teams 




Only industrial or municipal electric motor system ``end-users'' are eligible to submit project preliminary-proposals,


and for those preliminarily-selected as Showcase Demonstrations, final proposals. ``End-users'' are defined
as those companies who own and operate the facility where the demonstration will occur. In addition to end-user participation,
a project team may involve other partners including, but not limited to, motor and drive manufacturers, original
equipment manufacturers (OEMs), distributors, utilities, energy service companies, state energy offices, research
institutions, etc. End-user proposers are encouraged to include such participation. Other non-end user entities
are also encouraged to catalyze and support preliminary-proposal submission by end-user project teams.

Industry Showcase Demonstration Project Team Obligations 



Each proposing project team will themselves provide all the funding to support necessary design, equipment specification,
purchase, and installation for the efficient electric motor systems to be demonstrated, along with all the measurement
equipment and instrumentation to validate and substantiate all claims of performance and benefits achieved. (A
limited amount of supplementary measurement equipment and instrumentation may be provided by DOE). 

Teams will provide DOE with sufficient data to substantiate and document the energy and environmental performance
of the project and the economic benefit/cost of the result. Additionally, teams will provide appropriate information
to DOE to allow for DOE contractors to document a comprehensive case study and to perform an independent performance
validation. For activities within the Showcase Demonstration, DOE will respect all proprietary interests to which
selected demonstration hosts are entitled. These activities will be addressed in the previously referenced Agreement
between DOE and the project team. 



Showcase Demonstration Team's Intellectual Property Rights 



The Agreements to be signed by DOE and each MOTOR CHALLENGE Showcase Demonstration project team does not envision
a commitment by the Participants to perform research and development. DOE's intellectual property policies will
not apply to Participant's inventions because the work performed by the Participants in developing the demonstration
projects for the MOTOR CHALLENGE Showcase Demonstrations are not wholly or partially funded by DOE. Therefore, rights
to intellectual property developed by Participants and demonstrated at the MOTOR CHALLENGE Showcase Demonstrations
will not vest in the United States Government. Language to this effect will be incorporated into any resulting Agreement.




Industry Sector Demonstrations of Interest 



DOE will only consider proposals within the following industrial sectors and standard industrial classifications
(SICs): 




(1) All manufacturing sectors within SICs 20 through 39; 

(2) Agricultural production, crops and livestock (SICs 01 and 02); 

(3) Mining operations_metals, coal, and nonmetallic minerals (SICs 10, 12, and 14); 

(4) Oil and gas extraction and exploration (SIC 13); 

(5) Gas production and distribution (SIC 492); 

(6) Water supply (SIC 494); 

(7) Sewage systems (SIC 4952); 

(8) Irrigation systems (SIC 4971); 



Preliminary-Proposal Submission Format 



Preliminary-proposals are envisioned to be short (about 10 to 20 pages) narratives that set out the principal features
of the intended efficient motor system application. Only limited engineering effort is anticipated to be expended
for these preliminary-proposals. The preliminary-proposal should include the following sections at a minimum:




Section 1_Project Abstract 



A brief abstract of the project should include: 




(a) Project title 

(b) Brief narrative describing the project (1 or 2 sentences); 

(c) Proposing industrial end-user company;

and load] the proposed project is intended to address. Estimates of the energy, environmental, and economic costs
and benefits that might reasonably be expected to result from an assumed successful demonstration [relative to the
present or conventional system], should be presented. Also, extrapolated costs and benefits of the demonstrated
system if it were to be replicated in other similar applications, within the proposer's corporate facilities should
be estimated. 



Section 3_Facility Description 



A description of the facility where the demonstration will occur to include: 





(a) Geographic location; 

(b) The type of product produced or service provided (SIC code, if known); 

(c) The approximate number of people employed at the facility; 

(d) Approximate annual electricity costs. 

(e) The approximate demographics of the motors and drives at the facility (number, range of sizes, types of motors
and drives, typical driven load, etc.). 



Section 4_Technical Approach of Demonstration 



A description of the technical approach of how and where the demonstration will be implemented within the facility
should be explained. The level of complexity of the project should be described. Only technical information that
supports the technical validity and the likelihood of success of the demonstration project should be provided. Also,
a rough description of the technique and methodology to be employed to measure and evaluate the performance of the
demonstration should be provided. 



Section 5_Project Team Qualifications 



The qualifications and role of each participating project team member, company or organization should be described.
A description of key project personnel (project manager, engineering staff, consultants, etc.) qualifications
including relevant skills, work experience, and education should be briefly summarized. 



Section 6_Project Overall Estimated Cost and Resources 



The overall project cost should be estimated along with the approximate cost-share breakdown by all parties providing
resources to the project. 



Section 7_Letter of Intent 



Appropriate upper management within the industrial end-user company must provide a letter of intent to support the
demonstration project. This letter will show evidence that the company upper management (e.g., Vice President,
Engineering Director/Manager, Plant Manager, etc.) is aware, endorses, and is supportive of the project at the proposed
facility, and the company will provide some level of resources to the project, if selected. 



Section 8_MOTOR CHALLENGE Application Forms 



Each participating proposing Showcase Demonstration team member company or organization must join the MOTOR CHALLENGE
program by submitting an appropriately completed application. Applications can be obtained by calling the MOTOR
CHALLENGE hotline number at 1-800-862-2086. This section should contain all completed application
forms. 



Availability of Federal Funds 



Approximately $2 million in FY 1995 of Federal funds is expected to be available to support the activities, authorized
pursuant to Section 2101 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, 42 U.S.C 13451, in support of the Showcase Demonstrations.
These Federal funds will be managed through the DOE Office of Industrial Technologies' Electric Motor Systems program.
Subject to the availability of appropriated funds, up to 25 proposals may be selected as Showcase Demonstrations
in accordance with the evaluation criteria stated below. All selected Showcase Demonstration projects will receive
no Federal financial assistance, but will be provided technical assistance by DOE as stipulated above. 



Technical Evaluation Criteria and Review Process 



Preliminary-proposals and final proposals will be reviewed and technically evaluated by the Review Panel of DOE-selected
experts. The preliminary-proposal evaluation is to preliminarily accept a comprehensive set of projects for which
detailed engineering and final proposals will be prepared as Showcase Demonstration projects. As mentioned above,
other technically-interesting preliminary-proposals that are not selected as Showcase Demonstrations may be
selected as Case Study Briefs. 



Preliminary-Proposal Technical Evaluation Criteria 



All preliminary-proposals submitted in response to this notice will be technically evaluated by four major categories
as follows: 

(Category 1) Overall technical merit. The overall technical merit will consider such factors as: 

(a) The technical description of the proposed Showcase Demonstration project that supports the practicality and
likelihood that the project will achieve success and the benefits claimed; 

(b) The description provided by the proposer as to how the demonstration's performance will be measured. That is,
the proposer must illustrate that reliable and defendable performance measurement techniques will be employed
to ascertain the project's costs and benefits. 

(Category 2) Economic significance if the project were to be successfully replicated within the company and throughout
the United States. Factors to be evaluated that will influence the ability of the Showcase Demonstration to impact
the market are: 

(a) The estimated benefit/cost of the demonstration and some indication of cost-effectiveness (e.g., life-cycle
cost, payback, internal return on investment) of the proposed electric motor and drive system technologies to be
employed. That is, the life-cycle cost advantages of the technology to be demonstrated relative to conventional
technology or systems that would accomplish the same process output, function, or duty;

<TEXT>
 

(b) The qualitative level of productivity gain and non-energy cost savings from the application;
(c) The comparative significance of estimated energy cost savings were the demonstration to be replicated more broadly
at the facility and within the end-user's company. The opportunity for a demonstration to be replicated in like processes,
operations, and facilities, and the order of magnitude of the energy cost savings; 
(Category 3) Energy and environmental impact for the company. The magnitude and technical basis of the energy resource
conservation and environmental benefits of the demonstration should be determined on a qualitative basis by considering
the impact on primary fuel consumption and utilization at the source, even if off-site. (The emission reductions
should be estimated very roughly by showing the relative types and relative amounts of fuels to be saved or used). 
(Category 4) Qualifications of critical personnel on the project team. The qualifications of key personnel on the
project will be evaluated in relation to their skills, work experience, and education relative to the required work
tasks to accomplish the proposed project. 


Preliminary-Proposal Policy and Programmatic Factors and Applications of Greater Interest



DOE will use policy and programmatic factors to select the preliminary-proposals of greater interest. To attempt
to ensure that a broadly representative group of proposals are selected, DOE will seek diversity in the Showcase Demonstrations
selected by considering: geographical location, application type, industry type, and facility size (e.g., annual
electricity costs) of the Showcase Demonstration. 
DOE prefers proposals for projects that are no further along than the engineering design stage. However, if a project
is further along, DOE will consider the project as a Showcase Demonstration candidate, if a reliable and defendable
methodology of establishing a performance baseline of a conventional system is available. For example, if another
conventional system is currently operating, and a performance baseline of the conventional operating system can
be measured and reliably compared to the demonstration project, then this would be acceptable to DOE. 
DOE has identified the following seven broad technical applications as those in which it is most interested in receiving
Showcase Demonstration proposals: 
(1) Applications where new efficient electric motor and drive designs are creatively and cost-effectively integrated
within specific mechanical component systems (e.g., pumps, fans, compressors, etc.), or processes so as to yield
improved energy efficiency, productivity improvement, and reduced life-cycle cost relative to typical conventional
operating systems. 
(2) Applications where an efficient electric motor and drive system replaces a less efficient heat-engine/mechanical
drive system (e.g., steam turbine) to yield primary energy savings, productivity improvement, and environmental
improvement both at the facility and on a global basis. 
(3) New manufacturing production lines where state-of-the-art motor and drive system utilization results in energy
efficiency and productivity improvement compared to similar conventional operations. 
(4) Novel electric motor, drive, and mechanical system retrofits that are more optimally matched to yield overall
improved system energy efficiency, reliability, and productivity improvement. 
(5) Demonstration of exemplary electric motor and drive system management policies and maintenance practices that
result in higher process reliability and gradual, but continual, overall energy efficiency improvement. Topical
areas of interest could be motor repair and rewind techniques, electrical distribution improvement, and mechanical
system maintenance and optimization.

(6) Demonstrations that identify and implement the solution to power quality problems, and by doing so, effectively
increases total system efficiency and productivity. Specifically, projects addressing the impact of power quality
on motor drives and other motor system components which quantify the true cost/benefits of power quality enhancement
with respect to total motor system efficiency, reliability and productivity. 
(7) Implementation and retrofit of efficient motor and drive systems on industrial heating, ventilating, and air
conditioning (HVAC) equipment or motor-driven industrial process heating or cooling systems. These systems should
be integrated creatively and cost-effectively within an entire, or a portion of, an industrial facility or process
to yield improved energy efficiency, reduced life-cycle cost in an environmentally-acceptable manner. [HVAC for
industrial or manufacturing facilities are only of interest, not HVAC for space conditioning of an office or commercial
facility]. 
Projects could involve a single unit of equipment, a unit operation, a series of replicable equipment, an entire process,
or an entire facility. In general, proposals are desired which could lead to demonstrably higher U.S. industrial
productivity, energy efficiency, environmental enhancement, and improved competitiveness once the application
is replicated on a widespread basis throughout the United States. This listing is meant to be illustrative, not exclusive.



Final Proposal Technical Evaluation Criteria and Review Process



The final proposers will be encouraged to develop a fuller, engineered/technical proposal. The final proposals
then submitted will reflect more detailed engineering, energy, environmental, and economic assessment. While
there is no set format for the final proposals as yet, emphasis will be upon: 
(1) The technical soundness and concise explanation of the proposal and its benefits; 
(2) A clear commitment from the proposing team to provide resources for the project; 
(3) The techniques and methodologies envisioned to measure and validate the demonstration's performance; 
(4) The quality of the management plan to reach and achieve the stated goals of the project; 
(5) The potential impact of the project to reduce market barriers and accelerate the deployment of efficient electric
motor systems. 
The recommendations of the technical merit review will be provided by Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the Experts
Review Panel to representatives of the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Industrial Technologies. Final selection
will be made by the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.

<DOCTITLE>Replacement Resources Process, Grand Canyon Protection Act of 1992 </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Western Area Power Administration, DOE. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of public consultation meetings. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On August 8, 1994, Western Area Power Administration (Western) published a notice in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 40357-40359) announcing its intent to initiate a public consultation process to identify methods of
replacing lost Glen Canyon Dam power and to report the findings to Congress, as required by the Grand Canyon Protection
Act (GCP Act) of 1992. (Title XVIII of Pub. L. 102-575). Section 1809 of the GCP Act requires the Secretary of Energy
to consult with representatives of the Colorado River Storage Project power customers, environmental organizations,
seven Colorado River Basin States, and the Secretary of the Interior to identify methods to replace the lost power
from Glen Canyon Dam. 


The Secretary of Energy, acting through Western, has the responsibility of marketing power generated from Glen Canyon
Dam, including power acquired by Western to replace the power lost at Glen Canyon Dam. 
Western now announces that four consultation meetings have been scheduled to provide full opportunity for public
participation. Western has developed an information packet outlining the replacement resources process and the
required report as a starting point for discussions with customers, other stakeholders, and the public. Western
is seeking feedback on: (1) The proposed outline of the process, (2) the proposed content of the report, and (3) the
potential methods to acquire the most cost-effective alternative firm power replacement resources needed to meet
Western's firm contract obligations. 
The information packet will be distributed to identified stakeholders and other publics on Western's mailing list.
To receive this packet or have your name or organization added to the mailing list, call or write Jeffrey McCoy at the
address below. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The GCP Act was enacted to protect environmental resources in Grand Canyon National Park and Glen Canyon National
Recreation Area below Glen Canyon Dam. Operation of Glen Canyon Dam has been modified on an interim basis pending completion
of the Glen Canyon Dam environmental impact statement to assure the protection of these resources. Identifying feasible
replacement power resources will require assessment by Western of the magnitude and timing of the power lost at Glen
Canyon Dam and the cost for replacing it. Western's customers will then decide if they desire Western to replace any
or all of the lost Glen Canyon Dam resource. Such acquisitions might be made by Western on behalf of firm power customers
on a pass-through cost basis. 


Western will use an integrated resource planning approach to acquire long-term replacement resources at the lowest
possible cost. Western will consider a variety of resource options, both supply-side and demand-side, as well as
renewable resources. 
A Replacement Resource Methods Report to Congress detailing Western's findings is to be completed no later than 2
years after implementation of long-term operational criteria at Glen Canyon Dam. Notices of dates and locations
of future consultation opportunities will be published in the 

Federal Register

 and provided to interested stakeholders.

<DOCTITLE>Boulder Canyon Project_Proposed Second Annual Rate Adjustment </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Western Area Power Administration, Department of Energy.

 </AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice to terminate the public process for the proposed Rate WAPA-58-2 and announce that the existing
WAPA-58-1 rates will remain in place until Western Area Power Administration initiates a new annual rate
filing in 1995. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Notice is given by Western Area Power Administration (Western) for termination of the public process for the proposed
Rate WAPA-58-2 for the Boulder Canyon Project (BCP) second annual rate adjustment. The termination of
the public process for the proposed Rate WAPA-58-2 leaves the existing WAPA-58-1 BCP power
rate in effect until Western initiates a new annual rate filing in 1995. 


The public process for the proposed Rate WAPA-58-2 began with a 

Federal Register

 notice published on May 31, 1994 (59 FR 28075), announcing the second annual BCP proposed power rate adjustment. Western
held a public information forum on June 15, 1994, and a public comment forum on July 8, 1994. At the request of the BCP
contractors, Western re-evaluated the annual costs in the power repayment spreadsheet study for the ratesetting
methodology period. As a result of this re-evaluation, Western made the decision to terminate the public process
for the proposed Rate WAPA-58-2. 
The basis for Western's decision to terminate the public process for the proposed Rate WAPA-58-2 is as
follows: (1) The BCP currently has a rate in effect that will satisfy fiscal year (FY) 1994 and FY 1995 annual costs;
and (2) Western believes it is in the final stage of negotiations with the BCP contractors and the Bureau of Reclamation
(Reclamation) concerning an Implementation Agreement, which would provide for a revised methodology for establishing
BCP power rates on an annual basis. 
Under the existing ratesetting methodology, which is the methodology used in the proposed Rate WAPA-58-2,
the power rate is determined by the higher of (1) the 5-year-average rate for the cost evaluation period or (2) the rate
in the first year of the cost evaluation period. The proposed Rate WAPA-58-2 was set by the 5-year-average
rate, which was the higher of these two determinants. 
When Western implements a BCP rate based on the 5-year-average rate, a revenue surplus at year-end is created. The
revenue surplus would disappear under the revised methodology contained in the Implementation Agreement. 

Western's decision to terminate the public process for the proposed Rate WAPA-58-2 is consistent with
the Stipulation Agreement which provides that (1) Western will undertake the appropriate filing(s) before the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to maintain the BCP rates at the FY 1994 (WAPA-58-1) level until September
30, 1995; (2) Reclamation and the BCP contractors agree that neither Reclamation nor any of the BCP contractors will
protest the referenced filing by Western, and this Stipulation may be affixed to said filing as evidence of that agreement;
(3) Western will withdraw the proposed WAPA-58-2 in accordance with 10 CFR 903.21(a)(1) and will proceed
with the filing(s) as referenced above. Such withdrawal shall be without prejudice to any party with respect to the
issues involved in the rate order and the parties will continue their efforts to resolve those issues; and (4) the parties
will use their best efforts to finalize the negotiations of the Implementation Agreement by October 1, 1994. 
Western has consulted informally with FERC staff and is terminating the public process for Rate WAPA-58-2
with this 

Federal Register

 notice. Western will initiate another public process for the next annual rate in 1995. 
FERC approved the Rate Order No. WAPA-58 formula rate on November 3, 1993. The ratesetting methodology approval
period is through September 30, 1997. See FERC's decision at 65 FERC Par 61,186. The Administrator of Western confirmed
and approved Rate WAPA-58-1. The existing WAPA-58-1 BCP composite power rate identified
in Rate Schedule BCP-F4/2 is 12.62 mills per kilowatthour (mills/kWh) comprised of an energy charge of 6.31
mills/kWh and a capacity charge of $1.07 per kilowatt per month. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 By Amendment No. 3 to Delegation Order No. 0204-108, published November 10, 1993 (58 FR 59716), the Secretary
of Energy delegated (1) the authority to develop long-term power and transmission rates on a nonexclusive basis to
the Administrator of Western; (2) the authority to confirm, approve, and place such rates into effect on an interim
basis to the Deputy Secretary of Energy; and (3) the authority to confirm, approve, and place into effect on a final
basis, to remand, or to disapprove power rates to FERC. 


These power rates are established pursuant to the Department of Energy Organization Act (42 U.S.C. 7101 

et seq.

); the Reclamation Act of 1902 (43 U.S.C. 372 

et seq.

), as amended and supplemented by subsequent enactments, particularly section 9(c) of the Reclamation Project Act
of 1939 (43 U.S.C. 485h(c)); the Colorado River Basin Project Act of 1968 (43 U.S.C. 1501 

et seq.

); the Colorado River Storage Project Act of 1956 (43 U.S.C. 620 

et seq.

); the Boulder Canyon Project Act of 1928 (43 U.S.C. 617 

et seq.

); the Boulder Canyon Project Adjustment Act of 1940 (43 U.S.C. 618 

et seq.

); the Hoover Power Plant Act of 1984 (43 U.S.C. 619 

et seq.

); the General Regulations for Power Generation, Operation, Maintenance, and Replacement at the Boulder Canyon
Project, Arizona/Nevada (43 CFR part 431) published in the 

Federal Register

<DOCTITLE>Commercial Mobile Radio Services; California State Petition To Retain Regulatory Authority Over Intrastate Cellular
Service Rates</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Communications Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice; extension of time and permitting replies to revised petitions.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The amendments to the Communications Act in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 preempted state rate and
entry regulation of commercial mobile radio services. States were given the opportunity to file petitions for the
authority to continue regulating these intrastate rates. California filed such a petition and subsequently filed
revisions to that petition. This Order extends the deadlines for reply comments in partial response to a request filed
by the People of the State of California and the Public Utilities Commission of the State of California and allows additional
time to comment on the revised petition. This extension will provide interested parties enough time to complete their
review and submit meaningful replies and additional comments on the issues we raised in this proceeding.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



In the Matter of Petition of People of the State of California and the Public Utilities Commission of the State of California
To Retain Regulatory Authority Over Intrastate Cellular Service Rates.


Order Extending Time and Permitting Replies to Revised Petition



Adopted: September 26, 1994; Released: September 26, 1994.

By the Chief, Private Radio Bureau:

1. Petitioners, People of the State of California and the Public Utilities Commission of the State of California (collectively
California) have filed an emergency motion for a 45-day extension of time from the October 4, 1994 deadline for filing
reply comments.
 For the reasons given below, we grant California some, but not all, of the relief requested.





2. The amendments to the Communications Act in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 preempted state rate
and entry regulation of commercial mobile radio services. A state could, however, obtain intrastate rate regulatory
authority by fling a properly supported petition with the FCC.
 States with existing rate regulation could petition by August 10, 1994 to continue regulating, and would obtain a
stay of statutory preemption until the FCC acted. The Commission has one year in which to rule on the petition and to
decide any reconsideration. California filed such a petition on August 9, 1994. Pursuant to the Commission's rules,
 interested parties had 30 days in which to comment and then 15 days for replies.

3. Petitioners' motion is dated the date comments were due. They stated that they had already received two lengthy
pleadings and expected a substantial number of additional comments.
 In fact, over 1,400 pages of comments and associated pleadings were filed on the California petition. By the time copies
of the pleadings have been obtained, California states that it will have only six or seven business days in which to
review and analyze the record, finalize its comments, and respond to a party's motion addressing confidentiality
issues raised by the petition. Petitioners state that the issues involved are complex and that the proceeding concerns
fundamental state interests. They claim that no party will be prejudiced, and the FCC's ability to meet the one-year
statutory deadline not detrimentally affected, by the requested extension. They believe that the FCC will be well
served by a complete record and careful analysis on the part of California. Petitioners allege that they have shown
good cause for the requested extension.







4. Although it does not object to ``some appropriately brief'' extension, Air Touch Communications argues that the
45-day extension requested by California is excessive and needlessly delays resolution of this proceeding. It states
that rate regulation costs California consumers $250 million per year, contrary to California's claim that no party
will be prejudiced. It states that the pleading cycle in this proceeding was crafted to balance the rights of all parties,
especially the public's right to be relieved of needless regulation.






5. We agree with California that some measure of relief is required. The record in this proceeding is voluminous, and
the issues, including the state of competition and reasonableness of cellular rates in the state, are intricate.
Moreover, California field revisions to its petition on September 13, 1994, which, at our request, included previously
redacted information subsequently determined to be a matter of public record.
 Interested parties may wish to comment on any new material. For these reasons, we conclude that an extension of time
would serve the public interest. On the other hand, the Commission is faced with stringent statutory deadlines in
a complex and massive proceeding. Granting an extension as long as California requests could impair the Commission's
ability to comply with the statutory deadlines. For these reasons, we find that good cause has been shown for a extension
of 15 days. This doubles the reply period permitted to a total of 30 days. We also put all parties on notice that those
who wish to address the revised portions of California's petition should do so in these replies.





6. Pursuant to Section 1.46 of the Commission's Rules, 
 we GRANT IN PART AND DENY IN PART the Emergency Motion of the People of the State of California for a 45
day Extension of Time to File Reply Comments TO THE EXTENT INDICATED HEREIN, and HEREBY EXTEND the time for filing reply
comments UNTIL October 19, 1994. Interest parties ARE PERMITTED to include any comments on the revised petition filed
by California on September 13, 1994 in their reply comments.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 





In the Matter of Petition of the Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control to Retain Regulatory Control of
the Rates of Wholesale Cellular Service Providers in the State of Connecticut; Order



Adopted: September 28, 1994; Released: September 29, 1994.

By the Chief, Private Radio Bureau:

1. Richard Blumenthal, Attorney General of the State of Connecticut, the Connecticut Office of Consumer Counsel,
Connecticut Telephone and Communication Systems, Inc. and Connecticut Mobilecom, Inc. (collectively Movants)
have filed a motion for a 15-day extension of time from the October 4, 1994 deadline for filing reply comments.
 For the reasons given below, we grant the motion.





2. The amendments to the Communications Act in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 preempted state rate

 interested parties had 30 days in which to comment and then 15 days for replies.






3. Movants, who support the petition of the Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control, state that they need
the requested extension to analyze the filings of the parties opposing the petition, which contain ``putative antitrust,
competitive and economic analyses of the cellular markets as well as other testimony.''
 They state that grant of this ``modest'' extension will ensure a complete record in this proceeding and facilitate
a timely Commission decision in the proceeding.







4. We believe that the motion has merit. The record in this proceeding is large, and the issues, including the state
of competition in the cellular market in the state and the reasonableness of rates, intricate. We find that good cause
has been shown for the requested extension.

5. Pursuant to Section 1.46 of the Commission's Rules,
 we GRANT the Joint Motion for Extension of Time of Richard Blumenthal, Attorney General of the State of Connecticut,
the Connecticut Office of Consumer Counsel, Connecticut Telephone and Communication Systems, Inc. and Connecticut
Mobilecom, Inc., AND HEREBY EXTEND the period for filing replies UNTIL October 19, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 





In the Matter of Petition for New York State Public Service Commission to Extend Rate Regulation; Order



Adopted: September 26, 1994; Released: September 26, 1994.

By the Chief, Private Radio Bureau:

1. Petitioner New York Public Service Commission (New York) has filed a motion for a 30-day extension of time from the
October 4, 1994 deadline for filing reply comments.
 For the reasons given below, we grant New York some, but not all, of the relief requested.





2. The amendments to the Communications Act in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 preempted state rate
and entry regulation of commercial mobile radio services. A state could, however, obtain intrastate rate regulatory

 States with existing rate regulation could petition by August 10, 1994 to continue regulating, and would obtain a

any reconsideration. New York filed such a petition on August 9, 1994. Pursuant to the Commission's rules,
 interested parties had 30 days in which to comment and then 15 days for replies.






3. New York states that it needs the requested extension in order to have as much time to respond to the opposition as
other parties were given to respond to its petition. It states that it needs the additional time in order to read and
respond to the voluminous and complex comments filed. It observes that very few of the parties served New York with
their pleadings and that it did not receive a full set until September 22. It states that an extension will not undermine
the Commission's ability to complete the proceeding on a timely basis. New York claims that the complexity of the issues
and the fundamental state interests at stake demonstrate that good cause exists for an extension.






4. We agree with New York that some measure of relief is required. The record in this proceeding is large, and the issues,
including the state of competition and reasonableness of cellular rates in the state, are intricate. For these reasons,
we conclude that an extension of time would serve the public interest. On the other hand, the Commission is faced with

<DOCTITLE>Bank South Corporation, Atlanta, GA, et al.</DOCTITLE>



Bank South Corporation, Atlanta, Georgia; Barnett Banks, Inc., Jacksonville, Florida; SunTrust Banks, Inc., Atlanta,
Georgia; Synovus Financial Corp., Columbus, Georgia; TB&C Bancshares, Inc., Columbus, Georgia; BB&T
Financial Corporation, Wilson, North Carolina; First Citizens Bancshares, Inc., Raleigh, North Carolina; First
Union Corporation, Charlotte, North Carolina; NationsBank Corporation, Charlotte, North Carolina; Southern
National Corporation, Lumberton, North Carolina; and Wachovia Corporation, Winston-Salem, North Carolina (collectively,
Applicants), have applied pursuant to section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8)) (BHC
Act) and  225.23(a) of the Board's Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.23(a)) to expand the data processing services provided
by Southeast Switch, Inc., Maitland, Florida (Company), which operates the Honor electronic funds transfer (EFT)
network pursuant to section 225.25(b)(7) of the Board's Regulation Y. 
Applicants currently engage through Company and its subsidiary, Specialty Network Services, Inc., Maitland, Florida,
in card production and related services to entities that are members of the Honor EFT network. Applicants now propose
to provide card production and related services to entities that are not members of the Honor EFT network. The proposed
card production services would include ordering magnetically striped and integrated circuit plastic cards (including
plastic cards sometimes referred to as stored value cards) from card manufacturers, embossing the cards with the
name and account numbers of cardholders, encoding information on the cards' magnetic strips, hot stamping cards,
and generating and assigning personal identification numbers. Applicants propose to engage in this activity throughout
the United States.


Closely Related to Banking Standard


Section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act provides that a bank holding company may, with Board approval, engage in any activity
``which the Board after due notice and opportunity for hearing has determined (by order or regulation) to be so closely
related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto....'' In determining whether
a proposed activity is closely related to banking for purposes of the BHC Act, the Board considers, 

inter alia

, the matters set forth in 

National Courier Association v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System

, 516 F.2d 1229 (D.C. Cir. 1975). These considerations are:
(1) Whether banks generally have in fact provided the proposed services, 
(2) Whether banks generally provide services that are operationally or functionally so similar to the proposed services
as to equip them particularly well to provide the proposed services, and 
(3) Whether banks generally provide services that are so integrally related to the proposed services as to require
their provision in a specialized form. 

See

 516 F.2d at 1237. 

In addition, the Board may consider any other basis that may demonstrate that the activity has a reasonable or close
relationship to banking or managing or controlling banks. 

Board Statement Regarding Regulation Y

, 49 

FR

 806 (1984).


Applicants maintain that the proposed activities are closely related to banking within the meaning of the BHC Act.
Specifically, Applicants maintain that the Board has previously authorized bank holding companies to provide data
processing services to nonfinancial customers. 

See, e.g., Citicorp

, 72 Federal Reserve Bulletin 497 (1986). In addition, Applicants maintain that the Board has authorized card embossing
and issuance functions with respect to medical benefits cards issued by payer organizations. 

Banc One Corporation

, 80 Federal Reserve Bulletin 139 (1994). In addition, Applicants maintain that the Board has authorized card embossing
and encoding functions with respect to stored value cards for nonfinancial institutions. 

Banc One Corporation

, 79 Federal Reserve Bulletin 1158 (1993). Applicants further maintain that the data embossed on the type of cards
that are the subject of this application are banking, economic, or financial data that permit the cardholder to initiate
or consummate a banking or financial transaction, and that the identity of the customer does not change the financial
nature of the information being encoded and processed.


Proper Incident to Banking Standard


In order to approve the proposal, the Board also must determine that the proposed activities to be conducted by Company
``can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition,
or gains in efficiency, that outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased
or unfair competition, conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices.'' 12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8).
Applicants believe that the proposal will produce public benefits that outweigh any potential adverse effects.
In particular, Applicants maintain that the proposal will enhance customer convenience and efficiency. In addition,
Applicants state that the proposed activities will not result in adverse effects such as an undue concentration of
resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices. 
In publishing the proposal for comment, the Board does not take a position on issues raised by the proposal. Notice
of the proposal is published solely in order to seek the views of interested persons on the issues presented by the application,
and does not represent a determination by the Board that the proposal meets or is likely to meet the standards of the
BHC Act.
Any comments or requests for hearing should be submitted in writing and received by William W. Wiles, Secretary, Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, DC 20551, not later than November 1, 1994. Any request for
a hearing on this application must, as required by  262.3(e) of the Board's Rules of Procedure (12 CFR 262.3(e)), be
accompanied by a statement of the reasons why a written presentation would not suffice in lieu of a hearing, identifying
specifically any questions of fact that are in dispute, summarizing the evidence that would be presented at a hearing,
and indicating how the party commenting would be aggrieved by approval of the proposal.
This application may be inspected at the offices of the Board of Governors, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, or
the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond.

Supersedure and Redelegation of Authority



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, HUD.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of supersedure and redelegation of authority.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice supersedes the Redelegation of Authority published within the 

Federal Register

 Notice of Revocation and Redelegation of Authority (FR-3696), published April 15, 1994 (59 FR 18279); it also
supersedes the January 11, 1994 memorandum to the field from the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing
(PIH) entitled ``Redelegation of Regional Approval Authorities''. The April 15th notice indicated that the Department
would publish additional guidance for HUD field staff concerning their specific functions and responsibilities
under the authorities redelegated to them. This document contains that guidance.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In November of 1993, the Secretary announced the reorganization of HUD's field structure to improve HUD's performance
and provide HUD's customers_members of the public and program beneficiaries_more efficient service and less bureaucracy
by empowering HUD's employees to more effectively serve these customers. In implementing these objectives, the
Secretary determined to remove the Regional organizational layer and provide officials at lower organizational
levels full authority to carry out program functions, with these field office officials reporting directly to program
officials at Headquarters.



On April 15, 1994 (59 FR 18279), the Department published a Notice revoking and redelegating program authority to
meet the objectives of the reorganization for the Office of Public and Indian Housing. The Notice redelegated to Directors
and Deputy Directors of Public Housing in HUD field offices and to Administrators of Field Offices of Native American
Programs all powers and authorities necessary to carry out Office of Public and Indian Housing Programs within their
jurisdictions. This document supersedes the April 15th redelegation, and provides further guidance to field staff
concerning their specific functions and responsibilities under the programs for which all powers and authorities
are hereby redelegated.

Accordingly, the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing supersedes the prior redelegation and redelegates
authority as follows:



Section A. Authority Superseded



The redelegation of authority contained within the revocation and redelegation of authority (FR-3696), published
on April 15, 1994 (59 FR 18279), is hereby superseded by and replaced with this redelegation of authority; the redelegation
contained within the January 11, 1994 memorandum entitled ``Redelegation of Regional Approval Authorities'' from
the Assistant Secretary for PIH to the field offices is also hereby superseded by and replaced with this redelegation
of authority.

Availability of Final Environmental Impact Statement and Request for Comments on the Fair Market Value and Maximum
Economic Recovery; 
Coal Lease Application MTM 80697_Western Energy Company 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Bureau of Land Management, Interior.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Bureau of Land Management announces the availability of the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) for
Western Energy Company's Federal Coal Lease Application MTM 80697 and requests public comment on the fair market
value (FMV) and maximum economic recovery (MER) of certain coal resources it proposes to offer for competitive lease
sale. 


The land included in Coal Lease Application MTM 80697 is located in Rosebud County, Montana, and is described as follows:




T. 1 N., R. 39 W., P.M.M.


Sec. 2: S1/2NW1/4, N1/2NE1/4SE1/4


T. 1 N., R. 40 E., P.M.M.


Sec. 6: Lots 1,2,3,4, 
S1/2N1/2, S1/2 
Sec. 8: E1/2, N1/2NW1/4 
Sec. 14: S1/2SW1/4, SE1/4 


T. 2 N., R. 40 E., P.M.M.


Sec. 32: All 


2,061.00 acres



The Rosebud seam, averaging 22.3 feet thick, is the only economically minable coal seam within the tract. The tract
contains an estimated 35.6 million tons of recoverable reserves. Coal quality, as received, averages 8,360 BTU/lb,
25.52 percent moisture, 10.03 percent ash and 0.97 percent sulfur. This coal bed is being mined in adjoining tracts
by Western Energy Company. 
The FEIS addresses the cultural, socioeconomic and environmental impacts that would likely result from leasing
these federal coal lands, the cumulative impacts of the coal lease application, and the irreversible and irretrievable
commitment of resources involved with this action. 
Three alternatives are addressed in the FEIS: 
Alternative 1_(Preferred)_Lease the 2,061.00 acres of federal coal lands to Western Energy Company as applied for
in the coal lease application with two additional mitigation measures: (1) Establish a 160-foot buffer zone to protect
cultural properties; and (2) Plant trees in the buffer zone to screen the traditional cultural properties from intrusions.

Alternative 2_(No Action)_Reject or deny the coal lease application. The federal coal lands would not be offered
for lease. 
Alternative 3_(Cultural Resource Avoidance)_The coal lease application would be partially approved. Two cultural
properties with values as traditional cultural properties and sites with intangible spiritual attributes would
be avoided by excluding federal coal lands in and around these two sites from the coal lease application. 
The public is invited to submit written comments on the FEIS, the FMV and MER of the tract. 
In addition, notice is also given that a public hearing will be held on Wednesday, November 2, 1994, on the proposed
lease sale, the FMV and MER of the proposed lease tract.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In accordance with the Federal Coal Management regulations 43 CFR 3422 and 3425, not less than 30 days prior to publication
of a notice of sale, the Secretary shall solicit public comments on the proposed sale, FMV, and MER of the proposed lease
tract. Proprietary data marked as confidential may be submitted to the Bureau of Land Management in response to this
solicitation of public comments. Data so marked shall be treated in accordance with the laws and regulations governing
the confidentiality of such information. A copy of the comments submitted by the public on FMV and MER, except those
portions identified as proprietary by the author and meeting exemptions stated in the Freedom of Information Act,
will be available for public inspection at the Bureau of Land Management, 222 North 32nd Street, Billings, Montana,
during regular business hours (9 a.m. to 4 p.m.) Monday through Friday. 


Comments should be sent to the Bureau of Land Management, P.O. Box 36800, Billings, Montana 59107 and should include,
but not necessarily be limited to the following: 
1. The quality and quantity of the coal resources; 
2. The mining method or methods which would achieve MER of the coal including specification of the seams to be mined,
timing and rate of production, restriction to mining and inclusion of the tract in an existing mining operation; 
3. The FMV appraisal including but not limited to the evaluation of the tract as an incremental unit of an existing mine,
selling price of the coal, mining and reclamation costs, net present value discount factors, depreciation and other
tax accounting factors, value of the surface estate and any comparable sales data of similar coal lands. 
The values given above may or may not change as a result of comments received from the public and changes in market conditions
between now and when final economic evaluations are completed.

<DOCTITLE>Intent To Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) on a Proposed 345kV Transmission Line in Texas and New Mexico
</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Interior.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of intent to prepare an EIS and notice of scoping meetings.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In accordance with Section 102(2) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), and 42 U.S.C. 4321, the
Council on Environmental Quality regulations (40 CFR 1500-1508), the BLM, Las Cruces District, will be directing
the preparation of an EIS to be prepared by a third-party contractor on the impacts of the proposed 345kV transmission
line project, the Newman to Port-of-Entry project. The proposed project could affect public and private lands in
El Paso County in western Texas, and Do&ntilde;a Ana County in southwestern New Mexico. BLM's scoping process for
the EIS will include: (1) Identification of issues to be addressed; (2) Identification of viable alternatives; and
(3) Notifying interested groups, individuals and agencies so that additional information concerning these issues
can be obtained. The scoping process will consist of a news release announcing the start of the EIS process; letters
of invitation to participate in the scoping process; and a scoping document which further clarifies the proposed
action, alternatives and significant issues being considered to be distributed to selected parties and available
upon request. In this notice, the BLM announces public scoping meetings for the proposed project. Maps and other information
will be available at these meetings and the public will have the opportunity to ask questions regarding the proposed
project. The public scoping meetings will be held at the following times and locations: 


 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The El Paso Electric Company is proposing to build approximately 45 miles of 345kV transmission line from the Newman
Power Plant in western Texas, north of El Paso, to the planned Port-of-Entry Substation in southwestern New Mexico
in Santa Teresa, approximately 4 miles north of the U.S.-Mexico border. 


A regional environmental study was conducted in 1992. As a result of this study, approximately 100 miles of alternative
corridors were identified as being environmentally and technically satisfactory for transmission line development.
Potential issues include, but may not be limited to, residential and agricultural impacts, sensitive wildlife and
plant species, historical or traditional cultural properties, visual impacts, and electric and magnetic effects.

Lands crossed by the alternative study corridors include those under the jurisdiction of the BLM, Fort Bliss Military
Reservation, State of New Mexico, and the counties of El Paso (Texas) and Do&ntilde;a Ana (New Mexico). 
As part of El Paso Electric's 10-year plan, the proposed project is intended to improve the reliability of the electrical
system. Construction of the proposed transmission line is anticipated to begin in January 1998 and be in operation
by June 1998. 
The objectives of the EIS and related activities will be to study and assess the potential impacts of the proposed project
to various environmental resources including biological (e.g., threatened or endangered species), cultural,
land use, visual, socioeconomic, geology, soils, and surface water. Alternatives that will be considered in the
EIS include routing/siting locations, no action, and others that are identified through the scoping process. 
Because the project study area includes the Fort Bliss Military Reservation, the BLM has invited the Department of
Defense (Fort Bliss) to be a cooperating agency. A memorandum of agreement is anticipated between El Paso Electric,
BLM, and Department of the Army (Fort Bliss). 
It is anticipated that the EIS process will take 18 months and will include public information/scoping meetings;
coordination and 
involvement with appropriate Federal, State, and local agencies; public review and public hearings on the published
draft EIS; a published final EIS and a review period; and publication of a record of decision (ROD). Public information
and scoping meetings will begin in October 1994. Publication of the ROD is anticipated in April 1996.

<DOCTITLE>Proposed Extension of Withdrawal; Opportunity for Public Meeting; California </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Bureau of Land Management, Interior. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Bureau of Land Management proposes to extend Public Land Order No. 6763, which withdrew public lands and public
minerals for protection of Sea Site I, a highly classified, sensitive, electronic warfare installation at the Naval
Weapons Center, China Lake, pending the processing of an Engle Act withdrawal application. The land has been and will
remain open to mineral leasing. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On January 12, 1990, Public Land Order No. 6763 withdrew public lands and public minerals from operation of the public
land laws, including the mining laws, for five years to protect Sea Site I, a highly classified, sensitive, electronic
warfare installation at the Naval Weapons Center, China Lake, California, pending the processing of an Engle Act
withdrawal application. The land has been and will remain open to mineral leasing. This withdrawal exceeds the 5,000
acre limitation and requires legislation under the Engle Act. This legislation has not yet been approved and the segregation
provided by the five year withdrawal will terminate on January 11, 1995. It is proposed that Public Land Order No. 6763
be extended for five years to continue the segregation provided by this withdrawal. 


The following described public lands were withdrawn by Public Land Order No. 6763 to protect Sea Site I: 


Mount Diablo Meridian 


T. 27 S., R. 43 E., 


Secs. 31 to 34, inclusive. 


T. 28 S., R. 43 E., 


Secs. 4 to 9, inclusive; 
Secs. 17 and 18; 
Sec. 19, N1/2N1/2N1/2.

 

The area described contains 7,760 acres in San Bernardino County.

 

The purpose of this proposed extension is to continue the protection of Sea Site I until Congress makes a final determination
on legislation under the Engle Act. 
Until January 5, 1995, all persons who wish to submit comments, suggestions, or objections in connection with the
proposed extension may present their views in writing to the California State Director of the Bureau of Land Management.

Notice is hereby given that an opportunity for a public meeting is accorded in connection with the proposed extension.
Public meetings were held in Ridgecrest, California on February 6 and 16, 1984, and in Lancaster, California on November
15 and 16, 1984 concerning the Navy's application to withdraw Sea Site I. There have been no substantive changes in
either the proposed use of the withdrawn area or the issues involved since these meetings were held. Any parties who
feel that a public meeting would provide important information and should be held, must submit their request and reasons
therefore to the California State Director by January 5, 1995. If the authorized officer determines that a public
meeting will be held, a notice of the time and place will be published in the 

Federal Register

 at least 30 days prior to the scheduled date of the meeting. 
This proposed extension will be processed in accordance with the regulations set forth in 43 CFR part 2310. The proposed
extension of this withdrawal will not authorize any military use of the lands by the Department of the Navy until legislation
under the Engle Act is enacted by Congress.

<USBUREAU>Drug Enforcement Administration</USBUREAU>


Else M. Hillgard, M.D.; Denial of Application


On August 10, 1994, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to Else M. Hillgard, M.D., of Arlington, Virginia, proposing to deny her application
for registration as a practitioner. The Order to Show Cause alleged that Dr. Hillgard's registration would be inconsistent
with the public interest as that term is used in 21 U.S.C. 823(f).
The Order to Show Cause was served on Dr. Hillgard on August 13, 1993. More than thirty days have passed since the Order
to Show Cause was received by Dr. Hillgard. The Drug Enforcement Administration has received no response from Dr.
Hillgard or anyone purporting to represent her. Pursuant to 21 CFR 1301.54(d), the Deputy Administrator finds that
Dr. Hillgard has waived her opportunity for a hearing. Accordingly, under the provisions of 21 CFR 1301.54(e) and
1301.57, the Deputy Administrator enters his final order in this matter without a hearing and based on the investigative
file.
In 1989, a DEA investigation revealed that Dr. Hillgard prescribed controlled substances to several individuals
that were admitted drug abusers. When Dr. Hillgard became aware that she was under investigation for excessive prescribing,
she voluntarily surrendered her DEA Certificate of Registration, AH8248153 on July 25, 1989.
On June 22, 1990, Dr. Hillgard signed a Memorandum of Agreement with DEA in which she was granted a Certificate of Registration
to handle only Schedule II non-narcotic and Schedule IV controlled substances, subject to certain terms and conditions.
On September 4, 1990, DEA issued Dr. Hillgard DEA Certificate of Registration, BH2412687.
In September 1990, the Maryland State Department of Health and Mental Hygiene received information that Dr. Hillgard
was again excessively prescribing controlled substances to known drug abusers for no legitimate medical reason.
As a result, on October 23, 1991, Dr. Hillgard's license to practice medicine was suspended by the Maryland Board of
Physician Quality Assurance (Board). On October 24, 1991, Dr. Hillgard voluntarily surrendered her DEA Certificate
of Registration, BH2412687.
On September 15, 1992, the Board revoked Dr. Hillgard's license to practice medicine. The Board found that Dr. Hillgard
was selling, prescribing, giving away or administering drugs for illegal or illegitimate purposes. Based in part
upon the Board's findings regarding Dr. Hillgard's prescribing practices, and subsequent decision to revoke her
medical license, effective February 28, 1994, Dr. Hillgard's license to practice medicine in the Commonwealth of
Virginia was also revoked.
The Deputy Administrator finds that as of September 15, 1992, Dr. Hillgard's license to practice medicine in the State
of Maryland was revoked, and effective February 28, 1994, her license to practice medicine in the Commonwealth of
Virginia was also revoked. As a result, she is unable to handle controlled substances in the state in which she is registered
with DEA. The Drug Enforcement Administration cannot register or maintain the registration of a practitioner who

Elliott Monroe, M.D., 57 FR 23246 (1992); Bobby Watts, M.D., 53 FR 11919 (1988).

Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested
in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104 (59 FR 23637), hereby orders that the application for registration,

<DOCTITLE>Alaska Pulp Corporation, Rowan Bay Logging, Sitka Pulp Mill, Sitka, AK; Alaska Pulp Corporation, Wrangell Sawmill
Division, Wrangell, AK; Amended Certification Regarding Eligibility to Apply for NAFTA Transitional Adjustment
Assistance</DOCTITLE>



In accordance with Section 250(a), Subchapter D, Chapter 2, Title II, of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 USC 2273),
the Department of Labor issued a Certification for NAFTA Transitional Adjustment Assistance on August 29, 1994,
applicable to all workers of the Alaska Pulp Corporation, Rowan Bay Logging in Sitka, Alaska and the Sitka Pulp Mill
in Sitka, Alaska. The notice will soon be published in the Federal Register

.

At the request of the State Agency the Department reviewed the certification for workers of the subject firm. New findings
show that the Wrangell Sawmill Division is owned by the Alaska Pulp Corporation and a substantial portion of its production
is integrated with the Sitka Pulp mill.

The intent of the Department's certification is to include all workers who were adversely affected by increased imports.
Accordingly, the Department is amending the certification to include the Wrangell Sawmill Division in Wrangell,
Alaska.

The amended notice applicable to NAFTA_00185 is hereby issued as follows:




All workers of the Alaska Pulp Corporation, Rowan Bay Logging, Sitka, Alaska; Sitka Pulp Mill, Sitka, Alaska and the
Wrangell Sawmill Division, Wrangell, Alaska who became totally or partially separated from employment on or after
December 8, 1993 are eligible to apply for NAFTA-TAA under Section 250 of the Trade Act of 1974.

<DOCTITLE>Alaska Pulp Corporation; Sitka Pulp Mill, Sitka, AK; Rowan Bay Logging, Sitka, AK; Wrangell Sawmill Division, Wrangell,
AK; Amended Certification Regarding Eligibility To Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance</DOCTITLE>



In accordance with Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2273) the Department of Labor issued a Certification
of Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance on January 27, 1994, applicable to all workers of the subject
firm. The certification notice was published in the 

Federal Register

 on November 9, 1993 (58 FR 59492). The certification was amended on August 11, 1994 to include Rowan Bay Logging in Sitka,
Alaska.

At the request of the State Agency, the Department again reviewed the certification for workers of the subject firm.


New findings show that the Wrangell Sawmill Division is owned by the Alaska Pulp Corporation and a substantial portion
of the production at Wrangell consisted of wood chips which are integrated into the production of wood pulp at the Alaska
Pulp Corporation In Sitka, Alaska. 




The intent of the Department's certification is to include all workers who were adversely affected by increased imports.
Accordingly, the Department is amending the certification to include the Wrangell Sawmill Division in Wrangell,
Alaska.




The amended notice applicable to TA-W-29,162 is hereby issued as follows:




``All workers of the Alaska Pulp Corporation, Sitka Pulp Mill, Sitka, Alaska, and Rowan Bay Logging, Sitka, Alaska
and the Wrangell Sawmill Division, Wrangell, Alaska who became totally or partially separated from employment on
or after October 15, 1992 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974.''

<DOCTITLE>Jockey International, Inc.; Distribution Center, Kenosha, WI; Notice of Revised Determination on Reopening</DOCTITLE>



On September 21, 1994, the Department, at the request of the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers' Union (ACTWU)
reopened its investigation for the former workers of the subject facility. The initial investigation resulted in
a negative determination on May 24, 1994. The negative determination was published in the 

Federal Register

 on June 14, 1994 (59 FR 30617).




New findings on reopening show that all of the statutory requirements for a worker group certification have been met.




The investigation revealed that the Distribution Center in Kenosha serviced the Jockey sewing plant in Kenosha and
was a substantial part of the company's integrated production process. Workers at Jockey's sewing plant in Kenosha
were certified for TAA on July 30, 1993 under petition, TA-W-28,835.




Workers at the Distribution Center experienced employment declines as a result of the production declines at Jockey's
sewing plant in Kenosha. The Distribution Center closed in May, 1994. Accordingly, the Department is revising its
negative determination for workers at Jockey's Distribution Center in Kenosha, Wisconsin.



Conclusion




After careful consideration of the new facts obtained on reopening, it is concluded that increased imports of articles
like or directly competitive with underwear produced at Jockey International, Inc., Kenosha, Wisconsin contributed
importantly to the employment declines of workers at the Kenosha, Wisconsin Distribution Center of Jockey International,
Incorporated. In accordance with the provisions of the Act, I make the following certification:






``All workers and former workers of Jockey International Inc., Distribution Center in Kenosha, Wisconsin who became
totally or partially separated from employment on or after March 15, 1993 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance
under Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974.''

<DOCTITLE>Weldotron Corporation, Piscataway, NJ; Notice of Affirmative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration</DOCTITLE>



On August 23, 1994, the company requested administrative reconsideration of the Department of Labor's Notice of
Negative Determination Regarding Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance for workers at the subject
firm. The Department's Negative Determination was issued on August 10, 1994 and published in the 

Federal Register

 on August 25, 1994 (59 FR 23866).




The company submitted additional information showing that it sells to dealers not end users and that it has lost market
share. 



Conclusion



After careful review of the application, I conclude that the claim is of sufficient weight to justify reconsideration
of the Department of Labor's prior decision. The application is, therefore, granted.




Signed at Washington, D.C., this 28th day of September 1994.

<USBUREAU>Employment Standards Administration</USBUREAU>
<USBUREAU>Wage and Hour Division</USBUREAU>


<DOCTITLE>Minimum Wages for Federal and Federally Assisted Construction; General Wage Determination Decisions</DOCTITLE>


General wage determination decisions of the Secretary of Labor are issued in accordance with applicable law and are
based on the information obtained by the Department of Labor from its study of local wage conditions and data made available
from other sources. They specify the basic hourly wage rates and fringe benefits which are determined to be prevailing
for the described classes of laborers and mechanics employed on construction projects of a similar character and
in the localities specific therein.
The determinations in these decisions of prevailing rates and fringe benefits have been made in accordance with 29
CFR Part 1, by authority of the Secretary of Labor pursuant to the provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act of March 3, 1931,
as amended (46 Stat. 1494, as amended, 40 U.S.C. 276a) and of other Federal statutes referred to in 29 CFR Part 1, Appendix,
as well as such additional statutes as may from time to time be enacted containing provisions for the payment of wages
determined to be prevailing by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with the Davis-Bacon Act. The prevailing rates
and fringe benefits determined in these decisions shall, in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing statutes,
constitute the minimum wages payable on Federal and federally assisted construction projects to laborers and mechanics
of the specified classes engaged on contract work of the character and in the localities described therein.
Good cause is hereby found for not utilizing notice and public comment procedure thereon prior to the issuance of these
determinations as prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 553 and not providing for the delay in the effective date as prescribed in
that section, because the necessity to issue current construction industry wage determinations frequently and
in large volume causes procedures to be impractical and contrary to the public interest.

General wage determination decisions, and modifications and supersedeas decisions thereto, contain no expiration
dates and are effective from their date of notice in the 

Federal Register

, or on the date written notice is received by the agency, whichever is earlier. These decisions are to be used in accordance
with the provisions of 29 CFR Parts 1 and 5. Accordingly, the applicable decision, together with any modifications
issued, must be made a part of every contract for performance of the described work within the geographic area indicated
as required by an applicable Federal prevailing wage law and 29 CFR part 5. The wage rates and fringe benefits, notice
of which is published herein, and which are contained in the Government Printing Office (GPO) document entitled ``General
Wage Determinations Issued Under The Davis-Bacon And Related Acts,'' shall be the minimum paid by contractors and
subcontractors to laborers and mechanics.
Any person, organization, or governmental agency having an interest in the rates determined as prevailing is encouraged
to submit wage rate and fringe benefit information for consideration by the Department. Further information and
self-explanatory forms for the purpose of submitting this data may be obtained by writing to the U.S. Department of
Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Wage and Hour Division, Division of Wage Determinations, 200 Constitution
Avenue, N.W., Room S-3014, Washington, D.C. 20210.

Grant of Individual Exemptions; New Standard Corporation Pension Plan, et al.



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration, Labor.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Grant of Individual Exemptions.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document contains exemptions issued by the Department of Labor (the Department) from certain of the prohibited
transaction restrictions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (the Act) and/or the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986 (the Code).



Notices were published in the 

Federal Register

 of the pendency before the Department of proposals to grant such exemptions. The notices set forth a summary of facts
and representations contained in each application for exemption and referred interested persons to the respective
applications for a complete statement of the facts and representations. The applications have been available for
public inspection at the Department in Washington, D.C. The notices also invited interested persons to submit comments
on the requested exemptions to the Department. In addition the notices stated that any interested person might submit
a written request that a public hearing be held (where appropriate). The applicants have represented that they have
complied with the requirements of the notification to interested persons. No public comments and no requests for
a hearing, unless otherwise stated, were received by the Department.

The notices of proposed exemption were issued and the exemptions are being granted solely by the Department because,
effective December 31, 1978, section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1978 (43 FR 47713, October 17, 1978) transferred
the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to issue exemptions of the type proposed to the Secretary of Labor.



Statutory Findings



In accordance with section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2) of the Code and the procedures set forth in 29
CFR Part 2570, Subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August 10, 1990) and based upon the entire record, the Department makes
the following findings:




(a) The exemptions are administratively feasible;

(b) They are in the interests of the plans and their participants and beneficiaries; and

(c) They are protective of the rights of the participants and beneficiaries of the plans.

(2) The pooling and servicing agreement is provided 
to, or described in all material respects in the prospectus or private placement memorandum provided to, investing
plans before they purchase certificates issued by the trust.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, section I.C. does not provide an exemption from the restrictions of section 406(b)
of the Act or from the taxes imposed by reason of section 4975(c) of the Code for the receipt of a fee by a servicer of the
trust from a person other than the trustee or sponsor, unless such fee constitutes a ``qualified administrative fee''
as defined in section III.S. 

D. Effective June 28, 1994, the restrictions of sections 406(a) and 407(a) of the Act, and the taxes imposed by sections
4975 (a) and (b) of the Code by reason of sections 4975(c)(1) (A) through (D) of the Code, shall not apply to any transactions
to which those restrictions or taxes would otherwise apply merely because a person is deemed to be a party in interest
or disqualified person (including a fiduciary) with respect to a plan by virtue of providing services to the plan (or
by virtue of having a relationship to such service provider described in section 3(14) (F), (G), (H) or (I) of the Act
or section 4975(e)(2) (F), (G), (H) or (I) of the Code), solely because of the plan's ownership of certificates. 



II. General Conditions 



A. The relief provided under Part I is available only if the following conditions are met: 

(1) The acquisition of certificates by a plan is on terms (including the certificate price) that are at least as favorable
to the plan as they would be in an arm's-length transaction with an unrelated party; 

(2) The rights and interests evidenced by the certificates are not subordinated to the rights and interests evidenced
by other certificates of the same trust; 

(3) The certificates acquired by the plan have received a rating at the time of such acquisition that is in one of the
three highest generic rating categories from either Standard & Poor's Corporation (S&P's), Moody's Investors
Service, Inc. (Moody's), Duff & Phelps Inc. (D&P) or Fitch Investors Service, Inc. (Fitch); 

(4) The trustee is not an affiliate of any member of the Restricted Group. However, the trustee shall not be considered
to be an affiliate of a servicer solely because the trustee has succeeded to the rights and responsibilities of the
servicer pursuant to the terms of a pooling and servicing agreement providing for such succession upon the occurrence
of one or more events of default by the servicer; 

(5) The sum of all payments made to and retained by the underwriters in connection with the distribution or placement
of certificates represents not more than reasonable compensation for underwriting or placing the certificates;
the sum of all payments made to and retained by the sponsor pursuant to the assignment of obligations (or interests
therein) to the trust represents not more than the fair market value of such obligations (or interests); and the sum
of all payments made to and retained by the servicer represents not more than reasonable compensation for the servicer's
services under the pooling and servicing agreement and reimbursement of the servicer's reasonable expenses in connection
therewith; and 

(6) The plan investing in such certificates is an ``accredited investor'' as defined in Rule 501(a)(1) of 
Regulation D of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933.

B. Neither any underwriter, sponsor, trustee, servicer, 
insurer, or any obligor, unless it or any of its affiliates has discretionary authority or renders investment advice
with respect to the plan assets used by a plan to acquire certificates, shall be denied the relief provided under Part
I, if the provision of subsection II.A.(6) above is not satisfied with respect to acquisition or holding by a plan of
such certificates, provided that (1) such condition is disclosed in the prospectus or private placement memorandum;
and (2) in the case of a private placement of certificates, the trustee obtains a representation from each initial
purchaser which is a plan that it is in compliance with such condition, and obtains a covenant from each initial purchaser
to the effect that, so long as such initial purchaser (or any transferee of such initial purchaser's certificates)
is required to obtain from its transferee a representation regarding compliance with the Securities Act of 1933,
any such transferees 
will be required to make a written representation regarding compliance with the condition set forth in subsection
II.A.(6) above.

pool consists only of assets of the type which have been included in other investment pools, (ii) certificates evidencing

also means the trustee of the indenture trust.

I. ``Insurer'' means the insurer or guarantor of, or provider of other credit support for, a trust. Notwithstanding

are of a class subordinated to certificates representing an interest in the same trust.

J. ``Obligor'' means any person, other than the insurer, that is obligated to make payments with respect to any obligation
or receivable included in the trust. Where a trust contains qualified motor vehicle leases or qualified equipment

or a spouse of a brother or sister of such other person; and

(3) Any corporation or partnership of which such other person is an officer, director or partner.

N. ``Control'' means the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a person other
than an individual.

O. A person will be ``independent'' of another person only if:

(1) Such person is not an affiliate of that other person; and

(2) The other person, or an affiliate thereof, is not a fiduciary who has investment management authority or renders
investment advice with respect to any assets of such person.

P. ``Sale'' includes the entrance into a forward delivery commitment (as defined in section Q below), provided:

(1) The terms of the forward delivery commitment (including any fee paid to the investing plan) are no less favorable
to the plan than they would be in an arm's length transaction with an unrelated party;

Q. ``Forward delivery commitment'' means a contract for the purchase or sale of one or more certificates to be delivered
at an agreed future settlement date. The term includes both mandatory contracts (which contemplate obligatory delivery
and acceptance of the certificates) and optional contracts (which give one party the right but not the obligation
to deliver certificates to, or demand delivery of certificates from, the other party). 

R. ``Reasonable compensation'' has the same meaning as that term is defined in 29 CFR 2550.408c-2. 

S. ``Qualified Administrative Fee'' means a fee which meets the following criteria: 

(1) The fee is triggered by an act or failure to act by the obligor other than the normal timely payment of amounts owing
in respect of the obligations; 

(2) The servicer may not charge the fee absent the act or failure to act referred to in (1); 

(3) The ability to charge the fee, the circumstances in which the fee may be charged, and an explanation of how the fee
is calculated are set forth in the pooling and servicing agreement; and 

(4) The amount paid to investors in the trust will not be reduced by the amount of any such fee waived by the servicer.


T. ``Qualified Equipment Note Secured By A Lease'' means an equipment note: 

(a) Which is secured by equipment which is leased; 

(b) Which is secured by the obligation of the lessee to pay rent under the equipment lease; and 

(c) With respect to which the trust's security interest in the equipment is at least as protective of the rights of the
trust as the trust would have if the equipment note were secured only by the equipment and not the lease. 

U. ``Qualified Motor Vehicle Lease'' means a lease of a motor vehicle where: 

(a) The trust holds a security interest in the lease; 

(b) The trust holds a security interest in the leased motor vehicle; and 

(c) The trust's security interest in the leased motor vehicle is at least as protective of the trust's rights as the
trust would receive under a motor vehicle installment loan contract. 

V. ``Pooling and Servicing Agreement'' means the agreement or agreements among a sponsor, a servicer and the trustee
establishing a trust. In the case of certificates which are denominated as debt instruments, ``Pooling and Servicing
Agreement'' also includes the indenture entered into by the trustee of the trust issuing such certificates and the
indenture trustee.

<DOCTITLE>Grant of Class Exemption to Permit Certain Transactions Authorized Pursuant to Settlement Agreements Between the
U.S. Department of Labor and Plans </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration (PWBA), Department of Labor.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Grant of Class Exemption.


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document contains a final exemption from certain prohibited transaction restrictions of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the Code). The class exemption applies to
certain prospective transactions involving employee benefit plans where such transactions are specifically authorized
by the Department pursuant to a settlement agreement. The exemption affects plans, participants and beneficiaries
of such plans, and certain individuals engaging in such transactions or activities.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On May 27, 1994, the Department of Labor (the Department) published a notice in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 27581) of the pendency of a proposed class exemption from the restrictions of sections 406(a)(1) (A) through
(D), 406(a)(2), 406(b)(1) and 406(b)(2) of ERISA and from the taxes imposed by section 4975 (a) and (b) of the Code,
by reason of section 4975(c)(1) (A) through (E) of the Code. 


The Department proposed the class exemption on its own motion pursuant to section 408(a) of ERISA and section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code, and in accordance with the procedures set forth in 29 CFR Part 2570, subpart B (55 FR 32836, August 10, 1990).
 




The notice gave interested persons an opportunity to submit written comments or requests for a hearing on the proposed
exemption to the Department. No public comments and no requests for a public hearing with respect to the proposed class
exemption were received by the Department. Upon consideration of the record as a whole, the Department has determined
to grant the class exemption as proposed.

General Information 




The attention of interested persons is directed to the following: 


(1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of ERISA and section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest or disqualified person with respect to a plan from
certain other provisions of ERISA and the Code, including any prohibited transaction provisions to which the exemption
does not expressly apply and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of ERISA. Section 404
requires, in part, that a fiduciary discharge his or her duties respecting the plan solely in the interests of the participants
and beneficiaries of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(B) of ERISA. This exemption
does not affect the requirement of section 401(a) of the Code that a plan must operate for the exclusive benefit of the
employees of the employer maintaining the plan and their beneficiaries. 


(2) The exemption will not extend to transactions prohibited under section 406(b)(3) of ERISA and section 4975(c)(1)(F)
of the Code. 


(3) In accordance with section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2) of the Code, and based upon the entire record,
the Department finds that the exemption is administratively feasible, in the interests of plans and of their participants
and beneficiaries and protective of the rights of the participants and beneficiaries of such plans. 


(4) The exemption is supplemental to, and not in derogation of other provisions of ERISA and the Code, including statutory
or administrative exemptions and transitional rules. Furthermore, the fact that a transaction is subject to an administrative
or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the transaction is in fact a prohibited transaction. 


(5) The exemption is applicable to a transaction only if the conditions specified in the class exemption are satisfied.





Exemption 




Accordingly, the following exemption is granted under the authority of section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code, and in accordance with the procedures set forth in 29 CFR part 2570, subpart B (55 FR 32836, August 10, 1990).



Effective as of October 7, 1994, the restrictions of sections 406(a)(1) (A) through (D), 406(b)(1) and 406(b)(2)
of ERISA and the taxes imposed by sections 4975(a) and 4975(b) of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1) (A) through
(E) of the Code, shall not apply to a transaction or activity which is authorized, prior to the occurrence of such transaction
or activity, by a settlement agreement resulting from an investigation of an employee benefit plan conducted by the
Department under the authority of section 504(a) of ERISA, provided that: 


(A) The nature of such transaction or activity is specifically described in writing, by the terms of such settlement
agreement. 


(B) The Department of Labor is a party to the settlement agreement. 


(C) A party who will be engaging in the transaction or activity has provided written notice to the affected participants
and beneficiaries in a manner that is reasonably calculated to result in the receipt of such notice at least 30 days
prior to entry into the settlement agreement. 


(D) A copy of the notice and the method of distribution is approved in advance by the area or district office of the Department
which negotiated the settlement. 


(E) The notice includes an objective description of the transaction or activity, the approximate date on which the
transaction will occur, the address of the area or district office of the Department which negotiated the settlement
agreement, and a statement apprising participants and beneficiaries of their right to forward their comments to
such office.

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Advisory Committee on Nuclear Waste; Procedures for Meetings</DOCTITLE>



Background



Procedures to be followed with respect to meetings conducted pursuant to the Federal Advisory Committee Act by the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (NRC's) Advisory Committee on Nuclear Waste (ACNW) are described in this notice.
These procedures are set forth in order that they may be incorporated by reference in future individual meeting notices.

The ACNW advises the Nuclear Regulatory Commission on nuclear waste disposal facilities. This includes facilities
covered under 10 CFR parts 60 and 61 and other applicable regulations and legislative mandates such as the Nuclear
Waste Policy Act, the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act, and the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act,
as amended. The Committee's reports become a part of the public record. The ACNW meetings are normally open to the public
and provide opportunities for oral or written statements from members of the public to be considered as part of the
Committee's information gathering procedure. The meetings are not adjudicatory hearings such as those conducted
by the NRC's Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel as part of the Commission's licensing process. ACNW full Committee
meetings are conducted in accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act.



General Rules Regarding ACNW Meetings



An agenda is published in the 

Federal Register

 for each full Committee meeting. Practical considerations may dictate some changes to the agenda. The Chairman of
the Committee is empowered to conduct the meeting in a manner that, in his judgment, will facilitate the orderly conduct
of business, including making provisions to continue discussions of matters not completed on the scheduled day to
the next day.

The following requirements shall apply to public participation in ACNW meetings:

(a) Persons wishing to submit written statements regarding the agenda items may do so by providing a readily reproducible
copy at the beginning of the meeting. Comments should be limited to matters under consideration by the Committee.

Persons desiring to mail written comments may do so by sending a readily reproducible copy addressed to the Designated
Federal Official specified in the 

Federal Register

 notice for the individual meeting in care of the Advisory Committee on Nuclear Waste, Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555. Comments should be in the possession of the Designated Federal Official no later than five days
prior to a meeting to allow time for reproduction, distribution, and consideration at the meeting.

(b) Persons desiring to make oral statements at the meeting should make a request to do so to the Designated Federal
Official prior to the beginning of the meeting and summarize the content of the oral statements for the Designated
Federal Official. If possible, the request should be made five days before the meeting, identifying the topics to
be discussed and the amount of time needed for presentation, so that appropriate arrangements can be made. The Committee
will hear oral statements on topics being reviewed at an appropriate time during the meeting scheduled by the Chairman.

(c) Further information regarding topics to be discussed, whether a meeting has been cancelled or rescheduled, and
the Chairman's ruling on requests for the opportunity to present oral statements and the time allotted therefor can
be obtained by contacting, on the working day prior to the meeting, the Office of the Executive Director of the ACNW
(telephone: 301/415-7360, ATTN: the Designated Federal Official specified in the 

Federal Register

 notice for the meeting) between 7:30 a.m. and 4:15 p.m., Eastern time.

(d) During the ACNW meeting presentations and discussions, questions may be asked by ACNW members, Committee consultants,
and the NRC and ACNW staff.

(e) The use of still, motion picture, and television cameras will be permitted both before and after the meeting and
during any recess, subject to the condition that the physical installation and presence of such equipment will not
interfere with the conduct of the meeting. Approval from the Designated Federal Official will have to be obtained
prior to the installation or use of such equipment. The use of such equipment will be allowed while the meeting is in
session at the discretion of the Chairman to a degree that it is not disruptive. When use of such equipment is permitted,
appropriate measures will be taken to protect proprietary or privileged information that may be in documents, folders,
etc., being used during the meeting. Electronic recordings will be permitted only during those portions of the meeting
that are open to the public.

(f) A transcript is kept for certain open portions of the meeting and will be available in the NRC Public Document Room,
2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, for use within one week following the meeting. A copy of the certified minutes
of the meeting will be available at the same location on or before three months following the meeting. Copies may be
obtained at the Public Document Room upon payment of appropriate charges.

(g) When ACNW meetings are held at locations other than at NRC facilities, reproduction facilities may not be available
at reasonable cost. Accordingly, 25 additional copies of the materials to be used during the meeting should be provided
for distribution at such meetings.



Special Provisions When Proprietary Sessions Are To Be Held


If it is necessary to hold closed sessions for the purpose of discussing matters involving proprietary information,
persons with agreements permitting access to such information may attend those portions of the ACNW meetings where
this material is being discussed upon confirmation that such agreements are effective and related to the material
being discussed.

The Designated Federal Official should be informed of such an agreement at least five working days prior to the meeting
so that it can be confirmed, and a determination can be made regarding the applicability of the agreement to the material
that will be discussed during the meeting. The minimum information provided should include information regarding
the date of the agreement, the scope of material included in the agreement, the project or projects involved, and the
names and titles of the persons signing the agreement. Additional information may be requested to identify the specific
agreement involved. A copy of the executed agreement should be provided to the Designated Federal Official prior
to the beginning of the meeting for admittance to the closed session.

<USDEPT>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION</USDEPT>






Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of a Proposed Rule Change
and Amendment No. 1 to the Proposed Rule Change by the American Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating to Equity-Linked Term
Notes (``ELNs'')



September 30, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on September 7, 1994, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below,
which items have been prepared by the Amex. On September 20, 1994, the Amex filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule
change.
 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The Amex proposes to amend: (1) Section 107A of the Amex Company Guide (``Guide'') to allow the Exchange greater latitude
in evaluating the listing eligibility of those securities which cannot be readily categorized under the Exchange's
existing listing criteria; and (2) Section 107B of the Guide to provide for greater flexibility in the listing criteria
for Equity-Linked Term Notes (``ELNs''). The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary,
Amex, and at the Commission.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the Amex included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Amex has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In March 1990, the Commission approved the adoption of Section 107A of the Guide, which provides listing criteria
for hybrid securities, 

i.e.,

 securities that have features common to both debt and equity securities, yet do not fit within the traditional definitions
of such securities.
 In May 1993, the Commission approved the adoption of Section 107B of the Guide to specifically permit the listing of
ELNs.
 An ELN is an intermediate-term, hybrid instrument whose value at maturity is linked to the performance of a highly
capitalized, actively traded common stock or sponsored ADR.






Section 107A of the Guide currently specifies minimum issuer qualifications, public distribution, aggregate market
value guidelines, and other criteria to assist the Exchange in its case-by-case review and determination of the suitability
of any hybrid security (including ELNs) for listing and trading. The Exchange now proposes to amend Section 107A of
the Guide to provide additional flexibility in the listing of such securities. Specifically, it is proposed that
the aggregate minimum market value criteria be changed from $20 million to $4 million, consistent with the current
listing requirements for currency and index warrants under Section 106 of the Guide. The Exchange also proposes to
eliminate, in favor of a case-by-case review, the minimum holder requirement for securities that are listed pursuant
to Section 107A of the Guide but which are traded in thousand dollar denominations on the Exchange's bond trading floor.

The Exchange believes that these revision will provide the Exchange with the flexibility necessary to evaluate the
suitability of such securities for listing. The Exchange states that hybrid securities have special appeal for various
investors, especially institutions. The Exchange also believes that securities admitted to listing under Section
107A of the Guide benefit investors by providing important investment, hedging, and market timing opportunities,
as well as benefiting those issuers that offer hybrid securities as a means of raising capital at an advantageous cost.
With respect to Section 107B, the Exchange proposes a number of changes which it believes will provide for greater
flexibility in the listing criteria for ELNs and the criteria for the underlying linked stock. Specifically, the
Exchange proposes to: (1) amend the definition of an ELN to encompass instruments which are linked, in whole or in part,
to the market performance of a non-convertible preferred stock; (2) amend Section 107B(d) to provide an additional
minimum market capitalization and trading volume tier for the underlying security of $500 million in market capitalization
and 80 million shares traded in the 12-months prior to the date of listing; 
 (3) amend Section 107B(d) to provide the Exchange with flexibility, subject to the concurrence of the staff of the
Commission, to list an ELN linked to a security that does not meet the specific market capitalization and volume criteria;
 and (4) amend Section 107B(f) to provide for the issuance of ELNs, subject to the concurrence of the staff of the Commission,
that relate to more than the allowable maximum percentages of outstanding shares of the underlying security.
 Finally, the Exchange proposes to clarify that issuers of ELNs have the option of specifying at the time of issuance
that the issuer may satisfy their obligations at maturity of the ELN either with cash or by physical delivery of the
underlying linked stock. The Exchange shall require any issuer that reserves the right to make physical delivery
of the underlying stock at maturity, to publish notice, no less than 10 and no more than 20 business days prior to maturity
of the ELN, of how the issuer intends to satisfy its obligations.









The Exchange believes these revisions strike an appropriate balance between the Exchange's responsiveness to innovation
in the securities markets and its need to ensure the protection of investors and the maintenance of fair and orderly
markets. Moreover, the Exchange believes that these changes will not have an adverse impact on the markets for the
underlying linked security in view of the requirements that the linked security must have a large minimum market capitalization
and a large trading volume over the preceding 12 months. Under the listing standards for ELNs, without approval from
the staff of the Commission, an ELN issuer will only be able to issue an ELN linked to a maximum of 5% of the outstanding
shares of the underlying security. The Exchange believes, therefore, that the issuer should be able to satisfy all,
or substantially all, of its obligations at maturity by physical delivery of the linked security. Under these circumstances,
the Exchange believes there would be no need or incentive on the part of the ELN issuer to enter the market for the linked
security to any significant degree in order to discharge its obligations to ELN holders at the time of maturity. Additionally,
all of the other requirements for the listing of ELNs currently in place will continue to apply to the listing of ELNs.

The Amex believes the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the objectives
of Section 6(b)(5) in particular in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices,
to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in
facilitating transactions in securities, and to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open
market and a national market system.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The Amex does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants
or Others



No written comments were either solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



The Amex has requested that the proposed rule change be given accelerated effectiveness pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)
of the Act.

The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section
6(b)(5) of the Act
 in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles
of trade, and to protect investors and the public interest. Specifically, regarding the proposed amendments to Section
107A of the Guide, the Commission believes that the proposal will provide the Amex with added flexibility to list and
trade hybrid securities, which may benefit investors by providing additional investment and hedging opportunities,
as well as benefitting issuers who offer hybrid securities as a means of raising capital. Additionally, the proposed
changes to Section 107A of the Guide will conform Amex's rules regarding the listing of hybrid securities to those
already approved for the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE''). The NYSE's hybrid listing rules do not contain
a minimum holder requirement for hybrid issues traded in thousand dollar denominations on the Exchange's bond floor.
Additionally, Section 703.19 of the NYSE's Listed Company Manual provides that an issue of a hybrid security must
have a minimum market value at issuance of $4 million.





The Commission also believes that the proposed amendments to Section 107B of the Guide are consistent with the Act.
Specifically, the proposal to amend 107B provide that ELNs may be linked to non-convertible preferred stock, in addition
to common stock, will conform Amex's rules to those approved by the Commission for the listing and trading of Equity-Linked
Debt Securities (``ELDS'') on the NYSE.






With respect to the remaining amendments to Section 107B, the Commission believes that the proposed changes do not
raise any significant regulatory issues that were not addressed in the Commission's prior approval orders regarding
ELNs.
 The Commission finds that the proposal to add an additional market capitalization and trading volume requirement
for eligible linked securities will expand the number of securities that can be linked to ELNs while maintaining the
requirement that the linked security be an actively traded common stock or sponsored ADR issued by a highly capitalized
issuer. While the proposal introduces a third alternative for ELN eligibility that reduces the minimum market capitalization
requirement for the linked security, the stock of such an issuer (or sponsored ADR related thereto) could only be linked
to an ELN issue if its trading volume in the U.S. for the prior one-year period is at least 80 million shares, which is
four times higher than the current minimum trading volume requirement.
 The Commission believes that together, the new capitalization and trading volume requirements will continue to
ensure that ELNs are only issued on highly liquid securities of broadly capitalized companies and that these requirements
will reduce the likelihood of any adverse market impact on the securities underlying ELNs.

<TEXT>
 

Additoinally, allowing the Amex, subject to the concurrence of the staff of the Commission, to approve an issue of
ELNs that either does not satisfy one of the existing requirements regarding market capitalization and trading volume,
 or that exceeds the maximum allowable percentage of shares of the underlying security,
 merely adds flexibility to the proposed rule change. The Commission believes that this portion of the proposal does
not raise any regulatory concerns, particularly given the requirement of obtaining the concurrence of the staff
of the Commission prior to listing.







Finally, the Commission notes that the prior approval orders regarding ELNs
 did not contain a prohibition against an issuer retaining the ability to satisfy its obligations at maturity of the
ELN either in cash or with shares of the underlying security. Without Commission approval, a particular issuance
of ELNs may not be linked to more than 5% of the outstanding shares of the underlying security. In these cases, because
of the large market capitalization and trading volume requirements for the underlying security, the Commission
believes that the ELN will have minimal impact on the market for the underlying security even if the issuer determines
to satisfy its obligations with shares and must purchase the necessary shares prior to maturity. We note that if the
Commission were to approve an ELN related to more than the maximum allowable percentages specified in Section 107B,
the Commission would be able to impose restrictions and limitations, on a case-by-case basis, to minimize the potential
of the ELN having an adverse impact on the market for the underlying security. The Commission also believes that it
is appropriate for issuers to publish notice, no less than 10 and no more than 20 business days prior to maturity of the
ELN, about the issuer's intention to satisfy its obligations to the holders of the ELNs with either cash or shares of
the underlying security.






The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change and Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change
prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice thereof in the 

Federal Register

 in order to allow the Exchange to begin listing hybrid securities (including ELNs) satisfying the revised listing
standards described herein without delay. For the reasons discussed above, the Commission believes that the proposal
does not raise any significant regulatory issues. The amendments to Section 107A and those allowing ELNs linked to
nonconvertible preferred stock merely conform the Amex's rules to those previously approved for the NYSE, which
were published and for which no comments were received by the Commission.
 Additionally, the Commission believes that the issues raised by the remaining proposed amendments to Rule 107B were
adequately addressed in the Commission's prior approval orders regarding ELNs. Moreover, in recently approving
the proposal by the Amex to list and trade ELNs linked to securities (including sponsored ADRs) issued by non-U.S.
companies subject to reporting requirements under the Act, the Amex represented to the Commission that no problems
had been reported regarding the listing and trading of ELNs.






For the above reasons, the Commission believes it is consistent with Section 19(b)(2)
 of the Act to approve the proposed rule change and Amendment No. 1 to the proposal on an accelerated basis.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Boston Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Granting Approval to Proposed Rule Change Relating
to Additions to the Exchange's Minor Rule Plan</DOCTITLE>



September 30, 1994.



On May 6, 1994, the Boston Stock Exchange, Inc. (``BSE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange
Commission (``SEC''or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change to amend its Rules and its Minor Rule Violation Plan (``Plan'')
 to provide for the imposition of summary finds for violation of certain specified Exchange rules and policy.









The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34309 (July 5, 1994), 59
FR 35548 (July 12, 1994). no comments were received on the proposal.

The BSE's Plan, as embodied in Chapter XVIII, Section 4 of the BSE's Rules, provides that the Exchange may impose a fine,
not to exceed $2500, on any member, member organization, or person associated with a member or member organization
for any violation of an Exchange rule that has been deemed to be minor in nature and approved by the Commission for inclusion
in the Plan. The rule change will add to the List of Exchange Rule Violations and Fines Applicable thereto Pursuant
to Section 4 of Chapter XVIII for the imposition of fines:

1. Failure to Promptly Respond to Exchange Blue Sheet Requests or File Regularly Scheduled Financial (FOCUS, SIPC)
and/or Regulatory Reports (Specialist Performance Evaluation Questionnaire, Quarterly Option Report);

2. Improper Use of the ITS Administrative Message Function; and

3. Failure to Register Floor Employees and Complete Appropriate Forms.

The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements
of Section 6(b).
 In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the Section 6(b)(5) requirements that the
rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative
acts, and, in general, to protect investors and the public, and with the Section 6(b)(6) requirement that the rules
of an exchange provide that its members are appropriately disciplined for violations of an exchange's rules and the
Act.





Specifically, the Commission believes that an exchange's ability to effectively enforce compliance by its members
and member organization with Commission and Exchange rules is central to its self-regulatory functions. The inclusion
of a rule in an exchange's minor rule violation plan, therefore, should not be interpreted to mean that it is not an important
rule. On the contrary, the Commission recognizes that the inclusion of minor violations of particular rules under
a minor rule violation plan may make the exchange's disciplinary system more efficient in prosecuting more egregious
and/or repeated violations of these rules, thereby furthering its mandates to protect investors and the public interest.

The Commission believes that adding the provisions listed above to the Chapter XVIII of the Exchange's Rules and to
the Exchange's Plan is consistent with Sections 6(b)(5) and 6(b)(6) in that the purpose of chapter XVIII is to provide
for a response to a violation of Exchange Rules or policy when a meaningful sanction is needed, but when initiation
of a disciplinary proceeding under the Chapter XXX is not suitable because such a proceeding would be more costly and
time-consuming than would be warranted given the nature of the violation. Chapter XVIII provides for an appropriate
response to minor violations of certain Exchange rules, while preserving the due process rights of the party accused
through specified, required procedures.






Furthermore, the Commission finds that violations of the provisions being added are objective and technical in nature,
and are easily verifiable, thereby lending themselves to the use of expedited proceedings. Noncompliance with the
provisions may be determined objectively and adjudicated quickly without the complicated factual and interpretive
inquiries associated with more sophisticated Exchange disciplinary proceedings. If the Exchange determines that
a violation of one of these rules is not minor in nature, the Exchange retains the discretion to initiate full disciplinary
proceedings in accordance with Chapter XXX of the BSE Rules. The Commission expects the BSE to bring full disciplinary
proceedings in appropriate cases (

e.g., 

in cases where the violation is egregious or where there is a history or pattern of repeat violations).

It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (SR-BSE-94-08) is approved.






For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change and Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated
Approval of Amendment No. 2 to the Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc., Relating to Pricing
Increments and Priority Principles of Spreads, Straddles and Combinations</DOCTITLE>



September 30, 1994.



On November 17, 1993, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (``Act''),
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change to amend Rules 6.42 and 6.45 and Interpretations and Policies to Rule 6.42 concerning pricing
and priorities on spread, straddle, and combination orders (``combined trades''). On July 14, 1994, the CBOE submitted
Amendment No. 1 (``Amendment No. 1'') to the proposed rule change.
 On September 29, 1994, the CBOE submitted Amendment No. 2 (``Amendment No. 2'') to the proposal to amend Interpretation
.02 to Rule 6.42.









Notice of the proposed rule change and Amendment No. 1 was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release
No. 34397 (July 18, 1994), 59 FR 37794 (July 25, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal. This order approves
the proposal.



I. Description of the Proposal



The purpose of CBOE's proposed rule change is twofold: first, to clarify Rule 6.42 and add a new Interpretation and
Policy, .02 to permit quotes for combined trades and stock-option orders, as defined by CBOE Rule 1.1(ii) (``stock-option
orders'') to be expressed in any fractional or decimal price;
 and, second, to alter the priority principles applicable to combined trades and stock-option combination orders,
as defined by CBOE Rule 1.1(ii)(b) (``stock-option combinations''), when priced net at a multiple of one sixteenth
of a dollar.
 The CBOE believes that these changes will facilitate the orderly execution of combined trades and stock-option orders.






Rule 6.42 currently permits a CBOE member holding an order on a combined trade or stock-option combination to attain
priority over bids and offers in the trading crowd (``crowd'') and the customer limit order book (``limit order book''
or ``book'') provided all legs of the combined trade or stock-option combination trade at a price that is at least equivalent
to quotes in the crowd or on the book. As revised, combined trades and stock-option combinations priced net at a multiple
of 1/16 will attain priority over orders in the book only if one leg of the transaction trades at a price that is better
than the corresponding bid or offer in the book while the remaining legs of the transaction are at least equivalent
to the established bids or offers in the crowd or book. The principles for attaining priority over the crowd remain
unchanged. Bids or offers that are part of a combined trade or stock-option combination which is not priced at a net
multiple of 1/16, while permissible, will not be entitled to priority under the exception contained in paragraph
(d) to Rule 6.45. Finally, only the net price of the combination will be quoted in fractional or decimal prices; the
individual legs of the combination must still be quoted in accordance with Rule 6.42.






As an illustration, assume that Option A is quoted at 5 bid, 51/8 asked, and option B is quoted at 6 bid, 61/8 asked, and
assume that all four quotes are represented in the book. In that instance, a spread involving the purchase (or sale)
of option A and the sale (or purchase) of option B may trade at a net credit or debit of 1 (e.g., a net credit of 1 if option
A is bought at 5 and option B sold at 6, or a net debit of 1 if option A is sold at 51/8 and option B is bought at 61/8. In this
example, because the net price is a multiple of 1/16 and the execution of the spread involves taking the same side of
the market as the book on only one side of the spread, the spread would receive priority even though it ``touches'' quotes
in the book on both sides. (That is, in the spread consisting of the purchase of option A at 5 and the sale of option B at
6, only the 

purchase

 of option A occurs at the same price and on the same side of the market as the book, which is bid at 5; the 

sale

 of option B at 6 is on the opposite side of the market in the book, which is 

bid

 at 6.) In the same example, it would not be permissible under Rule 6.45(d) to trade the spread at a net debit of 7/8 by selling
the first option at 51/8 and buying the second at 6, because this trade would be executed at the same price and on the same
side of the market as the book on 

both sides

 of the spread.

To qualify for priority treatment, combined trades and stock-option combinations must meet the existing requirements
of Rule 6.45(d), 

i.e, 

one member must represent all legs of the transaction, each leg must cover the same number of options, and the trade
must be executed against one other member. In those circumstances, the CBOE believes it is fair to give these transactions
priority when priced net at a multiple of 1/16. Additionally, the CBOE represents that it will continue to disseminate
the individual legs with a prefix to identify trades effected as part of a combined trade or stock-option combination.







II. Discussion



The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section
6(b)(5).
 In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the Section 6(b)(5) requirement that the
rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade and not to permit unfair discrimination
between customers, issuers, brokers, and dealers.





The first change permits the quoting of combined trades and stock-option orders in either fractional or decimal prices.
Because these trades involve separate transactions effected at a net price, the Commission believes that the ability
to quote net prices in either fractional or decimal prices will provide the CBOE with greater flexibility to permit
market participants to price these orders more precisely, which should result in greater efficiency and improved
liquidity in their execution, and better prices for investors. The Commission notes that the individual legs of combined
trades and stock-option combinations currently are, and will continue to be, reported separately with an ``S'' in
the prefix field identifying it as part of a combination. Furthermore, the individual legs will continue to be input
to the CBOE price reporting system and made available to vendors in the same manner as all other CBOE trades.








The Commission notes this change will not affect the existing priority rules applicable to these transactions except
that, as discussed below, an exchange member will not be able to better an existing price by an increment less than 1/16th
and still attain priority. Therefore, the Commission is satisfied this change will not disadvantage existing orders
on the book.



The Commission notes that combined trades and stock-option combinations must be priced net at a multiple of 1/16th
in order to qualify for priority. These transactions will continue to take priority over orders in the crowd when all
legs of the combination trade at a price that is at least equivalent to quotes in the crowd, in accordance with the current
rule. However, as amended, combined trades and stock-option combinations will only attain priority over the book
when one leg of the transaction trades at a price that is better than the corresponding bid or offer in the book and the
remaining legs of the transaction trades at a price that is at least equivalent to the established bids or offers in
the crowd or book. The Commission notes that this change affords greater protection to the book since one leg of the
combined trade or stock-option combination must now at least trade at a better price than the book (while all remaining
legs must still at least touch the other bids or offers in the crowd or book) before the book loses priority. In addition,
because the Rule currently requires that one member must represent all legs of the trade and that the trade may only
be executed against one other member, public customers are still less likely to lose priority to combined trades and
stock-option combinations.
 Finally, the change to Rule 6.42 assures that orders in the book will not lose priority to these transactions unless
the net price is quoted in increments of 1/16th. The Commission believes that the proposal is a reasonable effort by
the CBOE to accommodate the ability to price combined trades and stock-option combinations more competitively while
at the same time not disadvantaging the public customer limit order book. The Commission also notes that the priority
principles applicable to the type of stock-option order as defined by Rule 1.1(ii)(a), remain unchanged, except
to the extent that this type of order must be quoted in increments of 1/16th in order to attain priority over the crowd.

The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 2 to the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day
after the date of publication of notice thereof in the 

Federal Register

. Amendment No. 2 amends Interpretation .02 to Rule 6.42 to allow stock-option orders, as defined in Rule 1.1(ii),
to be priced net in any fractional or decimal price, but also states that the priority principles applicable to such
transactions will not apply unless the net price is expressed in increments that are multiples of 1/16. The Commission
notes that a stock-option combination order is a transaction involving a combined trade and the purchase or sale of
the underlying stock. The Commission does not believe it is appropriate to distinguish between combined trades and
stock-option combinations simply because one transaction involves the purchase or sale of the underlying stock.
The same concerns attendant to the pricing of combined trades apply equally to a combination coupled with the purchase
of stock.
 Accordingly, the Commission believes it is consistent with Sections 6(b)(5) and 19(b) of the Act to approve Amendment
No. 2 to the proposed rule change on an accelerated basis. 





III. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning Amendment No. 2. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC. Copies of such filing will also be available for
inspection and copying at the principal office of the above-mentioned self-regulatory organization. All submissions
should refer to the file number in the caption above and should be submitted by October 28, 1994. 

It therefore is ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (SR-CBOE-93-54) is approved, as amended.






For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<USBUREAU>Federal Railroad Administration</USBUREAU>


<DOCTITLE>Waiver Petition Docket Number SA-94-5; </DOCTITLE>
Public Hearing 


The Burlington Northern Railroad Company (BN) has requested a waiver of compliance from certain provisions of the
Railroad Safety Appliance Standards (49 CFR part 231) (see FR 39820, August 4, 1994). BN states that it is building
one trainset of its ``trough train'' equipment. This train will be composed of 22, 13-section cars. The parking brakes
on these cars are of conventional design, but their location is not standard. The unique size and design of one, 13-section
car does not allow the conventional application of a handbrake. 
The BN is seeking a waiver of compliance with 
 231.1(a)1, 231.1(a)(3)(i), and 231.1(a)(3)(ii). 
Section 231.1(a)(1) requires that there be one efficient handbrake which shall operate in harmony with the power
brake installed on the car. 
The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) has determined that a public hearing be held in this matter. Accordingly
a public hearing is hereby set for 10:00 a.m. on November 15, 1994, at the Nebraska Public Service Commission, 300 The
Atrium, 
1200 N Street, Lincoln, Nebraska. The hearing will be an informal one and will be conducted in accordance with Rule
25 
of the FRA Rules of Practice (49 CFR Part 211.25), by a representative designated by the FRA. The hearing will be a nonadversary
proceeding in which all interested parties will be given the opportunity to express their views regarding this waiver
petition.

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Education.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed funding priorities for fiscal years 
1995 and 1996.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Secretary proposes funding priorities for Research 
and Demonstration (R&D) projects under the National Institute on 
Disability and Rehabilitation Research (NIDRR) for fiscal years 
l995-1996. The Secretary takes this action to focus research 
attention on areas of national need. These priorities are 
intended to assist in the solutions to problems encountered by 
individuals with disabilities in their daily activities.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This notice contains three proposed 
priorities for the R&D program. These proposed priorities focus 
on accommodations for individuals with disabilities in adult 
education programs, reproductive issues for women with 
disabilities, and HIV/AIDS and disability. 


Authority for the R&D program of NIDRR is contained in 
section 204(a) of the Rehabilitation Act of l973, as amended (29 
U.S.C. 760-762). Under this program the Secretary makes awards 
to public agencies and private agencies and organizations, 
including institutions of higher education, Indian tribes, and 
tribal organizations. This program is designed to support 
discrete research, demonstration, training, and related projects 
to develop methods, procedures, and technology that maximize the 
full inclusion and integration into society, independent living, 
employment, family support, and economic and social self-
sufficiency of individuals with disabilities, especially those 
with the most severe disabilities. Under program regulations at 
34 CFR 351.32, the Secretary may establish research priorities by 
reserving funds to support the research activities listed in 34 
CFR 351.10. 
These proposed priorities support the National Education 
Goals, one of which states that every American will be literate 
and will possess the knowledge and skills necessary to compete in 
a global economy and exercise the rights and responsibilities of 
citizenship.

The Secretary will announce the final funding priorities in 
a notice in the 

Federal Register

. The final priorities will be 
determined by responses to this notice, available funds, and 
other considerations of the Department. Funding of particular 
projects depends on the final priorities, the availability of 
funds, and the quality of the applications received. The 
publication of these proposed priorities does not preclude the 
Secretary from proposing additional priorities, nor does it limit 
the Secretary to funding only these priorities, subject to 
meeting applicable rulemaking requirements. 





Note:

 This notice of proposed priorities does not solicit 
applications. A notice inviting applications under this 
competition will be published in the 

Federal Register

 concurrent 
with or following publication of the notice of final priorities. 


Priorities
 


Under 34 CFR 75.105(c)(3) the Secretary proposes to give an 
absolute preference to applications that meet one of the 
following priorities. The Secretary proposes to fund under this 
program only applications that meet one of these absolute 
priorities: 


Proposed Priority 1: Accommodations for Individuals With 
Disabilities in Adult Education Programs 


Background 


In fiscal year 1991 Adult Education (AE) programs funded 
under the Adult Education Act (P.L. 100-297, as amended) served 
over 3.7 million people in Adult Basic Education, Adult Secondary 
Education, and English-as-a-Second-Language programs. Adult 
Education programs serve persons who are educationally 
disadvantaged, including individuals with all types of 
disabilities. The Office of Vocational and Adult Education 
estimates that at least 30 percent of the persons in AE programs 
have a disability. Adults (aged 16 years or older) with 
disabilities are enrolled in AE programs throughout the States 
and territories in local educational agencies, community 
colleges, community-based organizations, mental hospitals, 
rehabilitation and correctional facilities, and other facilities 
serving individuals with disabilities (U.S. Department of 
Education, Adult Learning and Literacy Clearinghouse, Fact Sheet 
9, February 1994). 
Because they are educationally disadvantaged, some 
individuals with disabilities in AE programs may need 
accommodations. These accommodations may involve the 
modification of policies, practices, or procedures, or the 
provision of auxiliary aids and services (e.g., relaxed time 
requirements for tests, interpreters). Published efforts to 
identify accommodations for adults with disabilities in AE 
programs have focused on administering tests and diagnostic 
assessments (American Council on Education, ``GED Test 
Accommodations,'' Washington, D.C., 1990; American Council on 
Education, ``External Diploma Program Assessment Accommodations 
and Modifications for Adults with Special Learning Needs,'' 
Washington, D.C., 1990). 
In addition to testing and assessment accommodations, 
individuals with disabilities in AE programs may require 
accommodations related to the presentation of instructional 
materials, alternative formats to print materials, notetakers, 
alternatives to written assignments, practicums, scheduling, and 
a variety of other educational tasks and requirements. 
Adult Education administrators and teachers need to 
understand not only their obligations under section 504 of the 
Rehabilitation Act, as amended, but also the resources that are 
available to enable them to provide the accommodations. 
Similarly, students with disabilities in AE programs need to 
understand their rights, articulate their needs, and identify the 
accommodations that will assist them to meet the program's 
requirements. 


Proposed Priority 


An R&D project on accommodations for individuals with 
disabilities in Adult Education programs shall_
 Survey the nature and extent to which a representative 
sample of AE programs are providing programmatic accommodations 
to students with disabilities and determine the relationship 
between the provision of those accommodations and program 
outcomes for those students (e.g., graduation rates, program 
completion, career advancement, etc.); 
 Identify and evaluate effective programmatic 
accommodations for individuals with disabilities in AE programs, 
and develop recommendations for the development of new 
accommodations, including, but not limited to, accommodations 
related to testing, presentation of instructional materials, 
alternative formats to print materials, notetakers, alternatives 
to written assignments, practicums, and scheduling;

 Utilizing existing materials to the maximum extent possible, develop guidance for AE staff and students with
disabilities in AE programs on the rights and duties of covered entities to provide appropriate accommodations to
individuals with disabilities;

 Utilizing existing material to the maximum extent possible, develop information for AE staff and students
with disabilities on innovative and common accommodations provided to students with disabilities, as well as information
on resources that will assist AE programs provide accommodations;

 Field-test materials to ensure that they address the needs of individuals with disabilities from minority
backgrounds who are in AE programs and that they are available in appropriate accessible formats; and

 Coordinate efforts with NIDRR's Disability and Business Technical Assistance Centers (ADA technical assistance
centers) as well as with the Division of Adult Education and Literacy within the U.S. Department of Education Office
of Vocational and Adult Education.



Proposed Priority 2: Reproductive Issues for Women With Physical Disabilities



Background


Despite the attention given to disability in general and certain impairments in particular, one of the groups within
the disabled population that has received little recognition or study is women. (Doggone, Mary J, Brooks, Nancy A.,
1985). Over 3,000,000 women of childbearing age in the United States have some type of disability. Many women with
physical disabilities have been discouraged by their families, friends, and health providers from considering
the option of parenthood. Until very recently, women with many types of physical disabilities have not been encouraged
or facilitated in exercising that option by health care providers and others. Medical professionals have often discouraged
pregnancy for women with physical disabilities because of the limited understanding of the effect of bodily changes
during pregnancy, labor, and delivery on existing impairments. This priority addresses reproductive issues confronted
specifically by women with physical disabilities.

Some aspects of women's health maintenance that are an ordinary part of life for most women pose significant problems
for women with physical disabilities. Dependent upon the type of disability, fertility may be unaffected but pregnancy
may be an increased risk and require high-risk management; genetic counseling may be suggested
