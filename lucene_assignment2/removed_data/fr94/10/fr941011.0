Federal Employees Health Benefits Program: Debarment



<AGENCY>
agency: 

Office of Personnel Management.




Action: 

Final rule.





</AGENCY>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing final regulations to incorporate into regulations the statutory
requirement that carriers in the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program may not deny claims for services
or supplies due to the debarment of the providers who supplied them if the claimants could not have known that the provider
was debarred. The purpose of these regulations is to comply with the provision of law that requires OPM to prescribe
regulations on this issue.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information: 

On May 10, 1994, OPM published interim regulations in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 24030) clarifying that carriers cannot deny claims based on debarment if there was no reasonable way the claimant
could have known that the provider was debarred. When an individual who has not previously been notified of a provider's
debarment submits a claim for services or supplies furnished by a debarred provider, the carrier must (1) honor the
claim under the terms of its contract with OPM, and (2) inform the individual about the debarment of the provider and
the minimum period of time remaining under the terms of the debarment.



In practical terms, this generally means that the first claim(s) an enrollee submits for services or supplies received
after a provider has been debarred, but before the enrollee has been informed of the debarment, is (are) paid to the
same extent it (they) would have been paid had the provider not been debarred. The carrier must, at the same time, inform
the enrollee concerning the debarment. The carrier will deny any subsequent claims for service or supplies furnished
during the period the provider is debarred.

OPM received no comments on the interim regulations.



Regulatory Flexibility Act



I certify that these regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
because they primarily affect Federal employees and annuitants.

This rule has been reviewed by OMB in accordance with E.O. 12866.

Food Stamp Program: Forfeiture and Denial of Property Rights



AGENCIES: 

Office of Inspector General and Food and Nutrition Service, Department of Agriculture.




<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This rule implements section 15(g) of the Food Stamp Act of 1977, as amended by Section 124 of the Food Stamp Act Amendments
of 1980, Pub. L. 96-249, which authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to subject to forfeiture and denial of
property rights any nonfood items, moneys, negotiable instruments, securities, or other things of value that are
furnished or intended to be furnished by any person in exchange for food coupons, authorization cards, or other program
benefit instruments or access devices in any manner not authorized by the Food Stamp Act or regulations issued pursuant
to the Food Stamp Act, 7 U.S.C. 2024(g). The rule establishes procedures to be followed by the Inspector General and
other Federal law enforcement officials who conduct investigations of alleged violations of the Food Stamp Act and
who may, during the course of those investigations, acquire property subject to forfeiture and denial of property
rights.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



Classification



Executive Order 12866



This rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866 and, therefore, has not been
reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.



Executive Order 12372



The Food Stamp Program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.551. For the reasons set
forth in the final rule and related Notice(s) to 7 CFR Part 3015, subpart V (48 FR 29115, June 24, 1983), this program
is excluded from the scope of Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and
local officials.



Paperwork Reduction Act



This final rule does not contain reporting or recordkeeping requirements subject to approval by the Office of Management
and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507).



Regulatory Flexibility Act



This action has been reviewed with regard to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. No.
96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, September 19, 1980). Charles R. Gillum, Acting Inspector General, USDA, has certified
that this rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.



Executive Order 12778



This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is intended to have
preemptive effect with respect to any state or local laws, regulations or policies which conflict with its provisions
or which would otherwise impede its full implementation. This rule is not intended to have retroactive effect unless
so specified in the 

Effective Date

 paragraph of this preamble. Prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule or the application of this
rule, all applicable administrative procedures must be exhausted. The administrative review requirements relating
to forfeiture of property pursuant to the Food Stamp Act of 1977, as amended, are set out in this rule.



Background



This rule recognizes that the Office of Inspector General (OIG), USDA, conducts the majority of criminal investigations
that result in Federal criminal prosecution under the Food Stamp Act; that such investigations involve the acquisition
of valuable property by investigators in exchange for food coupons, authorization cards, or other program benefit
instruments or access devices; and that Congress granted to USDA the power to subject such property to forfeiture.
It should be noted that the Act defines ``coupon'' to include any ``* * * type of certificate issued
pursuant to the provisions of this Act'' (7 U.S.C. 2012(d)). Thus, this rulemaking subjects to forfeiture property
offered in exchange for any program benefit instrument or access device.

In addition to OIG, other Federal law enforcement agencies, including the United States Secret Service and the United
States Postal Inspection Service, also conduct criminal investigations involving the acquisition of property
in exchange for food coupons, authorization cards, or other program benefit instruments or access devices. Finally,
in some instances food coupons and other benefit instruments are provided to other Federal law enforcement agencies
for use in investigations involving program related activities under memoranda of understanding with OIG. This
rule applies as well to seizures related to the Act which are made by those agencies. However, this rule specifically
provides that the forfeiture provisions shall not apply to those items exchanged during the course of internal investigations
by retail firms, investigations conducted by State and local law enforcement agencies, or FNS Compliance Branch
investigations.

For a more detailed explanation of the provisions of this rule, the reader should refer to the preamble of the proposed
rule cited below.

The proposed rule was published in the 

Federal Register

 on December 6, 1993, 58 FR 64172, with a 60 day comment period ending February 4, 1994. We received only one letter with
comments. The commenter suggested that the rule should clarify that property not acquired by investigation is not
subject to the rule, that the property belongs to USDA and disposal must be approved by USDA, and that any moneys obtained
from sale of property or by forfeiture belongs to USDA and shall be deposited with USDA.

We did not make any changes as a result of the comments because we believe the rule already adequately addresses the
commenter's concerns. The provisions of 7 CFR 271.5(e)(1)(ii) of the rule state that the forfeiture and denial of
property rights provisions shall apply to property exchanged or offered in exchange during investigations by the
Inspector General, USDA, and by other authorized Federal law enforcement agencies. We believe this is clear enough
without adding that it does not cover other property. Section 271.5(e)(2) clearly states that the property is deemed
forfeited to USDA, and  271.5(e)(2)(v) provides custodians guidance on property disposal and refers to the
applicable regulations which would be those of USDA and/or GSA. Finally, while any moneys exchanged or collected
are deemed forfeited to USDA just like other property, section 7 CFR 271.5(e)(2)(vi) provides that such moneys shall
be deposited into the general fund of the United States Treasury. The moneys are deposited to the general fund because
OIG does not have the legal authority needed to deposit them with USDA.

U.S. Warehouse Act Fees


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, USDA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This final rule revises the regulations under the United States Warehouse Act (USWA) to increase the fees charged
to grain, tobacco, wool, dry bean, nut, syrup, cotton and cottonseed warehousemen for licensing and inspection services.
In addition, a schedule of fees has been added to impose annual fees on cotton warehousemen. Future fee changes will
be announced by a notice in the 

Federal Register

 prior to July 1, to be effective October 1 of each year, when such changes have been determined to be necessary.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Executive Order 12866


This rule has been determined to be significant and was reviewed by Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive
Order 12866.


Executive Order 12372


This program is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation
with State and local officials. See the notice related to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, published at 
48 FR 29115 (June 24, 1983).


Executive Order 12778


The Office of General Counsel has certified to the OMB that these regulations meet the applicable standards provided
in sections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of this Executive Order.


Paperwork Reduction Act


The amendments set forth in this final rule do not generate any new or revised information collection or recordkeeping
requirements on the public.


Regulatory Flexibility Act


It has been determined that the Regulatory Flexibility Act is not applicable to this final rule. It has been determined
that this rule will not have a significant effect on a substantial number of small businesses because licensing under
the USWA is strictly voluntary on the part of the warehouseman. The actions taken herein are required by statute.


Executive Order 12612


It has been determined that the policies and procedures contained in this rule will not have substantial direct effects
on states or their political subdivisions, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various
levels of government.


National Environmental Policy Act 


This action is not expected to have any significant impact on the quality of the human environment, health, and safety.
Therefore, neither an Environmental Assessment nor an Environmental Impact Statement is needed.


Background


Pursuant to the provisions of the USWA, the Secretary has the authority to license public warehousemen. Warehousemen
that opt to have a USWA license understand that fees will be imposed to cover the costs of the program. Specifically,
the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 mandates the imposition of fees for USWA licensed warehouses. The Act
stipulates that:



The Secretary of Agriculture * * * shall charge, assess, and cause to be collected a reasonable fee
for: (1) Each examination or inspection of a warehouse * * *; (2) each license issued to any person to
classify, inspect, grade, sample, or weigh agricultural products stored or to be stored * * *; (3)
each annual warehouse license issued to a warehouseman to conduct a warehouse * * *; and (4) each warehouse
license amended, modified, extended, or reinstated * * *. Such fees shall cover, as nearly as practicable,
the costs of providing such services and licenses * * * including administrative and supervisory
costs * * *.



This final rule adopts and changes the fees charged and collected, discontinues publication of fee amounts in the
Regulations for Warehouses (7 CFR, chapter VII, subchapter C), and provides for fees to be adjusted annually in order
to cover program costs. Fees assessed in fiscal year 1995, are stated in the paragraphs and tables contained herein.
This fee information was also contained in the proposed rule published on May 19, 1994, in the 

Federal Register

 at 59 FR 26146. The table covering annual fees for cotton, as proposed, has been adjusted for warehouses that have a
capacity exceeding 160,000 bales.


Warehouse and Service License Fees


The fee for original issuance, reissuance, or duplication of a license for cotton, grain, tobacco, wool, dry beans,
nut, syrup, and cottonseed is $65 for each license issued.
The fee charged to license individuals to inspect, sample, grade, classify, or weigh commodities is $26 for each service
license issued.


Warehouse Annual and Inspection Fees


These fees are in the following tables by agricultural product. Inspection fees are assessed for each original examination
or inspection, or reexamination or reinspection for modification of an existing license. Annual fees are assessed
independently of inspection fees.

General Summary of Comments 


The proposed rule was published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 26146) on May 19, 1994. Comments from interested parties were due on or before the close of business on 
June 3, 1994. 
Twenty-two letters were received on time from entities concerned with issues regarding the cotton and grain USWA
changes. Because of the definite division of the comments between cotton and grain, our ``Summary of Comments'' will
be separated accordingly.

Seventeen of the 22 letters concern cotton fees, delaying the effective date of USWA fee charges, and a maximum limit
on fees. The 17 cotton entities are comprised of nine cotton compressors/ginners, four warehousemen, and four Associations.
One of the letters from an association states that its members support maintaining the integrity of the USWA warehouse
receipt system, but association policy will not allow for constructive comment on the proposal at this time. 
Five of the 22 letters concern grain fee increases and future fee announcements. The five entities are comprised of
three associations and two warehousemen. 
A total of 41 comments were received. Thirty-two of these comments concerned cotton, and 9 concerned grain. 
Discussion of Comments 
Most of the commenters were supportive of the continued need for the USWA and of the concepts behind the proposal. However,
many of the comments suggest that a different approach would be more desirable to finance the costs of the program.

The final rule adopts the proposed fees for grain, tobacco, wool, dry bean, nut, syrup, and cottonseed warehouses
without change. One minor change to the fee proposal regarding cotton has been made. The amount of fees collected in
warehouses where the capacity exceeds 160,000 bales, will be subject to incremental increases. 


Summary of Comments 


Cotton 


Fees 


Some degree of confusion exists among the commenters as they refer to the federal and State regulation programs and
warehouses with a Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) Cotton Storage Agreement as being one and the same. Specifically,
they believe that all regulatory and contractual fees should be announced at the same time. However, these three agencies
operate under different legislation with different authorities. Therefore, these comments are not discussed below
in detail. 
A total of 11 comments were received regarding fees. One comment opposes the warehouse and service license fee increase,
as well as the annual and inspection fee increases. One comment states that it is assumed that warehousemen who are
currently licensed would be grandfathered into this fee structure and would be opposed to any new assessment of fees
to cover the cost of existing licensed space. One comment strongly opposes the implementation of user fees for cotton,
stating that it is a new taxation. One comment understands the need for fees; but believes fees should be based on an
hourly rate of actual time spent. The commenter feels that if the main purpose is to cover an inspector's expenses,
that it would be more appropriate than using the bale capacity as the basis. One comment states that the proposed fees
are far greater than any suggested at recent meetings. The commenter feels that omission of any inspection fees for
State licensed warehouses is discriminatory. One comment states that the proposed fees are much too high, and that
ASCS should lock in any fee for at least five years. One comment states that user fees are not opposed, but that the fee
schedule in the 

Federal Register

 discriminates against small warehouses. One comment states that the importance of the examination system is questioned.
When examiners logged in each bale and knew what was missing, the audit provided valuable information. The commenter
feels that if a bale by bale check was still done it would be useful and that he would be glad to pay the fees for the service.
One comment supports the need for inspection fees, but believes we should consider a freeze on the level of fees for
a specific time, say five years, on the basis that escalations should not be needed in the near term. One comment opposes
the proposed fees. The commenter feels that the fees are too much, too soon, and if fees are a must, they should be phased
in over not less than a 3-year period. One comment states that there is reluctant concurrence with the imposition of
fees, but that they fully support the need for inspection fees to be imposed for cotton.

After consideration of these comments, ASCS decided to proceed with the implementation of fees on USWA licensed cotton
warehousemen. To cancel or delay such fees would not be in accordance with the statutory requirements to collect fees
for services. Since the USWA licensing authority has no control over, or influence on, State regulatory agencies
or CCC, it is not feasible to announce all such fees at the same time. The CCC contractual year is not the same as the USDA
fiscal year. The State authority has no connection with the USWA programs. 



Delaying Effective Date of USWA Fee Charges 


A total of 10 comments were received regarding the effective date. Nine commenters feel that all cotton warehouses,
including state licensed and CCC warehousemen, should be treated equitably in the timing of fee announcements. One
comment, from a grain association, fully supports the proposal for cotton warehouses to pay their fair share of the
costs of the federal warehouse system. 
After consideration, ASCS decided it could not change the manner in which the initial annual fees would be assessed
for cotton warehouses. 


Maximum Limit on Fees 


A total of 11 comments were received regarding caps on fees. Nine commenters state that they oppose the 160,000 cap
on charges because some warehouses are larger, and that the cap would be discriminatory to the smaller capacity warehouses.
One comment opposes the cap on capacity because there are additional expenses inspecting large warehouses and they
should be charged accordingly. One comment also opposes the cap and feels that fees should be escalated without regard
to an arbitrary cap. 

After consideration of these comments, ASCS decided to remove the cap of 160,000 bales of capacity for cotton warehouses
by adding an incremental increase with no cap. 


Grain 


Fee Increases 


A total of five comments were received regarding the fee increase. All five commenters oppose the increase at this
time and recommend deferring it until ASCS takes steps to streamline the program and cut costs. 
After consideration of these comments, ASCS decided to go ahead with increases as proposed. To cancel or delay this
increase would result in a major decrease in the services provided, and therefore the integrity of the USWA. Future
Fee Announcements 
A total of four comments were received regarding future fee announcements. All four commenters oppose changing the
fee setting process and eliminating advance public notice and comment. 
These comments were considered, however, it was determined that the proposed system is necessary and will be implemented.
The regulatory process of writing, clearing, and publishing proposed and final rules in the 

Federal Register

 takes, on the average, nine to twelve months. By removing the fees from the regulatory process, ASCS is able to respond
in a timely manner and make necessary fee adjustments.

Warehouse annual and inspection fees. 



Warehousemen must pay: 
(a) An annual fee which will be determined by computing the capacity for each warehouse location under a single license
and adding those amounts together to determine the total due. The fee will be assessed and payable when the warehouse
bond is furnished in accordance with these regulations, for acceptance by the Secretary and annually thereafter
on the bond renewal date. The capacity for each identifiable location will be determined by the Secretary. The total
capacity of all locations may not exceed the capacity stated in the current license. An identifiable location is a
fully functional public warehouse as determined by the Secretary. The annual fee a licensed warehouseman is assessed
may be adjusted by the amount Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) pays, if CCC has a storage contract or agreement with
the warehouseman. 
(b) An inspection fee for each original and amendment inspection. 
(c) An inspection fee at the rate of 100 percent of the annual fee charged warehouses without a CCC storage contract
or agreement, in all cases where the license has been suspended and the warehouseman has requested reinstatement.
No fee will be charged if the Secretary determines that the suspension was not justified. 
(d) A fee for each inspection requested by the warehouseman at the rate of 100 percent of the annual fee charged warehouses
without a CCC storage contract or agreement.

Priority Dates for Employment-Based Petitions


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Immigration and Naturalization Service, Justice.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This final rule amends the Immigration and Naturalization Service regulations on priority dates for employment-based
petitions based on labor certifications filed before October 1, 1991. This rule implements section 302(e)(2) of
the Miscellaneous and Technical Immigration and Naturalization Amendments of 1991 (MTINA), which amended section
161 (c)(1) of the Immigration Act of 1990 (IMMACT). This rule is necessary to ensure full public awareness of the October
1, 1993 deadline to file an employment-based petition, if the underlying labor certification was filed before October
1, 1991.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On November 29, 1991, the Service published a final rule on employment-based petitions in the 

Federal Register

 at 56 FR 60897-60913. The final rule, codified at 8 CFR 204.5(d), provided that the priority date for an employment-based
petition accompanied by a labor certification shall be the date on which any office within the employment service
system of the Department of Labor accepted the request for labor certification. A priority date determines when an
alien who has had an immigrant visa petition approved on his or her behalf may submit his or her application for permanent
resident status or an immigrant visa. 




Subsequent to the promulgation of this regulation, the President signed into law the Miscellaneous and Technical
Immigration and Naturalization Amendments of 1991, (MTINA) Public Law 102-232, dated December 12, 1991. Section
302(e)(2) of the MTINA, which amended section 161(c)(1) of the Immigration Act of 1990, (IMMACT) Public Law 102-649,
dated November 29, 1990, addressed, among other things, the transition of labor certifications filed before October
1, 1991 into the new employment-based immigrant visa categories created by IMMACT. In this regard, section 302(e)(2)
of MTINA provides that, in order to maintain the priority date of a labor certification application filed in connection
with an employment-based petition which was submitted to a state employment office before October 1, 1991, the employer
must file a petition under section 203(b) of the Act before October 1, 1993. Section 302(e)(2) of MTINA further provides
that if the Department of Labor approves a pre-October 1, 1991 labor certification application subsequent to October
1, 1993, the employer must file a petition under section 203(b) of the Act within 60 days of the date of certification
to maintain the pre-October 1, 1991 priority date. Although not specifically provided for in section 302(e)(2) of
MTINA, the Service has interpreted that section to require that, in the case of labor certifications which the Department
of Labor certified between August 2, 1993 and October 1, 1993, a petition under section 203(b) of the Act must be filed
within 60 days after the date of certification to preserve the earlier priority date. The Service does not believe
that Congress intended to provide those employers less than 60 days from the date of certification to file a petition
under section 203(b) of the Act. 

To implement section 302(e)(2) of MTINA, the Service issued an interim rule with request for comments on January 5,
1994 at 59 FR 501-502, providing that in the case of labor certifications accepted for processing by any office
within the employment service system of the Department of Labor before October 1, 1991, the sponsoring employer must
file a petition under section 203(b) of the Act before October 1, 1993, or within 60 days after the date of certification
by the Department of Labor, whichever is later, in order to maintain the pre-October 1, 1991 priority date. If the petitioning
employer fails to maintain the pre-October 1, 1991 priority date, the priority date shall be the date a new employment-based
petition is properly filed with the Service.

The public was provided with a 30-day period, ending on February 4, 1994, to comment on the interim regulation. The
Service received three comments. 



Discussion of Comments 



Statutory Interpretation 



One commenter disagreed with the Service's interpretation of section 161(c) of IMMACT. Focusing on the requirement
that a petitioner seeking to preserve a pre-October 1, 1991 priority date must file a ``new petition'', the commenter
argued that Congress intended the priority date rule in section 161(c)(1)(A) of IMMACT to apply only to employment-based
petitions filed before October 1, 1991 and not to applications for labor certification filed before that date. The
commenter further contended that an employment-based petition filed after the Department of Labor certifies a labor
certification would not be a ``new'' petition since an employment-based petition is considered to be ``new'' only
if the petitioner has not previously filed an employment-based petition on behalf of the alien. In other words, the
commenter basically argues that the use of the words ``new petition'' in section 161(c)(1)(A) of IMMACT presupposes
the filing of an old petition. The Service disagrees with the commenter's argument. 

In order to properly address the comment, it is necessary to examine carefully section 161(c)(1)(A) of IMMACT. The
underlined portions of section 161(c)(1)(A), which specifically refer to labor certification applications, are
the MTINA amendments, which were added after IMMACT became effective. The language of section 161(c)(1)(A) of IMMACT
reads as follows: 

(1) In the case of a petition filed under section 204(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act before October 1, 1991,
for preference status under section 203(a)(3) or section 203(a)(6) of such Act (as in effect before such date) 

or an application for labor certification before such date under section 212(a)(14)_ 

(A) in order to maintain the priority date with respect to such a petition or application,

 the petitioner must file (by not later than October 1,  1991, but not certified until after October 1, 1993, 

or 60 days after the date of certification in the case of labor certifications filed in support of the petition under
section 212(a)(14) of such Act before October 1, 1991, but not certified until after October 1, 1993

) a new petition for classification of the employment under paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of section 203(b) of such Act
(as amended by this title), and 

Before Congress amended section 161(c)(1)(A) of IMMACT by enacting section 302(e)(2) of the MTINA, section 161(c)(1)(A)
provided that in order to maintain a priority date of an employment-based petition filed before October 1, 1991, a
new petition must be filed by October 1, 1993. As used in section 161(c)(1)(A) of IMMACT, the term ``new petition''
clearly refers to an employment-based petition other than the one the petitioner had previously filed with the Service
and not ``new'' in the sense of a first-time petition. Congress' use of the word ``new'' in section 302(e)(2) of MTINA
does not alter the fact that the MTINA was amended specifically in order to apply the same priority date standard applicable
to employment-based petitions to labor certifications applications filed before October 1, 1991. It is a basic rule
of statutory construction that effect must be given to every word, clause, and sentence of a statute, so that no part
will be inoperative, superfluous, or would emasculate the entire amendment. See  46.06 Singer, Sutherland
Statutory Interpretation, 5th Ed. (1992); 

U.S.

 v. 

Menasche,

 348 U.S. 528, 538-39 (1955). Adopting the commenter's interpretation of section 161(c)(1)(A) of IMMACT would
render the MTINA amendments to that section superfluous simply because Congress retained the word ``new petition.''
The Service cannot ignore the MTINA amendment. For this reason, the Service will not accept the commenter's reading
of section 161(c) of IMMACT. 

The commenter also criticized the Service for engaging in retroactive rulemaking, citing 

Bowen

 v. 

Georgetown University Hospital,

 488 U.S. 204 (1988). The Supreme Court held in 

Bowen

 that courts should be reluctant to find authority for retroactive rulemaking absent an express statutory grant.
See 

id.

 at 209. As stated in the preceding paragraph, however, this rule is based on an express statutory amendment creating
the October 1, 1993 deadline. The 

Bowen

 case is not applicable to this situation, since the Service is simply implementing a clear statutory directive.

Timing of the Interim Rule



Two commenters criticized the Service for promulgating this regulation as an interim regulation after the October
1, 1993 deadline for submitting petitions elapsed. One commenter stated that the timing of the promulgation of the
Service's regulation violated the spirit of the Administrative Procedures Act and was unfair to the public by not
providing the public with adequate notice of the October 1, 1993 deadline by issuing the interim rule in January of
1994.

The timing of the interim regulation did not implicate the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) nor did it adversely
impact the public. The MTINA amendments to section 161(c)(1)(A) of IMMACT clearly superseded the Service's regulation
on establishing priority dates for employment-based petitions in the case of labor certifications filed before
October 1, 1991. The interim rule merely made the regulations consistent with the statute. The purpose of the regulation
was to inform the public that, under section 301(e)(2) of the MTINA, if a labor certification was filed before October
1, 1991, the petitioning employer should file an employment-based petition with the Service as soon as possible to
maintain the priority date. It also notified the public of the statutory requirement that if a labor certification
filed before October 1, 1991 is still pending with the Department of Labor, an employment-based petition must be filed
within 60 days of the date of certification to preserve the priority date. Any impact on the public therefore resulted
from the enactment of section 301(e)(2) of the MTINA and not by the promulgation of the interim rule.



Other Comments



One commenter objected to the interim rule on the ground that it had an impact on pending litigation involving substitution
of labor certification beneficiaries by the employer. See 

Kooritsky

 v. 

Reich,

 No. 92-5277 (D.C. Cir. March 18, 1994). In the 

Kooritsky

 decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia invalidated on APA grounds a Department of Labor regulation
which eliminated substitution of labor certification beneficiaries. The commenter argued that the interim rule
adversely affected an employer's ability to substitute labor certification beneficiaries, because, under the
interim rule, the substituted alien will not have the original priority date if the employer failed to file an employment-based
petition before the October 1, 1993 deadline.

The same commenter also stated that the interim rule circumvents the Department of Labor's existing rule at 20 CFR
656.30 that a labor certification is valid indefinitely. The interim rule neither affects an employer's ability
to substitute labor certification beneficiaries nor the Department of Labor's regulation. By issuing this interim
rule, the Service simply implemented section 302(e)(2) of the MTINA, which deals solely with preservation of priority
dates. Moreover, even though the MTINA amendment may affect a pre-October 1, 1991 priority date, it has no effect on
the validity of the underlying labor certification.

One commenter suggested that the Service extend the October 1, 1993 filing deadline to a date 60 days after the effective
date of this final rule. Absent a clear indication from Congress, the Service does not have the authority to go beyond
the plain language of the statute and extend the October 1, 1993 deadline.

In sum, section 302(e)(2) of the MTINA requires that in order to preserve a pre-October 1, 1991 priority date, the employer
must file an employment-based petition with the Service before October 1, 1993 or within 60 days after the Department
of Labor approves the labor certification, whichever is later.



Regulatory Flexibility Act



The Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility
Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this regulation and by approving it certifies that this rule will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule affects only a very limited number of petitioners
and aliens who filed requests for labor certifications prior to October 1, 1991, but have not filed petitions under
section 203(b) of the Act.



Executive Order 12866



This rule is not considered by the Department of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Service, to be a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866, section 3(f), Regulatory Planning and Review, and the Office of
Management and Budget has waived its review process under section 6(a)(3)(A).



Executive Order 12612



The regulation will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government
and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore,
in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this rule does not have sufficient Federalism implications
to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.



Executive Order 12606



The Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service certifies that she has assessed this rule in light
of the criteria in Executive Order 12606 and has determined that it will have no effect on family well-being.

Accordingly, the interim rule amending 8 CFR part 204 which was published at 59 FR 501-502 on January 5, 1994,
is adopted as a final rule without change.

Airworthiness Directives; Dornier Model 328-100 Airplanes


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to all Dornier Model 328-100 airplanes.
This action requires repetitive tightening of the screws and quick-release fasteners on the wing/body fairing panels.
This amendment is prompted by reports of loosened wing/body fairing panels. The actions specified in this AD are intended
to prevent structural damage to the horizontal or vertical stabilizer and potential injury to persons on the ground
due to loosened wing/body fairing panels that may separate from the airplane.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Luftfahrt-Bundesamt (LBA), which is the airworthiness authority for the Federal Republic of Germany, recently
notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on all Dornier Model 328-100 airplanes. The LBA advises that
during flight testing, prior to certification of Model 328-100 airplanes, the quick-release (camlock) fasteners
on the wing/body fairing panels were found to be loose on several airplanes. In another instance, an operator of Model
328-100 airplanes reported that a loosened fairing panel separated from an in-service airplane and struck
an antenna on the empennage while the airplane was in flight. Investigation into the cause of these loosened panels
revealed that the flex of the wing, coupled with the relative motion between the fairing panel and its supporting structure,
may have caused the fasteners to back out. Such loosened fasteners may have allowed air loads to pull the panel loose
from its supports, which resulted in the panel separating from the airplane. In addition, the tightness of the fasteners
may have compressed the relatively soft material of the fairing panel, which may have contributed to the loosening
of the fasteners. This condition, if not corrected, could result in structural damage to the horizontal or vertical
stabilizer and potential injury to persons on the ground due to loosened wing/body fairing panels that may separate
from the airplane.


Dornier has issued Alert Service Bulletin ASB-328-53-004, dated August 2, 1994, which describes
procedures for repetitive tightening of the screws and quick-release fasteners on the wing/body fairing panels.
The LBA classified this alert service bulletin as highly recommended and issued LBA Airworthiness Directive 94-009/3,
dated September 8, 1994, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in the Federal Republic
of Germany.
This airplane model is manufactured in the Federal Republic of Germany and is type certificated for operation in the
United States under the provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable
bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the LBA has kept the FAA
informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the LBA, reviewed all available information,
and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in
the United States.
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, this AD is being issued to prevent structural damage to the horizontal or vertical
stabilizer and potential injury to persons on the ground due to loosened wing/body fairing panels that may separate
from the airplane. This AD requires repetitive tightening of the screws and quick-release fasteners on the wing/body
fairing panels. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the alert service bulletin described
previously.
This is considered to be interim action. The manufacturer has advised that it currently is developing a modification
that will positively address the unsafe condition addressed by this AD. Once this modification is developed, approved,
and available, the FAA may consider additional rulemaking.
Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days.

Comments Invited


Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption 

ADDRESSES

. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed.
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket.
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this rule must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94-NM-171-AD.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter.
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and that it is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866.
It has been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and
Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be
significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed
in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



History




On August 10, 1994, the FAA published a final rule (59 FR 40801) to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations
(14 CFR part 71) to establish Class E airspace at Eastport, ME. The proposal was prompted by a review of proposed standard
instrument approach procedures (SIAP's) for Eastport Municipal Airport which showed a need for controlled airspace
upward from 700 feet above the surface for instrument flight rules (IFR) operations at the airport. The Class E airspace
description for Eastport, ME contains an error in the latitude for the Eastport Municipal Airport. The latitude should
read 44

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


Participation at the Meeting



Pursuant to the September 20, 1994, Notice of public meeting, requests from persons who wish to present oral statements
at the Washington, DC or New York public meetings should have been received by the FAA no later than October 3, 1994.
Requests received after the date specified above will be scheduled if there is time available during the meeting.
Such requests should be submitted to Cindy Herman as listed in the section titled FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT


and should include at which meeting oral statements will be presented, a written summary of oral remarks to be presented,
and an estimate of time needed for the presentation. Requests to present oral statements may be made on the day of the
public meetings during the registration period, although time constraints may not permit the accommodation of such
requests. The DOT will prepare an agenda of speakers that will be available at the meeting. The names of those individuals
whose requests to present oral statements are received after the date specified above may not appear on the written
agenda. To accommodate as many speakers as possible, the amount of time allocated to each speaker may be less than the
amount of time requested.



Background



On September 20, 1994, the FAA published in the 

Federal Register

 a Notice of public meeting regarding the High Density Rule (59 FR 48165). Specifically, the DOT seeks comment on the
following key issues:

(1) The economic, environmental, competitive, and operational aspects of the High Density Rule at the four airports.

(2) The projected air traffic environment.

(3) The process for allocating domestic and international slots.

(4) Access for small communities at High Density Rule airports.

(5) Potential alternatives to the current regulatory scheme at the High Density Rule airports.

These issues are intended to help focus public comments on areas that will be useful to the DOT in completing its review
of the High Density Rule. The comments at the meetings need not be limited to these issues, and the DOT invites comments
on any other aspect of the High Density Rule.

Meeting Procedures



The following meeting procedures, as established in the September 20, 1994, 

Federal Register

, are to facilitate the meetings:

(1) There will be no admission fee or other charge to attend or to participate in the meetings. The meetings will be open
to all persons who are scheduled to present statements or who register on the day of the meeting (between 10:45 a.m.
and 11:45 a.m.) subject to availability of space in the meeting rooms. The meetings may adjourn early if scheduled
for the meetings.

(2) An individual, whether speaking in a personal or a representative capacity on behalf of an organization, may be
limited to a 10-minute statement. If possible, we will notify the speaker if additional time is available.

(3) The DOT will try to accommodate all speakers. If the available time does not permit this, speakers generally will
be scheduled on a first-come-first-served basis. However, the DOT reserves the right to exclude some speakers if
necessary to present a balance of viewpoints and issues.

(4) Sign and oral interpretation can be made available at the meeting, as well as an assistive listening device, if
requested 10 calendar days before the meeting.

(5) Representatives of the DOT will preside over the meeting. A panel of DOT and FAA personnel involved in this issue
will be present.

(6) The meeting will be recorded by a court reporter. A transcript of the meeting and any material accepted by the DOT
representatives during the meeting will be included in the public docket. Any person who is interested in purchasing
a copy of the transcript should contact the court reporter directly. Additional transcript purchase information
will be available at the meeting.

(7) The DOT will review and consider all material presented by participants at the meeting. Position papers or material
presenting views or arguments related to the High Density Rule may be accepted at the discretion of the presiding officer
and subsequently placed in the public docket. The DOT requests that persons participating in the meeting provide
five copies of all materials to be presented for distribution to the DOT representatives; other copies may be provided
to the audience at the discretion of the participant.

(8) Statements made by DOT representatives are intended to facilitate discussion of the issues or to clarify issues.
Any statement made during the meeting by a DOT representative is not intended to be, and should not be construed as,
a position of the DOT.

(9) The meetings are designed to solicit public views and more complete information on the High Density Rule. Therefore,
the meetings will be conducted in an informal and nonadversarial manner. No individual will be subject to cross-examination
by any other participant; however, DOT representatives may ask questions to clarify a statement and to ensure a complete
and accurate record.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Interim rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This interim rule is issued by the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to clarify what
records shall be adequate to satisfy recordkeeping requirements for Listed Chemical transactions under provisions
of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) as amended by the Chemical Diversion and Trafficking Act of 1988 (CDTA) and
the Domestic Chemical Diversion Control Act of 1993 (DCDCA). Specifically, the amendment clarifies that for prescription
drug products, prescription and hospital records shall be adequate to satisfy recordkeeping requirements.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On March 17, 1994, the Acting Administrator of the DEA published a proposed rule in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 12562) to eliminate the threshold for ephedrine under provisions of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) as
amended by the Chemical Diversion and Trafficking Act of 1988 (CDTA) and the Domestic Chemical Diversion Control
Act of 1993 (DCDCA). This would require that recordkeeping, reporting and notification requirements of 21 CFR 1310
and 21 CFR 1313 apply to all transactions involving bulk ephedrine and single entity ephedrine products. Interested
parties had until May 2, 1994 to submit comments and objections.





A comment submitted by Abbott Laboratories requested that prescription injectable ephedrine products continue
to be exempt under the definition of ``regulated transaction''. Abbott further stated that there is no evidence of
diversion of these products which are dispensed pursuant to a prescription.

While the DEA agrees that it is not currently aware of the diversion of these single entity ephedrine injectable products,
the CSA does not provide for the exemption of a specific form of single entity ephedrine product. Therefore, recordkeeping,
reporting and notification requirements will apply to these prescription injectable products. However, prescription
and hospital records kept in the normal course of medical treatment are adequate to meet the recordkeeping requirements
of 21 CFR 1310. Therefore 21 CFR 1310.06(b) is being modified to reflect that for purposes of this section, prescription
and hospital records kept in the normal course of medical treatment shall be adequate to meet these recordkeeping
requirements for each record required under 21 CFR 1310.03. Reports, as specified in 21 CFR 1310.05, must be filed
although it is anticipated that they will rarely be necessary. In addition, notification requirements as set forth
in 21 CFR 1313 must still be satisfied for these products.



This action is being published as an interim rule with an effective date coinciding with the final rule which eliminates
the threshold for ephedrine since this will reduce the burden on hospitals and other institutions which dispense
ephedrine prescription products.

The Attorney General has delegated authority under CSA and all subsequent amendments to the CSA to the Administrator
of the DEA (28 CFR 0.100). The Administrator, in turn, has delegated this authority to the Deputy Administrator pursuant
to 28 CFR 0.104 (59 FR 23637 (May 6, 1994)). The Deputy Administrator hereby certifies that this interim rulemaking
will have no significant impact upon entities whose interests must be considered under the Regulatory Flexibility
Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. This interim rule is not a significant regulatory action and therefore has not been reviewed
by the Office of Management and Budget pursuant to Executive Order 12866.

This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria in E.O 12612, and it has been determined
that the interim rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism
Assessment.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This final rule is issued by the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to eliminate the
threshold for ephedrine under provisions of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) as amended by the Chemical Diversion
and Trafficking Act of 1988 (CDTA) and the Domestic Chemical Diversion Control Act of 1993 (DCDCA) in order to reduce
the diversion of ephedrine to clandestine laboratory operators. This will subject all transactions involving bulk
ephedrine and single entity ephedrine drug products to the applicable provisions of the Controlled Substances Act
(CSA).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On March 17, 1994, the Acting Administrator of the DEA published a proposed rule in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 12562) to eliminate the threshold for ephedrine under provisions of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) as
amended by the Chemical Diversion and Trafficking Act of 1988 (CDTA) and the Domestic Chemical Diversion Control
Act of 1993 (DCDCA). Interested parties had until May 2, 1994 to submit comments and objections.



Ephedrine is the primary precursor utilized in the clandestine synthesis of methamphetamine and methcathinone,
both potent central nervous system (CNS) stimulants controlled under the CSA. The public health risks from the abuse
of these drugs are well known and documented.

Ephedrine is a listed chemical under the Chemical Diversion and Trafficking Act of 1988 (CDTA) (Pub. L. 100-690).
Under provisions of the CDTA (21 U.S.C. 802 (39)(A)), thresholds were originally assigned to each listed chemical.
The CDTA imposes reporting, recordkeeping and notification requirements for regulated transactions which meet
or exceed these threshold amounts of a listed chemical.

The Domestic Chemical Diversion Control Act (DCDCA) of 1993 (Pub. L. 103-200) became effective on April 16,
1994. This Act amends the CSA via modification of 21 U.S.C. 802 (39)(A) by redefining the term ``regulated transaction''
as a ``distribution, receipt, sale, importation, or exportation, or an international transaction involving shipment
of a listed chemical, or if the Attorney General establishes a threshold amount for a specific listed chemical, a threshold
amount, including a cumulative threshold amount for multiple transactions'' of a listed chemical. All regulated
transactions in a listed chemical, regardless of size, are subject to CSA reporting, recordkeeping and notification
requirements if no threshold is established.

In addition, the DCDCA further modifies the definition of a ``regulated transaction'' by removing the exemption
for those transactions involving products which are marketed or distributed lawfully in the U.S. under the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 

et seq.

), if these products contain ephedrine (or its salts, optical isomers, or salts of optical isomers) as the only active
medicinal ingredient or contain ephedrine (or its salts, optical isomers, or salts of optical isomers) in combination
with therapeutically insignificant quantities of another active medicinal ingredient (21 U.S.C. 802 (39)(A)(iv)).
The DCDCA also provides that the Attorney General shall by regulation remove this exemption for drug products that
the Attorney General finds are being diverted in order to obtain a listed chemical for use in the illicit production
of a controlled substance.

The threshold for ephedrine was originally established as 1.0 kilogram for domestic, import and export transactions
(54 FR 31657). The threshold of 1.0 kilogram of ephedrine base is equivalent to greater than 48,000 ephedrine 25 mg
dosage units.

Thresholds are continuously reviewed by DEA to determine if they are satisfactory to prevent diversion. Current
evidence shows that the threshold for ephedrine of 1.0 kilogram is not adequate to prevent the diversion of ephedrine
to clandestine laboratory operators in the United States. Clandestine laboratory operators are obtaining ephedrine
in quantities much less than the current 1.0 kilogram threshold for use in the illicit production of methamphetamine
and methcathinone. DEA had determined that in order to ensure the maximum effectiveness of the CSA in curtailing the
diversion of ephedrine, there should be no threshold for ephedrine. Subsequently, all regulated transactions of
ephedrine would be subject to reporting, recordkeeping and notification requirements of the CSA regardless of size.



Comments



Seven comments were received in response to the March 17, 1994, Notice of proposed rulemaking. Some comments pertained
to provisions of the DCDCA which are not related to the ephedrine threshold. These comments will not be addressed in
this Federal Register Notice, but DEA will consider them in preparing the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking pertaining
to the DCDCA. A summary of relevant comments received is provided below:

A comment submitted by the National Wholesale Druggist Association (NWDA) did not raise any objections to the elimination
of the ephedrine threshold. NWDA, however, raised the issue that the March 17, 1994, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
does not change the definition of ``regulated transaction'' in Section 1310.01 (f) to be consistent with the DCDCA.
This will be remedied when the DEA publishes proposed regulations which implement the DCDCA in the near future.

A comment was also received from the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP). The NABP strongly supports
the elimination of the ephedrine threshold. Furthermore, the NABP expresses its support for the more restrictive
actions taken by certain state authorities whereby single entity ephedrine products have been placed in controlled
substance schedules or placed on prescription-only status. The NABP also states that a nationwide Federal effort
is needed to better monitor the distribution of single entity ephedrine products.

A comment was submitted on behalf of BDI Pharmaceuticals and raised the following issues:

BDI's comment states that the elimination of the threshold is prohibitory and will remove single entity ephedrine
products from retail stores. However, the elimination of the threshold only imposes recordkeeping, reporting and
notification requirements and will not remove products from the market. BDI states that the increased recordkeeping
burden from the elimination of the threshold will decrease the number of retail stores willing to sell ephedrine products.
BDI states that 21 CFR 1310.06(d) estimates that it will take approximately ten minutes to fulfill the recordkeeping
requirements for each sale. BDI further states that this is an excessive burden which will be a major factor in a merchant's
decision to drop the product. However, 21 CFR 1310.06(d) does not provide an estimate of the time required to keep sales
records of each regulated chemical transaction and it is estimated that creating and storing a transaction record
requires an average of only one minute per record. Conversely, 21 CFR 1310.06(d) pertains to the amount of time needed
for the filing of reports of suspicious transactions, unusual losses or domestic regulated transactions in a tableting
or encapsulating machine as outlined in 21 CFR 1310.05. These situations, whereby reports should be filed, occur
infrequently.

BDI's comment makes the point that asthma is a serious condition and elimination of the threshold for ephedrine will
have an adverse impact upon asthma patients because the single entity product will become unavailable. DEA recognizes
that asthma is a serious condition for which ephedrine has an approved treatment indication. DEA, in an effort to ensure
that the elimination of the ephedrine threshold would not adversely effect the availability of medications for the
treatment of patients suffering from this condition, has circulated the March 17, 1994, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Within FDA, this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking was circulated to several
offices for review and consideration. DEA has received an official response that FDA supports the proposed threshold
elimination in order to address the misuse, diversion and trafficking associated with single entity ephedrine products.
In addition, FDA's formal response also states that FDA believes that there may be other ephedrine products that may
also need to be considered for regulation under the CSA as amended by the CDTA and DCDCA.

The comment received from the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP) which strongly supports the elimination
of the ephedrine threshold also states that ``NABP agrees that adoption of the proposed rule should have no significant
impact on pharmacies, hospitals, or points of distribution that distribute medications containing ephedrine for
the treatment of asthma and other conditions.'' The NABP comment also notes that other products are also available
for the treatment of asthma.

BDI's comment claims that DEA is biased against single entity ephedrine products while many advertised combination
products are not considered safe and effective. On the contrary, DEA is not supporting the use of one product over another
for the treatment of asthma or any other medical condition. It is not DEA's mandate to make such determinations. It
is, however, DEA's responsibility to prevent the diversion of chemicals for the illicit production of controlled
substances. The DCDCA removes the exemption for single entity ephedrine products. However, it is important to note
that the DCDCA also provides for the removal of an exemption for any drug or group of drugs that are being diverted to
obtain the listed chemical for use in the illicit production of a controlled substance. Under such provisions, combination
products used in the illicit production of controlled substances can lose their exemptions and thus be subjected
to recordkeeping, reporting, notification and registration requirements. DEA plans to closely monitor such activity,
and is prepared to pursue the removal of exemptions for those products. 

BDI's comment implies that the high retail cost of its product line prevents these products from being a cost effective
source of ephedrine for clandestine laboratory use. Depending upon the package size, BDI reports that 48,000 ephedrine
25 mg tablets would cost $3,000 to $9,000 at a retail outlet. In contrast, however, based on data available to DEA regarding
the national range of street prices for methamphetamine in 1993, these products are a cost effective source of ephedrine
for clandestine laboratory use.

BDI's comment states that the comment period should be extended. However, BDI's request for extension was denied
by the Administrator on the grounds that sufficient information was included in the March 17, 1994, Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking and ample time given for comments to be submitted.

BDI's comment states that the likely source of ephedrine at clandestine laboratories is bulk ephedrine from Canada.
This is not substantiated by DEA information. Ephedrine tablets have been seized at many clandestine laboratories.
It is important to note, however, that DEA has emphasized that smuggling from Mexico is also an important source of
ephedrine for clandestine laboratory usage.

BDI's comment states that Congress did not contemplate the complete elimination of the ephedrine threshold. On the
contrary, the language in the DCDCA is specific, i.e. the DCDCA uses the language ``or if the Attorney General establishes
a threshold amount for a specific listed chemical''. Such language makes it clear that the normal case would be that
listed chemicals would not have a threshold unless the Attorney General decides that a threshold is warranted and
that the Attorney General may remove the threshold from chemicals already listed.

BDI's comment states that DEA has no evidence of retail package diversion. On the contrary, DEA does have evidence
of the retail diversion of ephedrine tablets as a source of precursor material for clandestine laboratory use. In
addition to the smuggling of ephedrine and purchase via mail order, ephedrine is obtained through the purchase of
ephedrine tablets from gas stations, convenience stores and other retail outlets. This includes small 6 count packets
of ephedrine and bottles of 24 dosage units. Investigative information shows that individuals have gone from store
to store to buy out the stock of ephedrine until they obtain sufficient material for desired batch sizes. 

T&M Distributing commented that DEA has not demonstrated that the current threshold is insufficient to control
diversion, and has failed to consider the burden to public health. These specific issues have been addressed earlier
in this 

Federal Register

 Notice.

A comment submitted by Abbott Laboratories requested that prescription injectable products continue to be exempt
under the definition of ``regulated transaction''. Abbott further states that there is no evidence of diversion
of these products which are sold by prescription only. While the DEA agrees that it is not currently aware of the diversion
of these single entity ephedrine injectable products, the CSA does not provide for the exemption of a specific form
of single entity ephedrine products. Therefore, recordkeeping, reporting and notification requirements will
apply to these prescription injectable products. However, prescription and hospital records kept in the normal
course of medical treatment are adequate to meet the recordkeeping requirements of 21 CFR part 1310. An Interim Rule,
which modifies 21 CFR part 1310 to clarify this, will be published in the 

Federal Register

.
Several comments proposed alternatives to the elimination of the threshold. BDI proposed that there be no monthly
cumulative threshold for retail stores which stock only packages of 100 tablets or less and limit sales to 2.5 grams
per transaction. A comment submitted by The Hammer Corporation suggested an alternative threshold of 61 tablets
per individual transaction and 6000 tablets per month. Mr. G's Manufacturer and Wholesale Distributors suggested
that 6 count or 42 count package sizes should be exempt at the retail level. T&M Distributing suggested that a threshold
of 12,000 capsules or tablets per month be instituted.
DEA has considered all of these comments and suggested alternatives. However, given the small batch sizes encountered
at U.S. clandestine methamphetamine and methcathinone laboratories, evidence of the diversion of ephedrine from
various types of outlets, and the public health threat imposed by the diversion of these ephedrine products, DEA has
determined that none of the suggested alternatives are sufficient to prevent the diversion of ephedrine consistent
with the intentions of the Domestic Chemical Diversion Control Act of 1993 (DCDCA). Therefore DEA had determined
that the elimination of the ephedrine threshold is necessary.
In making this determination, DEA recognizes that additional entities which distribute ephedrine products will
not be required to keep records. Many of the entities which distribute ephedrine products are truckstops, convenience
stores, gas stations and liquor stores. DEA has determined that (1) the sale of ephedrine is not a principal business
activity of these entities and (2) the recordkeeping, reporting and notification requirements resulting from the
elimination of the threshold are essential to prevent and detect the diversion of ephedrine products to clandestine
laboratories.
The Attorney General has delegated authority under the CSA and all subsequent amendments to the CSA to the Administrator
of the DEA (28 CFR 0.100) The Administrator, in turn, has redelegated this authority to the Deputy Administrator pursuant
to 28 CFR 0.104 (59 FR 23637 (May 6, 1994)). The Deputy Administrator hereby certifies that this proposed rulemaking
will have no significant impact upon entities whose interests must be considered under the Regulatory Flexibility
Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. This position is further supported by The National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP)
which commented that the elimination of the ephedrine threshold ``should have no significant impact on pharmacies,
hospitals, or points of distribution that distribute medications containing ephedrine for the treatment of asthma
and other conditions''.
This final rule is not a significant regulatory action and therefore has not been reviewed by the Office of Management
and Budget pursuant to Executive Order 12866.
This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria in E.O. 12612, and it has been determined
that the final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

 This rule implements the provisions of section 506(a) of Pub. L. 103-317. This section prohibits the issuance
of an immigrant visa to an alien for ninety days following an alien's departure from the U.S. unless the alien was maintaining
a lawful nonimmigrant status at the time of departure, or unless the alien is the spouse or unmarried child of an individual
who obtained temporary or permanent resident status under section 210 or 245A of the Immigration and Nationality
Act (INA) or section 202 of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA). Section 506(b) extends the benefits
of adjustment of status to permanent resident status to aliens who entered the U.S. without inspection and to certain
other aliens.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Expansion of INA 245 Adjustment of Status


On August 26, 1994 the President signed into law the appropriations bill for the Department of State, Pub. L. 103-317.
Section 506(b) thereof amends INA 245 to permit qualified immigrants to acquire permanent residence through adjustment
of status in the United States even though they entered the United States without inspection or violated their nonimmigrant
status after entry. The specific amendment to INA 245 is a new subsection (i) which reads as follows:
(i)(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) and (c) of this section, an alien physically present in
the United States who_
(A) entered the United States without inspection; or
(B) is within one of the classes enumerated in subsection (c) of this section, may apply to the Attorney General for
the adjustment of his or her status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence. The Attorney General
may accept such application only if the alien remits with such application a sum equalling five times the fee required
for the processing of applications under this section as of the date of receipt of the application, but such sum shall
not be required from a child under the age of seventeen, or an alien who is the spouse or unmarried child of an individual
who obtained temporary or permanent resident status under section 210 or 245A of the Immigration and Nationality
Act or section 202 of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 at any date, who_
(i) as of May 5, 1988, was the unmarried child or spouse of the individual who obtained temporary or permanent resident
status under section 210 or 245A of the Immigration and Nationality Act or section 202 of the Immigration Reform and
Control Act of 1986;
(ii) entered the United States before May 5, 1988, resided in the United States on May 5, 1988, and is not a lawful permanent
resident; and
(iii) applied for benefits under section 301(a) of the Immigration Act of 1990. The sum specified herein shall be in
addition to the fee normally required for the processing of an application under this section.
(2) Upon receipt of such an application and the sum hereby required, the Attorney General may adjust the status of the
alien to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence if_
(A) the alien is eligible to receive an immigrant visa and is admissible to the United States for permanent residence;
and

<TEXT>
 

(B) an immigrant visa is immediately available to the alien at the time the application is filed.
 

We note that two section 245(i)'s of the INA have been enacted into law in the last two months. The other section 245(i)
was enacted in the Crime Bill, Pub. L. 103-322, which created the ``S'' visa category and accompanying provisions
enabling adjustment of status for ``s'' visa holders. The State Department and the INS view both section 245(i)'s
as co-existing and will seek a legislative technical correction to rename one of the sections as 245(j). 

As the provisions of INA 245 are administered by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), appropriate regulations
and/or implementing instructions will be promulgated by that agency. It is anticipated that many aliens benefiting
from this amendment will indeed take advantage of the adjustment procedures rather than seek immigrant visa issuance
abroad. 



Companion Provision 



This Act further amends the INA at section 212 by adding subsection ``(o)'', which reads as follows: 

(o) An alien who has been physically present in the United States shall not be eligible to receive an immigrant visa
within ninety days following departure therefrom unless_

(1) the alien was maintaining a lawful nonimmigrant status at the time of such departure, or 

(2) the alien is the spouse or unmarried child of an individual who obtained temporary or permanent resident status
under section 210 or 245A of the Immigration and Nationality Act or section 202 of the Immigration Reform and Control
Act of 1986 at any date, who

(A) as of May 5, 1988, was the unmarried child or spouse of the individual who obtained temporary or permanent resident
status under section 210 or 245A of the Immigration and Nationality Act or section 202 of the Immigration Reform and
Control Act of 1986; 

(B) entered the United States before May 5, 1988, resided in the United States on May 5, 1988, and is not a lawful permanent
resident; and 

(C) applied for benefits under section 301 (a) of the Immigration Act of 1990.
 

This amendment to INA 212 encourages aliens who can benefit from the broadened INA 245 adjustment of status provisions
to take advantage of them by discouraging them from seeking immigrant visa issuance from a U.S. consular post abroad.
To induce such aliens to seek INA 245 adjustment of status, Congress imposed a requirement that an immigrant visa applicant
be physically absent from the United States for ninety days since the last departure before an immigrant visa can be
issued. Under this amendment, an alien who departs from the United States would be eligible to receive an immigrant
visa on the 91st day following the departure. As can be seen in the statutory language quoted above, two classes of aliens
are exempted from this provision. The first class consists of aliens maintaining lawful nonimmigrant status at the
time of departure. The second class consists of the spouses and children of certain aliens who benefited from the special
agricultural worker program, the legalization program, and the Cuban-Haitian adjustment provisions of IRCA, and
who sought benefits under the family unity provisions of the Immigration Act of 1990. 



Interim Rule 



This regulation is being promulgated to implement the INA 212(o) prohibitions of issuance on immigrant visas to aliens
who have not complied with the ninety day physical absence requirement, unless the aliens fall within either one of
the two specific excepted classes of aliens. Pursuant to this regulation, consular officers shall refuse to issue
immigrant visas to aliens who have been physically present in the United States unless 90 days have passed since their
departure or unless they are members of either of the two excepted classes of aliens. 

This rule is not expected to have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. This rule imposes no reporting or record-keeping action from the public requiring
the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act requirements. This rule has
been reviewed as required by 
E.O. 12778 and certified to be in compliance therewith. This rule is exempted from E.O. 12866 but has been reviewed
to ensure consistency therewith and vetted with INS through OMB to ensure interagency coordination.

 Final regulations. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document contains final regulations on the 
election to maintain general asset accounts for depreciable 
assets to which section 168 of the Internal Revenue Code 
applies. These regulations reflect changes to the law made 
by the Tax Reform Act of 1986. The regulations will 
simplify certain depreciation calculations. 



</SUMMARY>

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Paperwork Reduction Act 



The collection of information contained in these final 
regulations has been reviewed and approved by the Office of 
Management and Budget in accordance with the requirements of 
the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C 3504(h)) under control 
number 1545-1331. The estimated annual burden per 
respondent or recordkeeper varies from .20 to .30 hours, 
depending on individual circumstances, with an estimated 
average of .25 hours. 

Comments concerning the accuracy of this burden 
estimate and suggestions for reducing this burden should be 
sent to the Internal Revenue Service, Attn: IRS Reports 
Clearance Officer, PC:FP, Washington, DC 20224, and to the 
Office of Management and Budget, Attn: Desk Officer for the 
Department of the Treasury, Office of Information and 
Regulatory Affairs, Washington, DC 20503. 



Background 




On August 31, 1992, the IRS published a notice of 
proposed rulemaking in the 

Federal Register

 (57 FR 39374 
[PS-55-89, 1992-2 C.B. 870]) proposing amendments to the 
Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR part 1) under section 
168(i)(4). These amendments were proposed to reflect the 
amendments made by section 201 of the Tax Reform Act of 
1986. The preamble to the notice contains an explanation of 
the proposed regulations. 

Written comments responding to the notice were 
received, and a public hearing was held on November 4, 1992. 
After considering all written and oral comments, the 
proposed regulations under section 168(i)(4) are adopted as 
revised by this Treasury decision.

Explanation of Provisions 



In General 



The final regulations would simplify the computation of 
depreciation by allowing taxpayers an election to group 
assets into one or more general asset accounts under section 
168(i)(4). The assets in any particular general asset 
account are depreciated as a single asset. Unlike the rules 
under section 168 as in existence before enactment of the 
Tax Reform Act of 1986, general asset account treatment is 
not limited to ``mass assets.'' 

As required by section 168(i)(4), the final regulations 
provide generally that the amount realized upon the 
disposition of an asset from a general asset account is 
recognized as ordinary income. In addition, special rules 
are provided for terminating general asset account treatment 
upon certain dispositions. For transactions described in 
section 168(i)(7)(B), the transferee generally is bound by 
the transferor's general asset account election. 



Changes to the Proposed Regulations 



This Treasury decision generally adopts the rules in 
the proposed regulations. Certain changes to the proposed 
regulations have been made, however, in response to 
comments. These changes and the comments that were not 
adopted in the final regulations are discussed below. 



Assets Subject to Recapture

. One commentator 
recommended that the proposed regulations be amended to 
allow general asset account treatment for assets qualifying 
for the credit under section 47 or 48. After considering 
this comment, the IRS and Treasury Department have concluded 
that it is appropriate to allow taxpayers greater 
flexibility in determining what assets will be included in a 
general asset account. Therefore, the proposed rule that 
prohibits general asset account treatment for investment 
credit property has been deleted. Accordingly, under the 
final regulations, a general asset account may include any 
depreciable asset for which a credit or deduction is 
allowable. 

A new rule, however, has been added in the final 
regulations to account for any basis increase upon 
recapture. The final regulations provide that upon 
recapture, the asset is removed from the general asset 
account as of the first day of the taxable year in which the 
recapture event occurs. In addition, corresponding 
adjustments to the unadjusted depreciable basis and 
depreciation reserve of the account must be made. This rule 
was formulated in view of the limited types of property 
currently eligible for the investment credit. The IRS, 
however, may consider other alternatives to take into 
account the basis increase upon recapture if the scope of 
property that qualifies for the investment credit is 
expanded. 



Assets Used in a Personal Activity.

 The final 
regulations retain the rule of the proposed regulations that 
a general asset account may not include an asset if a 
taxpayer uses the asset both in a trade or business (or for 
the production of income) and in a personal activity at any 
time during the taxable year in which the asset is first 
placed in service by the taxpayer. Consistent with the 
retention of this rule in the final regulations, a new rule 
has been added providing that an asset in a general asset 
account becomes ineligible for general asset account 
treatment if a taxpayer uses the asset in a personal 
activity in a taxable year after the taxable year the asset 
is placed in service. If this change in use occurs, the 
final regulations provide that the taxpayer must use the 
method provided in  1.168(i)-1(e)(3)(iii)(C) for adjusting a 
general asset account when an asset becomes ineligible for 
general asset account treatment. 



Assets that Generate Foreign Source Income.

 A 
commentator suggested that the proposed regulations be 
amended to allow general asset account treatment for assets 
generating foreign source income. 

In response to this comment, the final regulations 
allow general asset account treatment for assets generating 
foreign source income. If, however, the inclusion of these 
assets in a general asset account results in a substantial 
distortion of income, the Commissioner may disregard the 
general asset account election and make reallocations of 
income or expense as necessary to clearly reflect income.

<DOCNO> FR941011-0-00034 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941011-0-00011 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The final regulations provide a rule coordinating the 
general asset account rules with the rules in  1.8611-9T(g)(3) relating to allocation and apportionment
of 
interest expense under the asset method. A general asset 
account will be treated as a single asset for purposes of 
applying the rules in  1.861-9T(g)(3). If the general asset 
account generates income in more than one separate grouping 
(statutory and residual), then the account is a multiple 
category asset, as defined in  1.861-9T(g)(3)(ii), and the 
income yield from the general asset account must be computed 
as if the account were a single multiple category asset. 

The final regulations also provide rules for 
determining the source of income from a disposition of an 
asset in a general asset account. If the general asset 
account includes assets generating both United States and 
foreign source income, any amount of ordinary income, gain, 
or loss recognized on the disposition must be apportioned 
between United States and foreign sources based on the 
allocation and apportionment of depreciation allowed for the 
general asset account or for the disposed asset, as 
applicable. If the general asset account includes assets 
that generate foreign source income in more than one 
separate category under section 904(d)(1) or another section 
of the Internal Revenue Code, or under a United States 
income tax treaty that requires the foreign tax credit 
limitation to be determined separately for specified types 
of income, then the amount of ordinary income, gain, or loss 
recognized on the disposition that is treated as foreign 
source income must be allocated and apportioned to the 
applicable separate category or categories. 



Disposition of All Assets or the Last Asset.

 One 
commentator questioned whether the rule under the proposed 
regulations that provided that a general asset account 
terminates on the disposition of all of the assets in the 
account or the last asset in the account was mandatory. In 
response to this comment, the final regulations clarify that 
this rule is an optional rule for taxpayers that maintain 
records showing the disposition of assets in a general asset 
account. The final regulations also provide that a taxpayer 
adopts the rule by reporting the gain or loss on the 
taxpayer's income tax return for the taxable year in which 
the disposition of all of the assets, or the last asset, in 
the general asset account occurs. 



Qualifying Dispositions.

 Under the proposed 
regulations, a qualifying disposition of an asset in a 
general asset account occurs when the asset is disposed of 
as a direct result of a cessation, termination, curtailment, 
or disposition of a business, manufacturing or other income 
producing process, operation, facility, plant, or other unit 
(other than by transfer to a supplies, scrap, or similar 
account). One commentator recommended that the final 
regulations should provide an example showing that the sale 
of an undivided interest in mineral property, along with the 
related operating equipment, is a curtailment of a 
taxpayer's business and, thus, constitutes a qualifying 
disposition. A curtailment was intended to be limited to a 
genuine business contraction and not to include transactions 
involving the sale of an undivided interest, other than the 
taxpayer's entire interest in assets. To avoid any further 
misinterpretation, the final regulations delete the term 
``curtailment.'' The final regulations also clarify that a 
taxpayer adopts the rule to terminate general asset account 
treatment for an asset in a qualifying disposition by 
reporting the gain, loss, or other deduction on the 
taxpayer's income tax return for the taxable year in which 
the qualifying disposition occurs. 



Anti-abuse rule.

 The final regulations add examples of 
transactions subject to the anti-abuse rule.

<TEXT>
 



Election. 

Some commentators noted that the proposed 
regulations do not address whether the election is made by 
the common parent corporation or each member of an 
affiliated group, by a partnership or its partners, or by an 
S corporation or the S corporation shareholders. The final 
regulations clarify that the election is made by each member 
of an affiliated group, by the partnership, or by the S 
corporation, respectively. 
The proposed regulations provide that the election to 
apply the regulations generally is binding on the taxpayer 
for computing taxable income as well as computing 
alternative minimum taxable income. A commentator suggested 
that the final regulations should allow taxpayers the option 
to make the election for either the regular income tax, the 
alternative minimum tax, or both. This rule was not adopted 
because of the separate and parallel nature of the regular 
tax and alternative minimum tax systems. Except as 
otherwise provided by statute or regulations, all Code 
provisions that apply in determining the regular taxable 
income of a taxpayer also apply in determining the 
alternative minimum taxable income of the taxpayer. The 
final regulations have not been expanded to include any 
exceptions. Consequently, an election to apply section 
168(i)(4) for determining regular taxable income also 
applies for determining alternative minimum taxable income. 
Therefore, the language ``as well as alternative minimum 
taxable income'' in the proposed rule is redundant and has 
been deleted from the final regulations. 


Effective Date. 

For assets placed in service after 
December 31, 1986, in taxable years ending before the 
effective date of the final regulations, one commentator 
recommended that the final regulations should provide a 
retroactive election or, alternatively, a prospective 
election. Another commentator also requested a provision 
allowing a prospective election. The final regulations 
retain the rule of the proposed regulations that, for prior 
periods, a taxpayer may use any reasonable method that is 
consistently applied to the taxpayer's general asset 
accounts. 


Dates 


The final regulations are effective for property placed 
in service in taxable years ending on or after October 11, 1994. 
For property placed in service after December 31, 1986, in taxable years ending before October 11, 1994, the IRS will
allow any reasonable method 
that is consistently applied to the taxpayer's general asset 
accounts. 


Special Analyses 


It has been determined that this Treasury decision is 
not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. 
Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It also 
has been determined that section 553(b) of the 
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the 
Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply 
to these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory 
Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 
7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, the notice of proposed 
rulemaking preceding these regulations was submitted to the 
Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on 
small business. 


Drafting Information 


The principal author of these regulations is Kathleen 
Reed, Office of Assistant Chief Counsel (Passthroughs and 
Special Industries), IRS. However, other personnel from the 
IRS and Treasury Department participated in their 
development.

General asset accounts. 


(a) 

Scope. 

This section provides rules for general 
asset accounts under section 168(i)(4). The provisions of 
this section apply only to assets for which an election has 
been made under paragraph (k) of this section. 
(b) 

Definitions. 

For purposes of this section, the 
following definitions apply: 
(1) 

Unadjusted depreciable basis 

is the basis of an 
asset for purposes of section 1011 without regard to any 
adjustments described in sections 1016(a)(2) and (3). 
(2) 

Unadjusted depreciable basis of the general asset 
account 

is the sum of the unadjusted depreciable bases of 
all assets included in the general asset account. 
(3) 

Adjusted depreciable basis of the general asset 
account 

is the unadjusted depreciable basis of the general 
asset account less the adjustments to basis described in 
sections 1016(a)(2) and (3). 
(4) 

Expensed cost 

is the amount of any allowable credit 
or deduction treated as a deduction allowable for 
depreciation or amortization for purposes of section 1245 
(for example, a credit allowable under section 30 or a 
deduction allowable under section 179, 179A, or 190). 
(c) 

Establishment of general asset accounts_

(1) 

Assets 
eligible for general asset accounts_

(i) 

General rules. 


Assets that are subject to either the general depreciation 
system of section 168(a) or the alternative depreciation 
system of section 168(g) may be accounted for in one or more 
general asset accounts. An asset may be included in a 
general asset account only to the extent of the asset's 
unadjusted depreciable basis (for example, if, in 1995, a 
taxpayer places in service an asset that costs $20,000 and 
elects under section 179 to expense $17,500 of that asset's 
cost, the unadjusted depreciable basis of the asset is 
$2,500 and, therefore, only $2,500 of the asset's cost may 
be included in a general asset account). However, an asset 
is not to be included in a general asset account if the 
asset is used both in a trade or business (or for the 
production of income) and in a personal activity at any time 
during the taxable year in which the asset is first placed 
in service by the taxpayer.

Special rules for assets generating foreign source 
income_

(A) Assets that generate foreign source income, both 
United States and foreign source income, or combined gross 
income of a FSC (as defined in section 922), DISC (as 
defined in section 992(a)), or possessions corporation (as 
defined in section 936) and its related supplier, may be 
included in a general asset account if the requirements of 
paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section are satisfied. If, 
however, the inclusion of these assets in a general asset 
account results in a substantial distortion of income, the 
Commissioner may disregard the general asset account 
election and make any reallocations of income or expense 
necessary to clearly reflect income. 
(B) A general asset account shall be treated as a 
single asset for purposes of applying the rules in  1.861- 
9T(g)(3) (relating to allocation and apportionment of 
interest expense under the asset method). A general asset 
account that generates income in more than one grouping of 
income (statutory and residual) is a multiple category asset 
(as defined in  1.861-9T(g)(3)(ii)), and the income yield 
from the general asset account must be determined by 
applying the rules for multiple category assets as if the 
general asset account were a single asset. 
(2) 

Grouping assets in general asset accounts_

(i) 


General rules. 

If a taxpayer makes the election under 
paragraph (k) of this section, assets that are subject to 
the election are grouped into one or more general asset 
accounts. Assets that are eligible to be grouped into a 
single general asset account may be divided into more than 
one general asset account. Each general asset account must 
include only assets that_

(A) Have the same asset class (for further guidance, 
see Rev. Proc. 87-56, 1987-2 C.B. 674, and 
 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(

b

) of this chapter); 
(B) Have the same applicable depreciation method; 
(C) Have the same applicable recovery period; 
(D) Have the same applicable convention; and 
(E) Are placed in service by the taxpayer in the same 
taxable year. 
(ii) 

Special rules. 

In addition to the general rules 
in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, the following rules 
apply when establishing general asset accounts_


(A) Assets without an asset class, but with the same 
characteristics described in paragraphs (c)(2)(i)(B), (C), 
(D), and (E) of this section, may be grouped into a general 
asset account; 
(B) Assets subject to the mid-quarter convention may 
only be grouped into a general asset account with assets 
that are placed in service in the same quarter of the 
taxable year; 
(C) Assets subject to the mid-month convention may only 
be grouped into a general asset account with assets that are 
placed in service in the same month of the taxable year; and 
(D) Passenger automobiles for which the depreciation 
allowance is limited under section 280F(a) must be grouped 
into a separate general asset account. 
(d) 

Determination of depreciation allowance_

(1) 

In 
general. 

Depreciation allowances are determined for each 
general asset account by using the applicable depreciation 
method, recovery period, and convention for the assets in 
the account. The depreciation allowances are recorded in a 
depreciation reserve account for each general asset account. 
The allowance for depreciation under this section 
constitutes the amount of depreciation allowable under 
section 167(a). 
(2) 

Special rule for passenger automobiles. 

For 
purposes of applying section 280F(a), the depreciation 
allowance for a general asset account established for 
passenger automobiles is limited for each taxable year to 
the amount prescribed in section 280F(a) multiplied by the 
excess of the number of automobiles originally included in 
the account over the number of automobiles disposed of 
during the taxable year or in any prior taxable year in a 
transaction described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii) (disposition 
of an asset in a qualifying disposition), (e)(3)(iv) 
(transactions subject to section 168(i)(7)), (e)(3)(v) 
(anti-abuse rule), (g) (assets subject to recapture), or 
(h)(1) (conversion to personal use) of this section.

(e) 

Disposition of an asset from a general asset 
account_

(1) 

Scope. 

This paragraph (e) provides rules 
applicable to dispositions of assets included in a general 
asset account. For purposes of this paragraph (e), an asset 
in a general asset account is disposed of when ownership of 
the asset is transferred or when the asset is permanently 
withdrawn from use either in the taxpayer's trade or 
business or in the production of income. A disposition 
includes the sale, exchange, retirement, physical 
abandonment, or destruction of an asset. A disposition also 
occurs when an asset is transferred to a supplies, scrap, or 
similar account. A disposition does not include, however, 
the retirement of a structural component of real property. 
(2) 

General rules for a disposition_

(i) 

No immediate 
recovery of basis. 

Immediately before a disposition of any 
asset in a general asset account, the asset is treated as 
having an adjusted basis of zero for purposes of section 
1011. Therefore, no loss is realized upon the disposition 
of an asset from the general asset account. Similarly, 
where an asset is disposed of by transfer to a supplies, 
scrap, or similar account, the basis of the asset in the 
supplies, scrap, or similar account will be zero. 
(ii) 

Treatment of amount realized. 

Any amount realized 
on a disposition is recognized as ordinary income 
(notwithstanding any other provision of subtitle A of the 
Internal Revenue Code (Code)) to the extent the sum of the 
unadjusted depreciable basis of the general asset account 
and any expensed cost (as defined in paragraph (b)(4) of 
this section) for assets in the account exceeds any amounts 
previously recognized as ordinary income upon the 
disposition of other assets in the account. The recognition 
and character of any excess amount realized are determined 
under other applicable provisions of the Code (other than 
sections 1245 and 1250 or provisions of the Code that treat 
gain on a disposition as subject to section 1245 or 1250). 
(iii) 

Effect of disposition on a general asset account. 


The unadjusted depreciable basis and the depreciation 
reserve of the general asset account are not affected as a 
result of a disposition of an asset from the general asset 
account. 
(iv) 

Coordination with nonrecognition provisions. 

For 
purposes of determining the basis of an asset acquired in a 
transaction described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(B)(

4

) of this 
section (relating to certain nonrecognition provisions), the 
amount of ordinary income recognized under this paragraph 
(e)(2) is treated as the amount of gain recognized on the 
disposition. 
(v) 

Examples. 

The following examples illustrate the 
application of this paragraph (e)(2). 





Example 1. 

(i) 

R, 

a calendar-year corporation, 
maintains one general asset account for ten machines. The 
machines cost a total of $10,000 and were placed in service 
in June 1995. Of the ten machines, one machine costs $8,200 
and nine machines cost a total of $1,800. Assume this 
general asset account has a depreciation method of 200 
percent declining balance, a recovery period of 5 years, and 
a half-year convention. 

R

 does not make a section 179 
election for any of the machines. As of January 1, 1996, 
the depreciation reserve of the account is $2,000 
[(($10,000^$0)  x  40%)/2]. 
(ii) On February 8, 1996, 

R

 sells the machine that cost 
$8,200 to an unrelated party for $9,000. Under paragraph 
(e)(2)(i) of this section, this machine has an adjusted 
basis of zero. 
(iii) On its 1996 tax return, 

R

 recognizes the amount 
realized of $9,000 as ordinary income because such amount 
does not exceed the unadjusted depreciable basis of the 
general asset account ($10,000), plus any expensed cost for 
assets in the account ($0), less amounts previously 
recognized as ordinary income ($0). Moreover, the 
unadjusted depreciable basis and depreciation reserve of the 
account are not affected by the disposition of the machine. 
Thus, the depreciation allowance for the account in 1996 is 
$3,200 (($10,000^$2,000) x 40%).

 



Example 2. 

(i) The facts are the same as in 

Example 1. 


In addition, on June 4, 1997, 

R

 sells seven machines to an 
unrelated party for a total of $1,100. In accordance with 
paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, these machines have an 
adjusted basis of zero. 
(ii) On its 1997 tax return, 

R

 recognizes $1,000 as 
ordinary income (the unadjusted depreciable basis of 
$10,000, plus the expensed cost of $0, less the amount of 
$9,000 previously recognized as ordinary income). The 
recognition and character of the excess amount realized of 
$100 ($1,100^$1,000) are determined under applicable 
provisions of the Code other than section 1245 (such as 
section 1231). Moreover, the unadjusted depreciable basis 
and depreciation reserve of the account are not affected by 
the disposition of the machines. Thus, the depreciation 
allowance for the account in 1997 is $1,920 (($10,000^$5,200) x 40%).

Special rules

_(i) 

In general.

 This paragraph 
(e)(3) provides the rules for terminating general asset 
account treatment upon certain dispositions. While the 
rules under paragraphs (e)(3)(ii) and (iii) of this section 
are optional rules, the rules under paragraphs (e)(3)(iv) 
and (v) of this section are mandatory rules. A taxpayer 
applies paragraph (e)(3)(ii) or (iii) of this section by 
reporting the gain, loss, or other deduction on the 
taxpayer's timely filed (including extensions) income tax 
return for the taxable year in which the disposition occurs. 
For purposes of applying paragraph (e)(3)(iii) through (v) 
of this section, see paragraph (i) of this section for 
identifying the unadjusted depreciable basis of a disposed 
asset. 

(ii) 

Disposition of all assets remaining in a general 
asset account

_(A) 

Optional termination of a general asset 
account.

 Upon the disposition of all of the assets, or the 
last asset, in a general asset account, a taxpayer may apply 
this paragraph (e)(3)(ii) to recover the adjusted 
depreciable basis of the general asset account (rather than 
having paragraph (e)(2) of this section apply). Under this 
paragraph (e)(3)(ii), the general asset account terminates 
and the amount of gain or loss for the general asset account 
is determined under section 1001(a) by taking into account 
the adjusted depreciable basis of the general asset account 
at the time of the disposition. The recognition and 
character of the gain or loss are determined under other 
applicable provisions of the Code, except that the amount of 
gain subject to section 1245 (or section 1250) is limited to 
the excess of the depreciation allowed or allowable for the 
general asset account, including any expensed cost (or the 
excess of the additional depreciation allowed or allowable 
for the general asset account), over any amounts previously 
recognized as ordinary income under paragraph (e)(2) of this 
section. 

 (B) 

Example.

 The following example illustrates the 
application of this paragraph (e)(3)(ii).

 




Example.

 (i) 

T

, a calendar-year corporation, maintains 
a general asset account for 1,000 calculators. The 
calculators cost a total of $60,000 and were placed in 
service in 1995. Assume this general asset account has a 
depreciation method of 200 percent declining balance, a 
recovery period of 5 years, and a half-year convention. 

T

 
does not make a section 179 election for any of the 
calculators. In 1996, 

T

 sells 200 of the calculators to an 
unrelated party for a total of $10,000 and recognizes the 
$10,000 as ordinary income in accordance with paragraph 
(e)(2) of this section. 

(ii) On March 26, 1997, 

T

 sells the remaining 
calculators in the general asset account to an unrelated 
party for $35,000. 

T

 chooses to apply paragraph (e)(3)(ii) 
of this section. As a result, the account terminates and 
gain or loss is determined for the account. 

(iii) On the date of disposition, the adjusted 
depreciable basis of the account is $23,040 (unadjusted 
depreciable basis of $60,000 less the depreciation allowed 
or allowable of $36,960). Thus, in 1997, 

T

 recognizes gain 
of $11,960 (amount realized of $35,000 less the adjusted 
depreciable basis of $23,040). The gain of $11,960 is 
subject to section 1245 to the extent of the depreciation 
allowed or allowable for the account (plus the expensed cost 
for assets in the account) less the amounts previously 
recognized as ordinary income ($36,960 + $0 ^ $10,000 = $26,960). As a result, the entire gain of $11,960 is subject
to section 1245.


 

(iii) 

Disposition of an asset in a qualifying 
disposition

_(A) 

Optional determination of the amount of 
gain, loss, or other deduction.

 In the case of a qualifying 
disposition of an asset (described in paragraph 
(e)(3)(iii)(B) of this section), a taxpayer may apply this 
paragraph (e)(3)(iii) (rather than having paragraph (e)(2) 
of this section apply). Under this paragraph (e)(3)(iii), 
general asset account treatment for the asset terminates as 
of the first day of the taxable year in which the qualifying 
disposition occurs, and the amount of gain, loss, or other 
deduction for the asset is determined by taking into account 
the asset's adjusted basis. The adjusted basis of the asset 
at the time of the disposition equals the unadjusted 
depreciable basis of the asset less the depreciation allowed 
or allowable for the asset, computed by using the 
depreciation method, recovery period, and convention 
applicable to the general asset account in which the asset 
was included. The recognition and character of the gain, 
loss, or other deduction are determined under other 
applicable provisions of the Code, except that the amount of 
gain subject to section 1245 (or section 1250) is limited to 
the lesser of_

(

1

) The depreciation allowed or allowable for the 
asset, including any expensed cost (or the additional 
depreciation allowed or allowable for the asset); or 

(

2

) The excess of_

(

i

) The original unadjusted depreciable basis of the 
general asset account plus, in the case of section 1245 
property originally included in the general asset account, 
any expensed cost; over

<TEXT>
 

(

ii

) The cumulative amounts of gain previously 
recognized as ordinary income under either paragraph (e)(2) 
of this section or section 1245 (or section 1250). 

(B) 

Qualifying dispositions.

 A qualifying disposition 
is a disposition that does not involve all the assets, or 
the last asset, remaining in a general asset account and 
that is_

(

1

) A direct result of a fire, storm, shipwreck, or 
other casualty, or from theft; 
(

2

) A charitable contribution for which a deduction is 
allowable under section 170; 
(

3

) A direct result of a cessation, termination, or 
disposition of a business, manufacturing or other income 
producing process, operation, facility, plant, or other unit 
(other than by transfer to a supplies, scrap, or similar 
account); or 
(

4

) A transaction, other than a transaction described 
in paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this section (pertaining to 
transactions subject to section 168(i)(7)), to which a 
nonrecognition section of the Code applies (determined 
without regard to this section), such as section 1031 or 
1033. 

(C) 

Effect of a qualifying disposition on a general 
asset account.

 If the taxpayer applies this paragraph 
(e)(3)(iii) to a qualifying disposition of an asset, then_

(1) The asset is removed from the general asset account 
as of the first day of the taxable year in which the 
qualifying disposition occurs; 

(

2

) The unadjusted depreciable basis of the general 
asset account is reduced by the unadjusted depreciable basis 
of the asset as of the first day of the taxable year in 
which the disposition occurs; 

(

3

) The depreciation reserve of the general asset 
account is reduced by the depreciation allowed or allowable 
for the asset as of the end of the taxable year immediately 
preceding the year of disposition, computed by using the 
depreciation method, recovery period, and convention 
applicable to the general asset account in which the asset 
was included; and 

(

4

) For purposes of determining the amount of gain 
realized on subsequent dispositions that is subject to 
ordinary income treatment under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this 
section, the amount of any expensed cost with respect to the 
asset is disregarded. 

(D) 

Example.

 The provisions of this paragraph 
(e)(3)(iii) are illustrated by the following example.


 



Example.

 (i) 

Z

, a calendar-year corporation, maintains 
one general asset account for 12 machines. Each machine 
costs $15,000 and was placed in service in 1995. Of the 12 
machines, nine machines that cost a total of $135,000 are 
used in 

Z's

 Kentucky plant, and three machines that cost a 
total of $45,000 are used in 

Z's

 Ohio plant. Assume this 
general asset account has a depreciation method of 200 
percent declining balance, a recovery period of 5 years, and 
a half-year convention. 

Z

 does not make a section 179 
election for any of the machines. As of January 1, 1997, 
the depreciation reserve for the account is $93,600.

<TEXT>
 

(ii) On May 27, 1997, 

Z

 sells its entire manufacturing 
plant in Ohio to an unrelated party. The sales proceeds 
allocated to each of the three machines at the Ohio plant is 
$5,000. Because this transaction is a qualifying 
disposition under paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(B)(

3

) of this 
section, 

Z

 chooses to apply paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this 
section. 

(iii) For 

Z

's 1997 return, the depreciation allowance 
for the account is computed as follows. As of December 31, 
1996, the depreciation allowed or allowable for the three 
machines at the Ohio plant is $23,400. Thus, as of January 
1, 1997, the unadjusted depreciable basis of the account is 
reduced from $180,000 to $135,000 ($180,000 less the 
unadjusted depreciable basis of $45,000 for the three 
machines), and the depreciation reserve of the account is 
decreased from $93,600 to $70,200 ($93,600 less the 
depreciation allowed or allowable of $23,400 for the three 
machines as of December 31, 1996). Consequently, the 
depreciation allowance for the account in 1997 is $25,920 
(($135,000 ^ $70,200)  x  40%). 

(iv) For 

Z

's 1997 return, gain or loss for each of the 
three machines at the Ohio plant is determined as follows. 
The depreciation allowed or allowable in 1997 for each 
machine is $1,440 [(($15,000 ^ $7,800)  x  40%) / 2]. Thus, 
the adjusted basis of each machine under section 1011 is 
$5,760 (the adjusted depreciable basis of $7,200 removed 
from the account less the depreciation allowed or allowable 
of $1,440 in 1997). As a result, the loss recognized in 1997 
for each machine is $760 ($5,000 ^ $5,760), which is subject 
to section 1231.




(iv) 

Transactions subject to section 168(i)(7).

 If an 
asset in a general asset account is transferred in a 
transaction described in section 168(i)(7)(B) (pertaining to 
treatment of transferees in certain nonrecognition 
transactions), the transferor must remove the transferred 
asset from the general asset account as of the first day of 
the taxable year in which the transaction occurs. In 
addition, the adjustments to the general asset account 
described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(C)(

2

) through (

4

) of this 
section must be made. The transferee is bound by the 
transferor's election under paragraph (k) of this section 
with respect to so much of the asset's basis in the hands of 
the transferee as does not exceed the asset's adjusted basis 
in the hands of the transferor. If all of the assets, or 
the last asset, in a general asset account are transferred, 
the transferee's basis in the assets or asset transferred is 
equal to the adjusted depreciable basis of the general asset 
account as of the beginning of the transferor's taxable year 
in which the transaction occurs, decreased by the amount of 
depreciation allocable to the transferor for the year of the 
transfer. 

(v) 

Anti-abuse rule

_(A) 

In general.

 If an asset in a 
general asset account is disposed of by a taxpayer in a 
transaction described in paragraph (e)(3)(v)(B) of this 
section, general asset account treatment for the asset 
terminates as of the first day of the taxable year in which 
the disposition occurs. Consequently, the taxpayer must 
determine the amount of gain, loss, or other deduction 
attributable to the disposition in the manner described in 
paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(A) of this section (notwithstanding 
that paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(A) of this section is an optional 
rule) and must make the adjustments to the general asset 
account described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(C)(

1

) through (

4

) 
of this section. 

(B) 

Abusive transactions.

 A transaction is described 
in this paragraph (e)(3)(v)(B) if the transaction is not 
described in paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this section and the 
transaction is entered into, or made, with a principal 
purpose of achieving a tax benefit or result that would not 
be available absent an election under this section. 
Examples of these types of transactions include_

(

1

) A transaction entered into with a principal purpose of shifting income or deductions among taxpayers in a manner

that would not be possible absent an election under this 
section in order to take advantage of differing effective 
tax rates among the taxpayers; or 

(

2

) An election made under this section with a 
principal purpose of disposing of an asset from a general 
asset account in order to utilize an expiring net operating 
loss or credit. The fact that a taxpayer with a net 
operating loss carryover or a credit carryover transfers an 
asset to a related person or transfers an asset pursuant to 
an arrangement where the asset continues to be used (or is 
available for use) by the taxpayer pursuant to a lease (or 
otherwise) indicates, absent strong evidence to the 
contrary, that the transaction is described in this 
paragraph (e)(3)(v)(B).

(f) 

Assets generating foreign source income

_(1) 

In 
general. 

This paragraph (f) provides the rules for 
determining the source of any income, gain, or loss 
recognized, and the appropriate section 904(d) separate 
limitation category or categories for any foreign source 
income, gain, or loss recognized, on a disposition (within 
the meaning of paragraph (e)(1) of this section) of an asset 
in a general asset account that consists of assets 
generating both United States and foreign source income. 
These rules apply only to a disposition to which paragraph 
(e)(2) (general disposition rules), (e)(3)(ii) (disposition 
of all assets remaining in a general asset account), 
(e)(3)(iii) (disposition of an asset in a qualifying 
disposition), or (e)(3)(v) (anti-abuse rule) of this section 
applies. 

(2) 

Source of ordinary income, gain, or loss

_(i) 


Source determined by allocation and apportionment of 
depreciation allowed. 

The amount of any ordinary income, 
gain, or loss that is recognized on the disposition of an 
asset in a general asset account must be apportioned between 
United States and foreign sources based on the allocation 
and apportionment of the_

(A) Depreciation allowed for the general asset account as of the end of the taxable year in which the disposition 
occurs if paragraph (e)(2) of this section applies to the 
disposition; 

(B) Depreciation allowed for the general asset account 
as of the time of the disposition if the taxpayer applies 
paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section to the disposition of 
all of the assets, or the last asset, in the general asset 
account; or 

(C) Depreciation allowed for the disposed asset for 
only the taxable year in which the disposition occurs if the 
taxpayer applies paragraph (e)(3)(iii) to the disposition of 
the asset in a qualifying disposition or if the asset is 
disposed in a transaction described in paragraph (e)(3)(v) 
(anti-abuse rule) of this section. 

(ii) 

Formula for determining foreign source income, 
gain, or loss. 

The amount of ordinary income, gain, or loss 
recognized on the disposition that shall be treated as 
foreign source income, gain, or loss must be determined 
under the formula in this paragraph (f)(2)(ii). For 
purposes of this formula, the allowed depreciation 
deductions are determined for the applicable time period 
provided in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section. The 
formula is: 





(3) 

Section 904(d) separate categories. 

If the assets 
in the general asset account generate foreign source income 
in more than one separate category under section 904(d)(1) 
or another section of the Code (for example, income treated 
as foreign source income under section 904(g)(10)), or under 
a United States income tax treaty that requires the foreign 
tax credit limitation to be determined separately for 
specified types of income, the amount of ``foreign source 
income, gain, or loss from the disposition of an asset'' (as 
determined under the formula in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this 
section) must be allocated and apportioned to the applicable 
separate category or categories under the formula in this 
paragraph (f)(3). For purposes of this formula, the allowed 
depreciation deductions are determined for the applicable 
time period provided in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section. 
The formula is: 






(g) 

Assets subject to recapture. 

If the basis of an 
asset in a general asset account is increased as a result of 
the recapture of any allowable credit or deduction (for 
example, the basis adjustment for the recapture amount under 
section 30(d)(2), 50(c)(2), 179(d)(10), or 179A(e)(4)), 
general asset account treatment for the asset terminates as 
of the first day of the taxable year in which the recapture 
event occurs. Consequently, the taxpayer must remove the 
asset from the general asset account as of that day and must 
make the adjustments to the general asset account described 
in paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(C)(2) through (4) of this section.

(h) 

Changes in use

_(1) 

Conversion to personal use. 

An 
asset in a general asset account becomes ineligible for 
general asset account treatment if a taxpayer uses the asset 
in a personal activity during a taxable year. Upon a 
conversion to personal use, the taxpayer must remove the 
asset from the general asset account as of the first day of 
the taxable year in which the change in use occurs and must 
make the adjustments to the general asset account described 
in paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(C)(

2

) through (

4

) of this section. 

(2) 

Other changes in use. 

[Reserved]. 

(i) 

Identification of disposed or converted asset. 

A 
taxpayer may use any reasonable method that is consistently 
applied to the taxpayer's general asset accounts for 
purposes of determining the unadjusted depreciable basis of 
a disposed or converted asset in a transaction described in 
paragraph (e)(3)(iii) (disposition of an asset in a 
qualifying disposition), (e)(3)(iv) (transactions subject to 
section 168(i)(7)), (e)(3)(v) (anti-abuse rule), (g) (assets 
subject to recapture), or (h)(1) (conversion to personal 
use) of this section. 

(j) 

Effect of adjustments on prior dispositions. 

The 
adjustments to a general asset account under paragraph 
(e)(3)(iii), (e)(3)(iv), (e)(3)(v), (g), or (h)(1) of this 
section have no effect on the recognition and character of 
prior dispositions subject to paragraph (e)(2) of this 
section. 

(k) 

Election

_(1) 

Irrevocable election. 

If a taxpayer 
makes an election under this paragraph (k), the taxpayer 
consents to, and agrees to apply, all of the provisions of 
this section to the assets included in a general asset 
account. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A), 
(e)(3), (g), or (h)(1) of this section, an election made 
under this section is irrevocable and will be binding on the 
taxpayer for computing taxable income for the taxable year 
for which the election is made and for all subsequent 
taxable years. An election under this paragraph (k) is made 
separately by each person owning an asset to which this 
section applies (for example, by each member of a 
consolidated group, at the partnership level (and not by the 
partner separately), or at the S corporation level (and not 
by the shareholder separately)). 

(2) 

Time for making election. 

The election to apply 
this section shall be made on the taxpayer's timely filed 
(including extensions) income tax return for the taxable 
year in which the assets included in the general asset 
account are placed in service by the taxpayer. 

(3) 

Manner of making election. 

In the year of 
election, a taxpayer makes the election under this section 
by typing or legibly printing at the top of the Form 4562, 
``GENERAL ASSET ACCOUNT ELECTION MADE UNDER SECTION 
168(i)(4),'' or in the manner provided for on Form 4562 and 
its instructions. The taxpayer shall maintain records (for 
example, ``General Asset Account 

#

1 - all 1995 additions in 
asset class 00.11 for Salt Lake City, Utah facility'') that 
identify the assets included in each general asset account, 
that establish the unadjusted depreciable basis and 
depreciation reserve of the general asset account, and that 
reflect the amount realized during the taxable year upon 
dispositions from each general asset account. (But see 
section 179(c) and  1.179-5 for the recordkeeping 
requirements for section 179 property.) The taxpayer's 
recordkeeping practices should be consistently applied to 
the general asset accounts. If Form 4562 is revised or 
renumbered, any reference in this section to that form shall 
be treated as a reference to the revised or renumbered form. 

(l) 

Effective date. 

This section applies to 
depreciable assets placed in service in taxable years ending on or after October 11, 1994. For depreciable assets
placed in service after December 31, 1986, in taxable years ending before October 11, 1994, the Internal 
Revenue Service will allow any reasonable method that is 
consistently applied to the taxpayer's general asset 
accounts.

Clean Air Act Approval and Promulgation of 
Air Quality Implementation Plan Revision for Colorado; 
Long-Term Strategy Review of Class I Visibility Protection 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA approves revisions to the long-term strategy of Colorado's State Implementation Plan (SIP) for Visibility Protection,
as submitted by the Governor with a letter dated November 18, 1992. The revisions address requirements to review periodically
and, if necessary, revise the long-term strategy for visibility protection for states containing mandatory Class
I Federal areas. EPA also corrects its error in a previous action on the State's Visibility protection provisions.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Background 



Section 169A of the Clean Air Act

1

 establishes as a National goal the prevention of any future, and the remedying of any existing, impairment of visibility
in mandatory Class I Federal areas

2

 which impairment results from man-made air pollution. Section 169A called for EPA to, among other things, issue regulations
to assure reasonable progress toward meeting the National goal, section 169A(a)(4), including requiring each State
with a mandatory Class I Federal area to revise its State implementation plan (SIP) to contain such emission limits,
schedules of compliance and other measures as may be necessary to make reasonable progress toward meeting the National
goal. Section 169A(b)(2).

EPA promulgated regulations that, in broad outline, required affected States to: (1) Coordinate development of
SIPs with appropriate Federal land managers (FLMs); (2) develop a program to assess and remedy visibility impairment
from new and existing sources; and (3) develop a long-term strategy to assure reasonable progress toward the National
visibility goal. 45 FR 80084 (December 2, 1980) (codified at 40 CFR 51.300-51.307). The regulations provided
for the remedying of visibility impairment that is reasonably attributable to a single existing stationary facility
or small group of existing stationary facilities. These regulations required that the SIPs provide for periodic
review and revisions, as appropriate, of the long-term strategy not less frequently than every three years, that
the review process include consultation with the appropriate FLMs and that the State report to the public and EPA a
specified assessment of its progress toward the National goal. See 40 CFR 51.306(c). 

On July 12, 1985 (50 FR 28544) and November 24, 1987 (52 FR 45132), EPA disapproved SIPs of states that failed to comply
with the requirements of, among others, the provisions of 40 CFR 51.302 (visibility general plan requirements),
51.305 (visibility monitoring), and 51.306 (visibility long-term strategy). EPA also incorporated corresponding
Federal plans and regulations into the SIPs of these states pursuant to section 110(c)(1) of the Act. The Governor
of Colorado submitted a SIP revision for visibility protection on December 21, 1987, which met the criteria of 40 CFR
51.302, 51.305, and 51.306 and consisted of five major sections: existing impairment, new source review, consultation
with FLMs, monitoring strategy, and the long-term strategy. EPA approved this SIP revision in an August 12, 1988 

Federal Register

 notice (53 FR 30428), and these revisions replaced the Federal plans and regulations in the Colorado Visibility SIP.


On May 13, 1994, EPA announced its proposed approval of revisions to the long-term strategy of Colorado's Class I Visibility
SIP and revisions concerning the long-term strategy in the Colorado Air Quality Control Commission's (AQCC) Regulation
No. 3 (59 FR 25002-25004). In that proposed rulemaking action, EPA described in detail its rationale for proposing
approval, considering the specific factual issues presented. Rather than repeating that entire discussion in this
notice, it is incorporated by reference here. Thus, the public should review the notice of proposed rulemaking for
relevant background on this final rulemaking action. 

EPA requested public comments on all aspects of the proposal (please reference 59 FR 25004). Comments were received
and are discussed below. This final action on the revisions to the long-term strategy of Colorado's Class I Visibility
SIP and revisions concerning the long-term strategy in Colorado AQCC's Regulation No. 3 is unchanged from the May
13, 1994 proposed approval action. 



II. Response to Public Comments 



One commenter responded to EPA's request for comments on its proposed rulemaking. These comments were received on
June 17, 1994, in a letter dated June 12, 1994. Although the comment period ended on June 13, 1994, EPA is endeavoring
to respond to these comments in an effort to facilitate the public's understanding of this action. 

On July 14, 1993, the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) certified to the State of Colorado the existence of visibility impairment
at the Mount Zirkel Wilderness Area, a mandatory Class I Federal area located in Colorado. (See July 14, 1993 letter
from Elizabeth Estill, USFS, to Governor Roy Romer, which is included in the docket for this action.) The comments
in response to EPA's proposed approval of Colorado's review and revision of its Long-Term Strategy address concerns
that Colorado has not appropriately responded to the USFS's certification. 

More specifically, the commenter asserts that EPA's proposed approval of the long-term strategy revision adopted
by Colorado on November 18, 1992 is problematic because: 




[I]t ignores numerous deficiencies in the State's efforts to implement the visibility protection program since
that time. In particular, Colorado has failed to respond in a timely or effective manner to the certification of visibility
impairment in the Mount Zirkel Wilderness Area that was filed by the U.S. Forest Service on July 13, 1993.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941011-0-00046 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941011-0-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The commenter asserts that EPA has a duty to notify the State of Colorado that its visibility protection plan, as currently
being implemented, is deficient and to explain what actions are needed to remedy those deficiencies. The commenter
recommends that, in any event, EPA should attach conditions to any final decision to approve the State's submittal.
In particular, the commenter states that EPA must notify the State of Colorado that its next long-term strategy revision
``must include emission limitations representing the best available retrofit technology (BART) and schedules
for compliance with BART in response to the U.S. Forest Service's certification of visibility impairment in the Mount
Zirkel Wilderness Area.'' 



EPA does not agree with the commenter that the SIP revision that is the subject of this action (

i.e.

, the November 18, 1992 Visibility SIP revision regarding the long-term strategy review and report) should be conditioned

with requirements involving the Mount Zirkel issue or that the State's response to the USFS's certification of visibility
impairment for the Mount Zirkel Wilderness Area should otherwise affect the approvability of this relatively limited
action. The November 18, 1992 submittal was adopted prior to the U.S. Forest Service's certification of impairment
of the Mount Zirkel Wilderness Area on July 14, 1993. Therefore, EPA assessed the adequacy of the SIP revision relevant
to the time and conditions of the submittal and found it approvable (as discussed in further detail in the proposed
rulemaking at 59 FR 25002-25004, May 13, 1994). 

EPA believes it would be unreasonable to expect that the State's long-term strategy review would address circumstances
that have not yet transpired, especially when EPA's regulations require periodic review and revision, as appropriate,
at least every three years. See 40 CFR 51.306(c). Thus, the applicable regulatory scheme itself has a built-in on-going
assessment of the State's progress in addressing visibility impairment in light of new developments and circumstances.


Even if the State's response to the USFS's certification of visibility impairment at the Mount Zirkel Wilderness
Area was within the scope of the this rulemaking action, the commenter has requested inappropriate relief in that
it presupposes a particular result. The commenter requested that EPA direct the State to include emission limitations
representing BART in its next long-term strategy review. While it ultimately may be appropriate for the State to include
emission limitations in its next long-term strategy review and revision, a necessary adjunct to the imposition of
such emission limitations is that the State has identified existing stationary facilities which may reasonably
be anticipated to cause or contribute to visibility impairment at the Mount Zirkel Wilderness Area. See 40 CFR 51.302(c)(4)(i).


Nevertheless, EPA is aware that significant changes have occurred since the November 18, 1992 submittal. Further,
EPA is concerned about the visibility protection progress the State makes between the November 18, 1992 submittal
and the next long-term strategy review and revision due by September 1, 1995. EPA's concern is heightened by the USFS's
certification of visibility impairment at the Mount Zirkel Wilderness Area. The State's interim efforts must be
guided by its responsibility to make reasonable progress toward the national visibility protection goal. See, 

e.g.

, Clean Air Act section 169A(a)(1) and 40 CFR 51.302(c)(2)(i), 51.300(a), 51.306(a)(3) and 51.306(c). 

By finalizing this action, the submittal of the next long-term strategy review and report is a federally-enforceable
obligation due by September 1, 1995 (see 59 FR 25003). Federal regulations (see 40 CFR 51.306) require the State to
coordinate with the FLM in its long-term strategy review process and to report on the following: 

(1) The progress achieved in remedying existing impairment of visibility in any mandatory Class I Federal area; 

(2) The ability of the long-term strategy to prevent future impairment of visibility in any mandatory Class I Federal
area;

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941011-0-00047 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941011-0-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(3) Any change in visibility since the last such report; 

(4) Additional measures, including the need for SIP revisions, that may be necessary to assure reasonable progress
toward the national visibility goal; 

(5) The progress achieved in implementing BART and meeting other schedules set forth in the long-term strategy; 

(6) The impact of any exemption granted under section 303; 

(7) The need for BART to remedy existing visibility impairment of any integral vista listed in the plan since the last
such report. 

EPA's regulations call for the State to make progress in remedying existing visibility impairment in mandatory Class
I Federal areas and to report on measures that may be necessary to assure reasonable progress toward the national visibility
goal. The State should move expeditiously to assess the visibility impairment at the Mount Zirkel Wilderness Area.
Further, the State should prioritize its assessment by examining the potential sources of visibility impairment
identified in the USFS's certification. The State's assessment should be designed to provide results that can be
addressed in the next long-term strategy report, due by September 1, 1995. See the July 29, 1994 letter from John Seitz,
EPA Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, in response to a letter from the commenter to Mary Nichols, EPA Assistant
Administrator for Air and Radiation. In its letter to Mary Nichols, which was incorporated in its comments on this
action, the commenter expressed concerns about the State's response to the USFS certification. 

EPA expects the State to address the U.S. Forest Service's certification of impairment at the Mt. Zirkel Wilderness
Area in its next long-term strategy review and report, due by September 1, 1995. In order for EPA to assess the progress
the State achieves in remedying the existing visibility impairment at the Mt. Zirkel Wilderness Area, that report
should include the results to date of the State's reasonable attribution study, results of any other relevant analyses,
and a decision on whether or not there is adequate information to determine if the visibility impairment at Mt. Zirkel
Wilderness Area is reasonably attributable to any specific stationary source/sources. If the State concludes that
it has adequate information, it follows that the State should determine whether or not the impairment is attributable
to specific sources. If the State concludes that it has insufficient information, the State should indicate the steps
that are being taken to collect the necessary information and by what date such information will be available. 

EPA will carefully review the State's next long-term strategy to ensure that it meets applicable statutory and regulatory
requirements. In the interim, EPA will provide guidance to help achieve these ends. Finally, should EPA determine
that the State's visibility protection plan is substantially inadequate to ensure that the applicable statutory
and regulatory requirements are met, EPA has discretion to call for a revision to the plan to correct the inadequacies.
See Clean Air Act section 110(k)(5). 


III. This Action 



Section 110(k) of the Act sets out provisions governing EPA's review of SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565-13566).
In a letter dated November 18, 1992, the Governor of Colorado submitted to EPA revisions to the State's long-term strategy
of the Class I Visibility Protection SIP. As described in EPA's proposed action (59 FR 25002-25004, May 13, 1994),
these revisions were made to address the Federal and Colorado requirements to review and, if necessary, revise the
long-term strategy at least every three years. This submittal updates the State's visibility long-term strategy.
Pursuant to section 110(k)(1) of the Act, EPA found the submittal to be complete and so notified the Governor in a letter
dated January 15, 1993.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941011-0-00048 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941011-0-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In this final rulemaking, EPA announces its approval of these revisions to the Colorado's long-term strategy of the
Class I Visibility Protection SIP, including revisions to 
AQCC Regulation No. 3. See Clean Air Act section 110(k)(3). The revisions were made to address when subsequent long-term
strategy review and revision report cycles would occur. The revision indicates that the long-term strategy report
will be made available by September 1 at least every third year following the submittal of the previous report. With
this final approval, the submittal of the next report by September 1, 1995 will be a federally-enforceable obligation.


Regulation No. 3 was also revised to clarify a discrepancy with EPA requirements regarding the scope of review of the
long-term strategy. The State revised the language to indicate that the long-term strategy must be reviewed, among
other reasons, to determine ``[t]he need for BART to remedy existing impairment in an integral vista declared since
plan approval.'' This change brings the State's program into conformance with EPA regulations. See 40 CFR 51.306(c)(7).
Declaration of an integral vista allows for protection of visibility resources outside a mandatory Class I area affecting
views from within the area. See 40 CFR 51.301(n). The State has not identified any integral vistas at this time, but
may do so in the future at its discretion. 

Finally, this SIP revision consists of replacing the original long-term strategy with the revised long-term strategy
adopted by the State in August, 1992. The SIP revisions address when the long-term strategy review is to be completed,
factors to be assessed in periodic long-term strategy reviews, and components of the long-term strategy plan (

e.g.

, existing impairment, prevention of future impairment, smoke management practices, FLM consultation and communication,
and annual visibility data reports). 

Please see EPA's proposed rulemaking for further details on the above revisions (59 FR 25002-25004). 

EPA is also correcting, under section 110(k)(6) of the Clean Air Act, the provision of 40 CFR 52.344(a) (``Visibility
protection''). In a previous rulemaking action, EPA should have revised the provision to indicate that Colorado's
visibility protection program was approved, except for visibility new source review (NSR) as it applied to certain
industrial source categories. With this action, EPA corrects  52.344(a) to reflect accurately the status
of program approval in Colorado. (Please reference EPA's proposed rulemaking for further details on this correction
(59 FR 25002-25004).) 


IV. Final Action 




This document announces EPA's final rulemaking on the action proposed on May 13, 1994 (59 FR 25002). EPA is taking final
action to approve the action it proposed. See Clean Air Act section 110(k)(3). This includes approving revisions
to Colorado AQCC Regulation No. 3 to bring it into conformance with Federal requirements for the long-term strategy
and to revise the reporting schedule. EPA has determined that these revisions are consistent with applicable Federal
requirements for long-term strategy review under the Clean Air Act's visibility protection program for mandatory
Class I Federal areas. 

Further, EPA is correcting its error in failing to reflect accurately Colorado's Visibility SIP approval status
in a previous action on the State's Visibility protection provisions. 

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600, 

et seq.

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 

Approvals of SIP submittals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Clean Air Act do not create any new requirements,
but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval
does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on small entities affected.
Moreover, due to the nature of the federal-state relationship under the Clean Air Act, preparation of a regulatory
flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Clean
Air Act forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds. 

Union Electric Co. 

v.

 U.S. E.P.A.

, 427 U.S. 246, 256-66 (1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2). 

Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by December 12, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by
the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor
does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review must be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements (see section
307(b)(2)). 

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has exempted this regulatory action from Executive Order 12866 review.

Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality 
Implementation Plans; Michigan; 
Revision to the State Implementation Plan Vehicle Inspection and Maintenance Program 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In this action, the EPA is approving a revision to the Michigan State Implementation Plan (SIP) for attainment of the
National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone. On November 12, 1993 and on July 19, 1994 Michigan submitted a SIP
revision request to the EPA to satisfy the requirements of sections 182(b)(4) and 182(c)(3) of the Clean Air Act, as
amended in 1990 (Act), and the Federal motor vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M) rule at 40 CFR part 51, subpart
S. This revision establishes and requires the implementation of an I/M program in the Grand Rapids and Muskegon ozone
nonattainment areas. On July 15, 1994, the EPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for the State of Michigan.
The NPRM proposed approval of the Michigan I/M SIP provided that the State submitted materials sufficient to address
the deficiencies found in the original submittal. No public comments were received on the NPRM and the State submitted
materials sufficient to remedy all the deficiencies in the original submittal, therefore, the EPA is publishing
this final action.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 


I. Introduction 



The Act requires States to make changes to improve existing I/M programs or implement new ones. Section 182 requires
any ozone nonattainment area which has been classified as ``marginal'' (pursuant to section 181(a) of the Act) or
worse with an existing I/M program that was part of a SIP, or any area that was required by the 1977 Amendments to the Act
to have an I/M program, to immediately submit a SIP revision to bring the program up to the level required in the past
the EPA guidance or to what had been committed to previously in the SIP, whichever was more stringent. All carbon monoxide
nonattainment areas were also subject to this requirement to improve existing or previously required programs to
this level. In addition, all ozone nonattainment areas classified as moderate or worse must implement a ``basic''
or an ``enhanced'' I/M program depending upon its classification, regardless of previous requirements. 

In addition, Congress directed the EPA in section 182(a)(2)(B) to publish updated guidance for State I/M programs,
taking into consideration findings of the Administrator's audits and investigations of these programs. The States
were to incorporate this guidance into the SIP for all areas required by the Act to have an I/M program. 




II. Background 



The State of Michigan currently contains 3 ozone nonattainment areas which are required to implement I/M programs
in accordance with the Act. The Detroit-Ann Arbor ozone nonattainment area is classified as moderate and contains
the following 7 counties: Wayne, Oakland, Macomb, Washtenaw, St. Clair, Livingston, and Monroe. The Grand Rapids
ozone nonattainment area is classified as moderate and contains 2 counties: Kent and Ottawa. The Muskegon ozone nonattainment
area is classified as moderate and is comprised of Muskegon county. These designations for ozone were published in
the

On November 12, 1993 the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) submitted to the EPA a revision that provided
for an I/M program in Western Michigan (i.e., the Grand Rapids and Muskegon nonattainment areas). Under the requirements
of the EPA completeness review procedures (40 CFR Part 51, appendix V) and the requirements of section 110(k) of the
Act, the submittal, as it applies to Western Michigan, was deemed complete by the EPA on April 18, 1994. 

In its original review, the EPA found several areas in the State's submittal that did not meet the requirements of the
I/M rule. The sections of the State's submittal found to be insufficient included: Motorist compliance enforcement
program oversight; enforcement against contractors, stations, and inspectors; public information and consumer
protection; improving repair effectiveness; and compliance with recall notices. 

While the EPA found the State's submittal deficient in several respects, the EPA published on July 15, 1994 at 59 FR
a document 36123 proposing to approve the majority of the State's submittal, and to conditionally approve or disapprove
the insufficient sections of the original submittal unless necessary, appropriate, and approvable materials were
submitted by the State 2 weeks prior to the close of the public comment period. 




III. State's Supplemental Submittal 



On July 19, 1994 the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) submitted supplementary materials to the EPA
related to the I/M program in Western Michigan. The supplementary submittal was made to remedy the deficiencies in
the State's original submittal. 



IV. The EPA's Analysis of the State's Supplemental Submittal 



The EPA has reviewed the State's supplemental submittal for consistency with the statutory requirements of the EPA
regulations. A summary of the EPA's analysis is provided below. The following summary is limited to the sections of
the State's original submittal that were deficient. For a discussion of the rest of the State's submittal, see the
July 15, 1994 (59 FR 36123) NPRM. 



A. Motorist Compliance Enforcement Program Oversight 



While the original submittal addressed some of the required elements of this section (40 CFR 51.362), it did not fully
satisfy all the elements, in particular procedures through which the activities of enforcement personnel are quality-controlled.


However, the State's original and supplemental submittals taken together provide an approvable basis for this section.
The original and supplemental submittals provide for regular auditing of the State's enforcement program and the
following of effective management practices, including adjustments to improve the program when necessary. These
program oversight and information management activities are described in the State's submittals and include: the
establishment of written procedures for personnel engaged in I/M document handling and processing and an I/M database
which will be compared to the registration database to determine program effectiveness. 



B. Enforcement Against Contractors, Stations and Inspectors 



While the initial SIP submittal established an innovative Total Quality Management (TQM) program for ensuring that
the I/M program will be run effectively, the submittal did not satisfy all the elements of the I/M rule, 40 CFR 51.364.


The State's supplemental submittal together with the original submittal, however, includes sufficient materials
to approve this section. The original and supplemental submittals, in addition to the TQM program, include specific
penalties for offenses committed by contractors, stations, and inspectors in accordance with the Federal I/M rule.
The SIP also includes the State's enforcement procedures. The MDOT has the authority to immediately suspend a station
inspector for violations that directly affect emission reduction benefits. The enforcement procedures also include
the authority to immediately dismiss inspectors that intentionally cause a vehicle to improperly pass or fail.

C. Public Information and Consumer Protection


The State's original submission addressed all the elements of this section (40 CFR 51.368), except for a provision
to automatically supply test repair facility performance data and diagnostic information to motorists that fail
the emissions test.
However, the supplemental submittal details the information that will be provided to motorists that fail the emissions
test, including test repair facility performance data and diagnostic information. Therefore, taken together,
the original and supplemental submittals sufficiently address all the elements of this section.


D. Improving Repair Effectiveness


The original submittal sufficiently addressed all the elements of the section (40 CFR 51.369), except for the issue
of repair facility performance monitoring.
The State's supplemental submittal, however, provides the necessary materials to establish an acceptable system
of repair facility performance monitoring. The supplemental submittal establishes a program to provide motorists
whose vehicles fail the I/M test with performance monitoring statistics of certified repair facilities. Therefore,
the supplemental submittal together with the original submittal sufficiently addresses all the elements of this
section.


E. Compliance with Recall Notices


The State's original submittal did not sufficiently address the elements required by this section, 40 CFR 51.370.
However the State's supplemental submission along with the original submittal provides a sufficient basis for approval
of this section. The original and supplemental submittals ensure that vehicles included in either a voluntary emission
recall or a remedial plan determination pursuant to the CAA, have had the appropriate repair made prior to the inspection.
The managing contractor will identify vehicles which have not been identified as having completed recall repairs.
Motorists with unresolved recall notices will be required to show proof of compliance or will be denied the opportunity
for inspection. The SIP also commits to comply with the policies of the National Recall Committee and additional the
EPA rulemaking when available.


F. Concluding Statement


The EPA has reviewed the Western Michigan I/M SIP revision submitted to the EPA, using the criteria stated above. The
State's original submittal along with the supplemental submittal represent an acceptable approach to the I/M requirements
and meet all the criteria required for approvability.
A more detailed analysis of the State's supplemental submittal and how it meets Federal requirements is contained
in the EPA's Technical Support Document (TSD), dated August 30, 1994 which is available from the Region 5 Office, listed
above.


V. Response to Comments


On July 15, 1994 (59 FR 36123), the EPA published an NPRM for the State of Michigan. The NPRM proposed approval in part,
and conditional approval or disapproval depending upon the materials submitted by the State 2 weeks prior to close
of the comment period. No public comments were received on the NPRM.


Final Action


By this action, the EPA is fully approving this submittal. The EPA has reviewed the State submittal against the statutory
requirements and for consistency with the EPA regulations and finds it to be acceptable. The rationale for the EPA's
action is explained in the NPRM and will not be restated here.
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to a SIP shall be considered in light of specific technical, economical,
and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.

As noted elsewhere in this action, the EPA received no adverse public comment on the proposed action. As a direct result,
the Regional Administrator has reclassified this action from Table 1 to Table 3 under the processing procedures published
in the FR on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214), and revisions to these procedures issued on October 4, 1993 in an the EPA memorandum
entitled ``Changes to State Implementation Plan (SIP) Tables.''


Regulatory Process


This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the FR on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro,
Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this action
from Executive Order 12866 review.
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq., 

the EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small
entities (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Alternatively, the EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact
on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises,
and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The Act forbids the EPA to base
its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds (

Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans State: Approval of Revisions to Florida Regulations 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Direct final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is approving revisions to the Florida State Implementation Plan (SIP). These revisions were submitted to EPA
through the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) on January 8, 1993. The revisions correct minor
deficiencies in the Motor Vehicle Inspection Program (MVIP) and revise the air quality classifications to coincide
with the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments in Florida's SIP. This plan has been submitted by the FDEP as an integral part
of the program to achieve and maintain the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone, carbon dioxide,
and nitrogen dioxide. These regulations meet all of the requirements and therefore EPA is approving the SIP revisions.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On November 15, 1990, the President signed into law the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. The Clean Air Act as amended
in 1990 (CAA) includes new requirements for the improvement of air quality in ozone nonattainment areas. Under section
181(a) of the CAA, nonattainment areas were categorized by the severity of the ozone problem, and progressively more
stringent control measures were required for each category of higher ozone concentrations. The basis for classifying
an area in a specific category was based on the ambient air quality data obtained in the three year period 1987091989.
The Jacksonville area (Duval County) was classified as transitional because it did not have any ozone violations;
the Tampa/St. Petersburg (Hillsborough and Pinellas counties) area was classified as a marginal ozone nonattainment
area, and the South Florida (Broward, Palm Beach, and Dade counties) area was classified as a moderate ozone nonattainment
area. The CAA delineates the SIP requirements for ozone nonattainment areas based on their classifications in section
182.



On January 8, 1993, Florida through the FDEP submitted a revision to the Florida SIP that made minor corrections to
the emissions testing program and revised the air quality classifications to coincide with the CAA. The revisions
address requirements of section 182 of the CAA.



Rule 1709242, Motor Vehicles Emissions Standards and Test Procedures


The regulation for this rule was originally approved 
March 3, 1992 (57 FR 7550). The revisions to this rule address several minor problems which have arisen during the first
years of operation of the MVIP. Specifically, definitions have been changed to correct some ambiguity in testing
requirements, and the pass/fail criteria for emissions testing are amended to test based on vehicle weight only instead
of vehicle body type. The latter change was made to make the testing criteria consistent with the vehicle registration
databases. The regulation also shortens the equipment calibration requirement time frame from 7 days to 72 hours
and establishes specific training requirements for vehicle emissions inspectors. The Florida I/M regulation meets
all of the pre-enactment guidance as required by section 182(a)(2)(b) of the CAA.



Rule 1709275, Air Quality Areas


These changes coincide with the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments definition for nonattainment areas. The rule specifies
current ozone nonattainment areas and outlines redesignation procedures. These changes reaffirm EPA's promulgation
of designations and classifications for areas of the country with respect to the NAAQS for ozone, CO, PM0910 and lead
in accordance with the requirements of the CAA (56 FR 56694, November 16, 1991). 



Final Action 


The EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment
and anticipates no adverse comments. However, in a separate document in this 

Federal Register

 publication, the EPA is proposing to approve the SIP revision should adverse or critical comments be filed. This action
will be effective December 12, 1994, unless by November 11, 1994, adverse or critical comments are received.


 
If the EPA receives such comments, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing a subsequent
document that will withdraw the final action. All public comments received will then be addressed in a subsequent
final rule based on this action serving as a proposed rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this
action. Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. If no such comments are received,
the public is advised that this action will be effective December 12, 1994.




The Agency has reviewed this request for revision of the federally-approved state implementation plan for conformance
with the provisions of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments enacted on November 15, 1990. The Agency has determined that
this action conforms with those requirements.




Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7607 (b)(1), petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed
in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by December 12, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration
by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality
 

of this rule for purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review
may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later
in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7607 (b)(2).) 


This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214092225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael Shapiro, Acting Assistant
Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables. On January
6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions from the requirements of section
3 of Executive Order 12291 for two years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table
3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request
continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. 

Nothing in this action shall be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for a revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall
be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to
relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.

Standards of Performance for New Stationary Sources: Automobile and Light-Duty Truck Surface 
Coating Operations 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On July 29, 1982, a revision to the new source performance standard (NSPS) for automobile and light-duty truck prime
coat operations was proposed. Analysis of data submitted after this proposal showed that the best demonstrated prime
coating system and prime coat materials could not consistently meet the proposed revised standard. This revised
final NSPS is consistent with the performance of the best demonstrated prime coating system and prime coat materials.
This revision of the standard does not reflect a change in the basis of the standard, but reflects a better understanding
of the performance of the prime coating system and prime coat materials upon which the standard was originally based.
The intended effect of this NSPS is to require all new, modified, and reconstructed prime coat operations at automobile
and light-duty truck assembly plants to use the best demonstrated system of continuous emission reduction considering
costs, nonair quality health, and environmental and energy impacts.

 is the solids turnover ratio. This is the ratio of the volume of coating solids added to an EDP system during a calendar
month divided by the total volume capacity of the EDP system. 
Prime coat systems other than EDP systems would be required to comply with a single numerical emission limit of 0.17
kg VOC per liter of applied coating solids. 
This revision is not a relaxation of the original prime coat standard since it does not reflect a change in the technological
basis upon which the original standard was based. It does reflect a better understanding of the operation and performance
of this technology based on an analysis of additional data which were not available at the time the standard was originally
developed. Consequently, this revision does not result in any environmental, energy, cost, or economic impacts.

Information collection requirements contained in this regulation (60.393) have been approved by the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq. 

and have been assigned OMB control number 2060-0034. 


I. Background 


On October 5, 1979, pursuant to Section 111 of the Act, standards of performance to limit emissions of volatile organic
compounds (VOC) from new, modified, and reconstructed automobile and light-duty truck surface coating operations
were proposed (44 FR 57792). Final standards limiting VOC emissions from prime coat operations to 0.16 kg VOC per liter
of applied coating solids were promulgated in the 

Federal Register

 on December 24, 1980 (45 FR 85410). 
On February 19, 1981, General Motors Corporation (GM) petitioned the Administrator to convene a proceeding under
section 307(d)(7)(B) of the Act to reconsider the prime coat standard. The basis for the petition was new data, which
had become available following promulgation of the standard, on the performance of the technology which served as
the basis for this standard. The basis for the standard promulgated on December 24, 1980, was cathodic EDP prime coat
systems which use low-VOC content waterborne materials. An EDP system consists of a large tank filled with coating
material. Metal parts are submerged in the tank and a voltage is applied to help deposit the coating solids onto the
parts. The low-VOC content cathodic EDP technology was quite new at the time of promulgation; and data on only one system,
which had operated for less than 1 year, were available. Following receipt of GM's petition for reconsideration,
data and information on the performance of this technology were solicited from GM, Ford Motor Company (FMC), American
Motors Corporation (AMC), Volkswagen Corporation (VW), Chrysler Corporation, Nissan, Honda, Inmont, and Pittsburgh
Plate Glass Corporation (PPG). Analysis of the additional data received confirmed that the promulgated standard
did not accurately reflect the performance of cathodic EDP prime coat systems. Consequently, a revised standard
of 0.17 kg VOC per liter of applied coating solids (6-month average using the best 6 months out of a 7-month period) was
proposed on July 29, 1982. 
A public hearing was not requested. The official public comment period closed on September 27, 1982. 


II. Comments and Changes to the Standard 


Six comments were received on the proposed revised standard. Three were from automobile manufacturers, one from
a coating manufacturer, one from an industry trade association, and one from a State regional control agency. A significant
amount of additional data on the performance of EDP prime coating systems was included with these comments. These
data covered the performance of 37 cathodic EDP prime coating systems using 10 different low-VOC content prime coating
materials over approximately 3,000 weeks of operation.

<TEXT>
 

Several commenters stated that the additional data included with their comments demonstrated that cathodic EDP
prime coating systems could not continuously meet the proposed revised emission limit. In addition, several commenters
suggested that flow control additive (FCA) added to the EDP prime coat system to maintain good flow characteristics
during periods when the system is not coating vehicles should be excluded from the emission calculations. The commenters
felt that the addition of FCA during production downtime was not representative of normal operation and, if not accommodated
in some manner, would cause unavoidable violations of the emission limit. The commenters argued that since the standard
is expressed in terms of kg of VOC per liter of applied coating solids, at times of near-zero use (i.e., essentially
no solids applied), even small evaporative losses result in the standard being exceeded by a wide margin. 
All of the data and information that were available, including the new data and information received during the comment
period, were reanalyzed. The cathodic EDP prime coat materials used by FMC, GM, AMC, and VW were very similar. The sole
suppliers were PPG, Inmont Corporation, and FMC. The coating materials consist of three components: resin, pigment,
and FCA. Table 1 presents the solids, solvent, and water composition of these three components for a representative
coating.

 






Each of these components may be added separately to the EDP prime coating tank. The solvent contained in these components
leaves the EDP tank either by transport on the surface of the automobile body or by evaporation from the liquid surface
of the tank. Upon leaving the EDP tank, the solvent clinging to the automobile body evaporates. All of the solvent added
to the EDP tank is ultimately released to the atmosphere. The VOC emissions released to the atmosphere per unit of solids
applied to the automobile body may, therefore, be determined directly by measuring the amount of VOC and solids added
to the EDP tank because additions are made to the tank to keep the coating material in a near steady-state condition.

The ratio of resin to pigment added to the EDP tank is recommended by the coating manufacturers and can vary with R

T

. The FCA is added as needed to provide the desired coating properties and finish quality and to maintain the coating
material in a near steady-state condition. Because of the high-solvent content of the FCA (95 percent by volume) and
the variable ratio (compared to resin and pigment) with which it is added to the EDP system, this component is of overriding
importance in determining emissions from the EDP system. 
All of the data were verified as being representative of good operation. Two potential sources of variation were differences
in the operation and maintenance of EDP tanks from plant to plant and differences among prime coat materials. Variations
in performance due to these two factors were analyzed and were not found to be statistically significant. Based on
this analysis, the coating material, coating equipment, and operation and maintenance for all of the data obtained
were determined to represent best demonstrated technology. Therefore, all of the data were used in establishing
the revised emission limit. 
All companies submitting data were able to provide data on a weekly basis. Averaging periods of 4 weeks, 8 weeks. 12
weeks, 24 weeks, and the best 24 out of 28 weeks (6 out of 7 months) were employed to examine the performance of EDP systems
including and excluding periods when the paint line was shut down, i.e., downtime. This analysis revealed that the
exclusion of periods of downtime slightly reduced the variability in VOC emissions. Even with downtime excluded,
however, the proposed revised standard was not met consistently.

In addition to periods of downtime, periods of low production also appeared to adversely affect performance. The
relative usage of an EDP system over any time period can be measured by either comparing the amount of new coating material
or new coating solids added to the total capacity of the system. The volume of coating solids added gives a better indication
of usage because it is a measure of production. i.e., the number of vehicles coated. This is because, regardless of
the coating material used, the same volume of coating solids must be deposited to coat a particular part to a specified
film thickness. The other major constituents of the EDP, coating material, VOC and water, do not become part of the
final dry coating and can evaporate from the tank during periods of downtime. Therefore, using the volume of new coating
material added would not give a consistent measure of usage for systems that use coating materials which contain varying
amounts of solids, VOC, and water. 
The total volume of coating solids added to the EDP tank divided by the total volume of the entire EDP system was found
to correlate well with VOC emissions. This ratio has been termed the solids turnover ratio (R

T

). The relationship between R

T

 and VOC emissions for 4-week periods is shown in Table 2. 
As seen in Table 2, VOC emissions, in terms of kilograms per liter of solids deposited, decrease as R

T

 increases. At R

T

's above 0.160, emissions are below 0.17 kg of VOC per liter of applied coating solids. Sources which operate at R

T

's of less than 0.160, however, cannot consistently meet an emission limit of 0.17 kg of VOC per liter of applied coating
solids. Further analysis of the data used to generate Table 2 indicates that for R

T

 between 0.040 and 0.160, VOC emissions are related to R

T

 by the following equation: 0.17  x  350

(0.l60-R



T



)

 kg of VOC per liter of applied coating solids.

The R

T

's of less than 0.040 represent periods of zero or abnormally low production. These low-operating levels occurred
more frequently than normal during the period in which the data in Table 2 were generated because of the depressed operating
level of the industry at that time. Operation at R

T

's below 0.040 results in widely varying VOC emissions in terms of kg VOC per liter of applied coating solids. Under
these low-operating conditions, emissions expressed in units of the standard range from 0.17 kg of VOC per liter of
applied coating solids to over 19 kg of VOC per liter of applied coating solids. Since operation with R

T

's below 0.040 result in widely varying emissions even when EDP prime coat systems are operated and maintained properly,
it is infeasible to establish a standard for these low-operating levels that distinguishes between proper and improper
operation regarding emissions of VOC. In addition, since the number of vehicles produced during 4-week periods with
R

T

's less than 0.040 is small, the total VOC emissions from the EDP tank during such periods of operation are only a fraction
of the emissions emitted when the EDP tank is operating properly at full production. Consequently, the revised standard
includes no emission limit for operation at R

T

's of 0.040 or less. 
The emission limits discussed above, therefore, were selected for the final revised standard. If there is little
or no production, almost no solids would be added to the EDP system, the R

T

 would always be below 0.040, and the owner would not have to comply with an emission limit. Prime coat systems other
than EDP would be required to comply with a single numerical emission limit of 0.17 kg of VOC per liter of applied coating
solids. 
One commenter suggested that the revised prime coat emission limit be based on the performance of the single EDP system
with the best observed performance. As mentioned earlier, however, the statistical analysis performed on 37 EDP
prime coating systems showed that there was no statistically significant difference in the observed performance
of any of the EDP systems. Consequently, all of the data on all of the EDP systems were used to develop the final revised
emission limits. 
One commenter suggested that the units of the prime coat standard be changed from kilograms of VOC per liter of applied
coating solids to kilograms of VOC per liter of coating minus water. The commenter indicated that this change would
make the prime coat standard units consistent with most State emission limits for existing facilities. Such a change
would have the effect of deleting the requirement that a transfer efficiency be used in determining compliance with
the emission limit. For an EDP system, the system upon which the standard is based, the transfer efficiency that is
allowed to be used for determining compliance is 100 percent. Therefore, for an EDP system, such a change would have
little effect on the allowable or actual emissions. However, if prime coat application systems other than EDP which
have transfer efficiencies of less than 100 percent are used, then the suggested changes in the units of the standard
could result in allowing increased actual VOC emissions while still apparently meeting the emission limit. Since
there is a possibility that systems other than EDP will be used in the future and a format of kg of VOC per liter of applied
coating solids is most consistent with the use of the solids turnover ratio, the units of the standard were not changed.

The Administrator certifies that a regulatory flexibility analysis under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), is not required for this
rulemaking because the rulemaking would not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.
The rulemaking would not impose any new requirements; therefore, no additional costs would be imposed. 
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines
``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: 
1. Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal
governments or communities; 
2. Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise 
interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 
3. Materially alter the budgetary impact of 
entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations or recipients thereof; or 
4. Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of 
legal mandates, the president's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order.
