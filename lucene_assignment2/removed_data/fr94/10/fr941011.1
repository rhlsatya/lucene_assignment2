<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This proposed rule would amend 7 CFR 1.22 by exempting four systems of records from certain sections of the Privacy
Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j). The previous list of exempt systems published in the 

Federal Register

 at 54 FR 39517, September 27, 1989, was omitted inadvertently from 7 CFR 1.22. The list of exempt systems contained
in the 

Federal Register

 notice at 54 FR 39517 is proposed to be amended by this notice. In addition, this proposed rule would amend 7 CFR 1.123
by changing the list of Office of Inspector General (OIG) systems of records covered under those sections to reflect
changes in the names of two of the systems of records, to add a third system which is being split-off from one of the other
systems, and to include the investigative records portion of a fourth system. 



These proposed amendments are being made in conjunction with the notice of proposed amendments to the USA/OIG systems
of records which is published elsewhere in today's issue of the 

Federal Register

. 

 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

For the system listed as USDA/OIG-2, ``Intelligence Records,'' OIG proposes to change the name to ``Informant
and Undercover Agent Records'' which represents a more descriptive title for the records contained in the system.
For the system listed as USDA/OIG-3, ``Investigative Files and Subject/Title Index,'' OIG proposes to change
the name to ``Investigative Files and Automated Investigative Indices System'' to reflect computerization of part
of the system. OIG also proposes to add systems USDA/OIG-4, ``OIG Hotline Complaint Records,'' and USDA/OIG-5,
``Consolidated Assignments, Personnel Tracking, and Administrative Information Network (CAPTAIN),'' to the
exemption lists in 7 CFR 1.122 and 1.123. It is proposed that the hotline records no longer be considered part of the
``Investigative Files'' system (USDA/OIG-3), but be set up as a separate system of records because the heavy
volume of activity in this area necessitates a separate control. It is also proposed that the investigative records
portion of system USDA/OIG-5, which is a computerized data base system, be considered exempt similar to other
investigative records. 




These amendments are not considered substantive because the basic OIG records covered by the exemptions in 7 CFR 1.122
and 1.123 remain the same as before. The justifications for these exemptions were published with the proposed rule
at 54 FR 11204, March 17, 1989, and were further explained when the final rule was published at 54 FR 39517, September
27, 1989. Although two new systems of records are proposed to be added to the exemption lists, the exemptions for those
records are not new because the records were previously considered exempted as part of the ``Investigative Files''
system. 

This proposed rule has been reviewed under Departmental Regulation 1512-1 and Executive Order No. 12866 and
has been determined not to be a ``significant regulatory action'' for the following reasons: 

(1) It would not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the
economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local, or tribal governments or communities; 

(2) Would not create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;


(3) Would not alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; and 

(4) Would not raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or principles
set forth in Executive Order 12866. 

In addition, it has been determined that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Viruses, Serums, Toxins and Analogous Products; Standard Requirement for Escherichia Coli Bacterins 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

We are proposing to amend the regulations by adding a Standard Requirement for 

Escherichia coli

 bacterins. This amendment would provide a uniform procedure to demonstrate the immunogenicity of reference bacterins
made from 

E. coli

 master seed bacteria. This amendment would also provide uniform procedures to requalify a reference bacterin for
which the dating period has expired. In addition, the amendment would specify the potency test requirements for the
release of serials of 

E. coli

 bacterins for immunogenicity and potency. 

 


The purpose of this regulation is to standardize the requirements for the production and testing of 

E. coli

 bacterins for immunogenicity and potency. 

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



Background 



Standard Requirements are prescribed in 9 CFR part 113 for the preparation and testing of veterinary biological products.
A Standard Requirement consists of test methods, procedures, and criteria which define the standards of purity,
safety, potency, and efficacy for a given type of veterinary biological product. Where a Standard Requirement for
a product does not exist in the regulations, production procedures and specifications for purity, safety, and potency
of a product are provided in an Outline of Production filed with the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. Once
uniform standards for a type of product are established, they are codified in the regulations. 

Because there is no Standard Requirement in 9 CFR part 113 for 

Escherichia coli (E. coli)

 bacterins, each manufacturer of these products has devised its own procedures, which are usually a part of a filed
Outline of Production, to meet the requirements of the Virus-Serum-Toxin Act that all veterinary biological products
be pure, safe, potent, and efficacious. Therefore, even though all of the procedures and methods must be satisfactory
to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, there are a number of different procedures which are used by firms
producing biological products containing 

E. coli

 as one of the components. At this time, we are prepared to propose adding a new  113.124 to the standards which
would contain uniform test methods, procedures, and criteria to be used by licensed manufacturers of 

E. coli

 bacterins to provide assurance that these bacterins are immunogenic and potent. 



Immunogencity 



The effectiveness of a veterinary biologic to ameliorate disease in animals is of paramount importance to the consumers
of veterinary biological products. The test for immunogenicity ascertains the efficacy of a veterinary biologic.
Based on experience with immunogenicity tests, the Animal and Plan Health Inspection Service is proposing uniform
requirements for establishing the immunogenicity of a Master Reference made from 

E. coli

 master seed. This would be accomplished by specifying in proposed  113.124(a): (1) The minimum number of pregnant
dams to vaccinate and the number of nonvaccinated controls; (2) procedures for challenge of neonates with virulent


E. coli

; and (3) the criteria for satisfactory protection against challenge and thereby demonstration of immunogenicity
of the Master Reference. The immunogenicity test of master seed bacteria described in proposed  113.124(a)
would be required of all new product license applications prior to licensure. The test would establish the immunogenicity
of the Master Reference used in the relative potency test required for release of serials of biological product.

<PARENT> FR941011-1-00002 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

As do all biologics, reference bacterins may lose potency and immunogenicity with the passage of time. The loss of
potency and immunogenicity is not constant for all biologics because of differences between master seeds, production
methods, adjuvants, diluents, conditions of storage and other variables used in the manufacture of biologics. Therefore
the proposed amendment in  113.124(b) describes the testing that must be conducted on an 

E. coli 

Master Reference to determine if it is still sufficiently potent and immunogenic after its date of expiration to permit
extending the date of expiration.


Potency


Different potency tests are currently used for 

E. coli 

bacterns. Potency tests used to compare serials of product to a reference bacterin are: mouse tests, guinea pig tests,
and enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). As proposed, new  113.124(c) would require the use of a standard


in vitro 

method for testing serials of 

E. coli 

bacterins. The proposed standard method is a parallel line immunoassay that compares, for both the unknown and the
reference, the linear regression of the optical density (OD) versus the logarithm of antigen concentration determined
by ELISA. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has proposed use of this standard 

in vitro 

potency test for 

E. coli 

bacterins 

because its use provides three advantages: (1) It ensures the use of a valid test method and makes potency testing more
uniform; (2) it ensures that serials of product are potent before release; and (3) it reduces significantly the number
of laboratory animals required for testing 

E. coli 

bacterins.


If adopted, this standard test would require that manufacturing firms have personnel proficient in performing the
ELISA procedure and the equipment necessary to perform the tests.


Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act


This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The rule has been determined to be not significant
for purposes of Executive Order 12866, and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.
This proposed rule, if adopted, would aid firms manufacturing 

E. coli 

bacterins. The proposal contains Standard Requirements for immunogenicity testing which would provide uniformity
among firms instead of each firm having to meet the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service requirements by its
own designed methods. This would reduce a firm's cost of research and development needed to design a method to test
immunogenicity. The proposed rule would prescribe 

in vitro 

potency testing of serials of product with minimal costs to manufacturing firms since the National Veterinary Services
Laboratories of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service have developed and standardized the tests and would
provide the critical reagents needed to perform the tests.

The manufacturers producing 

E. coli 

bacterins would need to have personnel proficient in conducting ELISA tests. The necessary equipment and personnel,
however, should already be available for other routine procedures in most biologic, research and diagnostic laboratories.
Also, the ELISA 

in vitro 

potency test is less expensive than the mouse potency test now used by the majority of firms producing 

E. coli 

bacterins.
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.


Executive Order 12778


This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. If this proposed rule is adopted:
(1) All State and local laws and regulations that are in conflict with this rule will be preempted; (2) no retroactive
effect will be given to this rule; and (3) administrative proceedings will not be required before parties may file
suit in court challenging this rule.

List of Subjects in 9 CFR Part 113



Animal biologics, Export, Imports, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.




Accordingly, 9 CFR part 113 would be amended as follows:



PART 113_STANDARD REQUIREMENTS



1. The authority citation for part 113 would continue to read as follows:






Authority:

 21 U.S.C. 151-159; 7 CFR 2.17, 2.51, and 371.2(d).




2. A new  113.124 would be added to read as follows:



 113.124 

Escherichia Coli Bacterin (E. coli).



Bacterins for the prevention of colibacillosis in mammalian neonates born to vaccinated dams shall be prepared from
bacterial cultures which are inactivated and nontoxic. Each lot of Master Seed Bacteria and serial or subserial of
product containing 

Escherichia coli

 shall meet the applicable requirements described in  113.100 and the special requirements prescribed in this
section. A lot of Master Seed Bacteria found unsatisfactory by any prescribed test shall not be used. A serial or subserial
found unsatisfactory by any prescribed test shall not be released.

(a) Each lot of Master Seed Bacteria shall be tested for immunogenicity in each species for which the bacterin is recommended.
The immunogenicity of the Master Seed Bacteria shall be established as follows:

(1) A Qualifying Serial of product with a minimum level of potency shall be produced from the highest allowable passage
of the Master Seed Bacteria for use in the immunogenicity test. The allowable passage level must be specified in the
filed Outline of Production. The relative potency of the Qualifying Serial compared to the References shall be established
as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.

(2) At least 30 pregnant cows or heifers (20 vaccinates and 10 controls) or at least 13 sows or gilts (8 vaccinates and
5 controls) shall be used as test animals. The animals shall be randomly divided between vaccinates and controls.
If the neonates to be protected are ovine or caprine, the number of test animals must be specified in a protocol approved
by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.

(3) Pregnant dams used as vaccinates shall be injected with one dose of the serial of product by the method recommended
on the label. If two doses are recommended, the second dose shall be administered at the time interval recommended
on the label. Serum samples shall be collected from each dam immediately prior to each inoculation, 2 weeks after the
last inoculation, and at parturition. Colostral samples shall be collected from each dam at parturition.

(4) Challenge of the neonates.

(i) Challenge culture(s), one for each 

E. coli

 pilus type for which protection is claimed, shall be provided or approved by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service. The challenge culture(s) used in the efficacy test(s) shall be aliquoted into individual doses, and stored
frozen at minus 70 
 C until needed.

(ii) After parturition, each neonate shall be allowed to suckle normally for at least 4 hours. Four to 12 hours after
parturition, each neonate shall be weighed, have a serum sample collected, and then be challenged.

(iii) Each neonate shall receive orally a predetermined dose of challenge culture.

(iv) Each neonate shall be examined at least twice daily for 7 days postchallenge for signs of colibacillosis. Neonates
that die shall be necropsied to determine the cause of death.

(5) Interpretation of results.

(i) If the mortality of the neonates from nonvaccinated bovine dams is less than 60 percent, the test is inconclusive
and may be repeated.

(ii) If at least 80 percent of the neonates from vaccinated bovine dams do not survive without showing clinical signs
of colibacillosis, the immunogenicity of the serial of product and the Master Seed Bacteria is unsatisfactory.

(iii) For porcine, ovine, and caprine neonates, if a statistically significant greater number of neonates from vaccinated
dams do not survive, or the survivors do not show a significant reduction in clinical signs of colibacillosis, or both,
when compared with neonates from nonvaccinated control dams, the immunogenicity of the serial of product and the
Master Seed Bacteria is unsatisfactory. The level of significance required is p <0.05. Clinical signs shall be
evaluated by a method of scoring and statistical analysis acceptable to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.

(b) References for 

in vitro

 potency tests.

(1) Comparison of the Qualifying Serial and Working References

(i) If the Qualifying Serial is the Working Reference, no comparative potency testing between the Qualifying Serial
and the reference is required.

(ii) If the Qualifying Serial is not the Working Reference, then the potency of the Qualifying Serial relative to the
Working Reference shall be determined using a parallel line immunoassay that is approved by the Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service. To be acceptable, the geometric mean of the relative potency values obtained for the Qualifying
Serial in at least 5 independent parallel line immunoassays shall be less than or equal to 1.00.


(iii) If the Master Reference is different from either the Working Reference or the Qualifying Serial, or both, the
dilution of the Master Reference with a potency equal to that of the Working Reference shall be determined by using
a parallel line immunoassay as specified in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.


(2) Dating period for References. References shall have an initial dating period equal to the dating period of the
product or as supported by data acceptable to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. The dating period begins
on the date of initiation of the immunogenicity test or repeat immunogenicity test. The expiration date(s) of References
shall be stated in the Outline of Production.


(3) Requalifying a Master Reference.


(i) To requalify and extend the dating period of a Master Reference, a repeat immunogenicity test shall be conducted
using a Qualifying Serial of product as defined in  101.5(q)(2). If the Master Reference or Working Reference
is a serial of product, the Qualifying Serial becomes the new Master Reference or the new Working Reference.


(ii) The protocol and the method of evaluation of the repeat immunogenicity test to requalify a Master Reference must
be approved by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. The results of the immunogenicity test specified in
paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(5) of this section will be a determining factor in what constitutes an appropriate
test to requalify a Master Reference. Different methods of requalifying a Master Reference are:


(A) Challenge of neonates born to vaccinated host animals.


(B) Challenge of vaccinated animals of another species whose immunological response has been shown to correlate
with protection of neonates of the species for which the product is recommended.


(C) Serum and colostral antipilus titers of dams, or serum antipilus titers of neonates, or both, when antibody titers
show a meaningful correlation to protection in the original immunogenicity test specified in paragraphs (a)(2)
through (a)(5) of this section.


(iii) Requalifying and extending the dating period of a Master Reference may also be done by monitoring the potency
of the Master Reference by 

in vitro 

methods over time by procedures approved by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service and then conducting a repeat
immunogenicity test as in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and (b)(3)(ii) of this section when any decline in potency is detected.


(4) An Outline of Production change must be approved by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service to provide an
extension of the expiration date of a Master Reference.


(c) Test requirements for release of serials.


(1) Each serial and subserial shall meet the applicable requirements prescribed in  113.100 and the requirements
of this paragraph. Any serial or subserial found unsatisfactory by a prescribed test shall not be released.


(2) Potency test. Bulk or final container samples of completed product shall be tested for potency using the parallel
line immunoassay and the Working Reference correlated directly to the immunogenicity test described in paragraph
(a) or indirectly as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The potency test(s) must be specific for each pilus
type for which protection is claimed. The antigen capture antibody and the antigen indicator monoclonal antibody
for the 

in vitro 

potency test is supplied by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. To be satisfactory and eligible for release,
each pilus antigen in each serial of product shall have a relative potency greater than or equal to 1.00 when compared
to the Working Reference(s). Serials not satisfactory on the initial relative potency test may be retested in accordance
with  113.8 (c)(1) through (c)(5).

Airworthiness Directives; Canadair Model CL-600-2B19 (Regional Jet Series 100) Series Airplanes 



<AGENCY>

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes the supersedure of an existing airworthiness 
directive (AD), applicable to certain Canadair Model CL-600-2B19 series airplanes, that 
currently requires a revision to the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) to restrict altitude and 
airspeed operations of the airplane under certain conditions of hydraulic system failure. 
This action would add a requirement to remove certain shear pins and install certain new 
shear pins on the elevator flutter dampers, and replace certain shear pins at repetitive 
intervals. This proposal is prompted by the development of a temporary repair that 
entails repetitive replacement of discrepant pins in a timely manner to prevent failure of 
the pins. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent undampened 
vibration of the elevators in normal cruise conditions; when combined with hydraulic 
system failures, this condition could result in reduced controllability of the airplane.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Comments Invited 


Interested persons are invited to participate in the making of the proposed rule by 
submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications 
shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address 
specified above. All communications received on or before the closing date for 
comments, specified above, will be considered before taking action on the proposed rule. 
The proposals contained in this notice may be changed in light of the comments received. 
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, 
environmental, and energy aspects of the proposed rule. All comments submitted will be 
available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for 
examination by interested persons. A report summarizing each FAA-public contact 
concerned with the substance of this proposal will be filed in the Rules Docket. 
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments

94-NM-155-AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. 


Availability of NPRMs 


Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, 
Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM-103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 
94-NM-155-AD, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington 98055-4056. 


Discussion 


On January 3, 1994, the FAA issued AD 94-01-09, amendment 39-8791 (59 FR 
1471, January 11, 1994), applicable to certain Canadair Model CL-600-2B19 (Regional 
Jet Series 100) series airplanes, to require a revision to the Limitations Section of the 
FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) to restrict altitude and airspeed operations 
of the airplane under certain conditions of hydraulic system failure. That action was 
prompted by a report of sheared-off shear pins found on one airplane's elevator dampers. 
The requirements of that AD are intended to prevent undampened vibration of the 
elevators in normal cruise conditions; when combined with hydraulic system failures, this 
condition can result in reduced controllability of the airplane. 
Since the issuance of that AD, Bombardier, Inc., has developed a temporary 
repair, which involves removing the existing shear pins and installing new shear pins on 
the elevator flutter dampers, and then replacing the shear pins at repetitive intervals. The 
intent of this temporary repair is to replace discrepant pins in a timely manner in order to 
prevent the failure of the pins. (The manufacturer is currently developing a permanent 
modification.) Failure of the shear pins on the elevator damper, if not detected and 
corrected, may lead to undampened vibration of the elevators during normal cruise 
conditions; when combined with hydraulic system failures, this situation could result in 
reduced controllability of the airplane. 
Bombardier has issued Canadair ``Regional Jet'' Service Bulletin S.B. 
601R-27-017, dated May 12, 1994, which describes procedures for accomplishing a 
temporary repair that entails the removal of shear pins having part number (P/N) 
HST22DU8-13, and the installation of new shear pins having P/N 601R24063-2501, on 
the elevator flutter dampers. This service bulletin also describes procedures for 
replacement of the new shear pins at repetitive intervals. Transport Canada Aviation, 
which is the airworthiness authority for Canada, classified this service bulletin as 
mandatory and issued Canadian Airworthiness Directive CF-93-32R1, dated 
August 12, 1994, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in 
Canada. 
This airplane model is manufactured in Canada and is type certificated for 
operation in the United States under the provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal 
Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness 
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, Transport Canada 
Aviation has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has 
examined the findings of Transport Canada Aviation, reviewed all available information, 
and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are 
certificated for operation in the United States. 
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on 
other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD 
would supersede AD 94-01-09 to require removal of existing shear pins and installation 
of certain new shear pins on the elevator flutter dampers; and to require replacement of 
shear pins at repetitive intervals. The actions would be required to be accomplished in 
accordance with the service bulletin described previously. 
The proposed AD would also continue to require the previously-required revision 
to the Limitations Section of the FAA-approved AFM to restrict altitude and airspeed 
operations under conditions of single or double hydraulic failure.

This is considered interim action until final action is identified, at which time the 
FAA may consider additional rulemaking. 

The FAA estimates that 19 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD. 

The AFM revision that was previously required by AD 94-01-09, and retained in this proposal, takes approximately
1 work hour per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total
cost impact of the AFM 
revision requirement on U.S. operators is estimated to be $55 per airplane. The FAA 
estimates that all affected U.S. operators have previously accomplished this requirement; 
therefore, the future cost impact of this requirement is minimal. 

The removal, installation, and replacement of shear pins that would be required by 
this proposal would take approximately 5 work hours per airplane to accomplish, at an 
average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Required parts would be supplied by the 
manufacturer at no cost to operators. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of 
these proposed requirement on U.S. operators is estimated to be $5,225, or $275 per 
airplane. 
The total cost impact figures discussed above are based on assumptions that no 
operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and 
that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not 
adopted. 
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the 
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal 
would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a 
Federalism Assessment. 
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a 
``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant 
rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 
1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or 
negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is 
contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules 
Docket at the location provided under the caption

List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 


Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. 



The Proposed Amendment 


Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration
proposes to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: 



PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 



1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows:






Authority:

 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 
11.89. 



 39.13 

[Amended] 


2. Section 39.13 is amended by removing amendment 39-8791 (59 FR 1471, 
January 11, 1994), and by adding a new airworthiness directive (AD), to read as follows:






Bombardier, Inc. (Formerly Canadair): 

Docket 94-NM-155-AD. 
Supersedes AD 94-01-09, Amendment 39-8791.






Applicability: 

Model CL-600-2B19 (Regional Jet Series 100) series airplanes; 
serial numbers 7003 and subsequent; certificated in any category. 


Compliance: 

Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously.

To prevent undampened vibration of the elevators in normal cruise conditions 
which, when combined with hydraulic system failures, could result in reduced 
controllability of the airplane, accomplish the following: 

(a) Within 30 days after January 26, 1994 (the effective date of AD 94-01-09, 
amendment 39-8791), revise the Limitations Section of the FAA-approved Airplane 
Flight Manual (AFM) to include the following restrictions of altitude and airspeed 
operations under conditions of single or double hydraulic system failure; and advise the 
flight crew of these revised limits. Revision of the AFM may be accomplished by 
inserting a copy of this AD in the AFM.






Note 1: 

The restrictions described in the AFM Temporary Revision (TR) RJ/30 
meet the requirements of this paragraph. Therefore, inserting a copy of TR RJ/30 in lieu 
of this AD in the AFM is considered an acceptable means of compliance with this 
paragraph.

(b) For airplanes having serial numbers 7003 through 7044, inclusive: Within 45 
days after the effective date of this AD, remove shear pins having part number (P/N) 
HST22DU8-13 that are installed on the elevator flutter dampers, and install new shear 
pins having P/N 601R24063-2501, in accordance with Canadair Regional Jet Service 
Bulletin S.B. 601R-27-017, dated May 12, 1994. Thereafter, prior to the accumulation of 
800 flight hours on any shear pin having P/N 601R24063-2501, replace it with a new 
shear pin having P/N 601R24063-2501. 
(c) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time 
that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, 
Standardization Branch, ANM-113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. Operators 
shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, 
who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Standardization Branch, 
ANM-113.

 

Note 2:

 Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods 
of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Standardization Branch, 
ANM-113.

 

(d) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with sections 21.197 and 
21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the 
airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. 
Issued in Renton, Washington, on October 4, 1994.

Proposed Alteration of Jet Routes 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This proposed rule would realign Jet Route J-10 from the Twentynine Palms, CA, Very High Frequency Omnidirectional
Range/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) to the Farmington, NM, VORTAC and extend Jet Route J-231 from the St.
Johns, AZ, VORTAC to the Twentynine Palms VORTAC. This action would enhance air safety, simplify routings, and reduce
controller workload. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Comments Invited 



Interested parties are invited to participate in this proposed rulemaking by submitting such written data, views,
or arguments as they may desire. Comments that provide the factual basis supporting the views and suggestions presented
are particularly helpful in developing reasoned regulatory decisions on the proposal. Comments are specifically
invited on the overall regulatory, aeronautical, economic, environmental, and energy-related aspects of the proposal.
Communications should identify the airspace docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address listed above.
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments on this notice must submit with those comments
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Airspace Docket No. 94-ASW-8.''
The postcard will be date/time stamped and returned to the commenter. All communications received on or before the
specified closing date for comments will be considered before taking action on the proposed rule. The proposal contained
in this notice may be changed in light of comments received. All comments submitted will be available for examination
in the Rules Docket both before and after the closing date for comments. A report summarizing each substantive public
contact with FAA personnel concerned with this rulemaking will be filed in the docket. 



Availability of NPRM's 



Any person may obtain a copy of this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) by submitting a request to the Federal Aviation
Administration, Office of Public Affairs, Attention: Public Inquiry Center, APA-220, 800 Independence Avenue,
SW., Washington, DC 20591, or by calling (202) 267-3485. Communications must identify the notice number of
this NPRM. Persons interested in being placed on a mailing list for future NPRM's should also request a copy of Advisory
Circular No. 11-2A, which describes the application procedure. 



The Proposal 



The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to realign J-10
from the Twentynine Palms, CA, VORTAC to the Farmington, NM, VORTAC and extend J-231 from the St. Johns, AZ, VORTAC
to the Twentynine Palms VORTAC. This realignment would reduce sector complexity northeast of Phoenix AZ, resulting
in more efficient utilization of the airspace. This action would enhance safety, simplify routings, and decrease
the controllers workload. Jet routes are published in paragraph 2004 of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and
effective September 16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The jet routes listed in this document
would be published subsequently in the Order. 

The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This proposed rule would amend Federal Airway V-36 by extending the airway from Sault Ste Marie, MI, to Thunder
Bay, ON, Canada, via Wawa, ON, Canada. Modifying the airway would simplify routings for air traffic transitioning
in that airspace from the United States to Canada. In addition, the airspace designation would be changed to reflect
the relocation of the Toronto, ON, Canada, Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range/Distance Measuring Equipment
(VOR/DME).

The Proposal 



The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to modify V-36
by extending the airway from Sault Ste Marie, MI, to Thunder Bay, ON, Canada, via Wawa, ON, Canada, excluding the airspace
in Canada. Extending the airway has become necessary because of the volume of air traffic utilizing V-36. This
action would simplify routings and reduce the workload for pilots and controllers. In addition, the airspace designation
would be changed to reflect the relocation of the Toronto, ON, Canada, VOR/DME. Domestic VOR Federal airways are published
in paragraph 6010(a) of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective September 16, 1994, which is incorporated
by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The airway listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order. 

The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is

a mailpiece's dimensions and relating them to processing category and other criteria, as well as standards concerning
the content and placement of delivery and return addresses; the location of, and the use of a ZIP Code or ZIP+4 code in,
the return address on certain mail; terms related to post office boxes and standards for their use in addressing mail;
and the prohibition of dual addresses on certain types of mail. The Postal Service requested comments by August 1,
1994. Owing to the needs of the mailing public, from whom several requests for additional time were received, the Postal
Service extended the comment period to September 16, 1994 (59 FR 37190). Continuing interest from customers has prompted
the Postal Service to further extend the comment period, to October 31, 1994, and to schedule a public meeting on October
20, 1994 (announced separately in this issue of the

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Postal Service published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 31178-31183) on June 17, 1994, a proposal to amend the Domestic Mail Manual concerning standards defining
a mailpiece's dimensions and relating them to processing category and other criteria, as well as standards concerning

the return address on certain mail; terms related to post office boxes and standards for their use in addressing mail;
and the prohibition of dual addresses on certain types of mail. The Postal Service initially requested comments by
August 1, 1994. The Postal Service extended the comment period, first to September 16, 1994 (59 FR 37190), and subsequently
to October 31, 1994 (announced separately in this issue of the 

Federal Register

). 


Several customers have also requested an opportunity to present their views and concerns in person regarding the
proposed rule. Generally, the Postal Service neither finds a need for nor holds public meetings about proposed rules.
Nevertheless, the Postal Service has decided to grant the request for a public meeting regarding this particular
rulemaking because of the varied yet interrelated issues it discusses, the desirability of exploring effective
alternatives to achieve the objectives of the proposed rule, and the advantages of discussion of the proposed rule
among postal managers and interested customer participants. Comments submitted at the meeting may be written or
oral; all will be considered as comments on the record. Oral comments will be transcribed for future reference and
will be available for inspection and photocopying between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, in Room 6800 at
the above address. Interested parties may submit written comments in accordance with the instructions in the 

Federal Register

 notices cited earlier. Individuals wishing to make oral comments at the meeting are asked to limit them to 10 minutes.
In order that the Postal Service may properly plan for the meeting, individuals who will attend are required to notify
the party identified above or the Manager, Mailing Standards, USPS Headquarters, 475 L'Enfant Plaza SW., Washington,
DC 20260-2419, in writing or by telephone at (202) 268-5304 no later than October 13, 1994.

 Proposed rule.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The EPA proposes to approve the state implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Florida for the
purpose of correcting minor deficiencies in the Motor Vehicle Inspection Program and revising the air quality classifications
in Florida's SIP to coincide with the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. In the final rules section of this 

Federal Register

, the EPA is approving the State's SIP revision as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views
this as a noncontroversial revision amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rational for the approval
is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to that direct final rule, no further
activity is contemplated in relation to this proposed rule. If EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule
will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed
rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this document. Any parties interested in commenting on
this document should do so at this time.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council (CAAC) and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council (DARC) are considering
changes to the Federal Acquisition Regulation to clarify the regulations concerning the allowability of personal
services compensation costs. This regulatory action was subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review
pursuant to Executive Order No. 12866 dated September 30, 1993.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
 A. Background


The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) currently requires contracting officers to evaluate the compensation
systems of a contractor and to make a determination as to the allowability of personal services compensation costs
claimed by the contractor (FAR 31.205-6 and 42.302(a)(1)). The Defense Contract Audit Agency has raised concerns
that the language in FAR 31.205-6(b) may be susceptible to differing interpretations and that the FAR does not
provide adequate guidance with regard to contractor compensation systems. Some have misinterpreted the current
cost principle to place equal weight on all factors affecting the reasonableness of compensation. Others have held
that all the factors affecting reasonableness are stated in the cost principle.
This proposed rule is intended to make it clear that the Government requires contractors to maintain sound compensation
systems that consistently provide employee compensation costs that are reasonable, complaint with laws and regulations,
and subject to applicable financial controls. The proposed rule does not require a contractor to change its compensation
practices or its compensation system. The basic requirement that the contractor demonstrate the reasonableness
of its compensation costs for personal services still exist. An adequate system requires documented compliance
with the cost principle, enforced by internal reviews. An inadequate system does not automatically mean that the
compensation claimed is unreasonable. However, an inadequate system may be a factor in the contracting officer's
evaluation of whether the compensation claimed is reasonable. An inadequate system generally indicates that a contractor
lacks sufficient documentation to support the reasonableness of its compensation costs and/or lacks adequate controls
to ensure that its established policies are properly enforced.
This proposed rule clarifies existing language at FAR 22.101-2; adds definitions at FAR 31.001; adds a new paragraph
FAR 31.205-6(a)(6) addressing contractor compensation systems and referencing a new FAR subpart 42.13; clarifies
the standard for reasonableness of labor-management compensation agreements at FAR 31.205-6 (b) and (c);
removes the examples from FAR 31.205-6(b); revises FAR 31.205-6(b)(2) to clarify what special circumstances
are covered, provide guidance to contracting officers confronted with those situations, remove references to the
Internal Revenue Code, and make unallowable or place limitations on certain high-risk type of payments; revises
FAR 31.205-6(i) to remove the current series of allowable examples and substitute a general allowability rule
to preclude the need to add further examples to paragraph (i); clarifies FAR 42.302(a)(1); and establishes a new FAR
subpart 42.13 which contains policies, procedures, and minimum standards applicable to contractor compensation
system and reviews of such systems.
This proposed rule also makes editorial changes, corrects administrative errors, and adds clarifying language
throughout FAR 31.205-6. Most notable of these changes is the redesignation of FAR 31.205-6(f)(2) to
a restructured and renamed FAR 31.205-6(d) to improve the flow of the cost principle and provide a more logical
placement of the language.


B. Regulatory Flexibility Act


This proposed rule clarifies a condition of cost allowability for contractors who wish to be reimbursed under Government
contracts subject to FAR 31.2. The Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq.

, applies, but the rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
because most contracts awarded to small entities are awarded on a competitive, fixed-price basis and the cost principles
do not apply. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments from small
entities concerning the affected FAR subpart will be considered in accordance with Section 610 of the Act. Such comments
must be submitted separately and cite FAR Case 93-5 in correspondence.

C. Paperwork Reduction Act



The Paperwork Reduction Act (Pub. L. 96-511) does not apply because the proposed rule does not impose recordkeeping
requirements or information collection requirements or collection of information from offerors, contractors,
or members of the public which require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501, 

et seq.

2. Section 22.101-2 is amended by revising paragraph (a) to read as follows:



22.101-2



Contract pricing and administration.



(a) Contractor labor policies and compensation practices, whether or not included in labor-management agreements,
are not acceptable bases for allowing costs in cost reimbursement contracts or for recognition of costs in pricing
fixed-price contracts if they result in unreasonable or unallowable costs to the Government. For a discussion of
cost reasonableness, as it affects the allowability of costs resulting from labor-management agreements, see 31.205-6(c).

Definitions.



* * * * *







Compensation system,

 as used in this part, means the contractor's system(s) for planning, administering, and controlling all remuneration
paid currently or accrued, in whatever form and whether paid immediately or deferred, for services rendered by employees
of a contractor during contract performance.



* * * * *







Job,

 as used in this part, means a homogeneous cluster of work tasks, the completion of which serves an enduring purpose
for the organization. Taken as a whole, the collection of tasks, duties, and responsibilities constitutes the assignment
for one or more individuals whose work is of the same nature and is performed at the same skill/responsibility level_as
opposed to a position, which is a collection of tasks assigned to a specific individual. Within a job, there may be pay
categories which are dependent on the degree of supervision required by the employee while performing assigned tasks
which are performed by all persons with the same job.





Job class of employees,

 as used in this part, means employees performing in positions within the same job.



* * * * *







Labor market,

 as used in this part, means an arena where individuals exchange their labor for compensation. Labor markets are identified
and defined by some complex combination of the following factors: (1) geography, (2) education and/or technical
background required, (3) experience required by the job, (4) licensing or certification requirements, (5) occupational
membership, and (6) industry.



* * * * *





4. Section 31.205-6 is amended by revising paragraph (a), (b), (c), (d), (f), and (i), to read as follows:



31.205-6




Compensation for personal services.





(b) 

General.

 Compensation for personal services includes all remuneration paid currently or accrued, in whatever form and whether
paid immediately or deferred, for services rendered by employees to the contractor during the period of contract
performance (except as otherwise provided for in other paragraphs of this subsection). It includes, but is not limited
to, salaries; wages; director's and executive committee members' fees; bonuses (including stock bonuses); incentive
awards; employee stock options and stock appreciation rights; employee stock ownership plans; employee insurance;
fringe benefits; contributions to pension, other post-retirement benefits, annuity, and employee incentive compensation
plans; and allowances for off-site pay, incentive pay, location allowances, hardship pay, severance pay, and cost
of living differential. Compensation for person services is allowable subject to the following general criteria
and additional requirements contained in other parts of this cost principle:



(1) Compensation for personal services must be for work performed by the employee in the current year and must not represent
a retroactive adjustment of prior years' salaries or wages (but see 31.205-6(g), (h), (j), (k), (m), and (o)
of this subsection). Each element of compensation has a net present value for the current year which expresses the
cash value of the compensation paid to employees in the year that it is earned.



(2) Compensation in total must be reasonable for the work performed; however, specific restrictions on individual
compensation elements must be observed where they are prescribed.



(3) Each element of compensation must be based upon and conform to the terms and conditions of the contractor's written
compensation plan that is followed consistently.



(4) No presumption of allowability will exist where the contractor introduces major revisions to existing compensation
plans or systems or introduces new plans or systems (see 31.201-3). Advance agreements on the allowability
of increased costs are recommended (see 31.109).



(5) Costs that are otherwise unallowable under Subpart 31.2 shall not be allowable under this subsection 31.205-6
solely on the basis that they constitute compensation for personal services.

(6) Contractor compensation systems must have adequate internal and administrative controls to ensure the integrity
of the system and its data (see 42.1304(b) for minimum standards). 

(b) 

Reasonableness.

 The compensation for personal services paid or accrued to each employee must be reasonable for the work performed.
Compensation will be considered reasonable if each of the allowable elements making up the employee's compensation
package is reasonable. This paragraph addresses the reasonableness of compensation except when the compensation
is set by provisions of a labor-management agreement under terms of the National Labor Relations Act or similar state
statues. The tests for reasonableness of labor-management agreements are set forth in paragraph (c) of this subsection.
In addition to the provisions of 31.201-3, in testing the reasonableness of individual elements for particular
employees or job classes of employees, consideration should be given to factors determined to be relevant by the contracting
officer. 

(1) Among others, factors which may be relevant include the adequacy of the contractor's compensation system (see
subpart 42.13), general conformity with the compensation paid by other firms of the same size, the compensation paid
by other firms in the same industry, the compensation paid by firms in the same geographic area, the compensation paid
by firms engaged in predominantly non-Government work, and the cost of comparable service obtainable from from outside
sources. 

In addition to the adequacy of the compensation system, the relative significance of other factors in evaluating
the reasonableness of compensation depends on the degree to which the factors are representative of the labor market
for the job being evaluated. In administering this principle, it is recognized that not every compensation case need
be subjected in detail to the tests described in this cost principle. The tests need be applied only when a general review
reveals amounts or types of compensation that appear unreasonable or unjustified. Based on initial review of the
facts, contracting officers or their representatives may challenge the reasonableness of any individual element
or the sum of the individual elements of compensation paid or accrued to particular employees or job classes of employees.
In such cases, there is no presumption of reasonableness and, upon challenge, the contractor must demonstrate the
reasonableness of the compensation item in question. In doing so, the contractor may introduce, and the contracting
officer will consider, not only any circumstances surrounding the compensation item challenged, but also the magnitude
of other compensation elements which may be lower than would be considered reasonable in themselves. However, the
contractor's right to introduce offsetting compensation elements into consideration is subject to the following
limitations: 

(i) Offsets will be considered only between the allowable elements of an employee's (or a job class of employees')
compensation package or between the compensation packages of employees in jobs within the same job grade or level.


(ii) Offsets will be considered only between the allowable portion of the compensation elements of employees or job
classes of employees. However, any of the compensation elements or portions thereof, whose amount is not measurable,
shall not be introduced or considered as an offset item. Compensation elements include: 

(A) Wages and salaries. 
(B) Incentive bonuses. 
(C) Deferred compensation. 
(D) Pension and savings plan benefits. 
(E) Health insurance benefits. 
(F) Life insurance benefits. 
(G) Compensated personal absence benefits. 

(iii) In considering offsets, the magnitude of the compensation elements in question must be taken into account.
In determining the magnitude of compensation elements, the timing of receipt by the employee must be considered.


(2) Compensation costs under certain conditions give rise to the need for special consideration. Among such conditions
are the following:

(i) Compensation to sole proprietors, partners or persons who are contractually entitled to acquire a partnership
interest in a contractor enterprise, persons who own 10 percent or more of an incorporated contractor's stock, persons
who are contractually entitled to acquire at least 10 percent of an incorporated contractor's stock, persons who
are officers or directors of an incorporated contractor, or persons who otherwise have a substantial financial interest
in the contractor's enterprise. To be allowable, compensation of each such person or member of their family must be
reasonable for the personal services rendered. Such employees are assumed to have influence over their own compensation
and the compensation of their family members.

(A) The reasonableness of the compensation of each such employee or family member must be separately supported for
the cost to be allowable. The determination of reasonableness for each such individual will be based on the application
of the provisions of this cost principle to the individual with no offsets allowed from any other employee, job class
of employees, or other jobs within a job grade.

(B) If a contractor seeks to justify compensation for such individuals in excess of the average compensation paid
by comparable firms (the reasonable compensation for the services rendered), it must be based upon superior performance
demonstrated by quantifiable performance measurements which use comparisons with firms of similar size and industry,
consistently applied from year to year.

(C) Severance payments (see 31.205-6(g)) paid to such individuals or to members of their families are not allowable
in excess of the payments otherwise allowable and paid in accordance with the provisions of the contractor's severance
policy in effect for the majority of the contractor's employees for the three year period prior to the individual's
dismissal. However, severance payments are not allowable if paid to sole proprietors, partners (or persons contractually
entitled to acquire a partnership interest in the contractor), or persons who hold (or are contractually entitled
to acquire) at least 10 percent of a corporate contractor's stock.

(D) Early retirement incentive payments (see 31.205-6(j)(7)) paid to such individuals or to members of their
families are not allowable unless the payments are otherwise allowable, paid in accordance with the provisions of
a contractor early retirement incentive plan made available to all other employees with similar eligibility. If
the total paid to all such individuals and members of their families exceeds 10 percent of the plan's cost, the excess
over the 10 percent is not allowable cost. However, early retirement incentive payments are not allowable if paid
to sold proprietors, partners (or persons contractually entitled to acquire a partnership interest in the contractor),
or persons who hold (or are contractually entitled to acquire) at least 10 percent of a corporate contractor's stock.

(E) Payment in lieu of salary for services rendered by partners and sole proprietors is allowable as compensation
to the extent that it would otherwise be allowable and reasonable as compensation for the same personal services if
those services had been rendered by an employee of the contractor.

(ii) Substantially increased compensation resulting from a change in a contractor's compensation policy or system,
particularly when it is concurrent with an increase in the ratio of Government contracts to other business, or any
change in the treatment of allowability of specific types of compensation related to changes in Government policy.
Contracting officers or their representatives should question such increased costs unless the contractor presents
supporting data to show to the contracting officer's satisfaction that the changed compensation plan or system produces
reasonable costs to the Government (see also 31.201-3 and 31.205-6(a)(4)).

(iii) The contractor's business is such that its compensation levels are not subject to the restraints that normally
occur in the conduct of competitive business.

(c) 

Labor-management agreements. 

If costs of compensation established under ``arm's length'' negotiated labor-management agreements are otherwise
allowable, the costs are reasonable if, as applied to work in performing Government contracts, they are not determined
to be unwarranted by the character and circumstances of the work or discriminatory against the Government. The application
of the provisions of a labor-management agreement designed to apply to a given set of circumstances and conditions
of employment (e.g., work involving extremely hazardous activities or work not requiring recurrent use of overtime)
is unwarranted when applied to a Government contract involving significantly different circumstances and conditions
of employment (e.g., work involving less hazardous activities or work continually requiring use of overtime). It
is discriminatory against the Government if it results in employee compensation (in whatever form or name) in excess
of that being paid for similar non-Government work under comparable circumstances. Disallowance of costs will not
be made under this paragraph (c) unless_

(1) The contractor has been permitted an opportunity to justify the costs; and

(2) Due consideration has been given to whether unusual conditions pertain to Government contract work, imposing
burdens, hardships, or hazards on the contractor's employees, for which compensation that might otherwise appear
unreason
