Meat Import Limitations; Fourth Quarterly Estimate 
 
 


The Meat Import Act of 1979, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2253 note) (the ``Act''), provides for limiting the quantity of fresh,
chilled, or frozen meat of bovine, sheep (except lamb), and goats; and processed meat of beef or veal (Harmonized Tariff
Schedule of the United States subheadings 0201.10.00, 0201.20.20, 0201.20.40, 0201.20.60, 0201.30.20, 0201.30.40,
0201.30.60, 0202.10.00, 0202.20.20, 0202.20.40, 0202.20.60, 0202.30.20, 0202.30.40, 0202.30.60, 0204.21.00,
0204.22.40, 0204.23.40, 0204.41.00, 0204.42.40, 0204.43.40, and 0204.50.00), other than products of Canada and
Mexico, which may be imported into the United States in any calendar year. Such limitations are to be imposed when the
Secretary of Agriculture estimates that imports of articles, other than products of Canada and Mexico, provided
for in Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States subheadings 0201.10.00, 0201.20.40, 0201.20.60, 0201.30.40,
0201.30.60, 0202.10.00, 0202.20.40, 0202.20.60, 0202.30.40, 0202.30.60, 0204.21.00, 0204.22.40, 0204.23.40,
0204.41.00, 0204.42.40, 0204.43.40, and 0204.50.00 (hereinafter referred to as ``meat articles''), in the absence
of limitations under the Act during such calendar year, would equal or exceed 110 percent of the estimated quantity
of meat articles prescribed for calendar year 1994 by section 2(c) as adjusted under section 2(d) of the Act.

As announced in the Notice published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 6, 1994 (59 FR 727), the estimated aggregate quantity of meat articles other than products of Canada and
Mexico prescribed by section 2(c) as adjusted by section 2(d) of the Act for calendar year 1994 is 1,108.1 million pounds.

 
In accordance with the requirements of the Act, I have determined that the fourth quarterly estimate of the aggregate
quantity of meat articles other than products of Canada and Mexico which would, in the absence of limitations under
the Act, be imported during calendar year 1994 is 1,218.8 million pounds.

<DOCTITLE>Privacy Act of 1974; Systems of Records</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of the Secretary, USDA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of revision of Privacy Act systems of records.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Notice is hereby given pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4) that the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) proposes
to revise the Privacy Act Systems of Records maintained by the Office of Inspector General (OIG) in order to update
the information in the systems and provide individuals with more current and more detailed information concerning
the records maintained in the USDA/OIG systems of records. The proposed revisions include removing two categories
of records from existing systems and setting them up as separate systems, deleting two systems for which records are
no longer maintained, establishing one entirely new system of records, and condensing/consolidating routine uses.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Proposed updates applicable to all USDA/OIG systems include changes in addresses to reflect changes in addresses
to reflect changes in office locations, and changes in titles of system managers and contact persons to reflect organizational
changes. Other proposals specifically applicable to particular systems are as follows.



For USDA/OIG-1, ``Employee Records, USDA/OIG,'' to clarify further the types of records that may be on file
USDA/OIG proposes to add two categories, security clearance forms and exit interviews, and to add an explanation
that the qualifications category in regard to law enforcement employees may include such records as Attorney General
designations, training certificates, physical fitness data, and the medical officer's certification section
of medical examination forms. Also to assist employees in locating their records, USDA/OIG proposes to add references
to two OPM systems and one USDA system which also cover employee records. Furthermore, the proposed changes include
the addition of citations to the National Archives and Records Administration General Records Schedules which govern
the retention and disposition of employee records.The routine uses listed under system USDA/OIG-1, which
are basically the same for all systems and which were last published in 54 FR 39552, September 27, 1989, are proposed
to be condensed, consolidated, and reduced in number from 17 to 12. The proposed routine use changes, which are primarily
for clarification purposes, are as follows:



_The use providing for release of records to an entity to enable the entity to recover money or property of USDA (previously
numbered 14), and the use pertaining to release of records to a licensing agency where violations or potential violations
of licensing standards are indicated (previously numbered 16), would be incorporated with other enforcement type
releases under the routine use numbered 1.
_The use governing the release of records to contractors for debt collection purposes (previously numbered 17),
would be included as part of the routine use numbered 2 which covers the release of records to obtain information relevant
to an OIG decision.
_The use allowing release of records to another agency that is considering suspension or debarment action (previously
numbered 13), would become part of the routine use numbered 3 which generally pertains to the release of records to
another agency for use in hiring or licensing decisions.
_The use covering the release of records for use in a proceeding before a court or adjudicative body (previously numbered
6), would be combined with the routine use numbered 5 concerning release of records to the Department of Justice for
litigation purposes. Ad Hoc forums and administrative tribunals would also be added.
_The use pertaining to the disclosure of records to private contractors performing work for OIG (previously numbered
11) would be reworded to identify more precisely what the use covers and to include Privacy Act safeguards. It would
be renumbered as 9.

<TEXT>
 

_The use providing for the release of records pursuant to a grand jury subpoena or request (previously numbered 12),
is proposed to be revised to recognize the role of the cognizant U.S. Attorney and it would be renumbered as 11.



The other routine uses would remain basically the same as previously published except for the following changes in
the numbering sequence: routine uses previously numbered 7, 8, 9, and 15, would now be numbered 6, 7, 8, and 12, respectively.
Concerning USDA/OIG-2, ``Intelligence Records, USDA/OIG,'' the proposal would change the system name to
``Informant and Undercover Agent Records'' which represents a more descriptive title for the records contained
in the system. Also, to clarify the categories of individuals covered by the system, USDA/OIG proposes to delete subjects,
who are covered in USDA/OIG-3, and add confidential informants, investigative operatives, and undercover
OIG special agents or other law enforcement personnel. In addition, the proposal includes adding criminal histories
and undercover identification documents as categories of records in the system.
For USDA/OIG-3, ``Investigative Files and Subject/Title Index, USDA/OIG,'' the proposal would change the
system name to ``Investigative Files and Automated Investigative Indices System'' to reflect computerization
of part of the system. This proposed change from manually prepared index cards to an automated indices system is also
reflected throughout the system description. Concerning categories of individuals covered by the system, USDA/OIG
proposes to delete applicants for employment (who are covered under USDA/OIG-1), individuals whose names
have been checked through the system, and complainants who have requested anonymity or confidentiality regarding
their identity. The proposal also changes the retention period for records in this system from 15 years to 10 years
to bring it into line with the guidelines in the National Archives and Records Administration General Records Schedules.
In regard to the system numbered USDA/OIG-4, the system now called ``Liaison Records'' is being deleted because
these records are no longer maintained, and it is proposed to assign the number USDA/OIG 4 to ``OIG Hotline Complaint
Records,'' which records are proposed to be taken out of the ``Investigative Files'' system (USDA/OIG-3) and
set up as a separate system of records. OIG has a special staff just for the initial handling of incoming hotline complaints
and the volume of activity in this area is sufficient to justify a separate system. Also, not all complaints result
in investigations and in those instances there would not be an investigative file as such. In addition, this would
be of assistance to individual complainants in that OIG would be able to respond more quickly to followup requests
from individuals as to the status or disposition of their complaints. This record system would be exempt from certain
provisions of the Privacy Act just as the hotline records are currently exempt under system USDA/OIG-3.
For USDA/OIG-5, ``Management Information and Data Analysis System, USDA/OIG,'' the proposal would change
the name of the system to ``Consolidated Assignments, Personnel Tracking, and Administrative Information Network
(CAPTAIN),'' to reflect an update of this computerized data base system. The proposal also includes changes in various
data elements of the system so that they accurately reflect the information in these updated automated records. The
routine uses are basically the same as in the previous system.
Concerning the system numbered USDA/OIG-6, the proposal is to eliminate the system now called ``Audit Information
System'' because these records are no longer maintained in such a manner that they can be retrieved by individual name
or other individual identifier, and then reassign the number USDA/OIG-6 to the ``Training Tracking System,''
which records will be separated from the ``Employee Records'' system (USDA/OIG-1). The majority of employee
training records will still remain part of the ``Employee Records'' system. The proposed system is only for tracking
OIG audit employee training. This separate computerized system is needed because of the complex continuing education
requirements for auditors. For instance, General Accounting Office Government Auditing Standards require that
every 2 years auditors complete 80 hours of training contributing to their professional proficiency, of which at
least 20 hours of the training should be completed in any 1 year, and for auditors working on Government audits, at least
24 of the 80 hours should be directly related to Government auditing. The data elements in this system are similar to
those in ``Employee Records'' except that a routine use has been added concerning the furnishing of records to a Federal
agency or professional organization if relevant to a determination of professional proficiency and compliance
with general qualification standards for Government auditing.

USDA/OIG-7, ``Freedom of Information Act and Privacy Act Request Records, USDA/OIG,'' is a proposed new system
covering requests from individuals, under either of the cited Acts, for OIG records. The volume of requests is such
that some form of control system is needed. This proposal would benefit both the agency and the individual by providing
a control mechanism for ensuring requests are acted upon and for determining the status of pending requests when necessary
to respond to a followup inquiry from a requester.
Accordingly, USDA hereby proposes to revise the full text of the OIG Systems of Records last published in full in 50
FR 50814, December 12, 1985, and amended in part in 54 FR 39552, September 27, 1989.
A Privacy Act Systems Report relating to these changes, required by 5 U.S.C. 552a(r), has been sent to the Committee
on Government Operations of the House of Representatives, the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate, and
the Office of Management and Budget.

USDA/OIG-3



System name:




Investigative Files and Automated Investigative Indices System, USDA/OIG.


System location:




Physical files are kept in the OIG headquarters office in the Agriculture Administration Building, 14th Street and
Independence Avenue SW, Washington, DC 20250-2307, and in the OIG regional offices and Investigations suboffices
listed in the system of records designated USDA/OIG-1.



The OIG regional offices and Investigations suboffices maintain physical files containing the report of investigation
and the workpapers for each case investigated by that office. The headquarters files contain a copy of every investigative
report, but no workpapers and not necessarily the copies of all correspondence in all cases. Older investigative
files may be stored in Federal Records Centers or on microfiche, microfilm, or electronic image filing systems. Therefore,
delays in retrieving this material can be expected.

Selected portions of records have been computerized_see section 1 of ``Categories of records'' below. These records,
used as a research tool, are accessible by computer terminals located in each OIG office. These records are maintained
on a computer in the Agriculture Administration Building.



Categories of Individuals covered by the system:




The individual names in the OIG index fall into one or more of the following categories:



Subjects.

 These are individuals against whom allegations of wrongdoing have been made. In some instances, these individuals
have been the subjects of investigations conducted by OIG to establish whether allegations were true. In other instances,
the allegations were deemed too frivolous or indefinite to warrant inquiry.




Principals.

 These are individuals who are not named subjects of investigative inquiries, but may be responsible for potential
violations. For example, the responsible officers of a firm alleged to have violated laws or regulations might be
individually listed in the OIG index.

Complainants.

 These are individuals, who have not requested anonymity or confidentiality regarding their identity, who allege
wrongdoing, mismanagement, or unfair treatment relating to USDA employees and/or programs.


Others.

 These are all other individuals closely connected with a matter of investigative interest.


Categories of records in the system:


The OIG Investigative Files and Automated Investigative Indices System consist of:
1. Computerized records searchable by case number or alphabetically by the names of individuals, organizations,
and firms, with a separate record for each containing, if applicable, identification of the OIG file or files which
contain information on that subject, and if such information was available when the record was created or modified,
the individual's name, address, sex, race, date and place of birth, relationship to the investigation, FBI or State
criminal identification number, and social security number (very few have the dates when entries were made into the
index);
2. Files containing sheets of paper or microfiche of such sheets from investigative and other reports, correspondence,
and informal notes and notations concerning (a) one investigative matter or (b) a number of incidents of the same sort
of alleged violation or irregularity; and 
3. Where an investigation is being or will be conducted, but has not been completed, various case management records,
investigator's notes, statements of witnesses, and copies of records. These are contained on cards and sheets of
paper located in an OIG office or in the possession of the OIG investigator. Certain management records are retained
after the investigative report is released as a means of following action taken on the basis of the OIG investigative
report.

<DOCTITLE>Opportunity to Comment on Development of Long-Term Strategy for Management of Anadromous Fish-Producing Watersheds
in California</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Forest Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice; opportunity for public comment.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The USDA Forest Service (FS) (lead agency) and the USDI Bureau of Land Management (BLM) (cooperating agency) will
develop and implement a long-term strategy for management of anadromous fish-producing watersheds in California.
The objective of the strategy is to maintain and restore ecological functions and processes that create good habitat
for Pacific salmon and steelhead trout. The area to be addressed includes portions of Mill, Deer, and Antelope Creek
watersheds managed by the Lassen National Forest; portions of nine watersheds managed by the Los Padres National
Forest; portions of the Redding Resource Area, Ukiah District, of the BLM; and portions of the Carmel River Watershed
in the Hollister Resource Area, Bakersfield District, of the BLM. Areas managed by the FS and BLM already implementing
direction from the President's Forest Plan for the Pacific Northwest are not included because long-term management
direction for anadromous fish-producing watersheds is already provided. The Mendocino, Shasta-Trinity, Klamath,
and Six Rivers National Forests and other areas managed by the FS and BLM within the range of the northern spotted owl
are therefore excluded. The geographic area to be addressed is that covered by PACFISH interim management direction
for anadromous fish-producing watersheds in California. (PACFISH refers to the proposed interim management strategy
analyzed in the Environmental Assessment for the Implementation of Interim Strategies for Managing Anadromous
Fish-producing Watersheds in Eastern Oregon and Washington, Idaho, and portions of California (PACFISH EA)).



Preliminary review indicates that implementation of FS land and resource management plans and BLM resource management
plans for the affected areas already provides protection of anadromous fish habitat. However, the adequacy of those
plans and consistency among plans and between the FS and BLM is being reviewed in light of information developed for
the PACFISH EA. The analysis conducted for the PACFISH EA indicates that implementation of PACFISH will have minor
environmental effects in California because of the relatively small size, discontiguous, and geographically dispersed
ownership pattern of the affected FS and BLM administered lands, and because of the protection already afforded by
the implementation of existing management plans.

The PACFISH interim management strategy is intended to arrest degradation of riparian and aquatic habitat and initiate
ecosystem recovery across four western States while long term strategies are prepared. In addition to the relatively
small area in California, the interim strategy also covers an extensive area of FS and BLM administered lands in Oregon,
Washington, and Idaho. Long-term strategies for the management of anadromous fish-producing watersheds will be
developed for those areas within the context of the Eastside Ecosystem Management Project and the Upper Columbia
River Basin Project.

For the development of a long-term management strategy in California, this comment process will be used by the FS and
BLM to help determine whether existing management plans (with or without the addition of PACFISH interim direction)
adequately protect anadromous fish habitat; what, if any, additional issues need to be addressed; the appropriate
level of National Environmental Policy Act analysis for the development of such a strategy; and the level of interagency
coordination necessary to insure a consistent approach to management on FS and BLM administered lands in California.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Pacific salmon and steelhead trout occur naturally from southern California northward to the Arctic Ocean. These
fish populations comprise a large number of stocks, or populations that originate from specific watersheds during
specific times of year as juveniles, migrate to the ocean, and generally return to reproduce in their natal watersheds.
Of the more than 400 stocks from California, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington recently evaluated in a report published
by the American Fisheries Society, 106 were found to be extinct, 214 were considered to be at ``moderate'' or ``high''
risk of extinction or of ``special concern,'' and about 120 were considered ``secure.''.

The analysis conducted for the PACFISH EA indicates that implementation of the interim management will have minor
environmental effects in California because of the relatively small size, discontinuous, and geographically dispersed
ownership pattern of the affected BLM and FS administered lands, and because of the protection already afforded by
the implementation of existing management plans. Details follow.



Lassen National Forest_Mill, Deer, and Antelope Creek Watersheds 



The existing Lassen National Forest Plan includes direction for protection and improvement of anadromous fish habitat.
Three anadromous fish-producing watersheds exist on the Forest: Mill, Deer, and Antelope Creeks. Along most of their
lengths, these creeks are managed as proposed Wild and Scenic Rivers under the existing forest plan Outside the Wild
and Scenic River corridors established by the plan, watershed disturbance is limited by other standards and guidelines
established by the plan. All lands in and adjacent to lakes, streams, ephemeral and perennial wetlands, bogs, seeps,
and pothole lakes are assigned the riparian/fish prescription. Activities within riparian zones are limited to
those that enhance riparian objectives. Final widths of reiparian zones are set following site-specific evaluation.
The forest plans directs preparation of detailed anadromous fish and Wild and Scenic River management plans following
site-specific analyses. Other prescriptions that limit watershed disturbance include primitive recreation,
late-successional, research natural area, and existing and proposed Wilderness.

In addition, the Lassen National Forest Plan will be amended by the California Spotted Owl EIS that is under preparation
for the ten national forests in the Sierran province. Alternatives considered in that EIS include enhanced riparian
standards and guidelines, with special provisions for the anadromous fish-producing watersheds on the Lassen.
The standards and guidelines are based on the Aquatic Conservation Strategy in the President's Forest Plan for the
Pacific Northwest, and on the proposed PACFISH interim management direction. A decision on this EIS is expected in
1995. The alternative selected may further limit disturbance in anadromous fish-producing watersheds.



Los Padres National Forest_Mine Coastal Watershed Areas



The existing Los Padres National Forest Plan includes direction for protection and improvement of anadromous fish
habitat. The forest has developed a Riparian Conservation Strategy to aid in implementation of the forest plan direction.
Standards and guidelines for watershed protection and programs for in-stream habitat improvements and prescribed
fire for chaparral management are included in the plan. Wildfires in chaparral and riparian woodlands are identified
in the plan as having the greatest effect on anadromous fish habitat. Scheduled timber harvest is not permitted under
the plan (the allowable sale quantity is zero).



BLM_Redding and Hollister Resources Areas



In California, BLM manages two areas with anadromous fish-producing watersheds outside the area implementing the
President's Forest Plan for the Pacific Northwest. BLM has reviewed the current resource management plans (RMPs)
for the Redding Resource Area, Ukiah District, and the Hollister Resource Area, Bakersfield District, and has determined
that PACFIAH interim management direction is in conformance with the existing plans.

The Redding Resource Area includes about 24 miles in scattered parcels along the Upper Sacramento River and tributaries,
including Battle, Clear, Deer, and Paynes Creeks. The enhancement of anadromous fisheries is identified as an objective
in the Redding RMP.

The Hollister Resource Area includes a parcel of approximately 1300 acres of upland area within an andromous fish-producing
watershed in the upper Carmel River drainage. The Hollister RMP identifies watershed enhancement as a major land
use objective.

Elements of the PACFISH interim management, including interim Riparian Management Objectives and Riparian Habitat
Conservation Area widths, may need to be refined for long-term management, in light of specific conditions in California.

Written comments from the public on this analysis should be submitted as indicated at the beginning of this notice.
Comments would be most useful if sent by the date specified and if they address clearly the proposed action: development
and implementation of a long-term strategy for the management of anadromous fish-producing watersheds on FS and
BLM administered lands in California, outside areas implementing the President's Forest Plan for the Pacific Northwest.
Alternatives that may be considered include continuation of existing management direction for the affected national
forests and BLM resource areas; integration of PACFISH interim management with features of existing plans that provide
equal or greater long-term protection of anadromous fish habitat; and application of the Aquatic Conservation Strategy
from the President's Forest Plan for the Pacific Northwest in all anadromous fish-producing watersheds of the Lassen
National Forest and Redding Resource Area. The analysis of public comments and review of existing management plans
could reaffirm the adequacy of existing plan direction, or it could lead to amendment of those plans, documented with
one or more environmental analyses. If more than one analysis is conducted, they may be structured by unit, by agency,
or by geography. For example, two joint FS/BLM analyses might be conducted_one for portions of the Lassen National
Forest and Redding Resources Area, and another for portions of the Los Padres National Forest and Hollister Resource
Area. A decision on the nature, scope, and structure of the analysis necessary for long-term management is expected
by April 1995.

The responsible official for the FS is G. Lynn Sprague, Regional Forester, 630 Sansome Street, San Francisco, CA 94111,
The responsible official for the BLM is ED Hastey, State Director, 2800 Cottage Way, Sacramento, CA 95825.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On May 24, 1994, 59 FR Part VI, the Department announced the availability of federal grant funds under the CABNIS program
and its intention to select non-profit organizations to participate as grantees under the program. The Department
of Commerce has selected three additional applicants to receive federal funding under the Consortia of American
Businesses in the Newly Independent States (CABNIS) initiative. Each of the three selected applicants is a non-profit
consortium created to help for-profit U.S. member companies do business and enhance private sector development
in the independent states formed since the breakup of the Soviet Union. The grantees will be required to match federal
funding. The grantees will use CABNIS seed money over a three year period to form and nurture U.S. business consortia
of for-profit firms interested in doing business in the Newly Independent States, and establish and operate consortia
offices in the region. The three new grantees are the American Agribusiness Equipment Consortium, Alexandria, VA;
Partners In Economic Reform, Washington, DC; and Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The purpose of this notice is to announce that the Secretary of Commerce has approved a new standard, which will be published
as FIPS Publication 189, Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX)_Part 2: Shell and Utilities. This standard
adopts the International Standard ISO/IEC 9945-2:1993, Information Technology_Portable Operating System
Interface (POSIX)_Part 2: Shell and Utilities, which defines a command language interpreter (shell) and a set of
utility programs. On January 28, 1994 (59 FR 4034) and February 17, 1994 (59 FR 8041), notices were published in the


Federal Register

 that a Federal Information Processing Standard for Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX)_Part 2: Shell and
Utilities was being proposed for Federal use.



NIST reviewed written comments submitted by interested parties and other available material. On the basis of this
review, NIST recommended that the Secretary approve the standard as a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS),
and prepared a detailed justification document for the Secretary's review in support of that recommendation.

The detailed justification document which was presented to the Secretary, and which includes an analysis of the written
comments received, is part of the public record and is available for inspection and copying in the Department's Central
Reference and Records Inspection Facility, Room 6020, Herbert C. Hoover Building, 14th Street between Pennsylvania
and Constitution Avenues NW., Washington, DC 20230.

This FIPS contains two sections: (1) An announcement section, which provides information concerning the applicability,
implementation, and maintenance of the standard; and (2) a specifications section, which deals with the technical
requirements of the standard. Only the announcement section of the standard is provided in this notice.

Objectives. This FIPS permits Federal departments and agencies to exercise more effective control over the production,
management, and use of the Government's information resources. The primary objectives of this FIPS are:

a. To promote portability of computer application programs at the source code level, thus reducing staff hours required
to tailor computer programs for different vendor systems and architectures.

b. To simplify computer program documentation by the use of a standard portable system interface design. 

c. To increase portability of acquired skills, allowing people to operate a wide range of application platform implementations
without additional training or study, resulting in reduced personnel training costs.

d. To maximize the return on investment in generating or purchasing computer programs by insuring operating system
compatibility.

Government-wide attainment of the above objectives depends upon the widespread availability and use of comprehensive
and precise standard specifications.

Applicability. This FIPS shall be used for POSIX command language interpreters and utilities that are either developed
or acquired for Government use. This FIPS is applicable to the entire range of computer hardware, including:

a. Notebooks and Subnotebooks,
b. Laptops,
c. Micro-computer systems,
d. Mini-computer systems,
e. Workstations,
f. Mainframes,
g. Other systems that require POSIX-like command language interfaces.

Specificaitons. The FIPS PUB 189 specifications are the specifications contained in the International Standard
ISO/IEC 9945-2:1993, Information Technology_Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX)_Part 2: Shell
and Utilities, with the modifications specified below. ISO/IEC 9945-2:1993 defines a command language interpreter
(shell) and a set of utility programs. ISO/IEC 9945-2:1993 (hereinafter referred to as POSIX.2) refers to and
is a complement to ISO/IEC 9945-1, Information Technology_Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX)_Part
1: System Application Program Interface (API) [C Language].

POSIX.2 contains a number of features that are labelled obsolescent. These features violate the general syntactic
guidelines of POSIX.2. They were included in POSIX.2 to provide upward compatibility of existing applications,
and may be deleted from POSIX.2 at some future date. The POSIX.2 standard requires that strictly conforming applications
do not use any of these features. It is strongly recommended that agencies that require the POSIX.2 FIPS prohibit users
from using these features in the development of new applications. Therefore, the following obsolescent features
are not required for a system to be the associated POSIX.2 FIPS. (For each feature a reference to the associated POSIX.2

Recommendations



Users of this standard should be aware that it does not require the Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX)_Part
2: Shell and Utilities to be implemented on a FIPS 151-2 conforming implementation. Users should also be aware
that certain utilities and functions are optional in ISO/IEC 9945-2:1993. To provide the greatest support
for application portability, it is recommended that an implementation conforming to this FIPS also provide the following
features:

1. User Portability Utilities Option (POSIX2

X

UPE, POSIX.2 Section 5) and Full Terminal Operations Option (POSIX2

X

CHAR

X

TERM, POSIX.2 Section 2.14).
2. A FIPS 151-2 conforming operating system interference.
3. Software Development Utilities Option (POSIX2

X

SW

X

DEV, POSIX.2 Section 6), when software will be developed or source-level software will be installed on the systems
being acquired
4. C-Language Development Utilities Option (POSIX2

X

C

X

DEV, POSIX.2 Annex A), when software written in the C language will be developed or installed on the systems being acquired.
5. C-Language Bindings Option (POSIX2

X

C

X

BIND, POSIX.2 Annex B), when software written in the C language will be used on the systems being acquired.
6. FORTRAN Development Utilities Option (POSIX2

X

FORT

X

DEV, POSTIX.2 Annex C), when software written in FORTRAN will be developed or installed on the systems being acquired.

7. FORTRAN Runtime Utilities Option (POSIX2

X

FORT

X

RUN, POSIX.2 Annex C), when FORTRAN software will be used on the systems being acquired.

Furthermore, it is strongly recommended that Federal users require Feature 1 and, in addition, ensure that purchased
systems are capable of supporting Features 2-5, listed above. Even when these features are not needed at the
time of initial purchase, changed requirements may demand some or all of these in the future, either for the development
of new applications, for the importing of applications from other systems, or to maximize compatibility among multiple
in-house systems.

Implementation. This standard becomes effective April 3, 1995. This standard is compulsory and binding for use in
all solicitations and contracts for new operating systems and/or applications development where POSIX shell and
utility interfaces are required.

a. Acquisition of Conforming Portable Shell and Utilities. Organizations developing applications which are to
be acquired after the publication date of this standard and which have applications portability as a requirement
should consider the use of this FIPS. Conformance to this FIPS should be considered whether the operating system enviornments
are:
1. developed internally,
2. acquired as part of an ADP system procurement,

3. acquired by separate procurement,

4. used under an ADP leasing arrangement, or

5. specified for use in contracts for programming services.

b. Interpretation of the FIPS for Shell and Utilities. NIST provides for the resolution of questions regarding the
FIPS specifications and requirements, and issues official interpretations as needed. All questions about the interpretation
of this FIPS should be addressed to: Director, National Computer Systems Laboratory, Attn: POSIX Shell and Utilities
FIPS Interpretation, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899.

c. Validation of Conforming Operating Systems Environments. NIST is developing cooperatively with industry a validation
suite for measuring conformance to this standard. This suite will be required for testing conformance of POSIX Shell
and Utilities implementations. These testing requirements will be announced at a future date.



Waivers.



Under certain exceptional circumstances, the heads of Federal departments and agencies may approve waivers to Federal
Information Processing Standards (FIPS). The head of such agency may redelegate such authority only to a senior official
designated pursuant to section 3506(b) of Title 44, U.S. Code. Waivers shall be granted only when:

a. Compliance with a standard would adversely affect the accomplishment of the mission of an operator of a Federal
computer system, or

b. Cause a major adverse financial impact on the operator which is not offset by Governmentwide savings.

Agency heads may act upon a written waiver request containing the information detailed above. Agency heads may also
act without a written waiver request when they determine that conditions for meeting the standard cannot be met. Agency
heads may approve waivers only by a written decision which explains the basis on which the agency head made the required
finding(s). A copy of each such decision, with procurement sensitive or classified portions clearly identified,
shall be sent to: National Institute of Standards and Technology; ATTN: FIPS Waiver Decisions, Technology Building,
Room B-154; Gaithersburg, MD 20899.

In addition, notice of each waiver granted and each delegation of authority to approve waivers shall be sent promptly
to the Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Governmental Affairs
of the Senate and shall be published promptly in the 

Federal Register.



When the determination on a waiver applies to the procurement of equipment and/or services, a notice of the waiver
determination must be published in the 

Commerce Business Daily

 as a part of the notice of solicitation for offers of an acquisition or, if the waiver determination is made after that
notice is published, by amendment to such notice.

A copy of the waiver, any supporting documents, the document approving the waiver and any supporting and accompanying
documents, with such deletions as the agency is authorized and decides to make under 5 U.S.C. Sec. 552(b), shall be
part of the procurement documentation and retained by the agency.




Where to Obtain Copies:

 Copies of this publication are for sale by the National Technical Information Service, U.S. Department of Commerce,
Springfield, VA 22161. (Sale of the included specifications document is by arrangement with the Institute of Electrical
and Electronics Engineers, Incorporated.) When ordering, refer to Federal Information Processing Standards Publication
189 (FIPSPUB189), and title. Payment may be made by check, money order, or deposit account.



Appendix A_Application Portability Profile



FIPS 189 is the second component of a series of specifications needed for the operating system services area of an applications
portability profile. FIPS 151-1 (and its replacement, FIPS 151-2) provided the crucial first step by
providing vendor independent interface specification between an application program and an operating system.
When fully extended, POSIX will provide the functionality required to support source code portability for a wide
range of applications across many different machines and operating systems.

NIST has published Special Publication 500-210, Application Portability Profile (APP), The U.S. Government's
Open System Environment Profile, OSE/1, Version 2.0, June 1993. The APP has been developed to provide sufficient
functionality to accommodate a broad range of application requirements. The functional components of the APP constitute
a framework for organizing standard elements that can be used to develop and maintain portable applications. A key
aspect of the APP is that it is based on an open system environment defined by non-proprietary specifications. Components
may be added or deleted as technology changes and as Federal government requirements change.

shipboard surveys. The study area is off the California coast where the marine mammal fauna is diverse and abundant,
with seasonality of occurrence for many species. The primary objectives are to determine the general ecology and
behavior of marine mammals off California, and secondarily, determine the effects of the Acoustic Thermometry of
Oceanic Climate Project (ATOC) signals on the ecology and behavior of marine mammals. The applicants are not seeking
a permit to take marine mammals using ATOC-type sounds but to study the ecology and behavior of marine mammals using
various methodologies and while studying the effects of a sound source.

West Coast Salmon Fisheries; Northwest Emergency Assistance Plan


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of program for financial assistance.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

NMFS establishes a program, the Northwest Emergency Assistance Plan (NEAP), that will provide $12 million of assistance
to salmon fishermen in the Pacific Northwest who have been affected by a fishery resource disaster during 1992 through
1994, while providing conservation benefits to salmon resources. These disaster relief funds, which were made available
under the Interjurisdictional Fisheries Act (IFA), will be applied toward the following three programs, administered
by the following intermediaries: A vessel permit buyout program_Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife; and
a habitat restoration jobs program_Soil Conservation Services (SCS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA);
and a data collection jobs program_Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission (PSMFC). The intent is to provide
assistance to those commercial fishermen who have recently participated in the salmon fisheries, who were substantially
reliant on West Coast salmon resources for their income, and who suffered an uninsured loss as a result of a significant
reduction in income because of the resource disaster. The intent is also to provide this assistance in a manner likely
to contribute to conservation/restoration efforts for salmon.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background


On May 26, 1994, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) declared a fishery disaster and, with the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB), announced a $15.7 million emergency aid package for Oregon, Washington, and northern California.
This aid is intended to alleviate the economic hardship suffered by individuals and communities because of the collapse
of salmon stocks in fishing areas along the Northwest coast. Included in this package is $12 million available under
the section 308(d) of the Interjurisdictional Fisheries Act of 1986, 16 U.S.C. 4107(d), to undertake the NEAP program,
as described in this notice.
In addition, $3 million is being administered by the Rural Development Administration (RDA) of USDA. Grants by RDA
will be made to public bodies and private nonprofit corporations to finance development of small business enterprises
in cities under 50,000 in population. The Economic Development Administration (EDA) of the Department of Commerce
is making $882,000 available, instead of the $700,000 originally announced as part of the $15.7 million aid package.
Grants by EDA have been earmarked to communities for tourism development and to tribes for stream reclamation.
In addition to the $15.7 million package, aid to salmon fishermen is also being provided by the Small Business Administration
and the Farmers Home Administration, in the form of loans and debt restructuring programs, and by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) and the Department of Labor (DOL) in the form of unemployment assistance, up to $14 million,
to dislocated Washington, Oregon, and California fishermen who are unemployed as a direct result of the continuing
effects of El Ni&ntilde;o on salmon fishing.
On behalf of the Secretary, NMFS published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) on June 3, 1994 (59 FR 28838),
to solicit public comment on issues to be considered in development and implementation of the $12 million NEAP program.
In addition to the ANPR, NOAA's Office of Sustainable Development and Intergovernmental Affairs arranged a series
of eight town meetings designed to gather information about the effects of the decline in the salmon resources on local
communities and fishermen. A notice of the proposed program, which included responses to comments received on the
ANPR, was published on September 7, 1994 (59 FR 46224). Comments received in response to that notice are summarized
and responded to in this document.

Fishery Resource Disaster



Although West Coast (Washington, Oregon, and California) salmon stocks experience annual fluctuations in abundance,
stock abundances in the last few years have been exceptionally low. West Coast salmon species are coho, chinook, chum,
sockeye, and pink salmon. Landings of chinook and coho, have declined significantly, from roughly 6.2 million fish
in 1988 to 2 million fish in 1993. Chinook salmon fisheries in the ocean waters off Washington and Oregon north of Cape
Falcon were closed in 1994 by the Federal Government. Other salmon fisheries in the ocean waters off central and southern
Oregon and northern California are at reduced levels and are closed to fishing for coho. Additional information regarding
the declines in chinook and coho can be found in the ANPR and the notice of the proposed program, and is not repeated here.

Despite increasingly stringent management measures enacted in recent years to protect these salmon stocks, they
have reached a critical stage of depletion, due in part to environmental conditions unfavorable to salmon survival
that include: (1) An extended drought in California, in combination with the already depressed condition of northern
California stocks; (2) less than normal snowpack throughout the western United States; (3) drought followed by extensive
flooding in the State of Washington; and (4) poor upwelling, due to an extreme El Ni&ntilde;o ocean warming event during
1992-1993, all of which are believed to have been responsible for extremely poor salmon survival.



Comments and Responses



During the comment period, thirty-three comment letters were received including several that had multiple signatures.
Almost all of the comments were from Oregon and California. Almost all comments recommended the need for direct grants
while the majority of comments were recommending reduction in the total Washington State targeted-state distribution
and for elimination of the Washington State permit buyout program. Other major comment areas concerned loosening
of the eligibility criteria, and recommendations for improvements in the Habitat Restoration and the Data Collection
Jobs Programs.



Direct Assistance to Impacted Salmon Fishermen





Comment: 

Many respondents requested that direct assistance be provided to eligible salmon fishermen for a variety of needs
including family related expenses and vessel maintenance and moorage.



Response: 

NOAA has decided not to provide direct assistance to impacted salmon fishermen for a number of reasons. Direct aid
is inconsistent with other Federal actions such as the aid granted to distressed New England fishermen or to distressed
Northwest timber workers. DOL Disaster Unemployment Assistance is available in all three states. Special administrative
mechanisms would need to be established which would slow relief and increase administrative expense. Another key
consideration is that direct aid, unlike the jobs and permit buyout programs, would do little to improve the prospects
for an overcapitalized salmon fishery.



State Funding Targets



Comments were received concerning the state funding targets. Several comments acknowledged that Washington State
may have suffered the greatest impact but did not agree that Washington's share should be as high as 55 percent, particularly
if the share was based on information concerning the private recreational harvests and associated impacts. Alternative
suggestions were to divide the aid equally between the three states; to allocate 40 percent to Washington State and
30 percent each to the other states; or to base the allocations on the apportionment guidelines used for other purposes
under the IFA.



Comment: 

Targeted state distributions between the states should be changed.



Response: 

After careful review of such factors as potential salmon fishing employment, commercial revenues and recreational
expenditures, NOAA has chosen to maintain the state funding targets at 55 percent to Washington, 22.5 percent to the
Oregon, and 22.5 percent to California as proposed. These percentages are established as targets that allow some
flexibility and not as rigid allocations, since no data can conclusively apportion the relative economic impact
among the three states.

Eligibility Requirements



The proposal identified eligibility criteria for participation in both the jobs programs and the permit buyout program.
Under the proposal for the buyout program, the commercial fisherman would have been required to demonstrate that
he/she suffered a loss between a selected base year and 1992 or 1993. Under the proposal for the jobs programs, the commercial
fisherman would have been required to show that: At least 50 percent of his/her income in the base year was derived from
fishing, he/she fished in either 1992 or 1993, his/her income declined by at least 50 percent between the base year
and 1992 or 1993, and his/her 1993 gross income must be no more than $25,000 for individuals or $50,000 in combined spousal
income (husband's plus wife's). Several comments and suggestions sought relaxation of the eligibility criteria,
thereby enlarging the pool of eligible participants.



Comment:

 Several commenters suggested that NMFS should expand the years for comparison to determine loss. Currently, the
commercial fisherman selects a base year from 1986-1989 and compares fishery income to either 1992 or 1993.
Expanding the possible base years to include 1990 and the possible comparison years to include 1994 would broaden
the number of participants eligible for the programs.



Response:

 NMFS has made changes in how NEAP eligibility and uninsured losses are determined to give added opportunity for participation
by fishermen. Fishermen can use 1991 and 1994 in addition to 1992 and 1993 as years to establish eligibility with respect
to earning commercial fisheries income. For calculating the amount of uninsured loss, 1990 can be used as a base year
and 1994 can be used as a comparison year. If a fisherman had commercial fisheries income in 1991, but none in 1992 through
1994, income for the comparison year can be zero.



Comment:

 Decrease the percentage of base year fishery income necessary to qualify for the jobs programs.



Response:

 Under the proposal, the commercial fisherman must show that at least 50 percent of his/her income is derived from fishing
in the selected base year. Suggestions were made to reduce this to 40 percent. Because of limited funds, the purpose
of using 50 percent is to capture individuals who depended on fishing for a majority of their income.



Comment:

 Modify the gross income requirements for the jobs programs.



Response:

 Under the current proposal, if single, the applicant's 1993 gross income must have been less than $25,000 and if married
the 1993 gross combined income of the applicant and his/her spouse must have been less than $50,000. There is a suggestion
to increase the $25,000 level to $40,000. Maintaining this $25,000 cap is expected to assist the neediest fishermen
and will allow for a sufficient pool of applicants.



Comment:

 Apply eligibility criteria equally to all programs.



Response:

 Under the current proposal, to qualify for the permit buyout program an individual need only show an uninsured loss.
To qualify for the jobs programs, however, an individual must meet additional criteria. Extending the jobs' criteria
to the buyout program would exacerbate the administrative complexities of the program. It could possibly lead to
more funds being absorbed in administrative costs and less funds going directly to fishermen. By reducing the number
of potential bidders under the buyout program, the additional criteria would tend to raise the price paid for each
permit and reduce the number of permits that could be purchased.



Habitat Restoration Jobs Program





Comment:

 Flexibility should be afforded to the habitat restoration jobs program to allow for broader types of activities.
Respondents suggested the following: pre-restoration stream surveys, post-restoration monitoring, public education,
and habitat protection.



Response:

 NMFS will provide flexibility to SCS to include a wider range of habitat related activities as part of this program.

Comment

: Priority should be given to those projects that include matching or in-kind contributions. 



Response

: NOAA will stipulate in the Interagency Agreement with SCS that greater consideration be given to those projects
that include a cost share/match or in-king contribution. 



Comment

: Funds provided to California for purposes of the habitat restoration jobs program should be divided equally between
the resource conservation districts and the Salmon Stamp Program. 



Response

: SCS will consider providing these funds to the California Association of Resource Conservation, which in turn will
award funds to Tribal organizations, conservation districts, state agencies and other organizations capable of
conducting habitat restoration work based on scientific merit and priority needs. 



Comment

: None of the NEAP money should be made available for the Columbia/Snake, Klamath/Trinity, or Central Valley watersheds,
because they have already received substantial Federal funds. Instead, funds should be directed to smaller but more
critical habitats. 



Response

: Currently almost all Federal funds spent to undertake habitat restoration projects in the named watersheds are
applied to projects on public lands. To complement these existing Federally funded activities, NOAA intends for
funds under this program to be used primarily for projects on private lands in the named watersheds. At the same time,
program funds may also be used to restore other critical watersheds. 



Comment

: A number of respondents expressed concerns that no specific criteria were identified to assess scientific merit
and/or need for individual habitat restoration jobs projects. Another respondent stated that projects should be
developed after a watershed analysis. Similarly, there were concerns that the habitat restoration jobs program
not overlap or duplicate other similar state and Federal projects undertaken as part of the Forest Plan. 



Response

: NMFS is working with SCS to develop a review process that evaluates the biological aspects of individual projects
and ensures the activities do not duplicate ongoing efforts. As deemed appropriate, a watershed analysis will be
required for projects. 



Comment

: Specific caps should be stipulated for the administrative costs associated with the habitat jobs restoration program.




Response: 

The Interagency Agreement between NOAA and SCS will stipulate that the cumulative administrative costs for the habitat
restoration jobs program not exceed 15%. 



Data Collection Jobs Program 





Comment

: Funds provide to the PSMFC should not be restricted by state allocation levels. All applicants, regardless of residence,
should compete openly for a single pool of funds.

Response:

 The PSMFC has the flexibility to deviate from the state allocation targets, if there is substantial justification.
State distribution targets are intended as guides rather than rigid allocations. Final state distributions may
differ from these targets.



Other





Comment:

 If the jobs programs are not available until spring, some fishermen will be participating in other fisheries, and
unable to participate in the program.



Response:

 The timing of many habitat restoration jobs will be limited by weather and biological considerations. It is intended
that the habitat restoration jobs program include a broader range of projects, which may provide for jobs during all
seasons.



Comment:

 The jobs programs are not structured to lead to permanent employment at a living wage. There is no long-term assistance
for training, placement, or business startup.



Response:

 The intent of the programs is to compensate fishermen for uninsured losses and not to provide long-term assistance
for other employment or business opportunities.



Comment:

 Salmon fishermen currently receiving unemployment funds and or Federally funded training should not be ineligible
to participate in the habitat restoration jobs program.



Response:

 Salmon fishermen receiving Federal unemployment funds or Federally funded training are not precluded from receiving
funds from NEAP. However, funds received for such purposes are considered compensation. The IFA provides that eligible
commercial fishermen may only receive 75% of their total uncompensated and uninsured loss, and may not receive in
excess of $100,000 in total Federal compensation.



Comment:

 Why are support industries and government entities ineligible for assistance?



Response:

 NOAA acknowledges that the closure of the salmon fishery negatively impacted the recreational support industries,
fish processing workers, and local governments. However, the IFA clearly provides that aid under this authority
will be made available only to commercial fishermen.



Comment:

 Why is this program taking so long to get started?



Response:

 Certain procedural steps must be undertaken to comply with the IFA and other applicable law. These steps include opportunity
for public notice and comment. Also the programs need to be designed and made operational. All three programs require
agreements with the administrative intermediaries who in turn must create programs and processes that comply with
the NEAP. All efforts are being undertaken to expedite the assistance. 



Comment:

 Because of the recent Sonoma County, California, FEMA disaster declaration, the geographic range of the jobs programs
needs to be expanded.



Response:

 The listing of counties was to serve as a means of illustration of the likely counties where projects are to take place.
The eligibility criteria do not require that fishermen must live in the county where the projects take place. Habitat
restoration projects are geographically limited to locations within close commuting distance of commercial fishermen
as defined under this action. However, for sake of completeness Sonoma County will be specifically mentioned as well
as the counties bordering on the tributaries of the Columbia River.



Changes From the Proposed Program



In response to comments, NMFS has made substantive changes to NEAP, from the proposed program, to provide added opportunity
and flexibility for participation by fishermen impact by the disaster. As noted in the response to comments, these
changes are: (1) Fishermen can use 1991 or 1994 in addition to 1992 or 1993 as years to establish eligibility with respect
to earning commercial fishing income; (2) fishermen can use 1990 as a base year and 1994 as a comparison year to calculate
the amount of uninsured loss; (3) charterboat permit holders are eligible for the buyout program at the discretion
of Washington State; and (4) the geographical range for habitat restoration projects has been expanded.



NEAP Program



I. Statutory Authority



Section 308(d) of the IFA, codified at 16 U.S.C. 4107(d), authorizes the Secretary to award grants to persons engaged
in commercial fisheries, for uninsured and uncompensated losses determined by the Secretary to have been suffered
as a direct result of a fishery resource disaster. Set forth below are the conditions and definitions established
by NOAA, pursuant to authority delegated by the Secretary, to implement the programs described in part III.

The IFA requires that ``the Secretary shall determine the extent, and the beginning and ending dates of any fishery
resource disaster'' (16 U.S.C. 4107)(d)(2)). Although there have been declining trends in landings from the salmon
fisheries in recent years, a sharp decline did not occur until after 1991. This sharp decline coincided with an extreme
El Ni&ntilde;o ocean warming event during 1992-1993. The 1994 season is the first season in which all ocean fisheries
for coho were closed; the projected chinook harvest for ocean fisheries indicates a new record low will be achieved,
eclipsing the previous record low in 1992. Therefore, for the purposes of the NEAP, the beginning and ending dates
of the fishery resource disaster are January 1, 1992, and December 31, 1994, respectively.

The extent of this disaster includes the waters and habitat associated with the salmon fisheries of northern California,
Oregon and Washington.

II. Definitions



For the purposes of the NEAP program:



Commercial fishermen

 are vessel owners, operators, or crews directly involved in the commercial fishery.



Commercial fishery

 is defined as the salmon fishery off the coasts and in the state waters of Washington, Oregon, and California for purposes
of either selling the salmon harvested or providing a vessel for hire that carries recreational fishermen to engage
in fishing for a fee (e.g., charterboats and headboats). Subsistence fisheries do not fall under this definition.



Commercial fishery income

 is earned income derived from participation in the commercial fishery.



Gross income

 includes all income received in the form of money, goods, property, and services that is not exempt from Federal income
tax.



Loss

 is defined as a loss of income not subject to Federal or state compensation and determined by a multi-step procedure,
as follows:

1. The applicant (commercial fisherman) selects a base year from the years 1986 through 1990.

2. The applicant determines his/her commercial fishery income from 1992, 1993, or 1994, and selects whichever year
commercial fisheries income was the highest. This is the comparison year. If an applicant had no commercial fisheries
income from 1992 to 1994, the amount for the comparison year is zero.

3. If the amount of the applicant's commercial fishery income, as selected in step 2 above, is less than the applicant's
commercial fishery income from the base year, then a loss has occurred. The amount of the annual loss is the difference
between the applicant's base year commercial fishery income and that from the comparison year selected in step 2 above.

4. The amount of the annual loss calculated in step 3 above is multiplied by three to determine the applicant's total
loss for the disaster period.




(

Note:

 The Federal assistance programs announced in this notice are limited to compensation to commercial fishermen for
uninsured losses that have not been addressed through compensation from other state or Federal programs.)






Salmon

 means chinook (king) salmon (

Oncorhynchus tshawytscha

), coho (silver) salmon (

Oncorhynchus kisutch

), pink (humpback) salmon (

Oncorhynchus gorbuscha

), chum (dog) salmon (

Oncorhynchus keta

), and sockeye (red) salmon (

Oncorhynchus nerka

).



III. Program Descriptions



A. Vessel Permit Buyout Program



This program is intended to compensate commercial fishermen for uninsured lost income and to aid the long-term viability
of the fishery resource by reducing fishing effort on the stocks.


</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941011-2-00032 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941011-2-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Only Washington State has indicated a strong interest in a buyout program and currently has a limited entry program
that meets the program requirements. Therefore, Washington State will function as the sole administrative intermediary.
However, if another state or tribal government entity has in place an appropriate limited-entry system and wants
to participate in the buyout program, NMFS will consider allowing buyouts of limited entry permits issued under appropriate
limited entry permit programs other than Washington State's. Washington State, in consultation with NMFS, shall
design a permit buyout program that is consistent with state and Federal management and grant regulations, including
a ``permit offer'' application that allows assessment of the uninsured, and otherwise uncompensated, loss of the
applicant, any receipt of benefits by the applicant from all other assistance programs associated with this disaster,
and the gross income of the applicant in 1993 (or, if married, the combined gross income of both spouses). The administrative
costs charged by Washington State shall be kept at a minimum; such costs should not exceed 7.5 percent of the total funds
distributed for this program.

Offers to sell gillnet or troll permits from commercial fishermen who participate under limited entry systems of
qualified government entities will be solicited by the State of Washington. (Qualified government entities are
those governments that administer limited-entry commercial salmon fisheries and can ensure that permits bought
out will not be replaced.) These commercial fishermen will need to demonstrate an uninsured, and otherwise uncompensated,
loss as a result of the fishery resource disaster, as defined for the purposes of NEAP.

Permits will be selected for buyout based on a sealed bid process. Starting with the lowest offers, permits will be
purchased until the funds are exhausted. Maximum purchase prices for these permits will be limited to amounts that
ensure that the offerer (commercial fisherman) will not be receiving total benefits from this and any other program
that exceed 75 percent of his or her uninsured, and otherwise uncompensated, commercial fishery loss resulting from
this fishery resource disaster, and in no case more than $100,000 per individual. The State of Washington, in consultation
with NMFS, will reserve the right to reject any and all bids.

This program was originally designed to be applied to the Washington State troll and gillnet fleets. However, Washington
State may elect to include the charterboat fleet. Fishermen may contact the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife
for updates on the development of this program. For more details about the buyout program, consult the September 7,
1994, notice of the proposed program.



B. Habitat Restoration Program 


The habitat restoration program will hire eligible commercial fishermen (i.e., those who suffered uninsured losses
as a result of the West Coast salmon fishery disaster), both tribal and non-tribal, at a ``living wage'' to perform
work that has a long-term beneficial impact on the habitat of the salmon. Generally, ``living wages'' are wages commensurate
with the prevailing rate for similar work conducted in a specific locality. Depending on the locality and the skills
required, living wage may range up to $10-15 per hour. The types of work fishermen may do under this program will
involve the operation of backhoes and skiploaders, and undertaking the necessary plantings of vegetation. Generally,
fishermen will need 1 to 2 days of training. Commercial fishermen who meet the eligibility criteria will be hired on
a first-come, first-served basis by contractors associated with projects that have been solicited and approved
by the administrative intermediary.

Habitat restoration projects are to take place in areas geographically accessible to displaced fishermen, which
include the coastal counties from Sonoma County, CA, to Whatcom County, WA; Clallam County, WA; and counties bordering
on Puget Sound or the Columbia River or its tributaries. If within commenting distance, projects can be undertaken
in other counties, if they contain habitat important to the salmon resources associated with the fishery resource
disaster.

NMFS intends to enter into an agreement with the SCS to serve as the administrative intermediary for the habitat restoration
program. A discussion of the rationale for choosing the SCS as the intermediary for this program can be found in the
September 7, 1994, notice of the proposed program.

The SCS will enter into agreements with the appropriate state conversation agency, conversation commission, or
association of conservation districts, which, in turn, will develop: A grant solicitation process, including guidelines
for making a grant application; a grant application review process; deadlines for grant applications; and a monitoring
and evaluation process. Each state conservation agency, conservation commission, or association of conservation
districts will develop agreements with state employment departments to establish a program to determine the eligibility
of commercial fishermen according to the criteria described elsewhere in this notice.

While it is NMFS' intention to make financial assistance available as soon as possible, it should be noted that, due
to weather, habitat considerations, and the need for project review, planning, and implementing, it is unlikely
that many fishermen will start receiving wages in this program prior to April 1, 1995. Every effort to expedite the
program will be made.



C. Data Collection Jobs Program 



NMFS has chosen the PSMFC as the administrative intermediary for the data jobs program in the three affected states.
NMFS has selected the PSMFC as the administrative intermediary because PSMFC goals, objectives, and organizational
structure coincide largely with the implementation needs of this program. The rationale for choosing the PSMFC as
the intermediary for this program is discussed in the September 7, 1994, notice of the proposed program.

The data collection program will provide jobs associated with collecting information or performing tasks that will
be of use to scientists and fishery managers. Under this program, eligible commercial fishermen, both tribal and
non-tribal, will be hired on a first-come, first-served basis, at a ``living wage,'' up to $10-15 per hour, to
perform various tasks by contractors associated with approved projects. Examples of these tasks include collecting
tissue samples for genetic research, measuring parameters of the ocean environment (temperature, upwelling, etc.),
performing baseline surveys of habitat, participating in test fisheries to determine ocean fish distribution,
and assisting hatchery technicians in collecting information or in improving hatchery operations. Commercial
fishing vessels may also be chartered to do research. For some tasks, as with the habitat restoration program, training
of fishermen will be required.

Proposals will be competitively solicited by the administrative intermediary from states, tribes, academia, and
industry or conservation organizations for projects to be considered under this data collection jobs program. These
proposals will be ranked according to criteria established in section IV of this notice. To ensure that this program
complements the habitat restoration program and does not duplicate other Federal assistance programs, representatives
from NMFS and SCS will be members of this review panel. Priority will be given to projects that provide the greatest
benefits to displaced fishermen; address the sustainability or rebuilding of anadromous species, especially threatened
or endangered salmon stocks; address Federal, Pacific Fishery Management Council, PSMFC, or state fishery research
needs; are based on sound scientific methodology; and have low administrative costs. Applicants must demonstrate
ability to manage and account for Federal funds. Matching funds or cost sharing are not required, but may be taken into
consideration during the final selection process. The timing of the actual employment of fishermen will depend on
the planning and proposal selection process, as well as the best seasons in which to undertake research.



IV. Eligibility Criteria



For purposes of the habitat restoration and data collection programs under NEAP, job applicants must meet all of the
following eligibility criteria to receive assistance:

1. The applicant must show an uninsured loss.

2. In the base year (1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, or 1990) used by the applicant in determining loss, the applicant must have
earned at least 50 percent of gross income from the commercial fishery.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941011-2-00034 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941011-2-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

3. The applicant must have earned commercial fishery income in 1991, 1992, 1993, or 1994.

4. The applicant's 1992, 1993, or 1994 commercial fishery income, whichever is greater, must have declined by at least
50 percent from the applicant's commercial fishery income from the base year selected. If an applicant had no commercial
fishery income in 1992-1994 and had commercial fishery income during a base year, this criterion is satisfied.

5. If single, the applicant's 1993 gross income must have been less than $25,000. If married, the applicant's 1993
gross combined income of the applicant and his/her spouse must have been less than $50,000.

No person may receive financial assistance under NEAP that exceeds 75 percent of any uninsured and otherwise uncompensated
commercial fishery loss resulting from the fishery resource disaster, and no person may receive more than $100,000
of Federal funds in the aggregate for all losses resulting from the disaster.

The intent of these criteria is to provide the available assistance to those commercial fishermen who have been most
heavily dependent on salmon fishing and who have suffered the greatest losses. In order to comply with the requirements
of the IFA, an uninsured loss must be shown. The second criterion is intended to determine those applicants that have
been dependent on the commercial fishery for most of their livelihood. The third criterion is intended to limit eligibility
to those who commercially fished during the disaster period. The final two criteria are intended to focus the available
financial assistance on those commercial fishermen who have suffered the greatest losses due to the disaster and
who do not have significant income from other sources.

In applying for any of the programs, a commercial fisherman will be required to submit documentation, including salary,
earnings, or crew-share statements and affidavits that demonstrate eligibility.

Discussion of the rationale for these criteria was provided in the notice of the proposed program and is not repeated
here.



V. Program and State Funding Targets



NMFS anticipates that the NEAP program will result in the following distribution of available financial assistance
among the affected states and programs: 55 percent of available funds will be distributed to the State of Washington
and 22.5 percent of available funds will be distributed to each of the States of Oregon and California. NMFS emphasizes
that these are ``target'' distributions, not fixed percentages, and are flexible; redistributions could be made,
if increased total benefits can be achieved.



Classification



This action has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866.

This action establishes a financial assistance program that will contain collection-of-information requirements
subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act. The necessary information collection forms and specific reporting requirements
have not been fully identified at this time, and will be developed in conjunction with the intermediaries administering
the program, and submitted to OMB for approval prior to implementation.

Because this notice establishes a program to address some of the immediate needs of salmon fishermen affected by the
resource disaster, there is good cause under section 553(d)(3) of the Administrative Procedure Act to make this notice
effective upon publication in the 

Federal Register

. Any delay in making this program effective will delay relief to those adversely affected by the disaster and, therefore,
delaying the effective date of this notice for 30 days in contrary to the public interest.

Missouri Basin Municipal Power Agency, et al; Electric Rate and Corporate Regulation Filings 


September 30, 1994. 


Take notice that the following filings have been made with the Commission: 


1. Missouri Basin Municipal Power Agency


[Docket No. IR-1096-001] 


Notice is hereby given that the Missouri Basin Municipal Power Agency (Missouri Basin) has filed on September 16,
1994, pursuant to Section 292.402 of the Commission's Regulations, a petition for waiver of certain obligations
imposed under Sections 292.303(a) and 292.303(b) of the Commission's Regulations (18 CFR Part 292, Subpart C) which
implement Section 210 of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA). Missouri Basin has duly implemented
the Commission's PURPA Regulations by filing a PURPA implementation plan on March 1, 1982. 
Missouri Basin requests a waiver on behalf of its 58 member municipalities located in the states of Iowa, Minnesota,
North Dakota and South Dakota (Members). Specifically, Missouri Basin seeks a waiver of the requirement contained
in 18 CFR 292.303(a) which would require these member electric cooperatives to purchase power made available from
any qualifying facility (QF) and of the obligation in 18 CFR 292.303(b) which would require Missouri Basin to make
sales to any QF. The applicant believes that purchases by the Members from QFs or sales by Missouri Basin to QFs are unnecessary

and regulating equipment owned and operated by Entex. 
Koch states that Entex proposes to add this delivery point to its existing firm transportation agreement with Koch.
Koch indicates that Entex estimates its peak day requirement at this delivery point would be 200 MMBtu. Koch states
that these facilities would not have an impact on Koch's curtailment plan since the proposed firm service is for a minor
peak day requirement and the level of firm service would remain within the certificated entitlement of service. Koch
states that it has sufficient capacity to render the proposed service without detriment or disadvantage to its other
existing customers and that its tariff does not prohibit the proposed modification of facilities.

Take notice that on September 22, 1994, CNG Transmission Corporation (CNG), 445 West Main Street, Clarksburg, West
Virginia 26301, Koch Gateway Pipeline Company (Gateway), filed in Docket No. CP94-795-000 an application

to construct new delivery facilities that would serve as an additional delivery point to National Fuel Gas Supply
Corporation (NFG Supply), under the blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82-537-000, all as more
fully set forth in the request on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. 
CNG states that NFG Supply currently transports local production gas to its affiliate, National Fuel Gas Distribution
(NFG Distribution), for distribution of approximately 325 consumers in the Village of Wilcox, in Jones Township,
Elk County, Pennsylvania. CNG further states that NFG Supply serves these consumers by utilizing CNG's B-5
and B-M7 lines. Because of the age and condition of these lines, and a declining supply, NFG Supply desires to
retire these lines. CNG proposes to construct a four-inch tap, measuring and regulation station and add approximately
150 feet of 4-inch connecting line from CNG's pipeline system near the Village of Wilcox. This would replace the gas
supply delivering it through the new facilities to NFG Supply so that NFG Distribution could continue serving its
consumers in Wilcox and vicinity. CNG states that the estimated cost of the construction is $124,596.00, and that
NFG Supply has agreed to reimburse CNG.

<DOCTITLE>East Tennessee Natural Gas Company; Notice of Proposed Changes in FERC Gas Tariff</DOCTITLE>






October 4, 1994.





Take notice that on September 30, 1994, East Tennessee Natural Gas Company (East Tennessee), tendered for filing
as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, Second Revised Volume No. 1, First Revised Sheets Nos. 50 through 57.




East Tennessee states that the purpose of this filing is to allow East Tennessee to provide an alternative no-notice
service to its shippers on a trial basis from November 1, 1994 through October 31, 1995. East Tennessee requests an
effective date for the above-referenced sheets of November 1, 1994.


East Tennessee states that the above-referenced tariff sheets represent East Tennessee's LMS-MA Rate Schedule,
which is used to provide balancing and no-notice service (DDS) to delivery point operators (Balancing Parties) on
the East Tennessee system. East Tennessee states that its customers have requested that it provide an alternative
no-notice service that allows customers to use their FS Storage and firm transportation on Tennessee Gas Pipeline
Company (Tennessee) for balancing purposes. East Tennessee states that its proposed alternative no-notice service
will meet this need.


Under the proposed revisions to the LMS-MA Rate Schedule, East Tennessee states that a Balancing Party has two
choices with respect to no-notice service. The Balancing Party may elect to use the currently authorized no-notice
service (DDS Option) or, if the Balancing Party has access to Tennessee's firm storage and transportation, the Balancing
Party may release such storage and associated transportation to East Tennessee, and elect the newly proposed Storage
Swing Option. Under the Storage Swing Option, East Tennessee will use the Balancing Party's Tennessee storage and
transportation to provide no-notice service. Any variance between the quantity of gas scheduled for delivery at
the Balancing Party's Delivery Point(s) and the actual quantity delivered Daily Variance), shall be treated as an
automatic injection into or withdrawal out of storage. East Tennessee will operate the storage contracts in such
a manner that a Balancing Party electing the Storage Swing Option can deviate from scheduled quantities by up to the
Maximum Daily Withdrawal Quantity assigned without incurring any Daily Variance Charges or imbalances under the
LMS-MA Rate Schedule.



East Tennessee states that it will not charge any administrative fee for this service but rather will bill the Balancing
Party that elects the Storage Swing Option the applicable rates under the Tennessee Agreements for storage and transportation
services, plus any applicable charges for firm transportation provided by East Tennessee, just as if the Balancing
Party had actually made the nominations for the storage service in advance.



East Tennessee requests that the revisions to the LMS-MA Rate Schedule that provide for the Storage Swing Option
remain in effect on a trial basis only until October 31, 1995. After one year of offering the Storage Swing Option, East
Tennessee shall have the option of continuing the storage swing option as currently proposed, revising and enhancing
the service to better meet customer needs, or discontinuing the Storage Swing Option if it proves unduly burdensome
to administer.


East Tennessee and Tennessee request that the Commission grant all waivers its deems necessary for acceptance of
this filing.




East Tennessee certifies that a copy of this cover letter has been mailed to all affected customers and state regulatory
commissions as shown on the service list.



Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said filing should file a petition to intervene
or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in
accordance with Sections 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, 18 CFR 385.211 and 385.214.
All such petitions or protests should be filed on or before October 12, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission
in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to this proceeding.
Any person wishing to become a party must file a petition to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file and available
for public inspection.

<DOCTITLE>Puget Power Sound and Light Company, Notice of Proposed Restricted Service List for a Memorandum of Agreement for
Managing Properties Included in or Eligible for Inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places</DOCTITLE>



October 4, 1994.



Rule 2010 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure provides that, to eliminate unnecessary expense or
improve administrative efficiency, the Secretary may establish a restricted service list for a particular phase
or issue in a proceeding (18 CFR 385.2010). The restricted service list should contain the names of persons on the service
list who, in the judgment of the decisional authority establishing the list, are active participants with respect
to the phase or issue in the proceeding for which the list is established.

The Commission is consulting with the Washington State Office of Archaeology and Historic Preservation (hereinafter,
``OAHP'') and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (hereinafter, ``Council'') pursuant to the Council's
regulations, 36 CFR part 800, implementing section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, as amended (16
U.S.C. 470f), to prepare a memorandum for managing historic properties_i.e., those included in, or eligible for
inclusion in, the National Register of Historic Places_that may be affected by a license issuing for Project No. 2493.

The MOA, when executed by the Commission, OAHP, and the Council, would satisfy the Commission's section 106 responsibilities
for all individual undertakings carried out in accordance with the license until the license expires or is terminated.

The Commission's responsibilities pursuant to section 106 for Project No. 2513 would be fulfilled through one MOA
which the Commission proposes to draft in consultation with certain parties listed below. The executed MOA would
be incorporated into any order issuing license.

Thus, we propose, as an initial consideration, to restrict the service list to OAHP and the Council, with whom we propose
to execute the MOA. Puget Power Sound and Light Company, moreover, as prospective licensee for Project No. 2493, and
various Native American groups are invited to participate in consultations to develop the MOA and to sign it as a concurring
party. Our proposed restricted service list for executing MOA for Project No. 2493, follows:




Dr. Edwin Slatter, FERC Office of Hydropower Licensing, Union Center Plaza, Room 1069, 810 First Street NE., Washington,
DC 20001

Ms. Claudia Nissley, Director, Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, 730 Simms Street,

The Snoqualmie Indians, Attn: Mr. Ron Lauzon, 18933_59th Avenue NE., Suite 114, Arlington, WA 98223.




Any person on the official service list for the above-captioned proceedings may request inclusion on the restricted
service list, or may request that a restricted service list not be established, by filing a motion to that effect within
15 days of this notice date. An original and 8 copies of any such motion must be filed with: Secretary, Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, Northeast, Washington, DC 20426, and must be served on each person

Fifth Revised Volume No. 1, the following revised tariff sheets to reflect the cancellation of Rate Schedule ISST-NE
(effective September 1, 1993) and the installation of a replacement service under Part 284 of the Commission's regulations:

Tennessee states that the Preferred Access Transportation rate schedule is an interruptible service that has higher
priority than other interruptible services. The service will be generally available to all shippers, but is restricted
to transportation of gas withdrawn from storage (Tennessee's or third parties') during the winter season from November
through March. These availability restrictions reflect the specialized nature of the ISST service that the Preferred
Access Transportation Rate Schedule replaces. The terms and conditions are similar to those in the Texas Eastern
Rate Schedule PTI, which has been approved by the Commission. See 

Texas Eastern, 

62 FERC  61,015 (1993).
Tennessee states that it is proposing a higher rate than under Rate Schedule IT (100% load factor rather than 125% load
factor), and is requiring monthly prepayment for monthly quantities derived from seasonal elections. Tennessee
states that the Commission has recognized that higher rates are justified for special higher priority service. Tennessee
states that because the service is interruptible, the revenues will be subject to the crediting mechanism in the same
manner as those collected under Rate Schedules IT and IT-X. This service does not represent new throughput on
the system, but merely the repriortization of existing interruptible volumes.
Any person desiring to be heard or to protest such filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with rules 211
and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before
October 12, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken,
but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion
to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.

<DOCTITLE>Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline Company; Notice of Application</DOCTITLE>



October 4, 1994.



Take notice that on September 30, 1994, Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline Company (Williston Basin), Suite 300,
200 North Third Street, Bismarck, North Dakota 58501, filed an application with the Commission in Docket No. CP94-823-000
pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act (NGA) for authorization to amend the authorization granted in Docket
No. CP91-1897-000
 by adding a new receipt point and reassigning natural gas volumes delivered at various receipt points used to transport
gas for Northern States Power Company (NSP), all as more fully set forth in the application which is open to the public
for inspection.





Williston Basin proposes to add the existing Bowdoin_KNE Whitewater Exchange receipt point in Phillips County,
Montana, to its FERC Rate Schedule X-13 for service to NSP during the months of November through March each year.
Williston Basin would deliver gas received at the Bowdoin_KNE Whitewater Exchange receipt point to NSP at the existing
Mapleton NSP delivery point in Cass County, North Dakota.

Williston Basin also proposes to reassign portions of the currently effective transportation Maximum Daily Receipt
Quantity (MDRQ) under Rate Schedule X-13 from the Little Knife Plant in Billings, North Dakota, and the Lignite
Plant in Burke County, North Dakota, to the Bowdoin_KNE Whitewater Exchange receipt point during the November-March
winter heating season. Williston Basin would receive 500 dekatherms at the proposed Bowdoin_KNE Whitewater Exchange
receipt point during the heating season and zero during the April-October summer season. Williston Basin would
also receive 2,250 dekatherms during the winter heating season and 2,500 dekatherms during the summer season at the
Little Knife Plant receipt point. During the winter heating season, Williston Basin would receive 1,000 dekatherms
at the Lignite Plant receipt point and 1,250 during the summer season.

Williston Basin would not construct and operate any new facilities to implement this proposal.

Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before October
11, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest
in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 or 385.214)
and the Regulations under the NGA (18 CFR 157.10). All protest filed with the Commission will be considered by it in
determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding.
Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion
to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules.

Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction conferred upon the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by Sections 7 and 15 of the NGA and the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure,
a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application if no motion
to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter finds that a
grant of the certificate is required by the public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene is
timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further notice of such
hearing will be duly given.

Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for Williston Basin to
appear or be represented at the hearing.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 

U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

), this notice announces that the Information Collection Request (ICR) abstracted below has been forwarded to the
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and comment. The ICR describes the nature of the information collection

Office of Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances




Title:

 Notification of Substantial Risks Under section 8(e) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). (EPA ICR No.: 0794.06;
OMB No.: 2070-0046). This is a request for extension of the expiration date of a currently approved collection.


Abstract:

 Under section 8(e) of TSCA, chemical manufacturers, importers, processors, and distributors must immediately
inform EPA when they obtain information which indicates that their product(s) may present a substantial risk of injury
to health or the environment. Section 8(e) of TSCA is an important and useful tool for early warning and the identification
of new substantial risks posed by exposure to chemical substances. The EPA and other Federal agencies use this information
to determine and control chemical risks.


Burden Statement:

 The annual public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 21 hours per initial
section 8(e) submission and 4 hours per follow-up/supplemental section 8(e) submission. EPA experience has shown
that approximately 2.2 follow-up/supplemental section 8(e) submissions are received on a yearly basis per initial
submission. This estimate includes the time needed to review instructions, gather and submit the data needed, and
complete and review the collection of information.


Respondents:

 Chemical manufacturers, importers, processors, and distributors.

<DOCTITLE>Technical Corrections on Additional Data Available on Cement Kiln Dust Waste Studied in the Report to Congress on
Cement Kiln Dust</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of corrections to data available for comment in RCRA Docket No. F-94-RC2A-FFFFF and extension
of comment period on corrected materials.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice announces the availability, for public inspection and comment, of corrections to certain portions of
data recently made available for public comment (see 59 FR 47133-47135, September 14, 1994), pertinent to additional
assessments of potential risks from cement kiln dust waste. This Notice also extends the period for public comment
on the corrected materials. Specifically, these corrections pertain to Pages 1-19 through 1-30 and Attachment
1-4 of Section 1 of the Technical Background Document on Human Health and Environmental Risk Assessment in Support
of the Regulatory Determination on Cement Kiln Dust, Section 1 being titled ``Expanded Risk Assessment for the Onsite
Management of Cement Kiln Dust.'' This Technical Background Document is Number S0019 in RCRA Docket No. F-94-RC2A-FFFFF.
The corrected materials, in the form of substitute pages 1-19 (revised) through 1-30 (revised) and Attachment
1-4 (revised), have been placed in RCRA Docket No. F-94-RC2A-FFFFF as docket entry No. S0019.A,
and have also been placed in EPA's Superfund electronic bulletin board (CLU-IN).


There were five general errors in the CKD human health risk assessment materials which need to be corrected. They include:



_Fixing a ``rounding'' error which inadvertently assigned all facilities into a risk category one order of magnitude
higher than estimated.
_Revising risk results for 5 sites to represent ``best-estimate'' results. (High-end risk estimates were inadvertently
used.)
_Revised risk estimates for two sites located near lakes. The dilution capacity of the two lakes is actually orders
of magnitude greater than what was used in the original material announced in the September 14, 1994, notice.
_Revised risk estimates for 14 sites for which we did not have constituent concentrations. In the original document,
risk estimates assumed 95th percentile concentrations for metals. In the revised tables, if risk at the sites could
not be determined as negligible using the 95th percentile, then risk at the sites are listed as ``unknown'' rather
than estimating the risk using the 95th percentile assumption.
_Add the results of the aquatic pathway exceedances of constituent concentrations as defined in the Ambient Water
Quality Criteria (AWQC). These were calculated but inadvertently left out of the previous document. They represent
a risk element not included in the previous edition. The AWQC exceedance results is a new subsection inserted at the
end of the revised results subsection.

<DOCTITLE>Federal Open Market Committee; Domestic Policy Directive of August 16, 1994</DOCTITLE>


In accordance with  271.5 of its rules regarding availability of information (12 CFR part 271), there is set forth below
the domestic policy directive issued by the Federal Open Market Committee at its meeting held on August 16, 1994.
 The directive was issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as follows:



The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that the pace of economic expansion, though still substantial,
may have moderated somewhat recently, while resource utilization has remained at high levels. Nonfarm payroll employment
continued to advance at a robust pace in July, but the civilian unemployment rate edged up to 6.1 percent_about the
same as the average for the second quarter. Industrial production rose appreciably over June and July. Growth in consumer
spending has slowed in recent months, owing in part to constraints on the supply of motor vehicles. Housing starts
rose in July. Orders for nondefense capital goods point to a continued strong expansion in spending on business equipment;
permits for nonresidential construction have been rising as well. Business inventories registered a large increase
in the second quarter, but inventories appeared to have remained broadly in line with sales. The average nominal deficit
on U.S. trade in goods and services was larger in April and May than the average for the first quarter. Increases in broad
indexes of consumer and producer prices have remained moderate in recent months, apart form the effect of short-run
swings in volatile food and energy components.
Most market interest rates are unchanged to up slightly on balance since the July meeting. The trade-weighted value
of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies was unchanged on balance over the inter-meeting period.
M2 and M3 turned up in July following declines on average in both aggregates over May and June; for the year through July,
M2 and M3 grew at rates slightly above the bottom of their ranges for 1994. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has continued
to expand at a moderate rate in recent months.
The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote
sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in July reaffirmed
the ranges it had established in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured
from the fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of 1994. The committee anticipated that developments contributing
to unusual velocity increases could persist during the year and that money growth within these ranges would be consistent
with its broad policy objectives. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained
at 4 to 8 percent for the year. For 1995, the Committee agreed on tentative ranges for monetary growth, measured from
the fourth quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of 1995, of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 0 to 4 percent for M3. The Committee
provisionally set the associated monitoring range for growth of domestic nonfinancial debt at 3 to 7 percent for 1995.
The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability,
movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.
In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the committee seeks to increase somewhat the existing degree
of pressure on reserve positions, taking account of a possible increase in the discount rate. In the context of the
Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration
to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve
restraint would be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be
consistent with modest growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.



By order of the Federal Open Market Committee, October 4, 1994.

in children from the 15th month of age, having already received three injections of a whole cell vaccine against pertussis.
The application was received and filed in the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research on August 19, 1994, which

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act, this notice announces a meeting of the 1994 Advisory Council
on Social Security (the Council).


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Purpose 


Under section 706 of the Social Security Act (the Act), the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary)
appoints the Council every 4 years. The Council examines issues affecting the Social Security Old-Age, Survivors,
and Disability Insurance (OASDI) programs, as well as the Medicare program and impacts on the Medicaid program, which
were created under the Act. 

In addition, the Secretary has asked the Council specifically to address the following: 

 Social Security financing issues, including developing recommendations for improving the long-range financial
status of the OASDI programs; 

 General program issues such as the relative equity and adequacy of Social Security benefits for persons at
various income levels, in various family situations, and various age cohorts, taking into account such factors as
the increased labor force participation of women, lower marriage rates, increased likelihood of divorce, and higher
poverty rates of aged women. 

In addressing these topics, the Secretary suggested that the Council may wish to analyze the relative roles of the
public and private sectors in providing retirement income, how policies in both sectors affect retirement decisions
and the economic status of the elderly, and how the disability insurance program provisions and the availability
of health insurance and health care costs affect such matters. 

The Council is composed of 12 members in addition to the chairman: Robert Ball, Joan Bok, Ann Combs, Edith Fierst, Gloria
Johnson, Thomas Jones, George Kourpias, Sylvester Schieber, Gerald Shea, Marc Twinney, Fidel Vargas, and Carolyn
Weaver. The chairman is Edward Gramlich. 

The Council met previously on June 24-25 (59 FR 30367), July 29, 1994 (59 FR 35942), and September 29-30
(59 FR 47146). 



II. Agenda 



The Council will discuss: 

 Economic and demographic assumptions contained in the Trust Fund reports; 
 Analysis of income distribution trends, and the implications for retirement income security; and 
 Adequacy and equity of Social Security benefits. 

The agenda items are subject to change as priorities dictate. 

The meeting is open to the public to the extent that space is available. Interpreter services for persons with hearing
impairments will be provided. A transcript of the meeting will be available to the public on an at-cost-of duplication
basis. The transript can be ordered from the Executive Director of the Council.

of Public Lands in Bingham County, Idaho.







NOTICE: 

Notice is hereby given that the Bureau of Land Management has amended the Pocatello RMP to allow for an exchange and
management of acquired lands in Bingham County, Idaho. The effective date of this action will be 60 days from the date
of 

Federal Register

 publication.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The following described public lands have been determined to be suitable for disposal by exchange under Section 206
of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, 43 U.S.C. 1716:



Boise Meridian




T. 1 S., R. 38 E.,


Sec. 17, S1/2SW1/4;

Sec. 18, SE1/4NW1/4, E1/2SW1/4, S1/2SE1/4;

Sec. 19, N1/2NE1/4, NE1/4NW1/4.




The area described contains 400.00 acres in Bingham County.







County the following described lands which have been examined and through the public supported land use planning
process have been identified to be managed through multiple use management pursuant to the Federal Land Management
Policy and Management Act of 1976:





Boise Meridian



T. 3 S., R. 39 E.,


Sec. 33, SW1/4SW1/4;
Sec. 34, W1/2NW1/4.





The area described contains 120.00 acres in Bingham County.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The purpose of the land exchange is to facilitate more efficient management of the public lands through consolidation
of ownership and to benefit the public interest by obtaining important resource values. The public lands to be exchanged
are isolated and difficult to manage parcels with limited resource values. The private lands being offered have very
important values for watershed/riparian, recreation, wildlife and access that merit acquisition for public ownership.
The exchange is consistent with the Bureau of Land Management land use plan, as amended, and the public interest will
be served by making this exchange. Final determination on disposal will await completion of an environmental analysis,
which will be made available to the public.




The value of the lands to be exchanged is approximately equal, and the acreage will be adjusted to equalize the value
upon completion of the final appraisal of the lands. Equalization of values will be achieved through acreage adjustment
or cash payment by the proponent, whichever is appropriate.



The exchange will be subject to:




1. All valid existing rights, including any right-of-way easement, permit, or lease of record.


2. A reservation to the United States of a right-of-way for ditches and canals constructed by the authority of the United
States under the Act of August 30, 1890 (43 U.S.C. 945).




PLANNING PROTEST: 

Any party that participated in the plan amendment may protest this action as it affects issues submitted for the record
during the planning process. The protest shall be in writing and filed with the Director (760), Bureau of Land Management,
1800 ``C'' Street, NW., Washington, DC 20240, within 30 days of this notice.

<USBUREAU>Drug Enforcement Administration</USBUREAU>


Kenneth Wayne Green, Jr., M.D. Revocation of Registration



On May 4, 1994, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to Kenneth Wayne Green, Jr., M.D. The order to Show Cause proposed to revoke Dr.
Green's DEA Certificate of Registration, BG124039, and deny any pending applications for renewal of such registration
as a practitioner under 21 U.S.C. 823(f). The statutory predicate for the issuance of the Order to Show Cause was Dr.
Green's lack of authorization to handle controlled substance in the State of Texas. 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(3). In addition,
the Order to Show Cause alleged that Dr. Green's continued registration is inconsistent with the public interest,
as that term is used in 21 U.S.C. 823(f) and 824(a)(4).

The Order to Show Cause was sent to Dr. Green by registered mail to his DEA registered address, 2728 Oak Lawn, Dallas,
Texas and to Post Office Box 191428, Dallas, Texas. Both Orders were returned to DEA unclaimed with the notation ``addressee
unknown.'' DEA Investigators made numerous attempts to locate Dr. Green. Investigators went to Dr. Green's DEA registered
location, which was his medical office, and learned that the office had been closed and the doors padlocked. Investigators
also went to Dr. Green's residence and to his parent's residence. Additionally, they contacted the state medical
authorities and the post office.

In their attempt to locate Dr. Green, DEA Investigators learned that he maintained a mailbox at a mailbox service company
located at 729 Grapevine Highway, Hurst, Texas. DEA Investigators personally delivered the Order to Show Cause to
that location. An employee confirmed that Dr. Green had a mailbox with that company. Some time later, that Order to
Show Cause was returned to DEA unclaimed.

The Deputy Administrator finds that the DEA Investigators made numerous attempts to locate Dr. Green and have determined
that his whereabouts are unknown. It is quite evident that Dr. Green is no longer practicing medicine at the address
listed on his DEA Certificate of Registration. The Deputy Administrator concludes that considerable effort has
been made to serve Dr. Green with the Order to Show Cause without success. Consequently, the Deputy Administrator
now enters his final order in this matter based on the investigative file. 21 CFR 1301.54 and 1301.57.

The DEA investigative file reveals that Respondent had abused Demerol and Vicodin, Schedule II and III controlled
substances, respectively; had been hospitalized for drug and alcohol abuse on February 7, 1991; had participated
in an impaired professional program between March and June 1991; and lost his clinical privileges at a medical center
in April 1991, due to his intemperate use of Demerol and Vicodin. Based upon those findings, on April 10, 1992, Dr. Green
and the Texas State Board of Medical Examiners (Board), entered into an agreed Order whereby Dr. Green's license to
practice medicine was suspended for ten years. The suspension was probated under certain terms and conditions. One
term provided that Dr. Green abstain from the consumption of alcohol and chemical substances. Another term required
that Dr. Green provide either a urine or blood specimen at the request of a Board representative.

On June 5, 1992, a compliance officer with the Board collected a urine sample from Dr. Green. The sample tested positive
for cocaine. As a result, on August 28, 1993, the Board again suspended Dr. Green's license to practice medicine for
ten years, said suspension stayed. Dr. Green's medical license was placed on probation under certain terms and conditions.
One condition required that Dr. Green abstain from the consumption of alcohol and chemical substances.

On November 2, 1993, the compliance officer returned to Dr. Green's office to obtain a urine specimen. Dr. Green initially
refused to comply with that request. Approximately three hours later, he provided a urine sample. The sample tested
positive for amphetamines and methamphetamine.

The investigative file further reveals that Dr. Green violated other provisions of the Texas Board Orders dated April
10, 1992 and August 28, 1993. Dr. Green failed to participate in the activities of the Dallas County Medical Society
Committee on Physician Health and Rehabilitation; failed to receive treatment from his counselors and from his treating
physician; and failed to immediately submit himself for a random screening for alcohol or drugs on November 2, 1993.

As a result of the foregoing, the Board issued a Final Order, dated August 19, 1994, revoking Dr. Green's license to
practice medicine in the State of Texas. Additionally, Dr. Green failed to renew his Texas controlled substances
registration on or before March 31, 1994. Consequently, he is no longer authorized to handle controlled substances
in the State of Texas.

The Deputy Administrator concludes that, based upon the information contained in the investigative file, there
are sufficient grounds for the revocation of Dr. Green's DEA Certificate of Registration and for the denial of any
pending applications for renewal. The fact that Dr. Green is no longer authorized to handle controlled substances
in the State of Texas is a sufficient ground, by itself, to order the renovation of his registration. DEA has consistently
held that it cannot maintain the registration of a practitioner who is not authorized to handle controlled substances
in the state in which he practices. 21 U.S.C. 823(f); Stephen A. Richards, D.D.S., 59 FR 42074 (1994); Scot Kazalla,
D.D.S., 59 FR 28424 (1994); Myong S. Yi, M.D. 54 FR 30618 (1989); William D. Romers, D.D.S., 52 FR 12621 (1987); Ramon
Pla, M.D., 51 FR 41168 (1986); Kenneth K. Birchard, M.D., 48 FR 33778 (1983); and cases cited therein. Since Dr. Green
is no longer authorized to handle controlled substances in the State of Texas, the Deputy Administrator cannot maintain
his DEA Certificate of Registration in that state.

In addition, the information regarding Dr. Green's history of drug abuse provides further support for the revocation
of his registration and for the denial of any pending applications for renewal. The Deputy Administrator finds that
Dr. Green's continued drug usage and relapses leads to the conclusion that he cannot be entrusted with the responsibilities
of a DEA registrant and that his continued possession of a registration would be contrary to the public interest. Allan
L. Gant, D.O., 59 FR 10826 (1994); David M. Headley, M.D., 58 FR 58183 (1994); Robert W. Sonntag, M.D., 53 FR 45606 (1988).

Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested
in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104 (59 FR 23637) hereby orders that DEA Certificate of Registration,
BG1204039, previously issued to Kenneth Wayne Green, Jr., M.D., be, and it hereby is, revoked. The Deputy Administration
further orders that all pending applications for the renewal of such registration, be, and hereby are, denied. This
order is effective November 10, 1994.

It is understood that NSFA and its personnel, and ASA and its personnel, will not be held responsible for accidental
discharges or releases of designated pollutants or wastes, unless such discharges are the result of gross negligence.



Add



NSFA and its personnel and ASA and its personnel, will not be held responsible for accidental discharges or releases
of designated pollutants or wastes, which are cleaned up in accordance with the permit unless there is a finding of
negligence.

Accidental releases such as those listed in the permit are inevitable in the harsh operating conditions of Antarctica.
Discharges may result, in whole or in part, from safety considerations; equipment, facility, or pipeline failure;
weather conditions such as high winds, limited visibility, icy conditions or extreme cold. Absent unusual circumstances,
such discharges would not be considered negligent and would not be actionable under the permit.

3. Responsibility to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Issuance of this permit by NSF does not relieve
the permittee of responsibility for complying with other applicable laws and regulations or future laws and regulations
that become effective during the term of the permit. However, enforcement of other applicable laws will not be taken
under this permit, but will be the responsibility of the appropriate regulating body designated within the applicable
law or regulation.
4. Required modification to conform with implementing legislation. In the event legislation is enacted to implement
the provisions of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, and regulations are adopted
thereunder governing waste disposal and waste management in Antarctica, NSF and the permittees shall discuss proposed
modifications to the permit, and this permit shall be modified, if necessary, to comply with the requirements of those
regulations.
5. Right of entry and inspection. Any NSF employee, contractor, or agent designated by the Director, Office of Polar
Programs; an Antarctic Conservation Act enforcement officer; or an NSF Representative may inspect any permitted
activity and records related thereto to verify compliance with permit conditions. The designated NSF employee,
contractor, or agent may take photographs, review documents, collect samples of solids, liquids or air for analysis
and environmental monitoring purposes and perform other actions related to verification of compliance with permit
conditions.
6. Incorporation of 45 CFR Part 671 into permit conditions. 45 CFR 671.9, Conditions of permit, and all other provisions
of 45 CFR part 671 are incorporated into this permit.
7. Field modification of Contingency Plans. The implementation of all Contingency Plans referred to in Volume I,
Chapter 6.0, ``Contingency Plans to Control Accidental Releases,'' of the permit may be affected by safety considerations;
material, equipment, facility, or pipeline failure; non-availability of equipment with sufficient capacity or
capability to address the release; non-availability of adequate transportation to reach or sustain work at the site;
and harsh weather conditions which restrict operations. Therefore, implementation of these plans may be modified
to accommodate these conditions.
8. Development of a consolidated compliance plan. A consolidated compliance plan identifying the procedures and
arrangements for managing compliance with the permit must be developed within 180 days of the issuance of this permit
and submitted to the NSF. The compliance plan must include pertinent information from existing USAP management documents
and subsequent documents as may be prepared. Information on fuel tank, pipeline, and associated equipment inspection,
testing, and monitoring, and the frequency of these events, as well as similar information concerning the management
of designated pollutants and wastes must be included in the compliance plan.
9. Changes in the total quantity of wastes managed. Projected increases in the total annual quantity by weight of antarctic
hazardous wastes managed under this permit by more than 20 percent or wastes (excluding antarctic hazardous wastes)
managed under this permit by more than 20 percent relative to the ``Projected Annual Waste Generation For All USAP
Facilities For the Period 1 October, 1994 through 30 September, 1999'', included in Volume I Table 3-7 of the
permit, shall require application for a formal amendment to this permit in accordance with 45 CFR 671.8(c).

10. Allocation of adequate resources to execute permit responsibilities. In the event that either permittee believes
that policy, programmatic, and funding decisions made by the NSF for the USAP prevent the adequate allocation of resources
to meet permit obligations, the permittee must notify and send a letter by certified mail to the Director, Office of
Polar Programs, with a copy to the contracting officer, within ten days of the identification of the resource allocation
problem and state what additional resources are required to enable full compliance with permit requirements. The
NSF will diligently respond to any such notification.
11. Fuel blending. The blending of used oils with new product for fuel shall be done only after representative testing
of the used oils to verify that the proposed fuel management technique meets comparable standards for management
of used oils set forth in 40 CFR Part 279.
12. Management of radioactive wastes. All low-level radioactive wastes shall be managed, stored, packaged, manifested,
and shipped in accordance with applicable Federal regulations (e.g., NRC, DOT). Final disposal of the wastes in the
United States will be in accordance with appropriate NRC and EPA regulations and any additional requirements imposed
by the local jurisdiction receiving these wastes. All waste subcontractors shall be duly permitted to handle, pack,
ship, or treat the wastes. The final disposal facility shall be licensed and permitted to receive and dispose of those
low-level radioactive wastes. Any short-lived radioactive wastes held for decay to background levels shall be stored
in a secure designated facility appropriate for that purpose; once sufficient time has passed, those wastes will
be handled in a manner consistent with their other, non-radioactive characteristics. Appropriate management controls
will be implemented to minimize the generation of ``mixed wastes'' (wastes with radioactive and hazardous characteristics).
13. Air emissions reductions. The standard emissions control equipment provided at the time of manufacturing for
sale of vehicles and equipment in the United States shall be maintained on all vehicles and equipment operated by the
permittees for the USAP. Vehicles and equipment with defective or missing emissions control equipment as determined
by visual inspection must have that equipment replaced within 24 months of the issuance of this permit. Vehicles and
equipment which cannot operate under antarctic conditions with the factory installed, or equivalent, emissions
control equipment must be replaced with vehicles or equipment with properly functioning emissions control equipment
or taken out of service within 24 months of the issuance of this permit.
14. Designation of a waste manager. The permittees shall provide to the NSF within 15 days of the issuance of this permit
the name, title, and appropriate contact information for the principal individual and an alternative individual
responsible for compliance with this permit. This individual shall be the official point of contact for all matters
relating to the use and management of designated pollutants and wastes in Antarctica and compliance with the permit.

15. Records at the site. A copy of this permit and the permit application, or relevant sections for a particular station
or vessel, must be maintained at the three principal U.S. Antarctic Program stations; McMurdo Station, Amundsen-Scott
South Pole Station, Palmer Station and the two USAP research vessels; the R/V Nathaniel B. Palmer and the R/V Polar
Duke or successor. Ongoing activities receiving waste management permits for the first time must forward copies
of the permit and permit application materials to the referenced site(s) as soon as practicable and maintain these
records at the applicant's home institution or agency upon receipt of the permit.

16. Violations. Violations of the Antarctic Conservation Act or the terms or conditions of this permit may result
in criminal or civil fines of up to $10,000 for each occurrence, imprisonment for up to one year under the Act and administrative
penalties (including debarment).



Reports



17. Annual summary report. A report on the management ad disposition of all wastes as required under 45 CFR 671.9(c)(1)(ii)
must be provided to the Director of NSF, Office of Polar Programs, by June 30 of each year for the preceding 12 month period
ending May 31 throughout the term of the permit. Records on the releases and final disposition of balloons used for
both logistical and scientific purposes must be included in this report. Any materials not accepted on the ship for
retrograde or not accepted in the U.S. should be identified in the report. Reports on any non-permitted releases and
any additional reports specifically requested by the Director are due as required under 45 CFR 671.9.

18. Wasted minimization, reduction, and treatment. The permittees must provide, by June 30th of each year, a report
summarizing the effectiveness of the waste minimization, reduction, and treatment methods employed during the
reporting period and new measures proposed for implementation during the upcoming year. The first reporting period
will be October 1, 1994 through May 31, 1995. Subsequent reporting periods will cover the 12 months since the last report.

19. Transferability of permit. This permit may be transferred only with the consent of the NSF. Upon termination of
ASA's contract with the NSF, ASA will be removed from the permit and will have no further obligations under the permit.
Upon award of a new contract to replace services being provided by ASA, NSF will commence the required administrative
and public processes for the transfer of the permit to the new contractor. ASA's obligation as a permittee will cease
on the last day of the transition period between the two contracts.

Notice of the Office of Management and Budget review of information collection.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has recently submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review
the following proposal for the collection of information under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44
U.S.C. Chapter 35).



1. Type of submission, new, revision, or extension: Revision.

2. The title of the information collection: 10 CFR Parts 30, 32, and 35_Preparation, Transfer for Commercial Distribution,

9. Abstract: In response to a petition for rulemaking submitted by the American College of Nuclear Physicians and
the Society of Nuclear Medicine, the NRC is amending its regulations for the medical use of byproduct material. This
rule is necessary to provide greater flexibility by eliminating current regulatory restrictions and allowing properly
qualified nuclear pharmacists and authorized users who are physicians greater discretion in preparing radioactive
drugs containing byproduct material for medical use. This rule will also allow the use of byproduct material in both
research involving human subjects and the medical use of radiolabeled biologics. In addition, this rule also contains
other miscellaneous and conforming amendments necessary to clarify or update the current regulations.

Copies of the submittal may be inspected or obtained for a fee from the NRC Public Document Room 2120 L Street NW (Lower
Level), Washington, DC.

Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S. C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on July 7, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below,
which Items have been prepared by the CBOE. The Exchange subsequently filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change
on September 29, 1994.
 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change 



The purpose of the proposed rule change is to request an extension of the ``As-of-Add'' fee [program contained in CBOE
Rule 2.26 (``Pilot Program''), until December 31, 1994.
 Under that rule, individual members and member organizations are assessed a monthly fee when they submit trade information
later than the trade date (each an ``As-of-Add'') on more than a stated maximum percentage of their monthly transatins.
The Exchange does not propose to amend Rule 2.26 in any respect at this time. 





Under the Pilot Program, the fee, if any, to an individual member is $10.00 for each As-of-Add submitting during a given
month in excess of the percentage of submissions considered ``nominal'' under paragraph (a) of Rule 2.26. The fee
to any clearing firm under paragraph (a) of Rule 2.26. The fee to any clearing firm under paragraph (b) of that rule is
$3.00 for each As-of-Add submitted in excess of the ``nominal'' monthly percentage. Any member assessed an As-of-Add
fee may request verification from the Exchange pursuant to Part B of Chapter XIX of CBOE's Rules and may appeal the fee
assessment pursuant to Part A thereof.

The Pilot Program was initially approved by the Commission on October 1, 1993.
 Continuation of the Pilot Program, in its present form, was approved on April 4, 1994.
 In the Continuation Order, the Commission required the Exchange, if it wished to make the Pilot Program a permanent
program, to explain how the Pilot Program reflects an equitable allocation of fees among members and to establish
a policy with respect to discipline of members that repeatedly file an excessive number of AS-of-Add.
 The Commission also required the CBOE to submit a report setting forth particular statistics about the Pilot Program.









The Exchange represents that the Pilot Program serves two purposes. First, it helps reimburse the Exchange for the
administrative burdens and costs of processing post-trade date submission from members. Late trade submissions,
according to the Exchange, impose special processing costs on the Exchange and require significant effort by clearing
firms and executing brokers to check and resolve late trade reports. The Exchange further represents that late trade
submissions also can burden the Exchange during periods of high volume and create financial risks to members during
volatile markets. Accordingly, the Exchange believes that the As-of-Add fees provide the Exchange with revenues
that cover, in part, its cost for providing As-of-Add services.

Second, the Exchange represents that the Pilot Program is designed to create economic incentives for members to submit
trade data on the trade date, thereby relieving the Exchange and Exchnge members of high levels of special handling.
The Exchange believes that the Pilot Program and the incentive effects of the fee are equitably allocated among individual
members and member organizations. Although individual members incur a higher per-submission fee than do clearing
members, the Exchange states that individual members have primary control over the timing of submissions and, in
the Exchange's experience, individual member errors and delays are the direct cause of most As-of-Adds. The fee structure
is thus designed to impose greater As-of-Add responsibilities on those members, 

i.e.

, individual members, whose conduct, according to the Exchange creates the biggest share of the extra work and extra
costs posed by late submissions. Since October 1993, 354 individual members, and 13 clearing firms, have been assessed
a fee pursuant to the Pilot Program.

<TEXT>
 

The Exchange continues to believe that it is also appropriate to impose As-of-Add fees on clearing firms that exceed
the nominal monthly level of As-of-Adds. In the Exchange's experience, clearing firms are sometimes the direct or
contributing cause of late submissions. The Exchange, therefore, believes that a fee imposed on such firms is therefore
appropriate, in general, as it is for individual members. Moreover, the Exchange believes that clearing firms are
in the best position to identify late-submitting individual members and to prompt such members to process trade information
on time. In that regard, the Exchange represents that the fee to clearing members not only helps promote their operational
vigilance, but also that of the individual members for whom they clear trades.

In the Continuation Order, the Commission expressed some concern about the differing fee levels for individual members
as compared to clearing firms and requested the Exchange to review the equities associated with the fee structure.
 The Exchange has reviewed the Pilot Program and continues to believe that the levels set in the current rule are appropriate
for each membership class, for several reasons. First, those few clearing firms who have been assessed a fee under
rule 2.26 have paid substantial amounts.
 Fee levels higher than those in the current rule would, the Exchange believes, be disproportionately severe. Second,
clearing firms incur personnel and systems costs, which the Exchange estimates to be about $5.00 per As-of-Add, for
the extra work that As-of-Add processing creates. Those costs are not incurred by individual members. Accordingly,
when the $5.00 cost per As-of-Add is added to the $3.00 fine imposed on clearing firms for each excessive monthly As-of-Add,
the disparity between the $10.00 paid by individual members and the $8.00 incurred by clearing members is, in the Exchange's
opinion, de minimis. Third, the Exchange believes that the fee structure places a greater share of the fee burden on
the members primarily responsible for the excess costs the Exchange incurs. The Exchange, therefore, believes that
the fee differential reflected in the current rule is both appropriate and equitable.






Finally, the Exchange believes that the Pilot Program has been, and will continue to be, effective in promoting a reduced
volume of As-of-Adds. Individual members' use of As-of-Adds has declined since the program was initiated, as have
the number of Exchange members that have exceeded the allowable monthly levels.
 For that reason, the Exchange continues to believe that the Pilot Program is effective in covering Exchange costs
and in improving member behavior. Nonetheless, the Exchange believes that As-of-Add processing continues to impose
burdens on the Exchange and its members, and chronic problems may not be fully addressed by fees alone. Accordingly,
to the extent that any member exceeds the nominal level for six consecutive months, or by a significant percentage
in any one month without clear justification, the Department of Market Operations will refer that member to the Division
of Regulatory Services for investigation and appropriate disciplinary action.
 On approval of this proposed rule change, the Exchange will issue a Regulatory Circular to members reviewing the operation
of the program and underscoring the foregoing compliance policy.

The CBOE believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the
objectives of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act in particular in that it is designed to provide for the equitable allocation
of reasonable dues, fees and charges among CBOE members.



(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The CBOE does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose a burden on competition.



(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others



No written comments were solicited or received respect to the proposed rule change.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



The Exchange has requested that the proposed rule change be given accelerated effectiveness pursuant to Section
19(b)(2) of the Act.

The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and in particular, the requirements of Section
6(b)(5).
 Specifically, the Commission finds, as it did in originally approving the Pilot Program and the subsequent extension,
that imposing fees on members who submit As-of-Adds for more than a prescribed percentage of transactions in any month
is likely to: (1) Offset the carrying costs incurred by the Exchange and Exchange members as a result of these post-trade
date submissions; (2) make trade comparisons on the CBOE more efficient in terms of the time and expense involved in
trade processing; and (3) reduce the risk exposure to investors and Exchange clearing members.
 Additionally, the Commission continues to believe that the Pilot Program does not raise any due process concerns
because of the availability of the verification and appeals processes.








Although the Exchange believes the fees that can be incurred are relatively modest, the Commission believes that
the fee assessments, which have reached in excess of $800 per month for an individual member and in excess of $2,400
per month for a clearing member,
 can be substantial. Nevertheless, because such high fees would only be imposed on the most egregious offenders of
Rule 2.26, the Commission believes the fee structure is not totally unreasonable. Furthermore, the Exchange has
represented that in determining the number of As-of-Add submissions each month, it cannot determine, without reviewing
each individual trade, whether a particular As-of-Add was submitted late due to the fault of an individual member
or that member's clearing firm.
 As a result, in determining whether a member has exceeded its stated monthly percentage of allowable As-of-Adds,
each As-of-Add processed by a member firm is counted against both that member firm and the individual member who executed
the transaction.
 In this context, the Commission remains troubled that to the extent that a clearing member is responsible for the late
submission, the individual member can still be assessed a substantive fine, and vice versa.







Despite these concerns, the Commission finds that the differential in the per-trade fee amount assessed against
clearing members ($3) and individual members ($10) is consistent with the Act based on the representations by the
Exchange that in its experience, most As-of-Adds are the result of late submissions by individual members rather
than by clearing members, and that clearing members are often delayed in submitting trade data because individual
members fail to submit trade data to the clearing members in a timely manner. As a result, the Commission believes that
the proposed rule change may serve to reduce the number of monthly As-of-Adds by individual members which should benefit
all Exchange members, and ultimately investors, by increasing the efficiency with which Exchange transactions
are processed as well as helping the Exchange to defray the additional costs it incurs with the processing of those
transactions.
 Although the maximum monthly allowable percentage of As-of-Adds for clearing members is lower than for individual
members, this alone does not address the fee differential because clearing members are clearing transactions for
many Exchange members. The Commission, therefore, continues to encourage the Exchange to consider methods of administering
the Pilot Program to ensure that As-of-Add fees are assessed in a fair and equitable manner.

<TEXT>
 

In addition to addressing whether the differential in the per-submission fee is a fair and equitable allocation,
the Commission also requested in the Continuation Order,
 that the Exchange address why the Pilot Programs should not be incorporated into the Exchange's Minor Rule Plan 
 because of the size of some of the fees imposed under the Pilot Program.
 Although the Exchange has stated that it believes the ``fees'' assessed pursuant to the Pilot Program are fair and
equitable and should not be incorporated into the Minor Rule Plan,
 the Commission does not believe the issue has been adequately addressed by the CBOE. Nevertheless, the Commission
has determined to grant a limited three month extension to the Pilot Program for two reasons. First, no formal complaints
have been lodged by members regarding the fees assessed to date pursuant to the Pilot Program.
 Second, the Exchange has represented that it will re-consider the issue of incorporating the As-Of Add fees, in some
form,
 into the Minor Rule Plan. 










In order to provide the Exchange with adequate time to assess any proposed changes to the Pilot Program, the Exchange
has represented to the Commission that a proposed rule filing pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Act will be submitted
by the Exchange on or before November 1, 1994. In addition, the CBOE will be required to submit with that proposed rule
change, an updated report containing the information requested by the Commission in the Continuation Order.
 The Commission also notes that it would not be inclined, at this time, to grant a further extension of the Pilot Program
until the concerns raised herein have been addressed by the Exchange. 





The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change and Amendment No. 1 thereto prior to the thirtieth
day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the 

Federal Register

 in order to permit the pilot program to remain in effect until December 31, 1994 without interruption. Additionally,
the Exchange has represented that no problems has arisen and no formal complaints have been received by the Exchange
concerning the pilot program since its implementation.
 Accordingly, the Commission believes it is consistent with Sections 6(b)(5) and 19(b)(2) of the Act to approve the
proposed rule change on an accelerated basis. 




IV. Solicitation of Comments 



Interested persons are invited to submit written date, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those than those that may be withheld
from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the
Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. Copies of such filing will also
be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of the CBOE. All submissions should refer to File No.
SR-CBOE-94-24 and should be submitted by November 1, 1994. 



It is therefore ordered, 

pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act
 that the proposed rule change (SR-CBOE-94-24), extending the pilot program for fees related to
As-of-Adds until December 31, 1994, is approved.

 



For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Midwest Clearing Corporation and Midwest Securities Trust Company; Notice of
Amendments and Order Approving on an Accelerated Basis Proposed Rule Changes Establishing a Risk Assessment Committee
and Making Various Other Changes to MCC's and MSTC's By-Laws and Rules</DOCTITLE>



On November 17, 1993, and on December 23, 1993, the Midwest Clearing Corporation (``MCC'') and the Midwest Securities
Trust Company (``MSTC'') respectively filed proposed rule changes (File Nos. SR-MCC-93-07 and
SR-MSTC-93-14) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') pursuant to Section
19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'').
 MCC amended its proposal on December 23, 1993, thereby making it virtually identical to that of MSTC. On January 3,
1994, MCC submitted a second amendment, a letter of clarification.
 Notice of the proposals was published in the 

Federal Register

 on March 3, 1994.
 On May 11, 1994, MCC submitted its third amendment, and MSTC submitted its first amendment.
 On July 8, 1994, MCC submitted its fourth amendment, and MSTC submitted its second amendment.
 On September 22, 1994, MCC submitted its fifth amendment, and MSTC submitted its third amendment.
 No comments on the proposals have been received by the Commission. This order approves the proposed rule changes as
amended.












I. Description of the Proposals



MCC and MSTC are modifying their By-Laws and Rules to define their participants' rights and obligations more precisely
and to give MCC and MSTC more flexibility and protection in dealing with violations of their rules.
 MCC and MSTC are adding new sections to their By-Laws to authorize MCC and MSTC to establish additional committees
as may be provided for in the By-Laws or Rules or may be established by their boards of directors. Such committees shall
have the duties and authority as prescribed for them by the By-Laws, the Rules, or the boards.





MCC and MSTC are amending their Rules to provide for the establishment of risk assessment committees. Each risk assessment
committee will consist of four members. The risk assessment committees shall have such duties as may be assigned to
them by MCC's or MSTC's Rules or by their boards. Among other duties of the risk assessment committees, the amendments
require MCC and MSTC to consult with at least one member of their respective risk assessment committee before ceasing
to act for a participant.
 Three members of the risk assessment committees will hear all appeals of MCC and MSTC decisions to deny application
for membership or to cease to act for a participant. Previously, MCC and MSTC Rules required the boards to appoint a
panel to hear such appeals.







MCC and MSTC are adding provisions to their Rules to adopt formal standards of review for the hearing of appeals beyond
the risk assessment committees. The new standards provide that the decisions of the risk assessment committees cannot
be reversed, modified, or remanded by the boards if the factual conclusions in the risk assessment committees' decisions
are supported by substantial evidence and if such decisions are not arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941011-2-00127 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941011-2-00083 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The amendments bar MCC or MSTC participants from bringing legal proceedings, except for violations of federal securities
laws, against any officer, director, employee, or agent of MCC, MSTC, or the Chicago Stock Exchange (``CHX'') if such
officer, director, employee, or agent is acting on MCC, MSTC, or CHX business. These provisions do not prohibit MCC
or MSTC participants from suing MCC or MSTC for actions taken by officers, directors, employees, or agents. The provisions
only prohibit suits against such persons in their capacities as individuals.
The proposed rule changes add provisions that limit the liability of MCC and MSTC to participants for losses arising
from the nonperformance or misperformance of MCC's or MSTC's duties except (1) for losses attributable to MCC's or
MSTC's negligence with respect to the safeguarding of securities or funds in MCC's or MSTC's custody or control and
(2) for losses attributable to the willful misconduct, gross negligence, bad faith, or fraudulent or criminal acts
of MCC, MSTC, their officers, directors, employees, or agents with respect to all other activities. The limitation
of MCC and MSTC liability does not apply to violations of federal securities laws. The amendments also provided that
any MCC or MSTC participant that fails to prevail in a legal proceeding brought by such participant against MCC or MSTC
or any of their officers, directors, employees, or agents shall be required to pay MCC or MSTC all reasonable expenses,
including legal fees, incurred by MCC or MSTC in such proceedings but only if such expenses exceed $50,000.


II. Discussion


The Commission believes that the proposals are consistent with the Act and particularly with Section 17A of the Act.
 Section 17A(b)(3)(H) requires that the rules of clearing agencies provide fair procedures with respect to disciplining
participants and denying participation to any persons seeking participation in a clearing agency.
 By establishing standing risk assessment committees, by requiring that such committees hear all appeals of MCC and
MSTC decisions to deny application for membership or to cease to act for a participant, and by setting forth specific
standards of review for appeals of the risk assessment committees' decisions, the proposals appear to provide fair
procedures as required by Section 17A(b)(3)(H). Furthermore, the proposals also should enhance certainty and consistency
in the operations of MCC and MSTC by providing that the decisions of the risk assessment committees cannot be reversed,
modified, or remanded by the boards if the conclusions are within the parameters discussed earlier.





Finally, the proposed rule changes also contain several modifications to MCC's and MSTC's rules regarding MCC's
and MSTC's standards of care and limitations of liability. By setting forth definite statements of MCC's and MSTC's
standards of care and limitations of liability, the proposals should increase the general operating efficiency
of MCC and MSTC.
The Commission believes that the provisions that require participants who are unsuccessful in suits against MCC
or MSTC must pay MCC's or MSTC's legal expenses under certain circumstances are consistent with the requirements
of Section 17A(b)(3)(D) of the Act which requires that the rules of a clearing agency provide for the equitable allocation
of reasonable dues, fees and other charges among its participants.
 Because the proposals allow MCC and MSTC to shift the financial burden of unsuccessful litigation to the responsible
participant, the proposals appear to be consistent with this statutory objective. The Commission also believes
that the rule changes should not provide an undue disincentive to litigation because MCC's and MSTC's expenses must
be reasonable and must exceed $50,000 before a participant member will be obligated to compensate MCC or MSTC.




The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule changes prior to the thirtieth day after the date of
publication of notice of the filing of the amendments. Because the Commission has not received any comments with regard
to its notice of the proposals as originally filed and does not foresee receiving any adverse comments regarding the
subsequent amendments and because the subsequent amendments generally narrowed the scope of the original proposals
and made clarifying and technical changes, the Commission finds it appropriate to approve the proposals prior to
the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of the filing of the amendments.


III. Solicitation of Comments


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW,, Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submissions, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule changes that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule changes between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW, Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal offices of MCC and MSTC. All submissions should refer to File Nos. SR-MCC-93-07
and SR-MSTC-93-14) and should be submitted by November, 1, 1994.


IV. Conclusion




It is therefore ordered

, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the above-mentioned proposed rule changes (File Nos. SR-MCC-93-07 and SR-MSTC-93-14)
be, and hereby, are, approved.




For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc.,
Relating to By-Law Articles IX and X Respecting the Trustees of the Stock Exchange Fund and the Executive Committee</DOCTITLE>





October 3, 1994.





On July 8, 1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PHLX'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposal to amend Section 9-1, ``Trustees of Stock Exchange Fund_How Appointed'' of Article IX, ``Trustees
of Stock Exchange Fund'' of the Exchange's By-Laws to allow two members of the Exchange's Board of Governors (``Board''),
rather than two Vice Chairmen, to serve as trustees of the Stock Exchange Fund (``Fund'') and to allow qualified non-members
to serve as trustees. In addition, the PHLX proposes to amend Section 10-13, ``Executive Committee,'' of By-Law
Article X, ``Standing Committees,'' to delete the requirement that the Executive Vice President of the Exchange
serve on the Exchange's Executive Committee.







Notice of the proposal appeared in the 

Federal Register

 in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34567 (August 19, 1994), 59 FR 44211 (August 26, 1994). No comment letters were
received on the proposal.


Currently, Section 9-1 of the Exchange's By-Laws requires that the trustees of the Fund include the Chairman
of the Exchange's Board, two Vice Chairmen of the Board and up to five other Exchange members; all of the trustees, except
the Chairman, are appointed by the Exchange's Board and serve for three years or until a successor is appointed. The
PHLX proposes to amend Section 9-1 to allow two members of the Exchange's Board, rather than two Vice Chairmen,
to serve as trustees of the Fund and to allow qualified non-members to serve as trustees. Under Section 9-1, as
amended, the trustees of the Fund will include the Chairman of the Board and two members of the Board. The remaining
five trustees, pursuant to the proposal, can be either members, non-members, or a combination from these two categories.



In addition, the PHLX proposes to amend Section 10-13, ``Executive Committee,'' of By-Law Article X, ``Standing
Committees,'' to delete the requirement that the Executive Vice President of the Exchange serve on the Exchange's
Executive Committee.










The PHLX states that the proposal to amend By-Law Article IX, Section 9-1, will give the Exchange's Board more
flexibility in choosing trustees of the Fund by eliminating the requirement that all trustees be Exchange members
or affiliated with member organizations. Under the proposal, the Board will be able to choose qualified persons with
investment management expertise regardless of their status as Exchange members or affiliates.








The proposed amendment will also eliminate the requirement that the Exchange's Vice Chairmen serve as Fund trustees,
to ease the administrative burdens currently imposed upon the Vice Chairmen. The proposal retains the Board's oversight
of the trustees by continuing to require the Chairman of the Board to be a trustee and by imposing a new requirement that
two other members of the Board be trustees.


The proposed amendment to By-Law Article X, Section 10-13 deletes the Executive Vice President of the PHLX from
membership on the Exchange's Executive Committee while increasing the minimum number of Board members on the Executive
Committee from three to four. The PHLX states that the Exchange's management will continue to be represented on the
Executive Committee by the Exchange's President and Chief Executive Officer. Under Section 10-13, as amended,
the other members of the Executive Committee shall include the Chairman of the Board, two Vice Chairmen of the Board,
the immediate past Chairman of the Board, and four or more additional members of the Board appointed by the Chairman
of the Board with the Board's approval.


The PHLX believes that the proposal is consistent with Section 6 of the Act, in general, and, in particular with Section
6(b)(3), in that it is designed to assure a fair representation of the Exchange's members in the administration of
its affairs and to provide that one or more Fund trustees may be representatives not associated with a member of the
Exchange.








The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements
of Section 6(b)(3) in that it is designed to assure the fair representation of the Exchange's members in the administration
of its affairs.
 Specifically, the Commission believes that the proposed amendments to Section 9-1 are designed to provide
the PHLX's Board with greater flexibility in the selection of Fund trustees by allowing the Board to appoint qualified
non-members to serve as trustees of the Fund, thereby allowing non-members with investment expertise to serve as
Fund trustees. In addition, the Commission believes that it is reasonable for the PHLX to eliminate the requirement
that the Exchange's Vice Chairmen serve as Fund trustees in order to ease the administrative duties of the Vice Chairmen.
At the same time, the Commission notes that the proposal requires two members of the Board, as well as the Chairman of
the Board, to serve as Fund trustees, thus helping to ensure that the Board will retain its oversight of the Fund.

In addition, the Commission believes that it is reasonable for the PHLX to amend Section 10-13 to eliminate the
PHLX's Executive Vice President from membership on the Exchange's Executive Committee in order to allow the PHLX's
management to be represented on the Executive Committee. Although the proposal also increases the minimum number
of Board members who are required to be on the Executive Committee from three to four, the Commission does not believe
this change should substantially affect the governance of the Exchange.
 The Commission believes that the proposal should make the structure of the Executive Committee less cumbersome and
help to streamline the Executive Committee's proceedings while preserving the participation of the PHLX's management
on the Executive Committee.







It is therefore ordered, 

pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (SR-PHLX-94-36) is approved.







For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; The Depository Trust Company; Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated
Approval on a Temporary Basis of Proposed Rule Change Implementing the Prime Broker Option in the Institutional Delivery
System</DOCTITLE>



October 3, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 notice is hereby given that on September 12, 1994, The Depository Trust Company (``DTC'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change (File No. SR-DTC-94-13) as
described in Items I and II below, which Items have been prepared primarily by DTC. The Commission is publishing this
notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons and to grant accelerated approval
of the proposed rule change on a temporary basis through May 31, 1995.






I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The proposed rule change involves the primary broker option in DTC's Institutional Delivery (``ID'') system and
will permit DTC's ID system to be used for the confirmation and affirmation of trades which are to be settled by prime
brokers. The proposed rule change also includes a procedure whereby prime brokers can disaffirm trades which they
previously had affirmed.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, DTC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule
change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined
at the place specified in Item IV below. DTC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of
the most significant aspects of such statements.



(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its letter dated January 25, 1994, to the Prime Brokerage Committee of the Securities Industry Association (``Prime
Brokerage Committee''), the Division of Market Regulation (``Division'') specified certain conditions for providing
prime brokerage services, including requiring that the parties to a prime broker arrangement utilize the facilities
of a clearing agency registered pursuant Section 17A of the Act
 to confirm and affirm prime broker transactions.
 DTC is a clearing agency registered pursuant to Section 17A of the Act. The proposed rule change contains procedures
which will permit DTC's ID system to be used to comply with the Division's prime broker letter and to facilitate the
option of settling affirmed prime broker trades through the National Securities Clearing Corporation's (``NSCC'')
continuous net settlement (``CNS'') system.






A prime broker is a broker-dealer participating in the ID system that provides a custodial facility for institutional
customers. Under the proposed rule change, broker-dealers that are members of both DTC and the NSCC and that participate
in DTC's ID system and NSCC's CNS system, will have the option to settle affirmed prime broker trades through the ID
system or through NSCC's CNS system. A common member executing trades on behalf of an institutional customer (``executing
broker'') will report trade details to DTC for initial processing through the ID system. At the time of submission,
the executing broker will be required to determine whether a trade will settle on a trade-for-trade basis through
the ID system or through CNS. If the executing brokers choose the former, the trade will settle through DTC's customary
ID procedures. If the executing brokers chooses to settle the trade through CNS, they will submit a prime broker's
CNS agent ID number to DTC when reporting the details of the trade.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941011-2-00132 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941011-2-00086 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

After the executing broker reports a trade to DTC using a prime broker's CNS number, DTC will complete its usual ID confirmation
and affirmation processing. Conformations will be issued by the morning of the next business day after the trade date.
The prime broker will affirm the trade if their information matches the information received from the executing brokers.
 The trades then will be submitted to NSCC through CCF
 on the night of T+2 for clearance and settlement following normal CNS settlement procedures.






Trades entered into the CNS system will settle like routine CNS trades. NSCC will combine prime brokers' and executing
brokers' positions with their other respective CNS positions in securities of the same issue to arrive at a net deliver
or net receive obligation for each issue. After establishing such net deliver or net receive obligations for the prime
brokers and executing brokers, NSCC will guarantee their respective obligations. Pursuant to NSCC's standard CNS
procedures, money settlement for these trades will occur at NSCC while deliveries of securities will occur at DTC.

The proposed rule change also includes procedures whereby prime brokers can disaffirm trades which they previously
had affirmed. A disaffirming prime broker will notify both DTC and the executing broker within identified DTC established
time frames through DTC's participants terminal system that a previously affirmed ID prime broker trade is being
disaffirmed. The prime broker simultaneously must call a director or vice president of DTC's ID department to alert
DTC of the disaffirmation. DTC will verify that each disaffirmation instruction matches an existing ID trade, and
on a ``best effort'' basis, DTC will attempt to contact the executing broker by telephone to inform it of the disaffirmation.
DTC then will determine the settlement mode of the trade to be disaffirmed (

e.g.,

 trade-for-trade or CNS). If the trades to be disaffirmed are scheduled to settle trade-for-trade or outside DTC and
NSCC, DTC is not required to take further action. For trade-for-trade settlement, prime brokers will not deliver
on the sell side or will reclaim the transaction on the buy side. For trades settling outside DTC and NSCC, prime brokers
will block settlement through their agents or correspondents.
If the disaffirmed trades are scheduled to settle in CNS, DTC will fax disaffirmation information to the proper department
at NSCC, and DTC will confirm the information with telephone calls to NSCC. NSCC will acknowledge disaffirmation
instructions in writing to DTC, and NSCC will effect journal entries to reverse the settlement obligations of the
prime brokers and will reestablish the settlement obligations of the executing brokers. On a best effort basis, NSCC
will telephone the executing brokers to advise them of the disaffirmation. Prior to the June 1995 conversion to three
business days as the standard settlement period,
 DTC will develop an automated mechanism that prime brokers can utilize to disaffirm previously affirmed trades.

DTC believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of Section 17A of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to DTC because the proposed rule change will promote efficiencies in the clearance
and settlement of prime broker trades. The proposed rule change will be implemented consistently with the safeguarding
of securities and funds in DTC's custody or control or for which it is responsible because the proposed rule change
will be implemented as an option in DTC's ID system.


(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


DTC perceives no impact on competition by reason of the proposed rule change.


(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others


The proposed rule change has been discussed with the Prime Brokerage Committee. Written comments from DTC Participants
or others have not been solicited or received on the proposed rule change.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


Section 17A(a)(1)(C) of the Act sets forth Congress findings that new data processing and communications techniques
create the opportunity for more efficient, effective, and safe procedures for clearance and settlement.
 Section 17A(a)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act directs the Commission to facilitate the establishment of linked or coordinated
facilities for the clearance and settlement of securities transactions.
 The Commission believes the proposed rule change will further these goals by facilitating the confirmation and affirmation
of prime broker transactions through DTC's ID system and by facilitating the settlement of prime broker trades through
either DTC or NSCC. Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act requires that rules of a clearing agency promote the prompt and
accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions and assure the safeguarding of securities and funds
which are in the custody or control of the clearing agency or for which it is responsible.
 The Commission believes that the proposal is consistent with DTC's responsibilities under Section 17A of the Act
because the proposal will facilitate the option of having prime broker trades settled in NSCC's CNS system, which
should promote efficiency by having those trades netted with the prime brokers' and executing brokers' other positions
in the same security. The Commission further believes that the proposal is consistent with DTC's responsibility
to safeguard securities and funds because utilizing the ID system for confirming, affirming, and disaffirming prime
broker trades should help provide standardized procedures by which the respective parties can perform their duties
in settling prime broker transactions.






DTC has requested that the Commission find good cause for approving the proposed rule changes prior to the thirtieth
day after the date of publication of notice of the filing. The Commission finds good cause for so approving the proposed
rule because accelerated approval will enable prime brokers and executing brokers to confirm and affirm prime broker
transactions through the ID system and to have the option to settle these trades in CNS as soon as possible. Furthermore,
accelerated approval will allow the effective date of the temporary approval of DTC's prime broker option to coincide
with the effective date of the prime broker letter issued by the Division.
 In addition, the Commission previously published notice of a similar DTC proposal
 that sought to establish the same prime broker option as is the subject of this current filing; the earlier proposed
rule change did not generate any comment letters, and none are expected on DTC's current proposal.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc.,
Relating to the Quote Spread Parameters for National Over-the-Counter Index (``XOC'') Options</DOCTITLE>



October 3, 1994.



On June 13, 1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PHLX'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (``Act''),
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change to amend PHLX Rule 1014, ``Obligations and Restrictions Applicable to Specialists and Registered
Options Traders,'' and PHLX Floor Procedure Advice (``Advice'') F-6, ``Option Quote Spread Parameters,''
to establish the following maximum quote spreads for National Over-the-Counter Index (``XOC'') options: $2.00
for XOC options with bids of $20.00 to less than $40.00; and $3.00 for XOC options with bids of $40.00 or more.






Notice of the proposed appeared in the 

Federal Register

 on July 25, 1994.
 Prior to the filing of the proposal with the Commission, the PHLX received one comment letter.






</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941011-2-00137 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941011-2-00088 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Currently, PHLX Rule 1014 and Advice F-6 establish a maximum quote spread of $1.00 for index options with bids
of $20.00 or more. The PHLX proposes to amend the quote spread parameters for XOC options to establish the following
parameters for XOC options with bids of $20.00 or more: $2.00 for XOC options with bids of $20.00 to less than $40.00;
and $3.00 for XOC options with bids of $40.00 or more.
According to the PHLX, recent volatility in the XOC caused floor officials to temporarily widen the quote spreads
for XOC options pursuant to Advice F-6.
 The Exchange proposes to codify these wider quote spread parameters for higher-priced XOC series.




The PHLX states that the purpose of the wider quotations is to reflect the wider bid/ask differential in the over-the-counter
(``OTC'') securities underlying the XOC, which market participants purchase in order to hedge XOC exposure. According
to the Exchange, the aggregate bid/ask differential for the XOC's component securities is often greater than $5.00.





The PHLX states that the bid/ask differential in XOC options is particularly problematic with respect to higher-priced
option series because the higher bids represent a greater premium dollar value and thus more risk. Thus, the Exchange
notes that a $40.00 bid represents a $4,000 premium. Accordingly, the Exchange proposes to widen the XOC quote spread
parameter only for higher-priced series. Moreover, the PHLX notes that the XOC series priced at $20.00 or less are
most often chosen for investment by public customers (

i.e., 

``customers'' who are not associated with broker-dealer organizations or subject to discretionary authorization
by associated persons of broker-dealers).





The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 6 of the Act, in general, and, in particular
with section 6(b)(5), in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, prevent fraudulent
and manipulative acts and practices, as well as to protect investors and the public interest, because widening higher-priced
XOC quote spread parameters should facilitate hedging, and, in turn, liquidity.
The Commission has considered carefully the opinions of the commenter and the PHLX and finds, for the following reasons,
that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder
applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of section 6(b)(5) in that the
proposal is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade.
 Specifically, the Commission believes that the proposal to establish wider quote spread parameters for XOC options
priced at over $20 is designed to facilitate hedging in higher-priced XOC options, thereby helping XOC specialists
to meet their affirmative market making obligations and providing for increased liquidity in higher-priced XOC
series. According to the PHLX, the aggregate bid/ask differential for the securities underlying the XOC is $5-6,
while the current bid/ask differential for XOC options priced at over $20 is $1. The PHLX states that the proposed quotations
for XOC options priced at over $20 are designed to reflect the wider bid/ask differential of the securities underlying
the XOC, which market participants purchase to hedge XOC exposure. Thus, the PHLX believes that the wider quote spread
parameters will facilitate hedging of high-priced XOC options.

<DOCNO> FR941011-2-00138 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941011-2-00088 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In addition, the PHLX states that volatility in the XOC has caused floor officials to grant temporary relief pursuant
to Advice F-6 to allow wider quote spreads in the XOC. In light of the volatility of the XOC, the bid/ask differential
of the underlying securities, and the high value of the XOC,
 the Commission believes that its is reasonable, under these limited circumstances, for the PHLX to widen the quote
spread parameters for XOC series priced at $20 or more. The Commission notes, however, that the proposal established
maximum allowable quote spreads and that it applies solely to XOC options priced at $20 or more; the Commission expects
the PHL to allow the use of the maximum quote spreads only where market conditions justify their application. 





In addition, the Commission notes that under PHLX Rule 1014, ``Obligations and Restrictions Applicable to Specialists
and Registered Options Traders,'' XOC specialists' transactions should constitute a course of dealings reasonably
calculated to contribute to the maintenance of a fair and orderly market. Accordingly, the Commission expects the
PHLX to monitor trading in XOC options affected by the proposal to ensure that there is adequate market market activity
in those series and to ensure that market are meeting their obligations to maintain fair and orderly markets. Accordingly,
the commission expects the PHLX to monitor trading in XOC options affected by the proposal to ensure that there is adequate
market make activity in those series and to ensure that market makers are meeting their obligations to maintain fair
and orderly markets. 



It is therefore ordered, 

pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule changed is approved. 



For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Issuer Delisting; Notice of Application To Withdraw From Listing and Registration (Sbarro, Inc., Common Stock,
$0.01 Par Value); File No. 1-8881</DOCTITLE>


October 4, 1994.


Sbarro, Inc. (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''),
pursuant to Section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d2-2(d) promulgated thereunder,
to withdraw the above specified security from listing and registration on the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'').
The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing this security from listing and registration include the following:
According to the Company, in addition to being listed on the Amex, its common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange,
Inc. (``NYSE''). The Company's common stock commenced trading on the NYSE at the opening of business on September
23, 1994 and concurrently therewith such stock was suspended from trading on the Amex.
In making the decision to withdraw its common stock from listing on the Amex, the Company considered the direct and
indirect costs and expenses attendant in maintaining the dual listing of its common stock and the debentures on the
NYSE and on the Amex. The Company does not see any particular advantage in the dual trading of its stock and believes
that dual listing would fragment the market for the common stock.
Any interested person may, on or before October 26, 1994, submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been
made in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the
protection of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the
application after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter.

<DOCTITLE>Van Kampen Merritt Equity Opportunity Trust, Series 1, et al.; Notice of Application</DOCTITLE>


October 4, 1994.


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'').



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of application for exemption under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (``Act'').






APPLICANT: 

Van Kampen Merritt Equity Opportunity Trust, Series 1 and subsequent series (the ``Trust''), and Van Kampen Merritt
or a sponsor controlled by or under common control with Van Kampen Merritt (the ``Sponsor'').



RELEVANT ACT SECTIONS: 

Exemption requested under section 6(c) from sections 14(a) and 19(b), and rule 19b-1 thereunder.


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: 

Applicants seek an order that would exempt the Sponsor from having to take for its own account or place with others $100,000
worth of units in the Trust, and permit the Trust to distribute capital gains dividends along with the Trust's other
distributions.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee from the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.



Applicants' Representations




1. The Trust will consist of a series of unit investment trusts, each of which will be similar but separate, and designated
by a different series number (``Trust Series''). Each Trust Series will invest exclusively in equity securities
(including common and preferred stocks) or in equity securities and zero coupon obligations. The objectives of the
Trust series will vary in accordance with the nature of their respective portfolios. Each Trust Series will be registered
under the Act, and under the Securities Act of 1933 by a registration statement on Form S-6.

2. Each Trust Series will be created pursuant to a trust agreement that will contain information specific to that Trust
Series and that will incorporate by reference the master trust indenture between the Sponsor and a financial institution
that is a bank within the meaning of section 2(a)(5) of the Act and that satisfies the criteria in section 26(a) of the
Act (the ``Trustee''). The trust agreement and the master trust indenture are referred to collectively as the ``Trust
Agreement.''

3. The Sponsor will perform the normal functions of a unit investment trust sponsor. The Sponsor will deposit the zero
coupon obligations, if any, and equity securities (collectively, ``Securities'') in the Trust Series at the price
determined by an independent evaluator. The Sponsor expects to deposit in each Trust Series substantially more than
$100,000 aggregate value of equity securities or zero coupon obligations and equity securities. All zero coupon
obligations in any one Trust Series will have essentially identical maturities, and the Sponsor will purchase all
Securities from third parties.

<PARENT> FR941011-2-00091 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

4. Simultaneously with the deposit of Securities in a Trust Series, the Trustee will deliver to the Sponsor registered
certificates for units (the ``Units'') that will represent the entire ownership of the Trust Series (owners of such
Units are hereinafter referred to as ``Unitholders''). The Units in turn will be offered for sale to the public following
the effectiveness of the registration statement relating to the Trust Series and clearance by the securities authorities
of the various states. Applicants intend to offer each Trust Series to the public initially at prices based on the closing
sale prices of listed equity securities and the asking prices of over-the-counter traded equity securities selected
for deposit in the Trust Series, plus the offering side value of the zero coupon obligations contained therein, if
any, plus a sales charge.

5. With the deposit of the Securities in the Trust Series containing zero coupon obligations on the initial date of
deposit, the Sponsor will have established a proportionate relationship between the zero coupon obligations and
equity securities in the Trust Series. The Sponsor will be permitted under the Trust Agreement to deposit additional
Securities, which may result in a potential corresponding increase in the number of Units outstanding. The Sponsor
anticipates that any addition Securities deposited in the Trust Series after the initial date of deposit will maintain
the proportionate relationship between the zero coupon obligations and equity securities in the Trust Series. The
original percentage relationships between zero coupon obligations and equity securities will be set forth in the
prospectus and in each Trust Agreement.

6. Each Trust Series that contains zero coupon obligations will be structured to ensure that, at the specified maturity
date for that Trust Series, the initial investors in such Trust Series will receive back at least the total amount of
their original investment in the Trust Series, including the sales charge. Thus, the principal value of the maturing
zero coupon obligations in each Trust Series will at least equal the original purchase price of the Units of such Trust
Series. Zero coupon obligations deposited in the Trust Series will be non-callable or callable at par.

7. The Trust Series will redeem Units at prices based on the aggregate bid side evaluation of the zero coupon obligations,
if any, and the closing sale prices of listed equity securities and the bid prices of over-the-counter traded equity
securities.

8. Although not obligated to do so, the Sponsor intends to maintain a secondary market for the Units. The existence
of such a secondary market will reduce the number of Units tendered to the Trustee for redemption and thus alleviate
the necessity of selling portfolio securities to raise the cash necessary to meet such redemptions. In the event that
the Sponsor does not maintain a secondary market, the Trust Agreement will provide that the Sponsor will not instruct
the Trustee to sell zero coupon obligations from any Trust Series that contains zero coupon obligations until equity
securities have been liquidated in order not to impair the protection provided by the zero coupon obligations, unless
the Trustee is able to sell such zero coupon obligations and still maintain at least the original proportional relationship
to Unit value. The Trust Agreement also will provide that zero coupon obligations may not be sold to meet Trust expenses.

Applicants' Legal Analysis



1. Section 14(a) of the Act generally requires investment companies to have $100,000 of net worth prior to making a
public offering. Rule 14a-3 thereunder exempts unit investment trusts from this provision if certain conditions
are complied with, one of which is that the trust invest only in ``eligible trust securities'' as defined in the rule.
The Trust may not rely on this rule because equity securities are not eligible trust securities.

2. The Sponsor will deposit substantially more than $100,000 of equity securities or zero coupon obligations and
equity securities in each Trust Series. However, applicants acknowledge that the SEC has interpreted section 14(a)
as requiring that the initial capital investment in an investment company be made without any intention to dispose
of the investment. Under this interpretation, a Trust Series would not satisfy section 14(a) because of the Sponsor's
intention to sell all the Units thereof. Accordingly, applicants request an exemption from section 14(a). Applicants
will comply in all respects with the requirements of rule 14a-3, except that the Trust will not restrict its portfolio
investments to ``eligible trust securities.''

3. Section 19(b) and rule 19b-1 thereunder provide that no registered investment company may distribute long-term
gains more than once every twelve months. Applicants state that these provisions were designed to remove the temptation
to realize capital gains on a frequent and regular basis, and to eliminate attempts by investment advisers to time
distributions to be advantageous to shareholders. Applicants also indicate that there was concern that investors
would be confused by a failure to distinguish between regular distributions of capital gains and distributions of
investment income.

4. Rule 19b-1(c), under certain circumstances, excepts a unit investment trust investing in ``eligible trust
securities'' as defined in rule 14a-3(b) from the requirements of rule 19b-1. Applicants believe that
this exception recognizes the danger of making manipulative capital gains distributions that would be to the detriment
of Unitholders is largely eliminated for unit investment trusts, as the conditions under which capital gains are
realized are beyond the control of the Sponsor, and capital gains are clearly identifiable. However, the Trust does
not qualify for the exemption in rule 19b-1(c) because it does not limit its investments to ``eligible trust
securities.'' Applicants therefore request an exemption from rule 19b-1 to the extent necessary to permit
capital gains earned in connection with the sale of equity securities to be distributed to Unitholders along with
the Trust's regular distributions.

5. Applicants assert that the dangers that section 19(b) and rule 19b-1 are designed to prevent do not exist in
the Trust. Any gains from the sale of equity securities would be triggered by the need to meet Trust expenses or by requests
to redeem Units, events over which the Sponsor and the Trust have no control. Applicants state that the Sponsor has
control over the actual redemption of Units to the extent it makes a market in Units. However, applicants also state
that the Sponsor has no incentive to redeem or permit the redemption of Units in order to generate capital gains for
the purpose section 19(b) or rule 19b-1 were designed to protect against. Aside from the fact that the Sponsor
intends to maintain a secondary market and that the current realization and distribution of gains is not an objective
of the Trust, applicants believe that cash generated from the sale of equity securities will be used to pay expenses
and meet redemptions and will not generate distributions to Unitholders. Moreover, applicants state that since
principal distributions are clearly indicated in accompanying reports to Unitholders as a return of principal and
are relatively small in comparison to normal distributions, there is little danger of confusion from failure to differentiate
among distributions.

6. Applicants believe that the requested exemption is consistent with the purposes and policies of the Act, and would
be in the best interests of the Unitholders.



Applicants' Condition



Applicants agree to the following as a condition to the granting of the requested relief:

Applicants will comply in all respects with the requirements of rule 14a-3, except that the Trust will not restrict
its portfolio investments to ``eligible trust securities.''

issues.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Federal Aviation Administration has established an Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC) (56 FR 219,
January 22, 1991; and 58 FR 9230, February 19, 1993). One area of the ARAC deals with airport certification issues.


Task


Specifically, the working group's tasks are the following:
Review Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 14, Chapter I, Part 139 and supporting material, previous studies
and surveys, procedures and interpretations for the purpose of determining if it would be appropriate to undertake
rulemaking and/or develop policy relative to performing friction measurement to be used in the maintenance of air
carrier runway surfaces; and
Review CFR Title 14, Chapter I, Part 139 and Advisory Circular 150/5340-18C, ``Standards for Airport Sign Systems,''
and supporting material for the purpose of developing a notice of proposed rulemaking which would require these distance
remaining signs at some or all the airports certificated under part 139.
If deemed appropriate, draft for ARAC notices of proposed rulemaking for each task proposing new or revised requirements,
supporting economic analyses and other required analyses, advisory and guidance material, and any other collateral
documents the working group determines to be needed.


Reports


A. Recommend time line(s) for completion of the tasks, including rationale, for consideration at the meeting of the
ARAC to consider airport certification issues held following publication of this notice.
B. Give a detailed conceptual presentation on the proposed recommendation to the ARAC before proceeding any further
with the tasks.
C. Give a status report on the tasks at each meeting of the ARAC held to consider airport certification issues.
The Friction Measurement and Signing Working Group will be comprised of experts from those organizations having
an interest in the task assigned. A working group member need not necessarily be a representative of one of the member
organizations of ARAC. An individual who has expertise in the subject matter and wishes to become a member of the working
group should write the person listed under the caption 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT

 expressing that desire, describing his or her interest in the task, and the expertise he or she would bring to the working
group. The request will be reviewed with the Assistant Chair of the ARAC for airport certification issues and the Chair
of the Friction Measurement and Signing Working Group, and the individual will be advised whether or not the request
can be accommodated.
The Secretary of Transportation has determined that the formation and use of the ARAC are necessary in the public interest
in connection with the performance of duties imposed on the FAA by law. Meetings of the ARAC to consider airport certification
issues will be open to the public except as authorized by section 10(d) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Meetings
of the Friction Measurement and Signing Working Group will not be open to the public, except to the extent that individuals
with an interest and expertise are selected to participate. No public announcement of working group meetings will
be made.
