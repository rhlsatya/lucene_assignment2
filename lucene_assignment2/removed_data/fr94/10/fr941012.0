</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This action modifies the Class E airspace at the Harper Municipal Airport, Harper, Kansas. Prior to the Airspace Reclassification,
the Class E airspace for Harper, Kansas, was designed to exclude that airspace east of 98 degrees longitude. However,
during Airspace Reclassification, the excluded area, including the Bob Park Airport (private), was inadvertently
omitted. The intended effect of this action is to exclude the Class E airspace east of 98 degrees longitude above the
Bob Park Airport (private) located northeast of Harper, Kansas. The area will be depicted on aeronautical charts
to provide a reference for pilots operating in the area.

Authorization of Bonded Carriers to 
Transport Cargo Within Port Limits Without 
Obtaining Cartman's License 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Customs Service, Treasury. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document amends the Customs Regulations to allow bonded carriers to transport merchandise within port limits
without having to obtain a cartman's license. It also amends the regulations to allow the operators of foreign trade
zones, container station and centralized examination stations and the proprietors of bonded warehouses to transport
merchandise from within the district to their respective facilities. These amendments will result in savings of
time and money for both the trade and Customs. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


Customs requires that the carriage of imported merchandise, for which duty has not yet been paid, only be accomplished
by certain bonded carriers. A cartman is one who undertakes to transport goods or merchandise within the limits of
a port. A lighterman is one who transports goods or merchandise on a barge, scow, or other small vessel to or from a vessel
within the port or from place to place within a port. The regulations regarding cartage and lighterage of merchandise
are set forth in Part 125 of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR Part 125). The regulations regarding the bonding of carriers
which receive merchandise for transportation in bond, and the licensing of cartmen and lightermen are set forth in
Part 112 of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR Part 112). 
Currently, pursuant to   112.2(b) and 112.21, Customs Regulations, Customs requires a bond and a license
to transact business as a cartman or a lighterman for the cartage or lighterage of merchandise entered for warehouse,
designated for examination, taken to container stations, or taken into custody as unclaimed. 
On October 29, 1992, Customs published a Notice of Proposed 
Rulemaking (NPRM) in the 

Federal Register

 (57 FR 49049) proposing to consider within port transfers by cartmen and lightermen like other in-bond movements
and to allow bonded carriers, in most instances, to carry in-bond cargo within a port without requiring them to obtain
cartman or lighterman licenses. 
According to the document, it was proposed that cartage and lighterage of merchandise designated for examination,
taken to container stations, taken into custody as unclaimed or destined for admission to a foreign trade zone either
may be done under the bond of a licensed cartman or lighterman, or if approved by the district director, under the bond
of a foreign trade zone operator, container station operator, centralized examination station operator, or a bonded
carrier. However, a license would still be necessary to obtain to carry in-bond merchandise within a port for the cartage
of merchandise entered for warehouse; the reason for this exception was that 19 U.S.C. 1565 contained a statutory
requirement that a cartman be licensed for cartage of merchandise entered for warehouse. Customs issued the proposal
because it believes that the elimination of the license requirement will save Customs and the trade time and money.



Statutory Change Since Proposal 


On December 8, 1993, the President signed the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (Pub. L. 103-182,
107 Stat. 2057). Section 666 of Title VI (Customs Modernization) amended 19 U.S.C. 1565 to allow the cartage of merchandise
entered for warehouse by bonded carriers as well as by licensed cartmen. Accordingly, the statement in the proposal
that a license is required to transact business as a cartman and lighterman for the cartage or lighterage of merchandise
entered for warehouse is no longer consistent with the statute. The statutory impediment to allowing the cartage
of merchandise entered for warehouse by bonded carriers that existed at the time the proposal was published no longer
exists.

Analysis of Comments 


A total of 19 entities responded to the proposal. Generally, each respondent supported the proposal and stated that,
if adopted, the proposal would eliminate unnecessary and redundant paperwork for both Customs and the trade, would
expedite the movement of cargo within port limits, and would be a positive step in simplifying Customs procedures.
Of the 19 commenters, seven fully supported the measure. The remaining commenters, although generally supportive
of the purpose of the proposed amendments, suggested some changes. Some sought clarification regarding the types
of cartage authorized to be performed by the operators of foreign trade zones, centralized examination stations
and container stations. Specific comments requesting changes and clarifications and Customs responses are set
forth below. 


Comment: 

Seven commenters requested that the measure be expanded to include transfers between foreign trade zones and subzones,
whether within or adjacent to the same port of entry. 


Response: 

The regulations currently provide that cargo movements carried out outside the port limits but within the district
boundaries may be accomplished by a bonded carrier. This applies to transfers between foreign trade zones and subzones.
The final regulation set forth in this document provides that cargo destined for a foreign trade zone or subzone may
be picked up within the district by the operator of the foreign trade zone or subzone to which it is going. This is specified
by the new language for  112.2(b). 


Comment: 

One commenter requested a more liberal wording of the proposed language for 19 CFR 112.2. The language for 19 CFR 112.2
reads, in part: ``Cartage * * * may be done under the bond of a cartman, * * * or, if approved
by the district director, a bonded carrier * * *.'' The commenter felt that the proposed language would
still require companies with extensive route systems to submit an application of some sort in every Customs district
where they anticipate performing the cartman function. 


Response: 

In the future, approval of the bond of a bonded carrier by the district director would indicate approval by Customs
for the bonded carrier to engage in cartage. The rule would permit bonded carriers to transfer merchandise within
port limits without the need for an application or a cartman or lighterman license; therefore, there is no need to further
amend or adopt a more liberal wording of the proposed language in 19 CFR 112.2. 


Comment: 

Three commenters requested that 19 U.S.C. 1565 be amended to eliminate the requirement for cartmen licenses for cargo
movements into bonded warehouses. They suggested that such an amendment could be accomplished through the Customs
Modernization Act. 


Response: 

As noted previously in this document, section 666 of Title VI (Customs Modernization) of the North American Free Trade
Agreement Implementation Act (Pub. L. 103-182) amends 19 U.S.C. 1565 to eliminate the requirement for a cartman's
license for cargo movements into bonded warehouses. Any carrier designated as a carrier of bonded merchandise may
cart merchandise destined for entry into a bonded warehouse. The final regulation has been amended to reflect the
statutory amendment.

Comment:

 
One commenter suggested that Customs clarify whether a foreign trade zone operator is only entitled to engage in cartage
for a foreign trade zone, a container station operator only for a container station, a centralized examination station
(CES) operator only for a CES, and a bonded warehouse proprietor only for a bonded warehouse, while a licensed cartman
or bonded carrier would be entitled to engage in cartage for any of those facilities, and whether district directors
would be allowed some discretion in this matter. 


Response:

 
Customs agrees that the best policy is that a foreign trade zone operator would be limited to the transportation of
merchandise to his foreign trade zone, a container station operator to his container station, a CES operator to his
CES, and a bonded warehouse proprietor to his bonded warehouse. A licensed cartman or a bonded carrier would be entitled
to engage in transporting merchandise for any of those facilities, the cartman within the port limits and the carrier
within the district boundaries. Language to this effect has been inserted in the new  112.2(b). Once a district
director has approved the respective entity's bond, that entity may engage in transporting merchandise as provided
for in these regulations. 


Comment:

 
The commenter suggests that the conditions of the custodial bond in 19 CFR 113.63 and the foreign trade zone operators
bond in 19 CFR 113.73 should be revised to conform with the proposed change in 19 CFR 112.2(b). 


Response:

 
Section 113.63, Customs Regulations, has been altered slightly to conform with the changes. Regarding the foreign
trade zone operator's bond, Customs agrees that the current foreign trade zone operator's bond is inadequate to secure
the operator's performance with respect to movement of goods from one zone to another. Changes have been made to 19
CFR 113.73 in the final rule. 


Comment:

 
A commenter suggested that conforming changes referring to bonded carriers under 19 CFR 112.2(b) should be added
to 19 CFR 125.11 (a) and (b). 


Response:

 
Conforming changes have been made in the final rule. 


Comment:

 
One commenter suggested that the procedures in part 125 seem to refer principally to cartmen, lightermen and, as proposed
in the NPRM, bonded carriers. He suggests that procedures pertaining to bonded warehouse proprietors and to operators
of container stations, centralized examination stations, and foreign trade zones should be made clear in the final
rule. 


Response:

 
Customs agrees that procedures pertaining to cartage and lighterage by bonded warehouse proprietors and operators
of container stations, centralized examination stations and foreign trade zones should be included within part
125. Part 125 is amended accordingly.

Comment:

 One commenter observed that both bonded warehouses and foreign trade zones are facilities with specific boundaries.
He suggested that Customs make clear whether receipt of merchandise by bonded warehouse proprietors for the purpose
of cartage constitutes receipt into a bonded warehouse and whether receipt of merchandise by a foreign trade zone
operator for the purpose of cartage constitutes receipt into an activated foreign trade zone area and the conferring
of foreign trade zone status. 


 

Response:

 Receipt of merchandise for cartage purposes to a bonded warehouse by its proprietor or to a foreign trade zone by its
operator constitutes receipt into the bonded warehouse or admission into the foreign trade zone. Customs approval
of such transfers will continue to be accomplished through existing local procedures. 


 

Conclusion 


 

After careful consideration of the comments received and further review of the matter, it has been determined that
the proposed amendments, modified as discussed above, should be adopted. The final regulation will allow the cartage
and lighterage of merchandise for all purposes by bonded carriers without the necessity of obtaining a cartage license.
It will also allow bonded warehouse proprietors, foreign trade zone operators, container station operators and
centralized examination station operators to engage in limited cartage and lighterage under their respective bonds
and to transport merchandise to their respective facilities from anywhere in the district in which their facility
is located. 


 

Regulatory Flexibility Act and Executive Order 12866 


 

Pursuant to the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

) and based upon the information set forth above, it is certified that the regulations will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The regulations eliminate duplicative or otherwise unnecessary
paperwork requirements and thus reduce the regulatory burden. Accordingly, the regulations are not subject to the
regulatory analysis or other requirements of 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. 


 This document does not meet the criteria for a ``significant regulatory action'' as specified in Executive Order
12866. 


 

Paperwork Reduction Act 


 

The collection of information requirements contained in these final regulations have been reviewed and approved
by the Office of Management and Budget in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)) under
control number 1515-0193. The estimated average annual burden associated with this collection is .1666 hour
per respondent and 1 hour per recordkeeper. Comments concerning the accuracy of this burden estimate and suggestions
for reducing this burden should be directed to the U. S. Customs Service, Paperwork Management Branch, Room 6316,
1301 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20229, or the Office of Management and Budget, Attention: Desk 
Officer for the Department of the Treasury, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Washington, D. C. 20503.

or centralized examination station operator under the conditions specified in 
 112.2 of this chapter for limited cartage; if he does so, the importer must also designate that the merchandise
is bound for the facility run by the operator he designates. Approval of a designation shall be indicated on the entry

trade zone operator, bonded warehouse proprietor, container station operator or centralized examination station
operator, as provided for in  112.2 of this chapter, for the purpose, it shall be carted by a bonded carrier or
by a public store cartman authorized by contract or designated by the district director for that purpose. The cost
of such cartage shall be paid by the importer of the merchandise before its release from Customs custody.

New Animal Drugs for Use in Animal Feeds; Halofuginone Hydrobromide


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the animal drug regulations to reflect the approval of a supplemental
new animal drug application (NADA) filed by Roussel-Uclaf. The supplemental NADA provides for use of halofuginone
hydrobromide (Stenorol) in the feed of replacement cage laying chickens and replacement broiler breeder chickens
for the prevention of coccidiosis. 

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Roussel-Uclaf, Division Agro-Veterinaire, 163 Avenue Gambetta, 75020, Paris, France, is the sponsor of NADA 130-951,
represented by Hoechst-Roussel Agri-Vet Co., P.O. Box 2500, Rt. 202-206, Somerville, NJ 08876-1258.
The NADA provides for use of halofuginone hydrobromide (Stenorol) Type A medicated article to make Type C medicated
broiler feed used for the prevention of coccidiosis. The sponsor filed a supplemental application which provides
for the use of 2.72 grams per ton (3 parts per million) halofuginone hydrobromide for replacement cage layers and replacement
broiler breeders for the prevention of coccidiosis. The supplemental NADA is approved as of October 12, 1994 and the
regulations are amended in 21 CFR 558.265(c) to reflect the approval. The basis for approval is discussed in the freedom
of information summary.


This approval is for use of a Type A medicated article to make a Type C medicated feed. Halofuginone hydrobromide is
a Category II drug that, as provided in 21 CFR 558.4, requires an approved form FDA 1900 for making a Type C medicated
feed. Therefore, use of a halofuginone hydrobromide Type A article to make a Type C medicated feed as in NADA 130-951,
as supplemented, requires an approved form FDA 1900. 
In accordance with the freedom of information provisions of part 20 (21 CFR part 20) and  514.11(e)(2)(ii) (21
CFR 514.11(e)(2)(ii)), a summary of safety and effectiveness data and information submitted to support approval
of this application may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, rm.
1-23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b(c)(2)(F)(iii)), the
approval of this supplemental application qualifies for 3 years of marketing exclusivity beginning October 12,
1994 because the supplemental application contains reports of new clinical or field investigations (other than
bioequivalence or residue studies) or human food safety studies (other than bioequivalence or residue studies)
essential to the approval of the supplemental application and conducted or sponsored by the applicant.
The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the
action will not have a significant impact on the human environment and that an environmental impact statement is not
required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained in an
environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday.

II. Submission of the Proposed Amendment


By letter dated February 23, 1994 (Administrative Record No. OH-1990), the Ohio Department of Natural Resources,
Division of Reclamation (Ohio), submitted proposed Program Amendment Number 65 (PA 65). In that submission, Ohio
proposed to revise two rules in the Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) to correct outdated rule references and to adopt
language similar to corresponding Federal regulations concerning the availability of documents for public view.
As part of PA 65, Ohio provided a draft example of the public notice on availability of documents which Ohio would post
at one of the two locations specified by OAC section 1501:13-1-10(B).
OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the March 10, 1994, 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 11227), and, in the same document, opened the public comment period and provided an opportunity for a public
hearing on the adequacy of the proposed amendment. The public comment period closed on April 11, 1994.
By letter dated June 17, 1994 (Administrative Record No. OH-2029), OSM provided its comments to Ohio on the February
23, 1994, submission of PA 65. By letter dated July 20, 1994 (Administrative Record No. OH-2033), Ohio resubmitted
Program Amendment Number 65 Revised (PA 65R) which is intended to resolve the requirements in OSM's June 17, 1994,
letter. Ohio proposed new revisions to one rule and modified the draft example of the notice on the availability of
documents.
OSM reopened the public comment period in the August 5, 1994, 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 39994). The public comment period closed on August 22, 1994.
In response to a comment made by the Soil Conservation Service (SCS), United States Department of Agriculture (Ohio
Administrative Record No. OH-2056), OSM requested that Ohio provide a written statement for the Administrative
Record clarifying the points of agreement between the Division and the SCS. By letter dated September 23, 1994 (Ohio
Administrative Record No. OH-2058), Ohio provided OSM with its intentions regarding the filing of coal mining
related documents at SCS field offices.


III. Director's Findings


Set forth below, pursuant to SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17, are the Director's findings
concerning the proposed amendment to the Ohio program.

1. Corrected Rule Reference



OAC section 1501:13-1-05 establishes that, in the event of a consolidation or reorganization of offices
within the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR), the OAC rules which now apply to the Division of Reclamation
shall apply to and be the rules of any other Division or office which succeeds the Division of Reclamation as the administering
agency for Ohio Revised Code Chapter 1513. Ohio is revising this rule to expand the specific references to the Division
of Reclamation's rules to cover additional rules adopted by Ohio since OAC section 1501:13-1-05 was first
promulgated. There is no counterpart Federal rule. However, the Director finds that this revision will not render
the Ohio program inconsistent with the requirements of SMCRA and the Federal regulations.



2. Availability of Records



Ohio is revising OAC section 1501:13-1-10 paragraph (B)(2) to provide additional ways that members of
the public may review Ohio's permit, inspection, and enforcement documents. Ohio is proposing that local district
offices of the ODNR, Division of Reclamation, shall maintain copies of all documents pertaining to both existing
and proposed mining operations within their jurisdiction, or post for public inspection a description of the information
available for mailing and a procedure for obtaining such information. If Ohio does not maintain a district office
in the specific county of the existing or proposed mining operation, Ohio shall either:

(a) Make copies of all records, reports, inspection materials, and other subject information available for public
inspection at that county's office of the county recorder or at that county's office of the Soil Conservation Service
(SCS) of the United States Department of Agriculture; or

(b) Post, at that county's office of the county recorder or at that county's office of the SCS, a description of the documents
available for inspection and the procedure by which members of the public may request copies of these documents. At
its own expense, Ohio shall promptly provide copies of documents by mail upon request of any resident of the area of
the mining operation.

The counterpart Federal rule at 30 CFR 840.14(c) provides that the regulatory authority shall make copies of these
documents available for public inspection or maintain a description of the information available for mailing and
the procedure for obtaining such information at a Federal, State or local government office in the county where mining
is occurring or proposed to occur. The proposed rule provides Ohio with options for meeting the obligation to make
permitting documents available to the public in the county where mining is occurring or proposed to occur. The Director,
therefore, finds that the revised State rule is no less effective than 30 CFR 840.14(c).

Ohio has designed a public notice on availability of documents which Ohio would post at that county's office of the
county recorder or at that county's office of the SCS as specified in OAC section 1501:13-1-10(B)(2)(b).
This proposed notice clarifies that public comments on applicable permitting, inspection, enforcement, and regulatory
documents shall also be available for public inspection and copying. Ohio is also listing in the public notice the
counties which are under the jurisdiction of each of its five coal-regulatory district offices. The Director finds
that the proposed notice satisfies the requirements of and is no less effective than 30 CFR 840.14(c)(2).



IV. Summary and Disposition of Comments



Public Comments



The Director solicited public comments and provided an opportunity for a public hearing on the proposed amendment.
The Ohio Historic Preservation Office provided comments in support of the proposed amendment. No other public comments
were received, and because no one requested an opportunity to testify at a public hearing, no hearing was held.

Federal Agency Comments


Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), the Director solicited comments on the proposed amendment from various Federal
agencies with an actual or potential interest in the Ohio program.
The U.S. Department of Labor, Mine Safety and Health Administration, acknowledged the proposed amendment with no
comment. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service (SCS), expressed concern with the requirement
that copies of all records, reports, inspection materials, and other information be retained in SCS field offices.
The SCS noted that this could involve a substantial amount of information in some counties with accelerated mining
activity. However, the SCS was not against posting for public inspection a description of the information available
for mailing and a procedure for obtaining such information upon request by any resident of the area where mining is
occurring. Based on Ohio's letter dated September 23, 1994 (Administrative Record N. OH-2058), Ohio will make
sure that any approach for filing documents or posting notices at SCS offices would be acceptable to the SCS. As discussed
above, the Director has determined that Ohio's options for meeting the obligation to make permit, inspection, and
enforcement documents available to the public in the county where the mining is occurring or proposed to occur are
no less effective than the Federal regulations.
No other comments were received.


Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)


Under 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(ii), the Director is required to obtain the written concurrence of the EPA with respect
to any provisions of a State program amendment that relate to air or water quality standards promulgated under the
authority of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 

et seq.

) or the Clean Air Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 

et seq.

). None of the revisions that Ohio proposed to make in this amendment pertain to air or water quality standards. Therefore,
OSM did not request EPA's concurrence.
Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), OSM solicited comments on the proposed amendment from EPA (Administrative
Record No. OH-1993). The EPA responded on March 16, 1994, (Administrative Record No. OH-1999) that Ohio
should add language in its proposed amendment to cover both existing and proposed mining operations. The Director
notes that Ohio's revised amendment at OAC section 1501:13-1-05 (B)(2) and (B)(2)(b) covers both existing
and proposed mining operations and therefore satisfies EPA's concerns.

V. Director's Decision 


Based on the above findings, the Director approves the proposed program amendment as submitted by Ohio on February
23, 1994, and revised and resubmitted on July 20, 1994. 
The Federal regulations at 30 CFR Part 935 codifying decisions concerning the Ohio program are being amended to implement
this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State program amendment process
and to encourage States to conform their programs with the Federal standards without undue delay. Consistency of
State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA. 



VI. Procedural Determinations 


Executive Order No. 12866 



This final rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 (Management
Planning and Review). 



Executive Order 12778 



The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that, to the extent allowed by law, this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections
(a) and (b) of that section. However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory
programs and program amendments since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM.
Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1253 and 1255) and 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15 and 732.17(h)(10), decisions
on proposed State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the requirements
of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731 and 732 have been met. 



National Environmental Policy Act 



No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)). 



Paperwork Reduction Act 



This rule does not contain information collection requirements which require approval by OMB under the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 

et seq.). 



Regulatory Flexibility Act 



The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.

). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon corresponding Federal regulations for which
an economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements
previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule
would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the corresponding
Federal regulations.

Special Local Regulations; International America's Cup Class World Championships; San Diego Bay and Mission Bay,
CA



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Temporary final rule with request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Temporary special local regulations are being adopted for that portion of the International America's Cup Class
(IACC) World Championships that is being conducted in the waters of the Pacific Ocean adjacent to San Diego Bay and
Mission Bay between October 28, 1994 and November 6, 1994, inclusive. These regulations are necessary to provide
for the safety of life, property, and navigation on the navigable waters of the United States during the scheduled
events.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking was not published for this regulation and it is being
made effective in less than 30 days after 

Federal Register

 publication. Publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking and delaying the effective date of this regulation would
be contrary to the public interest since the event is expected to result in a high concentration of spectator and participant
vessels, and the actual stipulations of the special local regulations were not finalized in time for publication
more than 30 days prior to the start of the event.



Although this regulation is published as a final rule, without prior notice, an opportunity for public comment is
nevertheless desirable to ensure the regulation is both reasonable and workable. Accordingly, persons wishing
to comment may do so by submitting written comments to the office listed under 

ADDRESSES 

in this preamble. Those providing comments should identify the docket number (CCGD11-94-004) for the
regulation and also include their name, address and reason(s) for each comment presented. Persons wanting acknowledgment
of receipt of comments should enclose a stamped, self-addressed postcard or envelope.

Based upon the comments received, the scope of the regulation may be changed.



Drafting Information



The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Lieutenant Cam Lewis, Project Officer for the Patrol
Commander, and Lieutenant Robin Barber, Project Attorney, Eleventh Coast Guard District Legal Office.



Discussion of Regulation



The event prompting a need for these Special Local Regulations is the International America's Cup Class World Championships
which will be conducted in the San Diego area in October and November 1994. In addition, exhibition races will be held
on two dates in October and November 1994 within San Diego Bay; special local regulations establishing measures promoting
the safety of these exhibition race is the subject of separate rulemaking (CGD11-94-006).

These regulations are intended to promote safe navigation on the waters of San Diego Bay, Mission Bay and the IACC race
venue during the IACC World Championship Races by controlling the traffic entering, exiting and traveling within
these waters. The anticipated concentration of spectator and participant vessels associated with these races poses
a safety concern, which is addressed in these special local regulations.

A channel within San Diego Bay has been designated for the exclusive use of IACC vessels during specifically prescribed
hours. This channel (the America's Cup Channel) is adjacent to the dredged main ship channel and bounded by the shoreline
of North Island. 

Within the geographic area of applicability of these special local regulations, speed limits and operating requirements
have been established for orderly passage to and from the IACC shore facilities and race venue. The America's Cup Channel
passes through the Security Zone listed in 33 CFR 165.1105 adjacent to naval piers J through P on the western shore of
North Island. Participants, vessels carrying race officials, and patrol vessels may transit this Security Zone
during the periods these Special Local Regulations are in effect, unless otherwise notified through Broadcast Notice
to Mariners and by patrol vessels on scene.

Speed limits and operating requirements are also established for other vessel traffic operating within the regulated
areas during times when most IACC and spectator vessels are expected to transit the harbors. During these same times,
vessels shall not operate exclusively under sail within the regulated areas. 

The regulations also provide for a one-way traffic pattern and a five knot speed limit. These requirements will be
activated by the Patrol Commander when necessary to ensure the safety of navigation. Activation of these regulations
will be announced by patrol vessels on scene and by Broadcast Notice to Mariners.

Additionally, several non-anchorage areas are established for the period of these regulations to promote smooth
traffic flow and ensure access to docks and piers.

These Special Local Regulations will be enforced for that portion of the race venue which is located within the navigable
waters of the United States to minimize navigational dangers and ensure the safety of vessels participating in and
viewing the races. Nonobligatory guidelines are included for that portion of the race venue which falls outside the
navigable waters of the United States.

All vessels which fail to comply with this regulation while operating within the regulated areas during the regulatory
periods are subject to citation for failure to comply with this regulation, and subject to the penalties presented
in 33 U.S.C. 1236 and 33 CFR 100.50.



Regulatory Evaluation



This regulation is not a significant regulatory action under Section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under Section 6(a)(3) of that Order. It has been exempted from review
by the Office of Management and Budget under that Order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this regulation to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10(e) of the Department of Transportation
regulatory policies and procedures is unnecessary.



Collection of Information



This regulation contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C.
3501 

et seq.

).



Federalism. 

The Coast Guard has analyzed this regulation in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive
Order 12612 and has determined that this regulation does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

Environmental Assessment



The environmental impact of this regulation has been analyzed in the Environmental Assessment (EA) prepared by America's
Cup 1995, the organizing committee of the races, in connection with its application for a Coast Guard regatta permit.
A copy of the EA has been made a part of the public docket and is available for review at the Eleventh Coast Guard District
Offices at the address listed under 

ADDRESSES.



The Coast Guard has reviewed the EA submitted by the sponsors of the event, considered the environmental impact of
this regulation and concluded that, under section 2.B.2 of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, it will have no significant
environmental impact and it is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. A Finding of No
Significant Impact (FONSI) has been prepared in connection with the regatta permit, has been made part of the public
docket, and is available for review at the address listed under 

ADDRESSES.

and civilian vessels designated by the Coast Guard Patrol Commander and flying the official patrol vessel flag. The
official patrol vessel flag is a white rectangular flag emblazoned with the words ``America's Cup '95'' and depicting
two sailing vessels racing beneath the America's Cup trophy. The civilian vessels may include but are not limited
to AC'95 Crowd Control Vessels and media vessels. AC'95 Crowd Control vessels are 20-foot and 23-foot Bayliner power
boats identified by the word ``PATROL'', followed by a number, printed in large letters on both sides of the vessel.
AC'95 Crowd Control Vessels will fly the official patrol vessel flag and operate a yellow and red flashing light. 



Participant

. Any IACC race boat, IACC chase boat or IACC tender that is registered with AC'95 while in performance of its official
function relative to a given race. 



Patrol Commander

. A Patrol Commander has been designated by the Commander, Eleventh Coast Guard District. The Patrol Commander has
the authority to control the movement of all vessels operating in the regulated areas and may suspend the regatta at
any time it is deemed necessary for the protection of life and property. 

 




Note: 

The Patrol Commander may be contacted during the regulatory periods on VHF/FM Channel 16 (156.8 MHZ) or Channel 22
(157.1 MHZ) by calling ``Coast Guard Patrol Commander'' or ``Coast Guard San Diego.'' 

 




Spectator vessels

. All vessels not registered with the America's Cup '95 governing body (AC'95), the race sponsor, as a participant
and not designated as an AC'95 Vessel or an Official Vessel by the Coast Guard Patrol Commander are spectator vessels.


(c)

Mission Bay. 

The following regulations are in effect between the hours of 10 a.m. to 12 noon and 3:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. on October 28
and 29 November 1, 2 and 4, 1994, and as otherwise ordered by the Patrol Commander by Broadcast Notice to Mariners:

(i) Spectator and participant vessels shall not exceed five knots.

(ii) Spectator and participant sail vessels shall not operate exclusively under sail without the prior express permission
of the Patrol Commander.

(iii) When transiting through the regulated area is necessary, spectator vessels shall make expeditious transit
and shall not impede or obstruct the orderly flow of vessel traffic.

(iv) All vessels shall follow instructions of Coast Guard and Coast Guard Auxiliary vessels.

(3) 

IACC offshore race venue. 

The following regulations are in effect from 12 noon to 5:30 p.m. on October 28 and 29 and November 1, 2 and 4, 1994, and
as otherwise ordered by the Patrol Commander by Broadcast Notice to Mariners, within the IACC offshore race venue
which falls within the navigable waters of the United States, i.e., those waters within three nautical miles (3nm)
of the baseline from which the territorial sea is measured:

(i) Spectator vessels shall remain outside the course perimeter, as marked by the AC'95 Vessels and Official Vessels.

(ii) All vessels shall follow the instructions of Coast Guard and Coast Guard Auxiliary vessels.






Note: 

The regulations specified in this paragraph apply only within the navigable waters of the United States. In all waters
within the IACC offshore race venue which fall outside the navigable waters of the United States, during the specified
dates and times, the following nonobligatory guidelines apply:




(A) All spectator vessels should remain clear of the race venue and avoid interfering with any participant, AC'95
Vessels or Official Vessels. Interference with race activities may constitute a safety hazard warranting cancellation
or termination of all or part of the World Championship race activities by the Patrol Commander.

(B) Any unauthorized entry within the race course perimeter, as marked by the AC'95 Vessels and Official Vessels,
by spectator vessels constitutes a risk to the safety of marine traffic. Such entry will constitute a factor to be considered
in determining whether a person has operated a vessel in a negligent manner in violation of 46 U.S.C. 2302.

(4) 

One way traffic and five knot speed limit. 

The Patrol Commander may implement one-way traffic patterns and a five knot speed limit in the regulated areas or portions
thereof if the Patrol Commander deems it necessary to ensure safe navigation. Notice of one-way traffic and a five
knot speed limit shall be made by Broadcast Notice to Mariners. If one-way traffic patterns are implemented, spectator
and participant vessels are required to transit the applicable regulated area(s) in either an inbound direction
(proceeding into port) or an outbound direction (proceeding to sea). No traffic in any direction other than inbound
or outbound (i.e., cross traffic) will be permitted in the area of implementation. If a five knot speed limit or one-way
traffic is implemented, all participant and spectator vessels shall also abide by all other nonconflicting provisions
contained within these special local regulations associated with the regulated area. If a five knot speed limit is
implemented in San Diego Bay, all traffic entering or exiting the harbors will be required to make a speed of no more
than five knots through the water.

(d) 

Effective Dates. 

This section is effective 10 a.m. PDT on October 28, 1994 through 5:30 p.m. PST on November 6, 1994, inclusive, unless
cancelled earlier by the District Commander.

Temporary final rule with request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Temporary special local regulations are being adopted for that portion of the International America's Cup Class
(IACC) regatta and exhibition races that are being conducted within San Diego Bay (the Bay) between October 28, 1994
and November 6, 1994, inclusive. These regulations are necessary to provide for the safety of life, property, and
navigation on the navigable waters of the United States during the scheduled events.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking was not published for this regulation and it is being
made effective in less than 30 days after 

Federal Register 

publication. Publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking and delaying the effective date of this regulation would
be contrary to the public interest since the event is expected to result in a high concentration of spectator and participant
vessels, and the actual stipulations of the special local regulations were not finalized in time for publication
more than 30 days prior to the start of the event.



Although this regulation is published as a final rule, without prior notice, an opportunity for public comment is
nevertheless desirable to ensure the regulation is both reasonable and workable. Accordingly, persons wishing
to comment may do so by submitting written comments to the office listed under 

ADDRESSES 

in this preamble. Those providing comments should identify the docket number (CCGD11-94-006) for the
regulation and also include their name, address and reason(s) for each comment presented. Persons wanting acknowledgment
of receipt of comments should enclose a stamped, self-addressed postcard or envelope.

Drafting Information



The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Lieutenant Cam Lewis, Project Officer for the Patrol
Commander, and Lieutenant Robin Barber, Project Attorney, Eleventh Coast Guard District Legal Office.



Discussion of Regulation



The event prompting a need for these Special Local Regulations is the International America's Cup Class World Championships
which will be conducted within San Diego Bay in October and November 1994. In addition, ocean races will be conducted
in the Pacific Ocean offshore of San Diego in October and November 1994; special local regulations establishing measures
promoting the safety of these ocean races is the subject of separate rulemaking (CGD11-94-004).
/
These regulations are intended to promote safe navigation on the waters of San Diego Bay during the exhibition races
by controlling the traffic entering, exiting and traveling within these waters. The anticipated concentration
of spectator and participant vessels associated with these races poses a safety concern, which is addressed in these
special local regulations. 

During the regulatory period prescribed in these regulations, specified portions of San Diego Bay will be closed
to all vessel traffic except vessels designated by the U.S. Coast Guard Patrol Commander. A designated channel, adjacent
to the dredged main ship channel, bounded by the shoreline of North Island and passing through the Security Zone defined
in 33 CFR 165.1105 adjacent to naval piers J through P on the western shore of North Island will be available for non-participating
vessels to enter, exit and travel within San Diego Bay during the regulatory period. Those vessels wishing to use this
channel to enter or exit San Diego Bay must obtain permission to proceed from the Patrol Commander at least 30 minutes
prior to the expected transit.

Speed limits and operating requirements are also established for other vessel traffic operating within the regulated
areas during the exhibition races and when most IACC and spectator vessels are expected to transit the harbors. During
these times, spectator vessels shall not operate exclusively under sail within the regulated areas. 

These operating requirements are applicable to all vessels operating within San Diego Bay preceding, during and
following the IACC boat races, unless otherwise specified. 

All vessels which fail to comply with this regulation while operating within the regulated areas during the regulatory
periods are subject to citation for failure to comply with this regulation, and subject to the penalties presented
in 33 U.S.C. 1236 and 33 CFR 100.50.



Regulatory Evaluation



This regulation is not a significant regulatory action under Section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under Section 6(a)(3) of that Order. It has been exempted from review
by the Office of Management and Budget under that Order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this regulation to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10(e) of the Department of Transportation
regulatory policies and procedures is unnecessary.



Collection of Information



This regulation contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C.
3501 

et seq.

). 



Federalism



The Coast Guard has analyzed this regulation in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive
Order 12612 and has determined that this regulation does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.



Environmental Assessment



The environmental impact of this regulation has been analyzed in the Environmental Assessment (EA) prepared by America's
Cup 1995, the organizing committee of the races, in connection with its application for a Coast Guard regatta permit.
A copy of the EA has been made a part of the public docket and is available for review at the Eleventh Coast Guard District
Offices at the address listed under 

ADDRESSES

. 

The Coast Guard has reviewed the EA submitted by the sponsors of the event, considered the environmental impact of
this regulation and concluded that, under section 2.B.2 of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, it will have no significant
environmental impact and it is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. A Finding of No
Significant Impact (FONSI) has been prepared in connection with the regatta permit, has been made part of the public
docket, and is available for review at the address listed under 

ADDRESSES

.

Any vessel designated by AC'95 and approved by the U.S. Coast Guard Patrol Commander that has been given official duties
in support of the World Championship Races. These vessels include but are not limited to mark boats, stake boats, and
umpire boats.



Official vessels. 

Official Vessels are all U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary, state and local law enforcement vessels, and
civilian vessels designated by the Coast Guard Patrol Commander and flying the official patrol vessel flag. The official
patrol vessel flag is a white rectangular flag emblazoned with the words ``America's Cup '95'' and depicting two sailing
vessels racing beneath the America's Cup trophy. The civilian vessels may include but are not limited to AC'95 Crowd
Control Vessels and media vessels. AC'95 Crowd Control Vessels are 20-foot and 23-foot Bayliner power boats identified
by the word ``PATROL'', followed by a number, printed on both sides of the vessel. AC'95 Crowd Control Vessels will
fly the official patrol vessel flag and operate a yellow and red flashing light.



Participant. 

Any IACC race boat, IACC chase boat or IACC tender that is registered with AC'95 while in performance of its official
function relative to a given race.



Patrol Commander. 

A Patrol Commander has been designated by the Commander, Eleventh Coast Guard District. The Patrol Commander has
the authority to control the movement of all vessels operating in the regulated areas and may suspend the regatta at
any time it is deemed necessary for the protection of life and property.






Note: 

The Patrol Commander may be contacted during the regulatory periods on VHF/FM Channel 16 (156.8 MHZ) or Channel 22
(157.1 MHZ) by calling ``Coast Guard Patrol Commander'' or ``Coast Guard San Diego.''






Spectator vessels. 

All vessels not registered with the America's Cup '95 governing (AC'95), the race sponsor, as a participant and not
designated as an AC'95 Race Official or an Official Vessel by the Coast Guard Patrol Commander are spectator vessels.



Transmitting vessels. 

A special classification of spectator vessels, whose sole purpose for being underway within the waters of San Diego
Bay is to exit the Bay or enter the Bay and return to its mooring. Transiting vessels include commercial or military
vessels.

(c)

 Special Local Regulations. 

The following regulations are in effect between the hours of 10 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. on October 30 and November 5, 1994,
and as otherwise ordered by the Patrol Commander through Broadcast Notice to Mariners:

(1) The area of San Diego Bay described as the IACC Bay Racing Venue in paragraph (a)(3) of this section shall be closed
to all vessels except participants, AC'95 Vessels and Official Vessels.

(2) All transiting vessels wishing to enter or exit San Diego Bay through the America's Cup Channel, specified in paragraph
(a)(2) of this section (the Channel), must obtain permission to proceed in the Channel from the Patrol Commander at
least 30 minutes prior to the expected transit time (prior to entering the Channel). Before actual entry into the Channel,
the vessel must notify the Patrol Commander of its location and speed. VHF/FM Channel 13 (156.65 MHZ) is the designated
channel for these communications. If deemed necessary by the Patrol Commander, the Coast Guard will assign an escort
vessel to accompany the transiting vessel through the Channel. The maximum speed for transiting through the Channel
is ten knots. While using the Channel, the transiting vessel shall follow all directions of the Patrol Commander and
the assigned escort vessel, if applicable.

(3) Spectator sail vessels shall not operate exclusively under sail without the prior express permission of the Patrol
Commander to do so.

Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans: Washington



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Direct final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) conditionally approves a revision to the State implementation plan (SIP)
submitted by the State of Washington for the purpose of bringing about the attainment of the National ambient air quality
standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers
(PM-10). The implementation plan was submitted by the State to satisfy certain Federal requirements for an
approvable moderate nonattainment area PM-10 SIP for Tacoma, Washington.

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Background


The Tacoma, Washington, area was designated nonattainment for PM-10 and classified as moderate under sections
107(d)(4)(B) and 188(a) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), upon enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) of 1990.

1

 See 56 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991) (official designation codified at 40 CFR 81.348). The air quality planning requirements
for moderate PM-10 nonattainment areas are set out in subparts 1 and 4 of part D, title I of the Act.

2

 EPA has issued a ``General Preamble'' describing EPA's preliminary views on how EPA intends to review SIPs and SIP
revisions submitted under Title I of the Act, including those State submittals containing moderate PM-10 nonattainment
area SIP requirements (see generally 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) and 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992)). Because EPA is describing
its interpretations here only in broad terms, the reader should refer to the General Preamble for a more detailed discussion
of the interpretations of title I advanced in this notice and the supporting rationale. In this rulemaking action
on the State of Washington's moderate PM-10 SIP for the Tacoma nonattainment area (referred to as Tacoma or the
Tacoma Tideflats), EPA is applying its interpretations taking into consideration the specific factual issues presented.
Additional information supporting EPA's action on this particular area is available for inspection at the address
indicated above. Those States containing initial moderate PM-10 nonattainment areas (those areas designated
nonattainment under CAA section 107(d)(4)(B)) were required to submit, among other things, the following provisions
by November 15, 1991: 







1. Provisions to ensure that reasonably available control measures (RACM) (including such reductions in emissions
from existing sources in the area as may be obtained through the adoption, at a minimum, of reasonably available control
technology (RACT)) shall be implemented no later than December 10, 1993; 
2. Either a demonstration (including air quality modeling) that the plan will provide for attainment as expeditiously
as practicable but no later than December 31, 1994, or a demonstration that attainment by that date is impracticable;

3. Quantitative milestones which are to be achieved every three years and which demonstrate reasonable further progress
(RFP) toward attainment by December 31, 1994; and 
4. Provisions to ensure that the control requirements applicable to major stationary sources of PM-10 also
apply to major stationary sources of PM-10 precursors except where the Administrator determines that such
sources do not contribute significantly to PM-10 levels which exceed the NAAQS in the area (see sections 172(c),
188, and 189 of the Act). 
Additional provisions are due at a later date. States with initial moderate PM-10 nonattainment areas were
required to submit a permit program for the construction and operation of new and modified major stationary sources
of PM-10 by June 30, 1992 (see CAA section 189(a)). The Washington State Department of Ecology (WDOE) submitted
the new source review requirements for this area on October 22, 1993. EPA will address that submittal in a separate


Federal Register

 document.
Such States also were required to submit contingency measures by November 15, 1993, which become effective without
further action by the State or EPA, upon a determination by EPA that the area has failed to achieve RFP or to attain the
PM-10 NAAQS by the applicable statutory deadline (see CAA section 172(c)(9) and 57 FR 13510-13512 and
13543-13544). EPA addresses the contingency measures the State has submitted for Tacoma in part II.8 of the
discussion below.


II. This Action 


Section 110(k) of the Act sets out provisions governing EPA's review of SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565-13566).
Section 110(k)(4) of the Act authorizes EPA to approve a plan revision based on a commitment by the State to adopt specific
enforceable measures by a date certain, but not later than one year after the date of approval of the plan revision.
EPA would then assess the approvability of the submittal after the State fulfilled its commitment. However, if the
State fails to comply with its commitment, section 110(k)(4) provides that a conditional approval shall be treated
as a disapproval. If the conditional approval is converted to a disapproval, the sanctions clock under section 179
of the Act and the Federal implementation plan clock under section 110(c)(1) of the Act will begin. 
In this action, EPA is granting conditional approval of the plan revisions submitted to EPA for Tacoma, Washington,
on November 15, 1991 and June 30, 1994 (hereafter generally referred to as a single submittal), except for the following
elements of the SIP which are described below or in the Technical Support Document associated with this rulemaking.
EPA is approving these following elements without conditions: exclusion from precursor controls, the monitoring
network, the procedures for consultation and public notification, the provisions for revising the plan and the adequacy
of funding and authority. 
EPA conditionally approves the submittal because it does not fully meet certain applicable requirements of the CAA
for moderate PM-10 nonattainment areas. The submittal does not meet the requirements to provide for the implementation
of RACM (including RACT), to demonstrate timely attainment of the PM-10 NAAQS (or demonstrate that timely attainment
is not practicable), and to provide for quantitative milestones and reasonable further progress. See CAA sections
172(c)(1), 189(a)(1)(C), 189(a)(1)(B) and 189(c). Some of the control measures relied on to satisfy these requirements
have not been made enforceable emission limitations. CAA sections 110(a)(2)(A) and 172(c)(6). However, the State
has submitted a commitment to adopt specific enforceable measures on or before January 1, 1995, and to address the
applicable requirements of the Act. In its June 30, 1994 SIP revision, the State committed to submitting federally
enforceable emission limits to EPA by January 1, 1995 for the following major stationary sources identified in the
SIP: Buffelen Woodworking, Continental Grain, Continental Lime, Domtar Gypsum, Puget Sound Plywood, USG Interiors,
US Oil and Refining, Woodworth, Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical Corporation and Simpson Tacoma Kraft Company. 
The submittal is substantive and contains some specific enforceable control measures. Accordingly, EPA is conditionally
approving the submittal, as authorized under section 110(k)(4) of the CAA. EPA also approves, without conditions,
the separable exclusion from precursor controls as described in part II.5 below, the monitoring network, the procedures
for consultation and public notification, the provisions for revising the plan and the adequacy of funding and authority.



Analysis of State Submission


1. Procedural Background


The Act requires States to observe certain procedural requirements in developing implementation plans and plan
revisions for submission to EPA. Section 110(a)(2) of the Act provides that each implementation plan submitted by
a State must be adopted after reasonable notice and public hearing.

3

 Section 110(l) of the Act similarly provides that each revision to an implementation plan submitted by a State under
the Act must be adopted by such State after reasonable notice and public hearing.





The EPA also must determine whether a submittal is complete and therefore warrants further EPA review and action (see
CAA section 110(k)(1) and 57 FR 13565). EPA's completeness criteria for SIP submittals are set out at 40 CFR part 51,
appendix V. EPA attempts to make completeness determinations within 60 days of receiving a submission. However,
a submittal is deemed complete by operation of law if a completeness determination is not made by EPA six months after
receipt of the submission. 
The State of Washington Department of Ecology conducted a public hearing to receive public comment on the State implementation
plan revision for PM-10 in Tacoma on November 7, 1991. WDOE adopted the implementation plan for the area on November
15, 1991, and submitted it to EPA the same day. In 1994, the plan was revised to amend its request for conditional approval.
WDOE conducted a public hearing to obtain public input on this revision on February 17, 1994. The letter revising the
request for conditional approval was submitted to EPA on June 30, 1994. The November 15, 1991 and June 30, 1994 SIP submittals
were reviewed by EPA to determine completeness in accordance with the completeness criteria set out at 40 CFR part
51, appendix V. Letters dated May 12, 1992 and August 1, 1994, were forwarded to the WDOE indicating the completeness
of the submittals and the next steps to be taken in the review process. 


2. PM-10 Emissions Inventory 


Section 172(c)(3) of the Act requires that nonattainment plan provisions include a comprehensive, accurate and
current inventory of actual emissions from all sources of relevant pollutants in the nonattainment area. The emissions
inventory should also include a comprehensive, accurate and current inventory of allowable emissions in the area.
See, e.g., CAA section 110(a)(2)(K). Because the submission of such inventories are necessary to an area's attainment
demonstration (or demonstration that the area cannot practicably attain), the emissions inventories must be received
with the attainment/nonattainment demonstration submission (see 57 FR 13539). 
WDOE submitted an emissions inventory of estimated actual emissions for the base year of 1987 and the attainment year
of 1994. The 24-hour emission inventory identified three major source categories contributing to particulate matter
in the Tacoma Tideflats. These are, in descending order of greatest contribution, industrial stack emissions (66
percent); vehicle resuspended road dust (18 percent); and industrial fugitive emissions (13 percent). Other contributing
sources were area sources, such as residential wood combustion and motor vehicle exhaust. The emission inventory
is dominated by one point source, the Simpson Tacoma Kraft Company (Simpson), a paper pulp producer, which accounts
for 45 percent of the emission inventory. 
For sources within the nonattainment area, the emissions inventory provides a comprehensive list of particulate
sources and utilizes appropriate factor and estimations that were available at the time the SIP revision was prepared.
However, the emission inventory may underestimate the impact of PM-10 sources outside of the nonattainment
area. Possibly due to where the nonattainment area boundaries were drawn, there may be a significant source of PM-10
outside of the nonattainment area. As is discussed in the Technical Support Document (TSD), substantial evidence
indicates that imported residential wood combustion accounts for a large portion of the PM-10 in the Tacoma
Tideflats. For further information, the reader is referred to the TSD accompanying this action, which is available
at the EPA address indicated above. 
The emissions inventory estimating actual emissions along with additional available information provides a sufficient
basis for determining the technical adequacy of the attainment demonstration for this area consistent with the requirements
of section 172(c)(3) of the Clean Air Act.

 An additional attainment year emission inventory issue, relating to the attainment demonstration, and other requirements,
is the use of actual instead of allowable emission estimates for projecting attainment. This issue will be discussed
in more detail under the demonstration section of this document. Again, the reader is referred to the TSD corresponding
with this action for further information.





3. RACM (Including RACT) 


As noted, the initial moderate PM-10 nonattainment areas must submit provisions to ensure that RACM (including
RACT) are implemented no later than December 10, 1993 (see CAA sections 172(c)(1) and 189(a)(1)(C)). The General
Preamble contains a detailed discussion of EPA's interpretation of the RACM (including RACT) requirement (see 57
FR 13539-13545 and 13560-13561). 
In broad terms, the State should identify available control measures evaluating them for their reasonableness in
light of the feasibility of the controls and the attainment needs of the area. A State may reject available control
measures if the measures are technologically infeasible or the cost of the control is unreasonable. In addition,
RACM, does not require controls on emissions from sources that are insignificant (i.e. de minimis) and RACM does not
require the implementation of all available control measures where an area demonstrates timely attainment of the
NAAQS and the implementation of additional controls would not expedite attainment. 57 FR 13540-13544.
Washington's control strategy for the Tacoma area provides for attainment of the 24-hour standard based on control
of industrial emissions, fugitive industrial emissions including resuspended road dust, and residential wood
combustion. However, as indicated below, some of the control measures are deficient because they are not reflected
in enforceable emission limitations. See CAA sections 110(a)(2)(A) & 172(c)(6). The State has committed to
address this deficiency and, based on section 110(k)(4) of the CAA, EPA is conditionally approving the submittal
relative to the RACM (Including RACT) requirement. The available control measures to be implemented in Tacoma include
the following:


a. Industrial Controls


The largest single reduction in the projected emission inventory results from the control of industrial stack emissions.
As stated earlier, Simpson accounts for 45 percent of the emission inventory. In 1991, Simpson replaced the #2,3,4,5
hogged fuel boilers and #1 oil boiler at the mill with a new hogged fuel boiler. Emissions from the new boiler represent
a 984 kg/day reduction in emissions, almost half of Simpson's previous emissions, or roughly 19 percent of the total
baseline emissions inventory.
In addition, changes in industrial processes resulted in decreased emissions; for example, U.S. Oil and Refining
and Simpson changed fuel sources to burn natural gas. The SIP assumes that emissions from mobile sources will grow
modestly from 1987 to 1994. Even including these growth projections, the overall reduction in industrial PM-10
stack emissions due to implementation of controls for all sources combined is projected to be 17 percent of the base
year's inventory. However, these industrial changes and controls have not been expressed as enforceable emission
limitations. As discussed earlier, WDOE has committed to submit enforceable emissions limits on the industrial
sources by January 1, 1995. 


b. Industrial Fugitive and Resuspended Road Dust 


The Tacoma emission inventory identified industrial fugitive emissions and resuspended road dust as significant
contributors of particulate matter to the airshed. The Puget Sound Air Pollution Control Agency (PSAPCA) is a local
air pollution control agency that has jurisdiction over four counties in Washington State; PSAPCA's jurisdiction
includes the Tacoma Tideflats. PSAPCA's fugitive dust regulation (Regulation I, section 9.15) was designed to reduce
fugitive dust from commercial and industrial activities and also to reduce dust emissions from paved and unpaved
roads and parking lots. 
PSAPCA requires ``Best Available Control Technology (BACT)'' under section 9.15 for all fugitive emissions from
all incinerators, boilers, manufacturing equipment and air pollution control equipment. The Tacoma attainment
plan lists and documents emission reductions from several major facilities that were required to pave roads or add
PM-10 controls as the result of PSAPCA's application of section 9.15. Puget Sound Plywood, Lone Star, Woodworth
and Buffelen were required to either pave roads or modify production processes to comply with section 9.15. The SIP
estimates that the application of section 9.15 would result in a reduction of 73 kg/day of fugitive emissions from
industrial sources. After accounting for an increase of 39 kg/day due to industrial growth, the net total reduction
from the base year to the attainment year of fugitive emissions is 34 kg/day. EPA accepts the emission reductions claimed
from this control measure as reasonable. Since it is generally impractical to source test fugitive emission sources,
a SIP must rely on calculated emission estimates, and control efficiency estimates, to arrive at emission reduction
estimates.
Control of resuspended road dust is a significant component of section 9.15. PSAPCA applies the same section 9.15
BACT provisions to dust emissions from both private and public paved and unpaved roads. In addition, all private roadways
adjoining paved public roads and all commercial properties with access points abutting paved public roads in the
Tacoma nonattainment area are required to implement BACT to stabilize vehicular entrances and exits. The control
measure also appropriately prioritized preventing material deposition on roadways over mitigating measures after
deposition. Looking specifically at the control of resuspended road dust, the plan uses an overall emission reduction
credit of 37 percent from resuspended road dust. EPA accepts this estimate as reasonable.


c. Residential Wood Combustion


As previously noted, there is a substantial body of evidence indicating that imported residential wood combustion
is a large source of Tacoma's PM-10. All three receptor models concluded that woodsmoke was one of the main sources
of particulate matter in the Tacoma Tideflats area. The most recent receptor modeling study suggested that residential
wood combustion was an unexpectedly strong source of PM-10. This is also supported by the Saturation Study conducted
by EPA. Additional discussion of the impact of imported residential wood combustion can be found in the TSD associated
with this action. Because of the likely impact of imported residential wood combustion on Tacoma's airshed, the available
control measures adopted for residential wood combustion are discussed here.
PSAPCA initiated a voluntary woodsmoke curtailment program throughout its four county jurisdictional area, including
Tacoma, in the winter of 1987-88. The program changed to mandatory curtailment beginning with the 1988-89
heating season, pursuant to WAC 173-433 and the PSAPCA Regulation I, Article 13. The curtailment program is
a two stage plan. At Stage I, which is imposed when ambient PM-10 levels reach 75  u g/m

3

, the use of uncertified stoves and fireplaces are banned. At Stage II, imposed when PM-10 levels reach 105  u g/m

3

, all woodheating (fireplaces, certified and uncertified woodstoves) is prohibited. The program exempts homes
with no other source of heat. WDOE and PSAPCA regulations contain additional controls, including the prohibition
of all fuels except dry, seasoned wood in woodheating devices. Plume opacity for woodheating devices is limited to
20 percent, with brief exceedances allowed for fire starting and stoking. PSAPCA serves as the primary enforcement
agency for the curtailment and opacity portions of the control program. Both WDOE and PSAPCA administer public education
programs targeted at residential wood burning. Throughout the State, WDOE also enforces a ban on the sale of uncertified
woodstoves. 
The strength and depth of the legislated woodsmoke program, and the size and historical effectiveness of the agencies
involved, demonstrates to EPA's satisfaction that the Tacoma area is achieving a sufficient compliance rate to justify
the 70 percent emission reduction credit taken for these measures. A more detailed analysis of the Washington woodsmoke
curtailment plan is contained in the TSD. Since PSAPCA administers the woodsmoke curtailment program throughout
its four-county jurisdictional area and the program affects sources both within the nonattainment area and in adjoining
areas, the 70 percent emission reduction credit is applicable to both residential wood combustion generated in the
nonattainment area and imported residential wood combustion.
As indicated, where sources of PM-10 contribute insignificantly to the PM-10 problem in the area, EPA's
policy is that RACM does not require the implementation of potentially available control measures. 57 FR 13540. Further,
EPA has indicated that for some sources in areas which demonstrate timely attainment, RACM does not require the implementation
of otherwise available control measures that are not ``reasonably'' available because their implementation would
not expedite attainment (see 57 FR 13543). In the Tacoma situation, EPA believes the significant sources, as well
as several less significant sources, of PM-10 in the area have been reasonably controlled. Thus, EPA believes
that RACM does not require the implementation of potentially available control measures or technology for other
de minimis sources of PM-10 in the area. Further, EPA believes implementation of such additional controls in
this area would not expedite attainment. 
A more detailed discussion of the individual source contributions, their associated control measures and an explanation
as to why certain available control measures were not implemented, can be found in the TSD. EPA has reviewed the State's
explanation and associated documentation and concludes that it adequately justifies the control measures to be
implemented. However, as addressed in more detail in part II.4 below, not all of the emission reductions necessary
to ensure expeditious attainment of the PM-10 NAAQS are embodied in enforceable emission limitations. Thus,
EPA is conditionally approving the control measures submitted for Tacoma, based upon a commitment by the State that
it will submit to EPA by January 1, 1995, legally enforceable emission limits for the significant stack sources in
Tacoma. See CAA section 110(k)(4). This conditional approval is discussed further in the section below.


4. Demonstration 


As noted, the initial moderate PM-10 nonattainment areas must submit a demonstration (including air quality
modeling) showing that the plan will provide for attainment as expeditiously as practicable but no later than December
31, 1994 (see section 189(a)(1)(B) of the Act). The General Preamble sets out EPA's guidance on the use of modeling
for moderate area attainment demonstrations (57 FR 13539). Alternatively, if the State does not submit a demonstration
of attainment, the State must show that attainment by December 31, 1994, is impracticable (CAA section 189(a)(1)(B)(ii)).

Several studies have been conducted to determine sources of particulate matter in the Tacoma nonattainment area.
WDOE and PSAPCA employed pollutant dispersion models in the Tacoma nonattainment area using both guideline and non-guideline
models. Neither RAM (guideline) nor WYNDvalley (non-guideline) yielded results that were well correlated to measured
values. It is difficult to determine precisely why dispersion modeling failed to yield acceptable values in the Tacoma
Tideflats when similar approaches have proven successful elsewhere, but the TSD raises possible explanations,
including where the boundaries of the nonattainment were drawn and how the background PM-10 concentration
was established. The reader is referred to the ``Description of Air Quality Modeling'' section of the TSD associated
with this action for further information.
In addition to dispersion modeling, three receptor modeling studies were conducted in the Tacoma Tideflats to try
to determine source contribution of PM-10. Separate from these receptor modeling studies, a saturation study
was conducted to determine the site of maximum impact in the Tacoma nonattainment area. Unfortunately, no single
study conclusively apportions the amount of PM-10 attributable to different sources. As is discussed in the
TSD, EPA has reservations about each of these studies because of study design flaws, errors in conducting the study,
or changing composition of particulate matter in the airshed. See the ``Attainment Demonstration'' section of the
TSD for a longer discussion of the individual studies.
Faced with several studies, none of which were definitive, the WDOE attempted to address several diverse scenarios
to demonstrate attainment and maintenance of the PM-10 NAAQS in the area. The SIP contains three demonstrations
of attainment and maintenance all using rollback, a modified attainment demonstration that EPA may accept on a case-by-case
basis. The first demonstration presented in the SIP is based on receptor modeling and proportional rollback; the
second used a dispersion modeling study and proportional rollback; and the last was based on straight rollback. Tacoma's
SIP meets the criteria for using rollback as outlined in EPA guidance (Attachment 5 of''PM-10 Moderate Area
SIP Guidance: Final Staff Work Product,'' April 2, 1990). EPA's primary concern about the demonstrations in the SIP
is that they underestimate the amount of PM-10 from residential wood combustion coming into the nonattainment
area from surrounding areas.
As discussed in the TSD, EPA believes that when looking at the receptor modeling and saturation studies as a whole,
there is a substantial body of evidence indicating that residential wood combustion was and is a major source of PM-10
in the airshed. As discussed in the TSD, this residential wood combustion is probably being imported into the nonattainment
area, and a conservative lower bound estimate is that 35-45 percent of the PM-10 in the Tacoma Tideflats
on the design day is attributable to residential wood combustion. A more detailed discussion of this point can be found
in the ``Attainment Demonstration'' of the TSD. 
EPA notes that there has been uncertainty over source contribution in the Tacoma nonattainment area despite numerous
efforts by PSAPCA, WDOE, EPA and other entities to characterize the airshed. In reviewing the SIP, EPA has considered
all relevant studies referenced in the SIP as well as additional information, such as the saturation study. Based
on these studies, EPA finds that imported residential wood combustion is a much larger source of PM-10 than currently
accounted for in the SIP. 
To evaluate the impact of imported residential wood combustion into the nonattainment area, the TSD associated with
the rulemaking contains a rollback analysis that incorporates a relatively conservative estimate of the residential
wood combustion being imported into the nonattainment area. As noted earlier, Tacoma's SIP meets the criteria for
using rollback. In the ``Attainment Demonstration'' discussion of the TSD, EPA sets out a rollback scenario that
incorporates the estimate that 35-45 percent of the PM-10 in the Tacoma Tideflats on the design day is attributable
to residential wood combustion. A mandatory residential woodsmoke curtailment program is being imposed over a four-county
area that includes the Tacoma Tideflats and surrounding contiguous areas. As discussed earlier in section II.3 of
this document, PSAPCA's mandatory woodstove curtailment program warrants a 70 percent control measure credit.
After applying control measure credit for the mandatory woodstove curtailment program, the rollback scenario presented
in the TSD demonstrates; to EPA's satisfaction, that the PM-10 NAAQS will be attained by 1994. 
Assurance of attainment and maintenance rests with the SIP's control measures. The SIP contains a broad array of control
measures aimed at both industrial and residential sources. Based on the emission inventory and related information
about the estimated contribution from residential wood combustion, these control measures, when they are made fully
enforceable (see below), will be sufficient to ensure attainment and maintenance. It should be noted that a major
problem with the attainment demonstration is the attainment year emission inventory used for point (stack) sources.
The inventory was based on actual emission estimates. EPA's Guideline on Air Quality Models (Revised, July 1986)
generally requires use of allowable emissions in inventories for the purposes of modeling attainment of the NAAQS
(see also CAA sections 110(a)(2)(A), 110(a)(2)(K) and 172(c)(6) of the Act). The requirement takes into consideration
possible increases from existing sources allowed by their permits, registrations, or other regulatory mechanisms
and ensures that the control measures relied on in the SIP are based on enforceable emission limitations. WDOE and
PSAPCA, based on comments from EPA, were not able to demonstrate that all point source emissions in the nonattainment
area would be unable to increase significantly above actual levels. Consequently, there is no objective assurance,
or legally enforceable mechanism in place, to restrict a point source from emitting above the estimated actual rate,
should the source have the physical capacity. Therefore, to ensure that the NAAQS will be protected in the Tacoma nonattainment
area, the currently allowable emission limits must be reduced. 
Despite the fact that Tacoma has been monitoring daily at the site determined to be the site of maximum impact and has
not had an exceedance of the NAAQS at any monitor in four years, there are no legal limits in place to prevent future increases
from a few industrial facilities that could consequently threaten attainment of the NAAQS. On June 30, 1994, WDOE
submitted a request for conditional approval of the Tacoma nonattainment plan based on a commitment to reconcile
the actual/allowable emission limitation issue and thereby establish an enforceable attainment demonstration.
WDOE's commitment includes a schedule to issue regulatory orders to appropriate point sources within the nonattainment
area that will restrict emissions (i.e. establish allowable emission limitations) at or below the ``actual'' emission
estimates used in the attainment demonstration. EPA conditionally approves the attainment demonstration for Tacoma
on the basis of this commitment. See CAA section 110(k)(4). The revisions to the emission limitations for the affected
sources will make enforceable the actual emission limitations already being achieved and implemented in the area.

Like the attainment demonstration, Tacoma's SIP contained three maintenance demonstrations. The first demonstration
is based on receptor modeling and proportional rollback; the second used a dispersion modeling study and proportional
rollback; and the last was based on straight rollback; however, the last demonstration failed to show maintenance
through 1997. EPA believes that the failure of the third demonstration to show maintenance through 1997 is due to the
SIP's low estimate of imported residential woodsmoke.
In the ``Evaluation of Attainment Demonstration'' section of the accompanying TSD, EPA considered additional information
and analyses in assessing the maintenance demonstration, including using rollback that differs from the SIP in its
estimate of the amount of residential wood combustion affecting the airshed. EPA believes that after evaluating
all of the studies of the Tacoma Tideflats, there is sufficient evidence to support an interpretation that imported
residential wood combustion is a much stronger source of PM-10 than currently accounted for in the SIP. Similar
to the demonstration of attainment presented in the ``Attainment Demonstration'' of the TSD, EPA believes a greater
background value that accounts for a large importation of residential woodsmoke should be employed in the maintenance
demonstration. Using the emission inventory, growth factors, and point source emission levels presented in the
SIP, considering additional information about the contribution of residential wood combustion and employing the
same background value as was used in the attainment demonstration discussed in the TSD, the rollback analysis demonstrates
maintenance through 1997, and would therefore satisfy the initial quantitative milestones due for this area, as
discussed in part II.6 below. However, as with the attainment demonstration, some of the control measures relied
on to demonstrate continued maintenance of the PM-10 NAAQS in the SIP are deficient because they are not reflected
in enforceable emission limitations. See CAA sections 110(a)(2)(A) & 172(c)(6). The State has committed to
address this deficiency and, based on section 110(k)(4) of the CAA, EPA is conditionally approving the submittal
relative to the quantitative milestone and reasonable further progress requirements discussed below. 
The accompanying TSD discusses the dispersion, receptor and saturation studies conducted in the Tacoma Tideflats,
estimates the amount of PM-10 attributable to residential wood combustion, and presents a rollback demonstration
for attainment and maintenance that incorporates the estimate that 35-45 percent of the PM-10 in the Tacoma
Tideflats on the design day is attributable to residential wood combustion. The reader is referred to the TSD associated
with this document for a more detailed discussion of any of these points.


5. PM-10 Precursors


The control requirements which are applicable to major stationary sources of PM-10, also apply to major stationary
sources of PM-10 precursors unless EPA determines such sources do not contribute significantly to PM-10
levels in excess of the NAAQS in that area (see section 189(e) of the Act). The General Preamble contains guidance addressing
how EPA intends to implement section 189(e) of the Act (see 57 FR 13539-13540 and 13541-13542). 
The three receptor modeling studies conducted in the Tacoma Tideflats show that sulfates and nitrates are not a significant
portion of the Tacoma PM-10 in the airshed. The three studies are discussed in the TSD. The two receptor modeling
studies conducted during the 1980s show that nitrates accounted for less than 4 percent of the total PM-10 sampled
mass, while sulfates contributed even less measuring less than 2.5 percent. 
The third receptor modeling study, the 

Evaluation of the Atmospheric Deposition of Toxic Contaminants to Puget Sound

 study was conducted in the Tacoma Tideflats during 1989 and 1990. The Atmospheric Deposition Study collected fine
particulate (> 2.5  u m) and coarse particulate (> 50  u m). Most of the precursor particles would be occurring
in the fine particle range. The analysis of the fine particles showed that SO

4

 was 9.3 percent of the total mass of fine particles, while NO

3

 accounted for approximately 5 percent of total mass of fine particles. As discussed in the ``Evaluation of Attainment
Demonstration'' in the accompanying TSD, the Atmospheric Deposition Study was conducted during a period when the
airshed was considerably cleaner than the design year. Moreover, control measures were in place during the Atmospheric
Deposition Study's sampling period; five of the sampling days occurred during a ban on the use of uncertified woodstoves.
Therefore, the results of this study are likely to show less PM-10 due to woodsmoke than probably occurred during
the design year. Correspondingly, the study's assessment of the amount of SO

4

 and NO

3

 found in the airshed is likely to be greater on a percentage basis than would have been the case during the design year.

Due to the relatively small amount of sulfates and nitrates in the airshed, EPA has determined that it is unlikely that
precursors do not contribute significantly to PM-10 levels which exceed the NAAQS in Tacoma. In addition to
these receptor analyses, a review of the emissions inventory for this area did not reveal any major stationary sources
of PM-10 precursors. The effect of this finding is to exclude major stationary sources of PM-10 precursors
from PM-10 nonattainment area control requirements.
While EPA is making a general finding about the contribution of PM-10 precursors for Tacoma, the determination
is based on the current character of the area including the existing mix of sources in the area. It is possible, therefore,
that future growth could change the significance of precursors in the area. The EPA intends to issue future guidance
addressing such potential changes in the significance of precursor emissions in an area.


6. Quantitative Milestones and Reasonable Further Progress (RFP)


The PM-10 nonattainment area plan revisions demonstrating attainment must contain quantitative milestones
which are to be achieved every three (3) years until the area is redesignated attainment and which demonstrate RFP,
as defined in section 171(1), toward attainment by December 31, 1994 (see section 189(c) of the Act). Reasonable further
progress is defined in CAA section 171(1) as such annual incremental reductions in emissions of the relevant air pollutant
as are required by Part D or may reasonably be required by the Administrator for the purpose of ensuring attainment
of the applicable NAAQS by the applicable date. 
While section 189(c) plainly provides that quantitative milestones are to be achieved until an area is redesignated
attainment, it is silent in indicating the starting point for counting the first 3-year period or how many milestones
must be initially addressed. In the General Preamble, EPA addressed the statutory gap in the starting point for counting
the 3-year milestones, indicating that it would begin from the due date for the applicable implementation plan revision
containing the control measures for the area (i.e., November 15, 1991 for initial moderate PM-10 nonattainment
areas). See 57 FR 13539. As to the number of milestones, EPA believes that at least two milestones must be initially
addressed. Thus, submittals to address the SIP revisions due on November 15, 1991 for the initial moderate PM-10
nonattainment areas must demonstrate timely attainment of the PM-10 NAAQS, the second milestone should, at
a minimum, provide for continued maintenance of the standards.

5

 





In implementing RFP for this initial moderate area, EPA has reviewed the attainment demonstration and control strategy
for the area to assess whether the initial milestones have been satisfied and to determine whether annual incremental
reductions, different from those provided in the SIP, should be required in order to ensure attainment of the PM-10
NAAQS by December 31, 1994 (see CAA section 171(1)). As indicated, the State of Washington's PM-10 SIP for Tacoma
demonstrates attainment in 1994 and maintenance through 1997, and therefore would satisfy RFP and initial quantitative
milestones (see 57 FR 13539) if all of the control measures relied upon were reflected in enforceable emission limitations.
However, as discussed previously, WDOE and PSAPCA based attainment and maintenance demonstrations on actual emission
estimates instead of the required allowable rates. The State has committed to adopt the necessary enforceable allowable
emission limits by January 1, 1995. Accordingly, as with other requirements discussed elsewhere in this document,
EPA is conditionally approving the submittal relative to the RFP and initial milestone requirements. CAA section
110(k)(4).


7. Enforceability Issues 


All measures and other elements in the SIP must be enforceable by WDOE and EPA (see CAA sections 172(c)(6), 110(a)(2)(A)
and 57 FR 13556). EPA criteria addressing the enforceability of SIP's and SIP revisions were stated in a September
23, 1987, memorandum (with attachments) from J. Craig Potter, Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, et
al. (see 57 FR 13541). Nonattainment area plan provisions must also contain a program that provides for enforcement
of the control measures and other elements in the SIP (see CAA section 110(a)(2)(C)). 
WDOE's control measures and regulations for control of Particulate Matter, which are contained in the SIP, are addressed
above under the section headed ``RACM (including RACT).'' These control measures apply to the types of activities
identified in that discussion including, for example, fugitive emissions from point sources; vehicle resuspended
road dust; and residential wood combustion. The SIP provides that the affected activities will be controlled throughout
the entire nonattainment area. 
The TSD contains further information on enforceability requirements including enforceable emission limitations;
a description of the rules contained in the SIP and the source types subject to them; test methods and compliance schedules;
malfunction provisions; excess emission provisions; correctly cited references of incorporated methods/rules;
and 
reporting and recordkeeping requirements. 
Both WDOE and PSAPCA have responsibilities in the implementation and enforcement of control measures in the Tacoma
nonattainment area. PSAPCA retains authority over all area sources and all but the two stationary sources in Tacoma
that are regulated by the Department of Ecology. PSAPCA has many compliance inspectors and, as discussed further
in the TSD, EPA considers PSAPCA's staffing level adequate to ensure that the Tacoma attainment plan is fully implemented.
As a necessary adjunct of its enforcement program, PSAPCA also has broad powers to adopt rules and regulations, issue
orders, assess penalties, require access to records and information, and receive and disburse funds. The Washington
State Department of Ecology has adequate authority to implement and enforce the plan in the event PSAPCA fails to make
a good faith effort to implement and/or enforce the regulations.
The two point sources in the Tacoma nonattainment area not under PSAPCA's jurisdiction are the Simpson Tacoma Kraft
Company and Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical Corporation. These sources are regulated by the Washington State Department
of Ecology. The Washington State Department of Ecology's legal authorities, personnel and funding sources are discussed
in the accompanying TSD. EPA finds these authorities and funding mechanisms adequate to ensure that the State will
be able to enforce the control measures in the Tacoma nonattainment area.
Controls on area sources, such as the residential wood combustion program and the fugitive dust control program are
also enforceable. Discussion and justification of EPA's reasoning can be found in the control measure section of
this document and the TSD. 
However, as discussed elsewhere in this document, the use of actual emission estimates rather than the significantly
higher emission limits allowed in the current WDOE or PSAPCA regulations is unacceptable. WDOE, PSAPCA, and EPA could
only enforce the allowable emissions that are currently contained in the WDOE or PSAPCA regulations. There are no
mechanisms for any of the regulatory agencies to enforce the emission estimates used in the attainment and maintenance
demonstration because they are well below the legal limits allowed in the WDOE or PSAPCA regulations. A discussion
regarding the use of actual instead of allowable emissions contained in the demonstration portion of this document
provides background for the enforceability decision. The Region is granting a conditional approval of the Tacoma
attainment plan based on the commitment contained in the June 30, 1994, submittal which will make the emissions from
point sources enforceable at or below the levels used to demonstrate attainment and maintenance. EPA will need additional
technical documentation from WDOE if the emission levels in the regulatory orders are greater than those used in the
attainment and three year maintenance demonstrations. Additionally, WDOE would need to provide cogent attainment
and maintenance demonstrations in order for the SIP to be fully approved. 


8. Contingency Measures 


As provided in section 172(c)(9) of the Act, all moderate nonattainment area SIP's that demonstrate attainment must
include contingency measures (see generally 57 FR 13510-13512 & 13543-13544). These measures must
be submitted by November 15, 1993, for the initial moderate nonattainment areas. Contingency measures should consist
of other available measures that are not part of the area's core control strategy. These measures must take effect
without further action by the State or EPA, upon a determination by EPA that the area has failed to make RFP or attain
the PM-10 NAAQS by the applicable statutory deadline. 
Assessing the adequacy of Tacoma's contingency measures is tied to the attainment demonstration because Tacoma
has submitted industrial emissions controls in excess of those needed to demonstrate timely attainment of the PM-10
NAAQS as a contingency measure. As discussed above, Simpson's boiler replacement alone represents a 984 kg/day reduction
in emissions, almost half of Simpson's previous emissions, or roughly 19 percent of the total baseline emissions
inventory. Based on the rollback discussion provided in the accompanying TSD, the Tacoma SIP contains emissions
limits and contingency measures that provide for reductions greater than the 25 percent contingency measure emissions
reduction value suggested in the General Preamble (57 FR 13543-13544). Further discussion can be found in the
``Contingency Measure'' section of the accompanying TSD.
The contingency measures submitted as part of the Tacoma SIP ranged from a commitment to implement mobile source controls
to crediting the emission limitations already existing in the SIP that would be in excess of those needed to address
the RACM (including RACT) requirement. The two mobile source contingency measures in the 1991 SIP were directed at
reducing emissions from diesel vehicles: (1) the establishment of an inspection and maintenance (I/M) program,
and (2) the reduction in sulfur content of on-highway diesel fuel. In 1993, Washington State expanded its I/M program
to include the Tacoma area, and the desulfurization program was implemented nationally.
Only the measures that are being implemented prior to a determination that the area has failed to timely attain or achieve
RFP, that would be in excess of those necessary to provide for timely attainment of the PM-10 NAAQS and that, therefore,
go beyond RACM (including RACT) can be relied on as contingency measures. The measures will provide for continued
emissions reduction progress beyond the core control strategy. Further, because the State would implement these
precautionary measures prior to a determination that the area has failed to timely attain the NAAQS or achieve RFP,
these measures essentially provide advance contingency benefit and satisfy the requirement that they ``take effect
. . . without further action by the State, or the Administrator.'' EPA believes it would be unreasonable to penalize
or otherwise discourage the State from taking the arguably more precautionary air quality management step of accelerating
the implementation of these contingency measures. 
However, it cannot be determined whether these measures are in excess of those necessary to provide for expeditious
attainment and necessary to address RACM (including RACT) until the State addresses the deficiencies associated
with its core control strategy. As indicated elsewhere, the State has committed to convert measures necessary to
address RACM (including RACT) to enforceable emission limitations. Until this commitment is fulfilled, EPA cannot
conclude that the contingency measures go beyond the core control strategy.
Therefore, EPA is conditionally approving these contingency measures. Due to the submission of emission reductions
that are purportedly in excess of those necessary to demonstrate timely attainment and necessary to satisfy RACM
as a contingency measure, final approval or disapproval of these contingency measures must be determined when WDOE
submits the regulatory orders establishing enforceable emission limits for the stationary sources in the Tacoma
Tideflats. 


III. Implications of This Action


EPA conditionally approves the plan revisions submitted to EPA for the Tacoma, Washington, nonattainment area on
November 15, 1991, and June 30, 1994, except for the following elements which EPA approves in full. EPA also approves,
without conditions, the separable exclusion from precursor controls as described in part II.5 above, the monitoring
network, the procedures for consultation and public notification, the provisions for revising the plan and the adequacy
of funding and authority. EPA will assess the final approvability of the submittals EPA is conditionally approving
after the State fulfills its commitment to submit enforceable emission limitations by January 1, 1995. If the State
fails to comply with its commitment, the conditional approval will become a disapproval. 


IV. Administrative Review


This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2224), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. OMB has exempted this regulatory action from Executive Order 12866
review.
Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by December 12, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by
the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor
does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (see CAA
section 307(b)(2), 42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(2)). 
The EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment
and anticipates no adverse comments. This action will be effective on December 12, 1994 unless adverse comments are
received by November 14, 1994. If the EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and all
public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on the proposed rule (please see the proposed
rule published, simultaneously, in the proposal section of this 

Federal Register

).
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
Conditional approvals of SIP submittals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements,
but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval
does not impose any new requirements, EPA certifies that it does not have a significant impact on small entities affected.
Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility
analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The CAA forbids EPA
to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds. 

Union Electric Co.

U.S. E.P.A.

 , 427 U.S. 246, 256-66 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2).
If the conditional approval is converted to a disapproval under section 110(k), based on the State's failure to meet
the commitment, it will not affect any existing State requirements applicable to small entities. Federal disapproval
of the State submittal does not affect its State-enforceability. Moreover, EPA's disapproval of the submittal does
not impose a new Federal requirement. Therefore, EPA certifies that this disapproval action does not have a significant
impact on a substantial number of small entities because it does not remove existing State requirements nor does it
substitute a new Federal requirement.
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any State implementation plan. Each request for revision to the State implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is conditionally approving a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of New Hampshire.
This revision requires and establishes an enhanced motor vehicle inspection and maintenance program in the counties
of Hillsborough, Merrimack, Rockingham, and Strafford. The intended effect of this action is to conditionally approve
the New Hampshire enhanced inspection and maintenance program. This action is being taken in accordance with the
Clean Air Act.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Clean Air Act Requirements


The Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA or Act), requires certain States to revise and improve existing I/M programs
or implement new ones. All ozone nonattainment areas classified as moderate or worse must implement a basic or enhanced
I/M program depending upon its nonattainment classification, regardless of previous requirements. In addition,
Congress directed the EPA in section 182(a)(2)(B) to publish updated guidance for State I/M programs, taking into
consideration findings of the Administrator's audits and investigations of these programs. The States must incorporate
EPA's guidance into SIPs for all areas required by the Act to have an I/M program. Metropolitan statistical areas with
populations of 100,000 or more that are within the Northeast Ozone Transport Region also are required to meet EPA guidance
for enhanced I/M programs. 



II. Background


The EPA has designated three areas as nonattainment for ozone in the State of New Hampshire. The New Hampshire portion
of the Boston-Lawrence-Salem Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area is classified serious for ozone, the
Portsmouth-Dover-Rochester Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), also classified serious for ozone, and the Manchester
MSA, classified marginal for ozone. The designations for ozone were published in the 

Federal Register

 (FR) on November 6, 1991 (56 FR 56694) and November 30, 1992 (57 FR 56762) and have been codified in the Code of Federal
Regulations (CFR) at 40 CFR 81.300 through 81.437. Based on these nonattainment designations, an enhanced I/M program
is required in Hillsborough, Rockingham, and Strafford Counties. In addition, these MSAs have populations of over
100,000 and are included in the Ozone Transport Region. 

Although parts of Merrimack County are in the Manchester MSA, the county could be exempted since, in New England, MSAs
are defined by town, not by county; more than fifty percent of the MSA population would still be in the I/M program; and
the population density is less than 200 persons per square mile. Under EPA's I/M rule 40 CFR 51.350(b)(1) such portions
of Merrimack County are not required to implement I/M. However, all of Merrimack County is included to provide an opportunity
to generate enforceable emission reductions that may be used to help provide opportunity for economic growth. 

By this action, EPA is conditionally approving the New Hampshire I/M SIP revision. EPA has reviewed the State submittals
against the statutory requirements under the Act and for consistency with EPA regulations. In letters dated May 19,
1994 and June 28, 1994, New Hampshire indicated its intent to address a number of outstanding issues discussed in this
document as well as in the July 18, 1994 notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR), and to submit necessary revisions to EPA
by August 18, 1994. New Hampshire submitted such revisions on August 18. They are consistent with the NPR as discussed
below and fully meet the requirements of the I/M rule, except for the portions being conditionally approved in this
document. 

Three parts of the program, on-road testing, compliance via diagnostic inspection, and enforcement against inspectors
require more time to resolve and provide the basis for today's conditional approval. As requested by New Hampshire,
the state will have until July 29, 1995 to submit revisions to address these three areas. If such revisions are submitted
by that date, fulfill the conditions set forth in this document, and fully meet the requirements of the I/M rule, the
state will have met the specified conditions and the I/M SIP will be fully approved. If not, this conditional approval
will automatically convert to a disapproval. A summary of EPA's analysis is provided below. In addition, more detailed
support for conditionally approving the State submittal is contained in the technical support document which is
available from the New England Regional Office, listed above.

On November 5, 1992 (57 FR 52950), EPA published a final regulation establishing the I/M requirements, pursuant to
sections 182 and 187 of the Act. The I/M regulation was codified at 40 CFR part 51, subpart S, and requires States to submit,
by November 15, 1993, an I/M SIP revision including all necessary legal authority and the items specified in 40 CFR
51.350(a)(1) through 51.373. 



III. State Submittal


On February 28, 1994, April 19, 1994, and April 21, 1994, the State of New Hampshire submitted an I/M SIP for its three
nonattainment areas. Public hearings for the submittals were held on January 5 and 6, 1994 for the February 28, 1994
SIP submittal, and on March 8, 1994 for the April 19, 1994 SIP submittal. The April 21, 1994 submittal contained only
administrative materials to supplement the April 19 submission. EPA submitted written comments to the state on March
18, 1994. In letters dated May 19, 1994 and June 28, 1994, the state agreed to submit by August 19, 1994, additional information
to address the areas discussed below. 

The submittals provide for the implementation of an enhanced I/M program in four counties in New Hampshire beginning
in 1995. New Hampshire will be implementing a biennial, test-only I/M program meeting the requirements of the I/M
performance standard and other requirements contained in EPA's I/M rule. Testing will be overseen by the New Hampshire
Department of Safety (NHDOS) and the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services (NHDES), with actual testing
done by a contractor. Other aspects of the New Hampshire I/M program include: testing of 1968 and later light duty vehicles
and trucks and heavy duty trucks, evaporative emission testing for 1975 and later model year vehicles, a test fee to
ensure the State has adequate resources to implement the program, enforcement by registration suspension, a repair
effectiveness program, contractual requirements for testing convenience, quality assurance, data collection,
minimum expenditure, time extension and hardship waivers, reporting, test equipment and test procedure specifications,
public information and consumer protection, inspector training and certification, and penalties against inspector
incompetence. In addition, the enhanced I/M program will include: IM240 testing for 1981 and newer vehicles, an on-road
testing program, and emission recall enforcement. 

On July 18, 1994, EPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) for the State of New Hampshire (59 FR 36408). The
NPR proposed conditional approval of the New Hampshire enhanced inspection and maintenance program. In response
to the NPR an additional submittal was made by New Hampshire on August 18, 1994. 
 
The NPR identified eight areas which needed to be addressed by New Hampshire. The August 18, 1994 submission by New
Hampshire adequately addressed these areas. Each one is discussed below and the state's response summarized.
 
 1. Enhanced I/M Performance Standard_Some of the assumptions used by New Hampshire in the MOBILE5a modeling demonstration
needed to be revised. The assumptions for gasoline Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) and vehicle refueling emissions used
in the model program were not the same as those used in the New Hampshire proposed program. The state was also asked to
review the assumptions for compliance and waiver rates and revise them if appropriate. The compliance and waiver
rates are discussed elsewhere in this document. The state revised the assumptions appropriately in the August 18,
1994 submittal, which included a new MOBILE5a modeling demonstration showing that the performance standard will
be met with the proposed New Hampshire program.

2. Network Type and Program Evaluation_The state did not have provisions to bar contractor employees from referring
motorists to particular repair facilities. The state has provided contract language drafted by the New Hampshire
Office of the Attorney General, the substance of which will be included in the final contract, to bar contractor employees
from referring motorists to particular repair facilities and to provide for appropriate penalties.

3. Vehicle Coverage_The state did not provide adequate information on vehicles subject to the program. In its August
18 submittal, New Hampshire included a table showing the number of subject vehicles by model year and provided information
on exempt vehicles.

4. Quality Control_The state did not address the required quality control manual in sufficient detail. The state
indicated in previous submittals that the quality control manual will be developed by the contractor. The manual
will follow specifications for quality control per EPA's Technical Guidance, and New Hampshire regulations. In
the August 18 submittal, New Hampshire included a table of contents for the manual. Based on these documents, the resulting
quality control manual will meet EPA requirements.

5. Waiver Rate_The state offered to provide additional guidance on procedures for waiver review, and to reconsider
the 1% waiver rate in the original submittal. The state explained in the August 18 submittal that the present waiver
rate is less than one half of one percent, and that in order to qualify for a waiver, verification of repairs must be done
by a highly trained state referee, and repairs must be performed by a certified mechanic who will have attended up to
120 hours of training. Although New Hampshire does not expect the waiver rate to increase, they increased the rate
in the SIP to 2%.
 
6. Motorist Compliance Enforcement_The state needed to submit information justifying a 99% compliance rate, describing
the computer matching system, handling of exempt vehicles, fleet vehicles, and tracking of out of state exemptions
and time extensions. In the August 18 submittal, the state described a 12 point enforcement program which will assure
a 99% compliance rate. The state also described the software and hardware upgrades which will be made to the computer
matching system. As part of the Enforcement Compliance Procedures also submitted on August 18, change of status actions,
which could make a previously subject vehicle exempt, must be verified by a Highway Enforcement Officer. Fleet vehicles
must be tested at the contractor facilities and meet the same requirements as other vehicles. A more detailed fleet
plan will be developed as part of the contract. New Hampshire explained that out of state exemptions and time extensions
would be tracked with the computer system, and vehicle owners would be issued registration suspensions when the time
of the extension ran out if the vehicle was not in compliance.

7. Quality Assurance_The state agreed to address certain points in the August 18 submittal. The August 18 submittal
stated that audit reports will be entered onto the host computer of the contractor, and a hard copy of the audit report
will be kept in the stations file in the I/M office. The report filed with the audit results will contain enough evidence
to request an administrative hearing if necessary. Anyone suspected of violating regulations would be targeted
for additional auditing. The DOS intends to assign officers that do not have regular contact with a particular facility
to conduct covert audits. Auditors will receive 128 hours of training at a vocational technical college covering
rules of the program, emission failures and emission repairs. Auditors will also be involved in acceptance testing
of the program and will receive quality assurance, quality control, and equipment training from the contractor.

8. Improving Repair Effectiveness_The state agreed to submit a plan to transmit information to the repair industry.
The August 18 submittal stated that New Hampshire will require the contractor to issue a quarterly newsletter to repair
facilities containing national information and tips, local program changes, training courses, common problems,
diagnostic tips, and other assistance issues. 



Conditional Approval


The August 18, 1994 submittal reaffirmed New Hampshire's commitment to submit by July 29, 1995 revisions addressing
compliance via diagnostic inspection, the inspector penalty schedule, and standards for remote sensing technology.
All three require regulation revisions. 


 
 
1. Compliance via diagnostic inspections were allowed for all model years in the original submission, but in a letter
dated May 19, 1994, the state indicated that it will establish procedures and a policy which will allow compliance
by this mechanism only on 1981 and newer vehicles subject to IM240 tests at final cutpoints or lower. 

2. The New Hampshire Enhanced I/M Rule, Section 16, does not require imposition of substantial penalties as defined
by EPA's I/M rule (six month suspension) or equivalent retainage on the first offense by inspectors for violations
that directly affect emission reduction benefits. In its letter to EPA dated June 28, 1994 New Hampshire stated that
Section 16 will be revised to be consistent with the penalties required by the EPA rule. 

3. The state has not established standards for the on-road testing program. In a letter dated May 19, 1994, the state
commits to develop and submit standards to EPA. 

The state has committed, in it's May 19 and June 28, 1994 letters to submitting revisions addressing the three issues
discussed above by July 29, 1995. Section 110(k)(4) of the CAA provides that, if a state fails to comply with its commitment,
such conditional approval will convert to a disapproval. 

Other specific requirements of EPA's I/M rule and the rationale for EPA's proposed action are explained in the NPR
and will not be restated here. No public comments were received on the NPR. 

Response to Comments


On July 18, 1994 (59 FR 36408), EPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) for the State of New Hampshire. The
NPR proposed conditional approval, or in the alternative, disapproval of the New Hampshire I/M SIP submitted by the
State. No public comments were received on the NPR.



Final Action


EPA is conditionally approving the New Hampshire Enhanced Vehicle Inspection and Maintenance Program as a revision
to the New Hampshire SIP. 

Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to a SIP shall be considered in light of specific technical, economic,
and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.

As noted elsewhere in this document, the EPA received no comment on the proposed action. Accordingly, the Regional
Administrator has reclassified this action from Table 1 to Table 3 under the processing procedures published in the
FR on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214), and revisions to these procedures issued on October 4, 1993, in an EPA memorandum
entitled ``Changes to State Implementation Plan (SIP) Tables.'' 

Regulatory Process


This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the FR on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro,
Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this action
from Executive Order 12866 review.

Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator certifies that SIP approvals under sections 107, 110 and 172 of the Clean
Air Act will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. SIP approvals (or redesignations)
do not create any new requirements but simply approve requirements that are already state law. SIP approvals (or redesignations),
therefore, do not add any additional requirements for small entities. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State
relationship under the Clean Air Act, preparation of a flexibility analysis for a SIP approval would constitute Federal
inquiry into the economic reasonableness of the State actions. The Clean Air Act forbids EPA to base its actions concerning
SIPs on such grounds.

 v. 

EPA.

, 427 U.S. 246, 96 S. Ct. 2518 (1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2).

 If the conditional approval is converted to a disapproval under section 110(k), based on the state's failure to meet
the commitment, it will not affect any existing state requirements applicable to small entities. Federal disapproval
of the state submittal does not affect its state-enforceability. Moreover, EPA's disapproval of the submittal does
not impose a new Federal requirement. Therefore, EPA certifies that in the event EPA disapproves the state submittal,
this disapproval action would not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities because it would
not remove existing state requirements nor does it substitute a new Federal requirement.

Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by December 12, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by
the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor
does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section
307(b)(2).)


Under Executive Order 12866, (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines
``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may:



(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal
governments or communities;
(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) Materially
alter the budgetary impact of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients
thereof; or 
(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order.
It has been determined that this rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the terms of Executive Order
12866 and is therefore not subject to OMB review.

Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans; State of Maryland-Emission Statement Program




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is approving a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Maryland. This revision consists
of an emission statement program for stationary sources which emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and/or nitrogen
oxides (NOx) at or above specified actual emission threshold levels. The intended effect of this action is to approve
in the State of Maryland a regulation for annual reporting of actual emissions by sources that emit VOC and /or NOx in
accordance with sections 184(b)(2) and 182(f) of the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA). This action is being taken under
section 110 of the Clean Air Act. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On June 21, 1994 (59 FR 31962), EPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) for the State of Maryland. The NPR
proposed approval of the Maryland's Emission Statement Program. The formal SIP revision was submitted by the State
of Maryland on November 13, 1992.
 


Maryland's Department of the Environment (MDE) submitted a revision to Maryland's SIP which requires owners of stationary
sources that emit VOCs and/or NOx, above specified actual emission applicability thresholds, to submit annual statements
certifying emissions. 

Other specific requirements of the SIP revision on Emission Statements and the rationale for EPA's proposed action
are explained in the NPR and will not be restated here. No public comments were received on the NPR.



Final Action


EPA is approving amendments to COMAR 26.11.01, General Administrative Procedures, to revise section .01, Definitions,
and to add section .05-1, Emission Statements, as a revision to the State of Maryland SIP.

Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any State Implementation Plan. Each request for revision to the State Implementation Plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements.
 
This action has been classified as a Table 3 action for signature by the Regional Administrator under the procedures
published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The OMB has exempted this regulatory action from Executive Order
12866 review.








Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by December 12, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by
the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor
does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action to approve Maryland's Emission Statements Program may not be challenged later
in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).)

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Commission, at the request of Ocean Isle Broadcasting Company, allots Channel 228A to Ocean Isle Beach, NC, as
the community's first local aural transmission service. 

See 

59 FR 4020, January 28, 1994. Channel 228A can be allotted to Ocean Isle Beach in compliance with the Commission's minimum
distance separation requirements, at coordinates 33-53-40 North Latitude and 78-28-26
West Longitude, with a site restriction of 4.3 kilometers (2.7 miles) west to avoid a short-spacing to vacant but applied-for
Channel 229A at Wrightsville Beach, NC. The allotment at Ocean Isle Beach is short-spaced to the presently licensed
facility of Station WLTT, Channel 228A, Shallotte, NC. However, pursuant to the modification of Station WLTT's license
to specify operation on Channel 279C3, a construction permit specifying the new channel has been granted and the licensee
has now filed an application for license to cover its construction permit (BLH-940210KA). Final action on a
construction permit application for Channel 228A at Ocean Isle Beach may be withheld pending the licensing of Station
WLTT at the site specified in its construction permit. With this action, this proceeding is terminated.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Occupational Safety and Health Administration 
(OSHA) is issuing a final standard specifying safety 
requirements covering all logging operations, regardless of 
the end use of the forest products (saw logs, veneer bolts, 
pulpwood, chips, etc.). This standard replaces the existing 
standard at 29 CFR 1910.266, that had applied only to 
pulpwood logging, and thereby expands coverage to provide 
protection for all employees engaged in logging operations. 
The final standard addresses the unique hazards found in 
logging operations, and supplements other general industry 
standards in 29 CFR part 1910. The final standard 
strengthens and further clarifies some provisions of the 
existing standard, and eliminates unnecessary provisions. 
The revised standard also requires training for all 
employees in this high risk industry. OSHA believes this 
standard will significantly decrease the number of employees 
killed or injured in this industry.

I. Introduction 



The Occupational Safety and Health Administration 
(OSHA) is issuing a final standard detailing safety 
requirements for logging operations, regardless of the end 
use of the forest products (saw logs, veneer bolts, 
pulpwood, chips, etc.). Logging consists of felling trees 
(usually by chain saws), removing the limbs and branches 
(limbing), and cutting or splitting the trees into 
manageable logs (bucking). Trees and logs are then moved 
(yarding) to central locations (landings) by one of several 
methods (e.g., skidding or forwarding). In relatively flat 
terrain, logs are hooked to a tractor and dragged to the 
landing. When terrain is very steep or rough, logs may be 
transported by steel cables attached to a winching apparatus 
(cable yarder) via a system of cables, blocks, pulleys, and 
carriages (cable yarding). Then logs are partially 
suspended and dragged over the ground (high-lead yarding) or 
hoisted into the air and conveyed on overhead cables (sky-line yarding) to the landing. At the landing, logs are 
mechanically loaded onto trucks, railroad cars or barges for 
transport to sawmills. In some cases logs are formed into 
log rafts for transport by water to sawmills. Logging 
operations require employees to work in all types of 
weather, on all types of terrain and in isolated, remote 
locations. (Logging operations and regional characteristics 
are discussed in greater detail in the profile of the 
logging industry in the Regulatory Impact Analysis.) 



II. Regulatory History 



OSHA's existing pulpwood standard was adopted pursuant 
to Section 6(a) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 
1970 (the OSH Act) (29 U.S.C. 655(a)). Section 6(a) 
permitted OSHA, within two years of the enactment of the OSH 
Act, to promulgate as OSHA standards any existing national 
consensus standard or established Federal standard. At that 
time, the only national consensus standard covering logging 
operations was the American National Standards Institute 
standard that was limited to pulpwood logging (ANSI O3.1-1971, Pulpwood Logging Safety Standard) (Ex 2-13).
OSHA's 
pulpwood standard has remained virtually unchanged since it 
was first adopted.

After OSHA adopted the ANSI pulpwood logging standard, 
trade associations with interests in the logging of other 
forest products, such as sawlogs and veneer bolts, joined 
with ANSI to revise the pulpwood logging standard to include 
all logging operations within the United States. The 
expanded ANSI standard was approved May 19, 1977 (ANSI 03.1-
1978, Safety Requirements for Logging) (hereafter ``1978 ANSI 
logging standard'') (Ex. 2-14). That standard adopted most of 
the safety practices contained in the earlier standard, 
applying them to all logging operations throughout the 
nation.

The 1978 ANSI logging standard, however, was withdrawn 
by ANSI in 1984 because no final action was taken to revise 
or reaffirm it. Since ANSI procedures require that action 
be taken to reaffirm, revise, or withdraw a standard no 
later than five years after the date of its publication, the 
1978 ANSI logging standard was withdrawn by default. 
Currently there is no national consensus standard covering 
logging operations.

In July 1976, the National Institute for Occupational 
Safety and Health (NIOSH), published a criteria document, 
Recommendations For An Occupational Standard For Logging 
From Felling To First Haul that was applicable to all 
logging operations (Ex. 4-3). The NIOSH document addressed 
the hazards and safe work practices involved in felling, 
bucking, limbing, yarding and loading operations.

The NIOSH criteria document differed from OSHA's 
pulpwood logging standard in several ways: 

(a) The criteria document included all logging 
operations such as those relating to sawlogs, veneer bolts, 
poles and pilings rather than being limited only to pulpwood 
operations; 

(b) It included training requirements for employees; 

(c) It did not include provisions dealing with 
equipment protective devices, personnel transport, 
off-highway truck transport, chipping operations, or the 
construction and maintenance of roads, trails, and bridges; 
and 

(d) It recommended pre-placement and periodic medical 
examinations.

This final standard for logging operations, as did 
OSHA's proposed rule, adopts many of the recommendations of 
the NIOSH criteria document, including expansion of coverage 
to all logging operations, emphasis on safe work practices 
and training, and elimination of provisions not unique to 
logging operations, such as that involving construction of 
roads and bridges.

Six states have promulgated standards covering logging 
operations under the OSH Act State plan procedure set forth 
in section 18 of the OSH Act (29 U.S.C.  667) and in OSHA 
regulations (29 CFR Part 1902), which requires State plan 
States to adopt standards which are at least as effective as 
those promulgated under section 6 of the OSH Act. 29 CFR 
1902.03(c). These States, Alaska (Ex. 2-17), California 
(Ex. 2-18), Hawaii (Ex. 2-19), Michigan (Ex. 2-20), Oregon 
(Ex. 2-21) and Washington (Ex. 2-22), have adopted standards 
which provide more protection than OSHA's pulpwood logging 
standard by covering all logging operations within their 
States. The standards of the five western states also 
contain a much higher level of detail and specification than 
either the 1978 ANSI logging standard or OSHA's pulpwood 
logging standard. OSHA used these standards as source 
documents during development of this final standard.

On May 2, 1989, OSHA published a notice of proposed 
rulemaking (NPRM) to amend OSHA's pulpwood logging standard, 
29 CFR 1910.266, to include requirements for all logging 
operations (54 FR 18798). Thereafter, on May 11, 1990, OSHA 
published a notice of hearing in which 10 issues were raised 
for additional comment (55 FR 19745). There were 92 
comments submitted in response to the proposed rule and 
hearing notice.

Informal public hearings were held on July 24-25, 1990, 
in Washington, D.C., and on August 21-23, 1990, in Portland, 
OR, to allow interested persons who had objections to the 
proposed rule to have an opportunity to state those 
objections. There were 23 companies, organizations, 
associations and individuals who participated in the 
hearings.

At the close of the hearing Administrative Law Judge 
John M. Vittone established a 60-day post hearing comment 
period, until October 22, 1990, for the submission of 
additional information and data supplementing the testimony 
provided at the hearing. The post-hearing comment period 
was followed by another 30 days, until November 21, 1990, 
for hearing participants to submit final briefs, analyses 
and summations. OSHA received 12 comments during the post-
hearing comment period. 

OSHA has considered all evidence, comments and 
testimony entered into the rulemaking record and presented 
at the public hearing in developing this final standard. 



II. Basis for Agency Action 



A. Hazards



The safety hazards present in the logging industry are 
well-known,
 and there is no dispute among participants in 
this rulemaking that logging is a high hazard industry (Ex. 
2-1 through 2-10, 2-30, 5-18, 38B, 38C). The tools and 
equipment which logging employees use or operate, such as 
chain saws, axes and tractors, pose hazards wherever they 
are utilized in industry. As logging employees use their 
tools and equipment, they are dealing with massive weights 
and irresistible momentum of falling, rolling, and sliding 
trees and logs. The hazards are even more acute when 
dangerous environmental conditions are factored in, such as 
uneven, unstable or rough terrain; inclement weather 
including rain, snow, lightning, winds, and extreme cold; 
remote and isolated work sites where health care facilities 
are not immediately accessible. The combination of these 
hazards present a significant risk to employees working in 
logging operations throughout the country, regardless of the 
type of timber being logged, where it is logged or the end 
use of the wood. 





There is also no dispute that these hazards and the 
resulting injuries and fatalities are severe and are not 
limited to the pulpwood sector of the industry (Ex. 2-1, 5-6, 5-10, 5-17, 5-18, 5-21,
5-36, 5-42, 5-46, 5-48, 5-49, 5-54, 5-61, 5-65). The 1992 Census of
Fatal Occupational 
Injuries, a public report compiled by the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics (BLS), indicated there were 158 fatalities in the 
logging industry, which amounts to a 2 in 1,000 risk of 
death each year. The National Institute for Occupational 
Safety and Health (NIOSH) estimates that there are 16,500 
compensable injuries each year in the logging industry (Ex. 
37). This amounts to an incidence rate of 1 in every 5 
loggers. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture 
(USDA), the accident rate in the logging industry has pushed 
workers' compensation insurance to 40 percent of payroll 
costs (Ex. 5-18). The USDA estimates that this now amounts 
to $90 million annually in the Pacific Northwest Region 
alone. According to a study conducted by the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics (BLS), as least 47 percent of all injuries 
reported occurred in non-pulpwood logging operations (Ex. 2-1).

The following discussion of the accident and 
injury data shows that injury incidence rate for the logging 
industry is among the highest industry incidence rates in 
the country. 



B. Accident, Injury, and Other Data 



OSHA looked at several data sources to identify and 
characterize the degree of risk faced by employees in the 
logging industry. The data show that the logging industry 
has one of the highest injury incidence rates. For example, 
the most recent injury incidence rate for the logging 
industry (15.6) compiled by the BLS is almost double the 
incidence rate for the combined private sector (7.9). The 
logging incidence rate was also well above the incidence 
rate for the manufacturing sector (11.2). 

To assess the level of risk in logging operations, OSHA 
relied primarily on the following data sources. These data 
sources are described and discussed below.

1. 

Bureau of Labor Statistics.

 The Bureau of Labor 
Statistics (BLS) publishes annual reports that list the 
estimates of injuries in the private sector during the year 
under consideration, Occupational Injuries and Illnesses in 
the United States by Industry (Ex. 2-1, 2-2, 2-3, 2-4, 2-5, 
2-6, 2-7, 2-8, 2-9, 2-10, 2-30, 38B and 38C). The data and 
information are broken down industry by industry according 
to Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes. The BLS 
injury reports and data are generated from inquiries to 
selected employers about the OSHA Form 200 (Log and Summary 
of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses). 

Table 1 shows BLS occupational injury incidence data 
for the logging industry for 1972 through 1991. The data in 
Table 1 were derived from the BLS data using SIC code 241 
(Logging Camps and Logging Contractors). While this 
classification covers the majority of the employees engaging 
in logging operations, it does not cover loggers employed by 
mills (SIC 242-Sawmills and Planing Mills) and other loggers 
working for other miscellaneous employers (SIC 24-Lumber and 
Wood Products, Except Furniture). Although the incidence 
rates for SIC 242 and 24 are very close to the rates for SIC 
241, OSHA did not include incidence rates for those SIC 
codes in its determination of incidence rates for logging 
because BLS does not provide incidence rates for 
occupational categories within a SIC code. As such, OSHA 
was not able to identify and segregate out the percentage of 
accidents which occurred while employees were performing 
logging as opposed to other operations in those related 
industries. OSHA is aware that there has been a move on the 
part of some mill owners to increasingly use private 
contractors rather than mill employees to harvest the trees 
that the mills process. OSHA believes, however, that SIC 
241 does capture the vast majority of employees performing 
logging operations. To the extent that some logging 
operations may still be performed by employees in other than 
SIC 241, OSHA does not believe that their accident data 
significantly alter the level of risk present in logging 
operations.

While the injury incidence rate remains high in the 
logging industry, the BLS data show a steady decrease in the 
incidence rate for the industry since the pulpwood logging 
standard was adopted in 1971.
 The decrease in incidence 
rates occurs in both lost-workday and non-lost-workday cases. 
In contrast, the data also show a steady increase in the 
average number of lost workdays per case, that indicates that 
the severity of injuries has increased over time. 





The 1991 logging industry incidence rates still remain 
far above the total incidence rates and lost-workday incidence 
rates for other industries, as Table 2 indicates. For 
example, the most recent logging industry incidence rate 
(15.6) is almost double the incidence rate for the private 
sector combined (7.9). It is also 40 percent higher than the 
manufacturing sector incidence rate (11.2). The logging 
injury incidence rates also are well above the incidence rates 
for the construction industry (12.8) and mining (7.1), 
industries generally considered as high hazard.

<TEXT>
 

 

The most recent lost-workday incidence rate for logging was 9.9, which is almost double the 5.0 incidence rate in the
manufacturing sector and almost three times the 3.7 incidence rate for the private sector combined. The lost-workday
rate, that is an indicator of the severity of cases, is extremely high in the logging industry (274.8 lost workdays
per 100 full-time workers). It is more than three times the private sector lost-workday rate (79.8) and more than double
the manufacturing lost-workday rate (101.1). 
2. Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries. 

The Bureau of Labor Statistics also publishes an annual Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries (CFOI). The CFOI is
a systematic and verifiable count of fatally injured public and private sector workers. This census uses administrative
records, such as death certificates, workers' compensation fatality claims, medical examiners' records, and other
reports to Federal and State agencies, to identify the workplace fatalities and complete descriptive data on the
workers and circumstances of their deaths. According to the 1992 CFOI, the most recent data available, 158 logging
employees were killed while performing logging operations. Table 3 shows that more than 60 percent were using power
tools and performing cutting activities at the time of their death. Almost 20 percent were killed while operating
logging machines or vehicles.

<TEXT>
 

 

Applying the CFOI fatality estimate to the most recent logging employment estimate of 72,100 developed for the Regulatory
Impact Analysis (see Section VI of this preamble), the fatality incidence rate is .22. The logging industry fatality
incidence rate is 8.1 times higher than the fatality incidence rate the mining sector (.027), the next closest industrial
division. In addition, the logging fatality rate is 53.6 times higher than the fatality rate for the manufacturing
sector (.0041). 


3. BLS Work Injury Report (WIR). 

The most detailed data source available to the Agency on logging injuries and their causes is a June 1984 BLS Work Injury
Report survey of 1,086 injured logging employees, hereafter referred to as the WIR survey (Ex. 2-1). It is significant
to note that all 1,086 injuries occurred within just a three-month period.





Included in the report are employees who were injured while performing logging activities at the logging site or while
moving or transporting logs across terrain. Motor vehicle accidents were included when the accident occurred at
the work site, while hauling logs to the mill, returning from the mill, or transporting tools, equipment, or workers
to or from the logging site in company-owned vehicles. 
Almost one half (47%) of those responding indicated they were performing non-pulpwood logging operations, therefore
they were not covered by OSHA's existing pulpwood logging standard. Another 17 percent did not know what type of timber
they were logging.
 OSHA believes it is reasonable to assume that some percentage of those employees were not covered by OSHA's existing
logging standard and therefore, more than one half of the injured employees were not covered by the OSHA standard.
Approximately 35 percent of the injured employees were engaged in pulpwood logging operations.




The survey also contained the following information: (1) the work site where the injury occurred (Table 4); (2) work
activity being performed at the time of the accident (Table 5); (3) causes of the accidents (Table 6); (4) sources of
the accidents (Tables 7-10); (5) protective equipment in use at the time of the accident (Table 11); (6) safety
features of vehicles or equipments operated at the time of the accident (Table 12); (7) safety training given prior
to the accident (Table 13); (8) factors contributing to the injury (Table 14); (9) severity of the injury (Table 15-16).



a. Work site where injury occurred. 

Table 4 shows that more than one-half of employees injured were at cutting sites in the woods, while only 20 percent
were injured at landings. In addition, more than one-half of those injured were working on sloping terrain at the time
and more than 60 percent reported that the work site contained moderate or heavy brush.

<TEXT>
 



b. Work activity at time of accident. 

Table 5 shows 
that almost one-half of all injured employees were engaged 
in cutting activities (felling, limbing, bucking) at the 
time of their accidents, and almost one-fourth of all 
injured employees were felling trees. Twenty-eight percent 
of the employees were injured during yarding operations 
(choker setting or hooking up, tractor or cable skidding, 
chasing). The remainder of the accidents occurred when the 
logs were being prepared to move from the landing 
(loading/unloading and rigging) or were being transported to 
the mill or other final destination. Other unspecified 
logging activities accounted for eight percent of the 
accidents. Finally, servicing and maintaining of equipment 
accounted for four percent of the accidents, a figure that 
is consistent with the information found for servicing or 
maintenance accidents throughout general industry. (See 
Docket S-012A.) Table 3 outlines the activity being 
performed at the time of the accidents and the percentage 
each activity represents.

c. Causes of accidents. 

Table 6 indicates that almost 
one-fourth of the employees were injured when hit by trees, 
limbs or logs. Another quarter of the accidents were due to 
slips and falls. It is important to note that 20 percent of 
all injuries were chain saw related.

d. Sources of injury. 

The WIR survey broke down the 
sources of injuries into employees hit by trees; injured in 
slips or falls; while using chain saws; and while operating 
equipment or motor vehicles (Tables 7-10). As Table 7 
indicates, almost one-half of those employees injured by 
trees were hit by falling wood.



 


Approximately one-fourth of employees were injured in 
slips or falls, as shown in Table 8. Of these employees, 47 
percent were injured when they fell from elevations. 
Approximately 28 percent fell from some type of mobile 
equipment or motor vehicle.

It should be noted that in a majority of cases where an 
employee slipped or fell, the fall was due to an uneven 
surface. Many of these employees lost their balance on 
those uneven surfaces, such as standing on felled trees. 
Other employees slipped and fell from slippery or loose 
bark, sudden shifting of trees or logs, protruding roots, 
deadwood, leaves, vines, other wood litter and rocks.

As stated above, one-fifth of all employees were 
injured while operating chain saws, as shown in Table 9. Of 
these employees, about two-thirds were hurt when the chain 
saw kicked back.

Table 10 shows the type of machine or vehicle the 
employee was operating at the time of injury. Over one-half 
of those injuries involved logging trucks, on which logs are 
loaded for transport to mills, etc. 







e. Protective equipment. 

Also included in the WIR 
survey was information about the type of protective 
equipment being worn or used at the time of the accident. 
Table 11 shows that the majority of employees were wearing 
logging boots, gloves and head protection when they were 
injured. However, less than one-third of those injured were 
wearing leg protection, even though almost 60 percent of the 
injuries investigated occurred when employees were 
performing activities that required the use of a chain saw 
(brushing, felling trees, limbing, and bucking). In 
addition, only six of the 33 employees injured while 
operating equipment or vehicles were using seat belts. 
Since more than one-half of all injured employees said they 
were working on sloping terrain at the time, OSHA believes 
it is reasonable to assume that some of the machine 
accidents were rollovers or tipovers and that seat belts 
could have prevented some of those injuries.

f. Equipment and vehicle safety features. 

Table 12 
clearly shows that a significant number of machines and 
vehicles involved in the logging accidents were not equipped 
with fall protection, rollover protection or seat belts. 






g. Safety training. 

The WIR survey also contained 
information on whether employees had received safety 
training prior to their accidents. Table 13 indicates that 
over one-third of the injured employees had never received 
training on safe work practices or in the operation of 
machines and vehicles used in logging operations. Only 40 
percent of employees injured said they had received training 
from the employer. In fact, 19 percent of those injured 
said that whatever training they had received had come from 
a relative. 






h. Factors contributing to the accident

. Table 14 
shows the conditions or factors that the injured worker felt 
contributed to his/her accident. With regard to natural 
conditions, more than 30 percent said the sloping terrain 
and heavy brush had been a factor. In addition, 15 percent 
of the injured employees said that a danger tree had 
contributed to the accident. 

Human factors also contributed to accidents, according 
to the injured employees. More than 20 percent said that 
the fast speed at which they had been working contributed to 
their accident. OSHA notes that 10 percent of those injured 
were unaware of the hazards when they were injured.

i. Severity of injury. 

The WIR survey also indicates 
that when employees were injured in logging operations, 
their injuries were more severe than injuries occurring in 
other industry sectors. Table 15 shows that almost three- 
fourths of those injured missed more than 1 day of work due 
to their injuries. Over 30 percent missed more than 10 days 
of work. The average lost-time case resulted in 23 days 
away from work. In addition, Table 16 shows that more than 
one-fifth of those injured were hospitalized an average of 
six nights.

4. OSHA First Reports of Serious Injury (FRSI). 

OSHA also utilizes a telephone reporting system for the field staff to inform the national office of the occurrence
of serious or significant accidents. This telephone call system is part of the OSHA emergency communications system.
Regional Administrators are required to file first reports of fatalities, catastrophes and other important events
(such as those that receive significant publicity) to the National Office. The information is recorded on a form entitled
First Report of Serious Accident (FRSI). Approximately 1,200 reports are received by the National Office yearly.




None of the reports are screened prior to OSHA receiving them to eliminate those from a certain industry, occupation
or because of other factors. None of these reports may be considered statistically significant by themselves in attempting
to determine the number of accidents that have occurred. However, they do give an indication of where many serious
accidents have occurred and the types of work being performed at the time of the accidents. 

OSHA has examined the FRSI reports and identified 105 (Ex. 4-65) that occurred while employees were performing
logging operations. These accidents occurred between October 1985 and December 1989. Table 17 lists the logging
accident reports as a percentage of all accident reports received.

The percentages attributable to logging injuries are particularly large in relation to the total employment in the
industries represented. Using employment rates for 1985-1989 for the private sector and for the logging industry,
OSHA observes that the percentage of accidents recorded on the FRSI for logging for each year far exceeded the percentage
of employees in logging compared with the private sector. Whereas, logging employment constituted one tenth of one
percent of total private sector employment, the reports of serious accidents in logging averaged about two percent
of the total accidents. Table 18 lists these employment rates as they appear in the BLS annual reports entitled, Occupational
Injuries and Illnesses in the United States by Industry, (followed by the year of the data). (See section A above.)

OSHA was also able to identify from the FRSI reports the activity that was being conducted at the time of the accident
and the causes of the accidents. For example, more than one-half were involved in cutting activities when they were
seriously injured. OSHA also notes that almost nine percent were seriously injured in machine rollover or tipover
accidents while only 1 employee was injured by a jillpoke. Table 19 lists the activity being conducted or the causes
of the accidents.

5. OSHA Fatality/Catastrophe Investigations Report (FCI).

 OSHA regulations require that all workplace fatalities be reported to the nearest OSHA Area Office. Employers are
required to complete a Fatality/Catastrophe Event Report Form (OSHA 36), which is reviewed by the OSHA Area Director
to determine whether an investigation of the fatality is warranted. In 1989, OSHA published a study of 141 logging
fatalities that occurred during the period of 1978-84 (Ex. 4-61). These fatalities do not represent all
logging industry fatalities during that time period. 

According to the study, 71 percent of those logging employees killed were out in the cutting area. Only one percent
each were killed on skid trails or at landings. 

The study also indicated that 43 percent of those 
killed were felling trees at the time. Employees performing 
yarding and bucking and limbing operations each accounted 
for 13 percent of the fatalities. The overwhelming majority 
of employees (72%) were killed when they were struck or 
crushed by a tree, log or limb, while 17 percent were killed 
in machine accidents. One percent were killed in chain-saw 
accidents. 

Unsafe work practices, misjudgments and lack of 
training or supervision accounted for 42 percent of the 
fatalities while less than one percent were due to equipment 
failure. 



6. Maine Bureau of Labor Statistics.

 The State of 
Maine Bureau of Labor Statistics (Maine BLS) has compiled 
various statistics on injuries and fatalities in the logging 
industry (Ex. 4-174, 4-175, 4-176). 

Maine BLS conducted a detailed survey of 189 logging 
employee injuries that occurred between May and July of 1982 
(Ex. 4-175). This number does not represent all logging 
employees who were injured during that period. According to 
this survey, 35 percent of employees reporting injuries were 
struck by trees, logs or limbs. Chain-saw accidents 
accounted for 26 percent of the reported injuries while 13 
percent of the logging employees were injured in slips or 
falls. 

According to Maine BLS, the category that showed a 
significantly higher than average percentage of disabling 
injuries was chain-saw accidents. Over one-half of all 
chain-saw accidents involved kickback. In over 70 percent 
of the kickback accidents, the chain saws were equipped with 
chain brakes. Maine BLS said that chain brakes had played a 
significant role in lessening the effects of the injury. 
Less than 13 percent of chain-saw accidents where chain 
brakes were present resulted in hospitalization, while 
nearly 50 percent of the accidents involving other than 
chain saws resulted in hospitalization. 

This survey also indicates that two-thirds of all 
logging accidents resulted in lost workdays and 13 percent 
of all injuries required at least one overnight in the 
hospital. The average hospitalization was for five days. 

Maine BLS has also compiled statistics from 1980-87 of 
chain-saw injuries that resulted in a first report of 
serious injury (Ex. 4-176). According to this report, 
average chain-saw injuries for each year was 362. Of those, 
an average of 237 (65%) were disabling injuries, that is, 
injuries which result in lost workdays. 

Maine BLS has also examined disabling logging injuries 
reported from 1985-87 that had resulted in lacerations (Ex. 
4-174). During those three years, there were an average of 
183 disabling lacerations each year. 



7. Washington State Logging Fatalities.

 A detailed 
study has been compiled on logging fatalities in the State 
of Washington from 1977-83 (Ex. 4-129). Of the 135 
fatalities that occurred during those years, the study 
analyzed 92 percent of them. Death certificates and reports 
of investigations by Washington OSHA were used in the 
analysis. 

According to this study, the overall annual fatality 
rate for logging during this period was approximately 2 per 
1,000 full-time employees. Those employees who were killed 
had a mean length of experience in the logging industry of 
11.6 years. Less than 10 percent had less than one year's 
experience. 

More than 40 percent of all loggers killed were engaged 
in felling activities, while 23 percent were killed 
performing yarding operations. Almost 20 percent of the 
loggers were operating logging machines at the time of their 
accident. Table 20 shows the jobs employees were performing 
at the time of their accident.

<TEXT>
 




More than 65 percent of all employees killed were hit or crushed by a log or tree. While most of these employees who were
hit or crushed by a tree were the result of their own activity, more than eight percent were hit by trees being felled
by another employee. Approximately nine percent were killed in machine rollover accidents, while 10 percent of those
employees killed were struck by a machine or vehicle. Table 21 shows the causes of the accidents in which loggers were
killed.

According to the study, accident investigation reports indicted that many of the deaths would not have occurred if
the employees had been following safe work practices and had remained out of hazardous areas (e.g., other occupied
work areas). 


C. Need for agency action. 


OSHA believes that current logging methods and the inherent dangers posed by work in the woods, such as those caused
by inclement weather, uneven terrain and isolation from health care facilities, present significant hazards to
employees engaged in logging operations across the nation, regardless of the type logging being conducted or the
end use of the wood. The presentation of data in the preceding section further demonstrate the level of risk to which
all loggers are exposed. Nevertheless, the existing OSHA safety standard for pulpwood logging (29 CFR 1910.266)
specifically addresses only one segment of the logging industry_logging operations whose forest product ends up
as pulp. Although OSHA does not know precisely the breakdown of employment and occupational injuries between pulpwood
and other logging operations, the data and other information available to OSHA indicate that similar hazards exist
in both sectors of the industry. 
The preceding section has shown that the logging industry remains a high risk industry, regardless of the end use of
the forest product. In particular, the data show: 
1. Employees engaged in logging operations have a substantially higher risk of injury and death than workers in many
other industries, including other high hazard industries. 
2. If they are injured, loggers are more likely to be hospitalized and lose workdays compared to employees in most other
industries, as evidenced by the very high lost-workday incidence rate. 
3. When loggers are injured, their injuries are much more severe and result in longer hospitalizations and more lost
time per employee than do the injuries of employees in most other industries. 
4. Loggers also have a much higher incidence of fatalities than employees in other industries.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941012-0-00056 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941012-0-00011 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In addition, the Regulatory Impact Analysis for the 
final logging standard estimates, based on the various data 
in the record, that there are an average of 158 fatalities, 
6,798 lost workday injuries and 3,770 non-lost workday 
injuries that occur each year in the logging industry. (For 
further discussion see section VI of this preamble.) 
Of the 72,100 employees engaged in logging operations 
as defined by the final rule, only 38 percent (27,170) are 
covered by State Plan State logging standards,
 which 
currently provide protection regardless of kind of logging 
operation in which the loggers are employed. Of the 
estimated 62 percent (44,930) of logging employees who are 
not covered by State plan State standards, OSHA estimates 
that at only one-third (16,478) are covered by the existing 
pulpwood logging standard. That means that almost two-thirds (28,452) are not covered by any Federal or State 
logging standard. (This estimate is consistent with the WIR 
survey, which indicated that only 35 percent of those 
surveyed were engaged in pulpwood logging operations.) 




The preceding section shows there has been a steady 
decrease in injury and lost-workday incidence rates since 
the adoption of OSHA's existing pulpwood logging standard 
and the State plan State standards. In addition to a 
further reduction in accidents for those employers currently 
covered by OSHA and State logging standards, OSHA believes 
that a substantial reduction in incidence rates can be 
achieved by promulgating a uniform national logging standard 
that provides protection for all employees engaged in 
logging operations. 
In developing the proposed rule, OSHA used the l978 
ANSI standard as its model for a uniform national logging 
standard, since many of its requirements were stated in 
performance language. This is in keeping with the Agency's 
determination that properly drafted performance standards 
can adequately address safety and health hazards without 
unnecessarily impeding technological advancement and 
employer innovation. The final rule provides a base level 
of safety for employees in all logging operations. At the 
same time, it still allows those State plan States with more 
complicated or specialized local conditions to develop their 
own detailed standards, as several States have already done. 
Many participants in this rulemaking have said that a 
comprehensive performance-based logging standard is 
necessary to reduce the risk of injury and death (Ex. 5-6, 
5-10, 5-17, 5-18, 5-21, 5-22, 5-42, 5-46, 5-74 through 5-92;

Tr. W1 21, 73, 202). OSHA agrees with these commenters. 
The Agency believes that the integrated program of personal 
protective equipment; equipment, machine and vehicle 
protective devices, inspection and maintenance; work 
practices; and training contained in the final rule is 
reasonably necessary and appropriate to reduce the high 
injury and fatality incidence rates in this industry. 


V. Major Issues 


A. Introduction 


As a result of issues raised by those commenting on the 
proposed logging standard, OSHA solicited information on 10 
major issues in the notice of public hearing (55 FR 19745, 
May 11, 1990). OSHA requested detailed information on a 
variety of issues including training, personal protective 
equipment, first aid, chain-saw protective devices, and seat 
belts. These issues were discussed by the participants 
during the public hearings and in post-hearing comments. 
The evidence submitted to the record is summarized and 
evaluated in the following discussion of each issue and in 
the summary and explanation of the final rule.

1. Training. 

Comments on the proposed rule generally 
supported the need for training. Several commenters, 
however, raised specific questions about particular training 
issues. As a result, OSHA requested in the hearing notice 
further comment on the following training issues: Effective 
date of training, sufficiency of training, and portability 
of training. 



a. Effective date for training. 

In the proposed rule, 
OSHA would have required employers to be in compliance with 
all provisions of the final logging standard within 60 days 
of publication of the rule in the 

Federal Register

. The 
proposed rule did not provide extended compliance time for 
employers to familiarize themselves with the standard and to 
develop and conduct training. Some commenters said 
additional time to meet the training requirements of the 
rule was unnecessary (Ex. 9-3, 9-13; Tr. OR 343). These 
commenters said that in many logging establishments training 
is already being provided and that employers would not 
require significant time to incorporate the proposed 
training requirements into their ongoing programs. However, 
other commenters argued that the effective date for training 
should be delayed because additional time was necessary to 
develop the required training program and to train employees 
(Ex. 5-2, 5-27, 9-1, 9-2; Tr. W2 243-44). Commenters 
proposed various effective dates for training. For example, 
the Northeastern Loggers Association, Inc., recommended a 2-year phase-in of the training requirements (Ex. 5-2).
The 
American Pulpwood Association, Inc. (APA), however, 
supported a shorter six-month phase-in period:


 

Safety training programs for loggers are largely 
specific to a function (for example, proper felling 
technique). A fully comprehensive training package 
will have to be developed to meet the training 
requirements. APA is attempting to develop training 
programs and have them available by the end of 1989. * * * APA will seek OSHA staff review of its
training 
program as it is developed. We'd like a brief delay in 
enforcement, just long enough for us to have something 
available for employers (Ex. 5-27). 




At the hearing there was little testimony about 
delaying the effective date for training. Mr. Doug 
Domenech, testifying on behalf of APA, repeated APA's 
position that employers should be given some additional time 
to comply with training requirements: 




The training is a very needed thing and, unfortunately, 
we just don't have the infrastructure to provide that 
training. That's why * * * we * * * hope that OSHA 
will give some kind of variance on time before 
citations are delivered because it's just not out 
there. If loggers had to comply with a training 
requirement today, they'd all be cited (Tr. W2 243-44).




At the same time, however, Mr. Alex Hansen, of 
Associated Oregon Loggers, Inc. (AOL), testified that Oregon 
loggers already were in compliance with the training 
provisions contained in the proposed rule: 




As far as we're concerned in Oregon, you could 
implement the training tomorrow. We already have it in 
place. We don't have a problem with it. We're 
advocates of safety training in the woods. I know some 
other states have some problems. They haven't been 
doing it or maybe not as strenuous as the Oregon rules, 
and I understand their problems, but as far as our association is concerned, if you pass it tomorrow, we're in compliance
(Tr. OR 343).

<DOCNO> FR941012-0-00058 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941012-0-00011 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The record indicates that training materials and 
courses for logging safety are widely available and that 
many logging establishments have implemented training 
programs (Ex. 4-122, 4-123, 4-181, 5-20, 5-33, 9-1, 9-2, 9-5, 9-6,
36; Tr. W1 163-64, W2 113, 115, 125, 199-201, OR 87, 
259-60, 393, 546-47, 566). Trade associations such as AOL, 
APA and the Montana Logging Association have been providing 
training materials on an on-going basis (Ex. 5-27). APA 
expected to have completed a comprehensive training package 
for its members companies by 1989. In addition, state 
agricultural extension services are a source of training 
information (Ex. 4-122, 4-123). Several hearing 
participants submitted descriptions of their training 
programs and the actual training materials (Ex. 21, 22, 23, 
24, 26, 28, 29). 

OSHA is aware that many of the existing training 
programs are based on the training requirements of OSHA's 
pulpwood logging standard. Because the training 
requirements have been revised in this final rule, current 
training programs will have to be reviewed and upgraded, 
when necessary, to meet the revised requirements. In 
addition, the training provisions of the final rule vary to 
some degree from the proposed rule. As such, employers who 
made changes in their programs in response to the proposed 
rule will have to review their training materials to assure 
compliance with the final rule. 

OSHA is aware that employers, trade associations and 
other organizations that provide training will need time to 
prepare and/or update training programs to meet the 
requirements of the final rule and will need time to provide 
training to employees. However, the record also shows that 
many companies and organizations already have developed 
training programs that meet most of the requirements of the 
final rule (Ex. 5-20, 5-27, 5-52, 5-69, 9-2; Tr. OR 343). 
Many establishments, especially those in States that have 
logging standards, already are providing training (Ex. 21, 
22, 23, 24, 26, 28, 29). Therefore, OSHA does not believe 
that a lengthy delay is necessary to meet the training 
requirements of the final rule. The Agency believes that 
extending the effective date of the standard for 120 days 
after publication of the final rule in the 

Federal Register

 
will be sufficient to allow employers and others to 
familiarize themselves with the final rule, to update 
training programs to meet the provisions of the final rule, 
and to conduct initial training. This phase-in period also 
will give employers time to determine whether current and 
new employees have received the training in all of the 
elements specified in this section or whether they will need 
additional training. 



b. Sufficiency of training. 

The second issue raised in the hearing notice concerned 
what training OSHA would consider sufficient to meet the 
training requirements in the final rule. Some commenters 
supported OSHA's preference for performance based training 
(Ex. 9-3, 9-15). Other commenters argued for detailed 
specifications to be included in the training requirements, 
including a minimum number of hours of training (Ex. 9-13, 
9-19). 

In general, the final rule contains training 
requirements in performance language to allow employer 
flexibility in tailoring training programs to the individual 
circumstances under which they operate. The final rule sets 
forth the basic elements that must be covered in the 
employer's training program, such as safe performance of 
assigned work tasks; safe use of tools; recognition and 
control of workplace hazards; prevention and control of 
general logging hazards; and the requirements of the final 
standard. The training provisions also require that 
employees initially work under supervision and that they 
demonstrate the ability to perform their work tasks safely 
before being released from supervision. 

As discussed elsewhere in this preamble, each logging 
establishment has unique conditions or hazards associated 
with its logging operations, that result in unique methods 
of operation. OSHA believes that the general elements of 
the training provisions allow employers to take into account 
those differences while still requiring the employer to 
assure through training that each employee is able to 
perform the job safely.

<TEXT>
 

On the basis of information submitted to the record and 
the testimony presented during the hearings, OSHA has 
determined that employers will not have difficulty in 
complying with the training requirements of the final rule. 
OSHA believes that the performance-based elements adopted in 
the final rule will enhance employee safety and will provide 
employees with the tools to permit them to actively 
participate in providing their own protection. 

The Industrial Truck Association (ITA) recommended that 
OSHA specify in greater detail the training required for 
industrial truck operators (Ex. W1 5-47, Tr. 221-27). ITA 
urged OSHA to adopt the training provisions from the ASME 
B56.6 standard on rough-terrain forklift trucks. Mr. 
William Montweiler, testifying for ITA, stated:




Part Two of the B56.6 standard addresses general safety 
and operating practices that are highly relevant to the 
proposed rule's training provisions. Although ITA is 
pleased that the proposed rule's training provisions 
provide greater detail than OSHA's industrial truck 
rule, these provisions can be made still more effective 
by additional particularity. 

The proposed rule merely requires that employees be 
trained to recognize safety hazards and trained ``in the 
safe use or maintenance of any machinery, equipment, or 
tools that they may be required to operate or 
maintain.'' This directive, we feel, is inadequate 
because it fails to state the elements that comprise an 
effective training program. 

By contrast, paragraph 5.17.4 of the B56.6 voluntary 
standard lists numerous elements of a proper training 
program specific to rough-terrain forklift truck 
operation, including explanation of the safety-related 
aspects of truck and component design; location and 
function of controls; supervised practice; oral, 
written, and operational performance testing; and 
refresher courses. ITA requests, therefore, that the 
final logging operations rule incorporate the training 
provisions contained in the B56.6 standard.




OSHA believes that the performance-based and 
competency-based training provisions contained in the final 
standard adequately address ITA's concerns, and that more 
specific requirements in this standard for forklift truck 
operator training are not warranted for several reasons. 

First, the record indicates there is not a significant 
number of rough-terrain industrial trucks used in logging 
operations. Mr. Richard Lewis, testifying on behalf of APA, 
confirmed the limited use of rough-terrain industrial trucks 
in the logging industry:




The American Pulpwood Association currently employs 
seven technically trained foresters, two in Washington 
and five in division offices throughout the U.S. And 
collectively we've worked in the field for 
approximately 103 man years, and we get out on logging 
operations every month and sometimes once a week, and 
we have never, never observed the use of a rough 
terrain fork lift in a logging operation (Tr. OR 478-79 
OR).




Second, the ASME standard to which ITA refers, B56.6, 
does not focus on any unique problems with the use of 
industrial trucks in logging operations. Conversely, the 
logging standard is intended primarily to deal with 
workplace hazards that are unique to logging operations. 

Third, in any event, the final standard achieves the 
same training outcome as the B56.6 standard: demonstrated 
ability to safely operate a rough-terrain industrial truck.

OSHA is in agreement with ITA that safety in industrial truck operation is important in the logging industry as well
as all other industries. OSHA believes that the issue of training of industrial truck operators is more appropriately
addressed in more detail in OSHA's forthcoming proposed standard on industrial truck operator training. OSHA believes
the major safety issues involving industrial truck operation can be fully and specifically examined and addressed
in that rulemaking. 


c. Portability of training. 

The third issue raised regarding training involves the portability of training; that is, whether current and new
employees who are experienced and previously trained must receive additional or supplemental training. The proposed
rule would have required that each new employee be trained, regardless of whether he/she had been trained previously.

Some commenters supported the proposed requirement (Ex. 9-2, 9-3, 9-9, 9-13). Several commenters
disagreed with the scope of employees that need training, stating that trained and experienced loggers should not
require the same training as an inexperienced new employee (Ex. 5-21, 5-33, 5-39, 9-2; Tr.
W1 63, OR 85). 
OSHA believes that training is important for all loggers regardless of whether they have no logging experience or
have many years of experience. The need to provide training for even experienced loggers is buttressed by the WIR survey
of injured loggers, which indicated that over one third of those injured had never received training (Ex. 2-1).
In addition, more than 60 percent of those injured had worked 5 years or more in the logging industry. In fact, only 22
percent of those injured had worked in the logging industry for one year or less. 
At the same time, OSHA does not want to penalize those employers who already have instituted training programs that
meet the requirements of the final rule or can easily be brought into compliance with the final rule. In addition, OSHA
does not want to impose an unnecessary burden on an employer who hires loggers who have received the training required
by this section on a prior job. 
In order to eliminate unnecessary duplication of training in the final rule, OSHA is not requiring employers to retrain
employees who have received training in the specific requirements of this section. The final rule only requires the
employer to train employees in those elements in which the current or new employee has not been trained. For example,
an employee may need to be trained to recognize hazards that are specific to the terrain in which the work is being done,
and to utilize safe work practices to avoid or control these hazards. In addition, a new employee, even if experienced
in logging operations, may not be familiar with various work site procedures of the new employer, such as signals to
be used. It is important for new employees to be brought up to speed with the current logging practices so other members
of the logging crew are not placed at risk by the actions or inactions of the new employee. 
OSHA has included in the final rule a provision that each new employee and each employee who must be trained work under
the supervision of a designated person until they can demonstrate the ability to perform their new duties safely.
OSHA's position on the supervision requirement was supported by various hearing participants. For example, various
witnesses at the hearing noted that close supervision of new employees, regardless of their experience, is a widely
accepted practice in the logging industry and a means of determining whether the employee's previous training was
adequate (Tr. W1 91-92, OR 95-97, 204-05, 275-76, 374, 456-57, 635-36). As such,
OSHA believes that the inclusion of the supervision requirement in the final rule will provide the necessary safety
to both the new and current employee, and will not impose a significant burden on the employer. 


2. Personal protective equipment. 

In the hearing notice OSHA raised the issue about who should pay for personal protective equipment (PPE) that employees
are required to use or wear. The Agency proposed that employers 

provide

 PPE and assure it is used by employees when required. OSHA's intent in the proposed rule was that the employer provide
personal equipment at no cost to the employee. PPE items included in the proposed rule were gloves, leg protection,
logging boots, safety helmets (hard hats), eye or face protection, and respiratory protection.

Many commenters agreed that the personal protective equipment specified in the proposed rule should be used. (Ex.
5-32, 5-42, 5-64, 9-2, 9-15, 9-16, 9-20). Some commenters urged OSHA to require
that the employer be responsible for providing all PPE (Ex. 9-3, 9-13). They said that only if the employer
provided the PPE could he assure its quality, design and maintenance. However, many other commenters opposed requiring
logging employers to provide certain types of PPE, and their opposition focused primarily on logging boots (Ex. 5-11,
5-21, 5-32, 5-39, 5-45, 5-51, 5-55, 5-74 through 5-92, 9-2, 9-5,
9-15, 9-17, 9-18; Tr. W1 74-75, 110, 177, OR 22, 79, 205, 262, 441, 533, 632, 701). Many commenters
did not give any reason why the employer should not be required to pay for PPE. Other commenters contended primarily
that employers would be financially burdened if they had to pay for certain high cost PPE, such as individually-fitted
and non-reusable logging boots, in an industry that has such a high turnover rate. Other reasons for not requiring
the employer to provide certain types of PPE were the use of certain PPE by employees outside the workplace, and industry
custom. 

Commenters noted that employee turnover in the logging industry is very high (Ex. 5-11, 5-21, 5-39,
5-49, 5-51, 5-55, 5-56, 5-63, 5-65, 5-74 through 5-92; Tr. W1 74-75,
110, 177, OR 22, 79, 205, 262, 441, 533, 632, 701). Some commenters also indicated that employees sometimes work only
one or two weeks before leaving, often taking jobs at another logging establishment (Ex. 5-55, 5-74 through
5-92; Tr. OR 78). These commenters argued that it would be unfair to require employers to pay for expensive logging
boots given the high turnover rate of the logging industry. One commenter said: 




[I]t frightens us to think that we might be providing a $300 pair of boots for a man that's there a week (Tr. W1 74). 




These commenters also contend that for some PPE, particularly logging boots, employers might have to buy new PPE every
time they hire a new employee. First, this would be necessary because terminated employees do not return PPE they are
issued (Ex. 5-45). Second, these commenters argue that, unlike PPE such as ear muffs and head and leg protection,
logging boots are an item of PPE that cannot be reused by other employees because of size and hygienic concerns (Ex.
5-29, 5-43, 5-44, 5-62, 5-74 through 5-92, 9-1, 9-15, 9-21; Tr.
OR 78). Because logging boots cannot be worn by other employees, these commenters said employers view logging boots
as ``personal clothing.'' In addition, these commenters said that even if employees did return their logging boots,
new employees would be unwilling to wear used logging boots. One commenter said: 




Suppose a new employee comes to work in the spring and finds he can't or doesn't want to be a logger so he hands in his $200
boots with two weeks wear and tear and leaves. Is the next guy going to accept ``used'' boots someone else wore? (Ex.
5-78) 




The commenters said that requiring employers to pay for new PPE, primarily logging boots, for each new employee would
place a considerable financial burden on employers (Ex. 5-32, 5-39, 5-45, 9-15; Tr. W1 74,
OR 78, 350). They said the cost would be particularly burdensome for small establishments that comprise the vast majority
of the logging industry. Their basis for this conclusion is that logging boots are very costly, ranging from $60 to
$400 a pair (Ex. 5-45, 9-15; Tr. W1 74, OR 78, 350). In addition, they said employees need two to three pairs
of logging boots a year. The commenters, however, did not present any financial or economic evidence as to the burden
(e.g., effect on profits, sales, etc.) on the industry as a whole, and particularly small employers as a group, of providing
logging boots. 

One commenter said employers should not be required to pay for logging boots that are used by employees away from workplace
(Ex. 5-39). This commenter said employees take their logging boots with them when they seek new employment (Ex.
5-39). He also said employees use their logging boots for hunting and cutting their own wood (Ex. 5-39).
In contrast, the record shows that other types of PPE (e.g., leg protection, safety glasses and hearing protection)
remain with the employer, therefore, they are not used away from the workplace (e.g., Ex. 5-32). In addition,
one commenter said that these types of PPE are already being provided by many establishments as standard industry
practice (Ex. 5-32).

<TEXT>
 

Finally, several commenters said that employers should 
not be required to pay for certain PPE because the custom in 
the logging industry is that employees, especially piece-rate workers, provide their own PPE, particularly logging

boots (Ex. 5-11, 5-24, 5-45, 5-67, 5-74 through 5-92). 
These commenters said that piece-rate workers provide all 
``tools of the trade,'' that includes some types of PPE. 
However, the record also shows that some logging 
establishments do provide logging boots (Ex. 5-32; Tr. W1 
177). For example, one commenter said:

 

[T]he way we set it up is that when you're with us 
for one year we will buy you three pair of boots 
and we will supply all safety equipment. 
After you are with us for one month, we will supply 
safety chaps, the helmet, the whole works. The first 
day you come on the job we will supply the helmet, a 
helmet with the eye protection and the ear protection 
(Tr. W1 177). 
Another commenter said: 
In most instances items such as ear plugs, safety 
glasses, bucking chaps or any other safety item 
required to work in a safe environment are 
provided (Ex. 5-32).

 

OSHA has carefully reviewed the evidence in the record 
and, for several reasons, has decided in the final rule to 
delete the general requirement that the employer be required 
to provide logging boots. However, the final rule does 
require that such boots be worn by logging employees, and 
holds the employer responsible for assuring that the 
employee has logging boots and wears them. As to the other 
PPE requirements specified in paragraph (d), OSHA has 
retained the language of the pulpwood logging and proposed 
standards that the employer provide such PPE at no cost to 
the employee. 
The OSH Act imposes on employers the responsibility for 
compliance with standards and for providing safe working 
conditions for employees. This responsibility has been 
recognized in OSHA's personal protective equipment standards 
at 29 CFR 1910.132 through 29 CFR 1910.138. Section 
1910.132(a) establishes the employer's obligation to provide 
and maintain personal protective equipment whenever such 
equipment is necessary by reason of the hazards in the 
workplace. 
Section 1910.132(b) does recognize that in some limited 
circumstances that employees may provide their own PPE. 
However, OSHA emphasizes that this practice is not the norm, 
but rather an exception based on unusual or specific 
circumstances. In addition, section 1910.132(b) underscores 
the employer's continuing obligation to assure the adequacy 
and maintenance of the PPE. 
The record shows that special circumstances exist in 
the logging industry which may make it appropriate for 
employees to provide their own logging boots. First, the 
record shows that the logging industry is highly transient, 
and that logging boots, unlike other PPE required by the 
final rule, are not the kind of PPE that can be reused. 
Logging boots purchased to fit one employee may not fit the 
next employee. It is important that logging boots fit 
properly or the boot may not provide the necessary 
protection. Therefore, based on current turnover rates in 
the industry, employers would have to purchase non-reusable 
logging boots costing $200 to $400 many times a year for 
newly-hired employees, even though there is a significant 
likelihood that these employees will remain in the job for 
only a short time. 
Second, the record shows that logging employees tend to 
move from one logging establishment to another, taking their 
``tools of the trade'' with them, particularly their logging 
boots. OSHA believes it may be appropriate in this 
situation to allow employees to take their logging boots to 
the next place of employment, rather than requiring the new 
employer to provide logging boots. Logging boots are both 
portable (i.e., not limited in use to or maintained at a 
particular workplace, like respirators for instance) and in 
most cases they fit only that particular employee therefore 
they cannot be reused by other employees. The other items 
of PPE required by the final rule, such as leg and head 
protection, tend to be both less personal to the employee 
and more connected to the workplace itself, and can be 
readily used by other employees.

<TEXT>
 

Third, there is evidence in the record that employees 
do use their logging boots away from work. Employees come 
to and leave work wearing their logging boots, suggesting 
that the boots are used away from the workplace. In 
addition, commenters cited specific activities where logging 
boots are used away from the logging work site. The 
commenters did not provide any comparable evidence that 
other items of PPE required by the final rule are also used 
by employees away from the workplace. 
Based on the above, OSHA has decided in the final rule 
not to require the employer to provide logging boots. The 
Agency emphasizes that it is the totality of the special 
circumstances in the logging industry that justify this 
determination. Of the reasons discussed above, none of them 
standing alone would provide sufficient justification for 
departing from the general requirement that employers 
provide PPE. Rather, it is the combination of these reasons 
and special circumstances in the logging industry that make 
it appropriate to allow employees to provide their own 
logging boots. 
OSHA also emphasizes that regardless of who provides 
the logging boots, the final rule makes the employer 
responsible for assuring that logging boots are used by the 
employee and are maintained in a serviceable condition. In 
addition, in the final rule the employer is responsible for 
assuring that logging boots are inspected before initial use 
during a workshift. Attendant to this requirement, the 
employer is also responsible for assuring that damaged and 
defective equipment is either repaired or replaced before 
work is commenced. 
With regard to the other items of PPE required by the 
final rule, OSHA does not believe there is sufficient 
evidence in the record to justify a departure from OSHA's 
long-established policy. Neither industry practice nor 
turnover rates compel the Agency to relieve employers of the 
obligation to pay for the other items of PPE for loggers. 
Indeed, evidence in the record shows that many employers are 
currently providing these other items of PPE (Ex. 5-32, 9-15; Tr. W1 177). The record shows that, unlike
logging 
boots, these items of PPE tend to remain at the workplace 
and are amenable for use by other employees. Further, there 
is no evidence in the record of an established practice of 
employees using such PPE away from the workplace. Also, 
there is no evidence of established and uniform industry 
practice of transporting such PPE from job to job. 
Therefore, in the final rule, OSHA is requiring, except for 
logging boots, that the employer provide PPE at no cost to 
the employee. 


3. Leg protection.

 In the hearing notice OSHA raised 
three issues concerning leg protection for chain-saw 
operators: specifications for leg protection, the area to 
be protected, and potential disadvantages of leg protection. 


a. Specifications.

 The proposed rule would have 
required that chain-saw operators wear leg protection made 
of ballistic nylon or other material that provides at least 
equivalent protection. Many commenters supported the leg 
protection requirement for chain-saw operators (Ex. 5-5, 5-7, 5-17, 5-30, 5-33, 5-42,
5-45, 5-51, 5-60, 5-68, 5-73, 9-9-11; Tr. W2 126-28). Several commenters
and hearing 
participants also supported OSHA's position that leg 
protection meet certain criteria (Ex. 5-30, 5-60, 5-68, 5-73; Tr. W2 126-28). Two commenters
suggested that OSHA 
require leg protection made with KEVLAR because they believe 
KEVLAR provides more protection than ballistic nylon (Ex. 5-5, 5-30). One of these commenters said KEVLAR
leg 
protection provides 50 percent more protection than 
ballistic nylon with a fraction of the weight and bulk, thus 
allowing easier movement and reducing fatigue (Ex. 5-30). 
This commenter also said that the U.S. Forest Service 
specifications call for KEVLAR leg protection. Other 
commenters stated that a testing protocol for leg protection 
should be adopted rather than specifying that leg protection 
be comprised of any certain type of material (Ex. 5-60, 5-68, 5-72). One commenter said OSHA should
adopt the ISO or 
Canadian testing standards for leg protection (Ex. 9-16). 
However, other commenters said there was no consensus in 
this country regarding an appropriate testing standard (Ex. 
5-60, 5-68, 5-72). One commenter proposed that the 
following testing standard be adopted:

 

[T]he protective garment must have a minimum ``Threshold 
Chain Speed'' of 2500 feet per minute for operators 
using chain saws with an engine displacement of under 
65 cc and 3000 feet per minute for operators using 
chain saws with an engine displacement of over 65 cc. 
Further the test procedure developed and currently used 
by the US Forest Service [should] be adopted and 
defined as the test method used to measure the 
``Threshold Chain Speed'' of safety material (Ex. 5-68).

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941012-0-00064 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941012-0-00011 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Another commenter proposed that a different testing 
standard be adopted in OSHA's final rule: 



I propose to replace ``ballistic nylon or 
equivalent protection covering each leg from the 
upper thigh to boot top or shoe top'' by ``leg 
protective device in conformity with the standard 
NQ 1923-450 ``Protective pad for chain saw 
operators' trousers and leggings.






This performance standard covers all the requirements 
for safety leggings such as the minimum coverage and a 
minimum performance level. This performance level is 
measured in conformity with the standard NQ 1923-450 
``Protective pads for chain saw operators' trousers and 
leggings_Determination of stopping speed and cut-through time.'' These two standards have been adopted 
by a consensus of employers, workers, manufacturers of 
fabrics and PPE, government and workers' compensation 
boards.

 

Other participants opposed specific criteria for leg 
protection performance for several reasons (Tr. W2 206-07, 
OR 472-75, 496-98, 513-14). First, some argued that there 
were no national consensus or State standard to provide 
guidance on specification standards. Second, others 
commented that a specification standard limited to 
``ballistic nylon'' was too restrictive (Ex. 5-30; Tr. W2 189-90). Third, others stated that there are
no standards 
establishing specific performance criteria of the material 
for leg protection. For example, APA testified:

 

APA does not know of any state leg protection apparel 
standard in existence or under development. I can 
report to you that our association has a special 
committee working on the development of a safety 
apparel standard, and this committee has generally 
accepted the Quebec Research Institute testing method, 
and now it's kind of rewriting this testing method to 
meet the American Society of Testing Materials 
guidelines. So the committee is close to completing 
its work on endorsing an approved test procedure. 
The next step in the committee's charge is to develop a 
voluntary performance testing standard that would apply 
for leg protection, safety boots and other apparel. 
That's going to be a little way down the road. It's 
own opinion that the work of this committee is not yet 
mature and that OSHA should probably not attempt to 
include any specific performance testing standard for 
leg protection or other safety items at this time. 
They're recommending that you defer the inclusion of a 
specific leg protection performance testing standard 
until the next revision of the OSHA logging 
regulations, whenever that might be. It may be ten 
years from now or fifteen years from now. At this 
point in time, we feel it's much more important to get 
any safety equipment worn, rather than to worry about 
whether or not it meets specific performance standard 
(Tr. OR 472-75).

 

APA also testified that regional differences in chain-saw operations also precludes a specification standard for

leg protection: 



I would also say in general our feeling is that logging 
is so different obviously in every part of the country 
that often we've got to have lead-way for the types of 
leg protection that might be appropriate for a person 
working in the swamps of Louisiana as opposed to the 
mountains of Montana. Not that we know what those 
differences might be, but that in general we feel like 
the loggers in those areas should be able to have the 
opportunity to design or approve a leg protection that 
would be appropriate for their situation (Tr. OR 207-08).

 

The record shows that leg protection for chain-saw 
operators is essential to prevent injuries. According to 
the WIR survey, 64 percent of injuries to chain-saw 
operators were due to kickback, an accident that usually 
results in injury to the leg (Ex. 2-1). The WIR survey also 
indicates that 22 percent of all injuries reported were to 
the leg. 
OSHA believes that leg protection made of ballistic 
nylon or equivalent material is effective in preventing 
injuries to the leg. A study by the French Farmers' 
Mutuality indicates that ballistic leg protection was 
effective in preventing 12 leg injuries in 91 loggers 
studies over an eight-month period (Ex. 37). Testimony and 
comments show, however, that there is no accepted testing 
measurements standard in this country on leg protection 
performance. In addition, the foreign standards that do 
exist have not been generally accepted or used in this 
country. Nonetheless, OSHA believes that a performance-based requirement for leg protection to provide protection

against contact with a moving saw chain will provide 
flexibility for employers while encouraging technological 
innovation, such as the work by APA.

<TEXT>
 

For these reasons, in the final rule OSHA has adopted 
the proposed provision requiring that leg protection be worn 
on each leg by all chain-saw operators. However, OSHA has 
revised the final rule to require that where the employer 
provides leg protection made of material other than 
ballistic nylon, the employer is responsible for 
demonstrating that it provides protection which is at least 
equivalent to ballistic nylon, such as KEVLAR. This 
requirement ensures that employees are protected against 
moving saw chains, while at the same time providing 
flexibility for the employer. 



b. Area to be protected and disadvantages of leg 
protection.

 The other issues raised regarding leg 
protection concerned the parts of the chain-saw operator's 
body that should be covered and its effect on mobility and 
other potential safety disadvantages of wearing leg 
protection. 

The proposed rule specified that leg protection extend 
from the upper thigh to the boot or shoe top. Many 
commenters supported the proposed rule (Ex. 9-2, 9-3, 9-4, 
9-5, 9-11, 9-13, 9-15, 9-16, 9-20). One commenter said that 
the proposed rule followed the requirements of the European 
draft standard (Ex. 9-11B). Some commenters said the 
proposed rule was not protective enough and said the 
equipment for protecting chain-saw operators should be 
expanded (Ex. 5-14, 5-68). One of these commenters said: 




[W]e would recommend that a standard be developed 
defining the minimum coverage these garments should 
have, for example from crotch to ankle bone with a 
minimum width measured at the knee of 9.5 (Ex. 5-68). 




The other commenter recommended leg protection be 
extended to also provide foot protection that is cut 
resistance to a chain saw (Ex. 5-14). This commenter said 
that the additional foot covering protection would also 
assure that the entire leg and ankle were covered if the 
chaps were not long enough to cover the boot top. 

Several commenters, however, said leg protection should 
be limited in the final rule (Ex. 5-17, 5-45, 5-56, 5-65, 9-1; Tr. OR 227, 633-34).
Most of these commenters said that 
OSHA should not require leg protection to extend from the 
upper thigh to the boot or shoe top. First, these 
commenters said that extending leg protection from the thigh 
to the boot or shoe top was not necessary because most of 
the injuries occur to the area around the knee. For 
example, one commenter stated: 




A person using a chain saw would have to do some pretty 
spectacular gymnastics to receive a chain saw cut more 
than 4
'
' below the knee. Once again, we have no 
recordable injuries for the last 7 years involving 
chain saw cuts more than 4
'
' below the knee (Ex. 5-45). 




Another commenter stated that leg protection was not 
necessary for climbers and bucket truck operators: 




The major hazards for these individuals are cuts to the 
upper body from saw kick-backs and falling material. 
Leg protection should not be required, however the use 
of some of the new lighter and more pliable pads sewn 
into pants should be encouraged whenever feasible (Ex. 
5-19).

 


Second, commenters stated that the small risk of injury 
to the lower leg was outweighed by the risks due to lack of 
mobility caused by full-length leg protection. For example, 
one said:

 


We have received numerous comments from our membership 
throughout the country who use leg protection (or 
chaps) suggesting that chaps only extend to just below 
the knee. Chaps that extend to the boot top, or shoe 
top, as required in proposed Section (e)(1)(ii), impede 
mobility and cause a greater safety hazard than the 
standard works to protect against. Our members believe 
that the highest risk for chain saw cuts occurs from 
the knee to the thigh. Thus, chaps that cover the leg 
from the upper thigh to just below the knee are 
sufficient (Ex. 5-56). 





Third, one commenter testified that leg protection to 
the boot or shoe top would pose an unreasonable financial 
burden on employers (Tr. OR 633-34). According to the 
participant, different loggers use the employer-provided leg 
protection each day. Because all loggers are not the same 
height, the leg protection provided may not reach to the 
boot or shoe top or may be too long for other loggers to 
wear safely. This participant suggested that the only way 
an employer could guarantee compliance with the required fit 
of the leg protection would be to provide fitted leg 
protection to each individual logger. The participant 
recommended the following: 




We suggest [leg protection extend] to below the knee 
because these come in various lengths. And certainly 
in those times you can't always stretch a pair of chaps 
that somebody maybe having to put on to operate a chain 
saw all of a sudden to get it down to the boot top (Tr. 
OR 633-34).

 


Fourth, some commenters stated that leg protection that 
extends to the boot or shoe top might cause mobility 
problems, and would therefore be hazardous for chain-saw 
operators (Ex. 5-19, 5-20, 5-55). For example, one 
commenter stated: 




Rigging crews will occasionally use a power saw. If 
they are required to wear leggings, it could be more 
dangerous than not having anything. This is one of the 
reasons rigging crews prefer suspenders rather than a 
belt because you don't get ``hung up'' so often. 
Anything that is going to hinder mobility is a problem 
(Ex. 5-20). 




Another commenter recommended that OSHA limit leg 
protection to just one leg for cutters (i.e., the leg in 
front that is used to maintain balance during cutting) (Ex. 
5-65). However, this commenter also admitted that any 
chain-saw operator who is clearing brush needs to wear 
protection on both legs because the saw is continuously and 
perilously close to either leg at all times. 

Other commenters said leg protection should be limited 
because heat and humidity could increase worker fatigue or 
cause problems that might exceed the benefits of leg 
protection (Ex. 5-25, 5-26, 5-59, Tr. W2 206-07). For 
example, one commenter stated: 




OSHA proposes that employees are assigned duties that 
require an operator of a chain saw to wear ballistic 
nylon or equivalent protection that must cover each leg 
from the upper thigh to the boot top. This does not 
take into consideration the various temperature factors 
which could increase fatigue. Fatigue is a major cause 
of injuries. As stated, on Page 11802 [of the preamble 
to the proposed standard], Alabama and Georgia are 
states that are among the leaders in logging 
activities. Due to the high heat and humidity of these 
states, the requirement to wear ballistic nylon chaps 
could possibly increase injuries as a result of the 
fatigue caused by hot, humid summer weather (Tr. W2 
206-07).

Clause (e)(1)(ii) should allow exceptions to the 
wearing of leg protectors for all circumstances (not 
just climbers) in which there is a greater hazard than 
working without them (for instance, fatigue from heat 
and humidity or loss of mobility in heavy undergrowth 
etc.). It would be even more appropriate if the 
wearing of ``leg protectors'' were made optional, 
depending on the individual work circumstances. One 
study, (The Role of Personal Protection in the 
Prevention of Accidental Injuries in Logging Work, T. 
Klen and S. Vayrynen, Journal of Occupational 
Accidents, 1984) concluded that personal protectors 
have not been very effective and that this was a result 
of a phenomena known as ``risk compensation'', the 
tendency of workers to be more careless when they 
believe that personal protectors will prevent injury 
(Ex. 5-59). 




OSHA has carefully reviewed the record on this issue 
and, for several reasons, has decided in the final rule to 
retain the requirement that leg protection cover the upper 
thigh to the boot top. The record clearly shows that chain-saw operators face a significant risk of injury due to 
kickback. The WIR survey indicates that 64 percent of all 
chain-saw injuries reported were the result of kickback (Ex. 
2-1). Further, the WIR survey shows that almost 30 percent 
of all injured employees were not wearing leg protection at 
the time. Also, almost one-fourth of all injuries reported 
were to the leg. 

According to the Maine BLS survey, chain-saw accidents 
accounted for 26 percent of all reported injuries and more 
than half of those accidents involved chain-saw kickback. 

OSHA does not believe the record supports the 
commenters' claims that chain-saw injuries only occur to the 
area around the knee. Injuries to the lower leg as well as 
the knee are significant. The WIR survey indicated that 
nine percent of all employees reporting injuries were hurt 
in the lower leg or ankle, while 11 percent were injured in 
the knee. 

The available accident and injury data also do not 
support the commenters' argument that lack of mobility is a 
greater hazard to chain-saw operators than lack of leg 
protection. To the contrary, the data clearly show that the 
risk of chain-saw kickback is far more serious than any of 
the potential dangers that have been suggested with regard 
to leg protection (Ex. 2-1). For example, according to the 
WIR survey, none of the chain-saw operators said they had 
been injured because they did not have enough time to 
retreat from the falling tree. On the other hand, almost 
two-thirds of the chain-saw operators were injured because 
the chain saw kicked back. In any event, OSHA believes that 
other provisions in the proposed and final rule will 
adequately address concerns about mobility. For example, 
the requirement to plan and clear retreat paths before 
commencing cutting will protect employees who would be at 
risk from decreased mobility. 

Finally, OSHA believes the new innovations in leg 
protection technology address the commenters' concerns about 
costs, mobility, fatigue and heat stress. First, the 
record shows that full-leg protection now being manufactured 
is light-weight and relatively cool (Ex. 5-68, 9-4). The 
record also shows that light-weight leg protection that is 
inserted or sewn into logging pants is now available. 
According to one commenter, these new innovations make leg 
protection tolerable even in the hot and humid southern 
logging regions. OSHA believes these innovations will 
reduce fatigue and heat stress and will prevent mobility 
from being impeded. Second, the record shows that foot 
coverings are available that can supplement protection in 
those instances where leg protection may not fully cover the 
logger's lower leg. These devices will provide adequate 
protection in those isolated instances where leg protection 
may not be long enough without requiring the employer to 
purchase leg protection in many different sizes. 



4. First aid.

 The hearing notice raised two issues 
about first aid: the number of employees who must have 
first-aid training, and the elements required as part of 
that training, such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). 



a. Number of employees trained.

 The proposed standard 
specified that all supervisors and all fellers be adequately 
trained in first aid methods as prescribed by the American 
Red Cross, the Mine Safety and Health Administration or an 
equivalent training program. In addition, the proposed rule 
included a provision that at least one person in the 
``operating area'' have first-aid training.

OSHA received many comments regarding the number of 
employees who should be trained in first aid in order to 
provide adequate protection. There was no consensus among 
those commenters on the appropriate number of employees who 
must be trained. Their recommendations about the number of 
employees who should be required to receive first-aid 
training covered a wide range of options, including the 
following: 

1. All employees (Ex. 5-7, 5-17, 9-15, 9-20; Tr. W1 
175, W2 209, OR 100, 375, 393, 681); 

2. All supervisors and fellers (Ex. 9-3, 9-13); 

3. All supervisors and enough additional personnel so 
each work site would have a trained employee (Tr. 
OR 21); 

4. All supervisors and fellers, plus two additional 
employees on a logging job (Ex. 5-54; Tr. OR 647); 

5. All supervisors, fellers, and one-fifth of 
remaining crew members (Ex. 9-19, Tr. OR 282); 

6. All supervisors, fellers and one-fourth of 
remaining crew members (Tr. OR 206); and 

7. All supervisors and some fellers (Ex. 5-36, 5-53, 
5-55, 5-63). 

Commenters who recommended first aid training for a 
limited number of employees, said that training all fellers 
or all other employees was excessive since the proposed rule 
would also require employees to work within visual or 
audible contact of another employee (Ex. 5-36, 5-55). 
Another commenter said that requiring all fellers to be 
trained would be duplicative since more than one feller may 
work at a work site (Ex. 5-63). 

Other commenters said they already provide first-aid 
training for each employee: 

 


Everyone_all the people on our crew are trained [in 
first aid] on a rotating basis. Now, the fellow that's 
been with us six months, he has not been to the first-aid class yet. Also, one of the_I believe it's in 
with the Nortim Corporation, the Nortim self insured, 
it is one of the regulations that we do have people on 
the job that are versed in first aid (Tr. OR 174). 

Another hearing participant stated: 

Along with overall safety training, I feel that 
required first aid training for all employees is simply 
common sense (Tr. OR 393). 

 


Other commenters indicated that they are providing 
first aid training to a substantial portion of employees, in 
part because the company's logging operations are in 
isolated locations in Alaska: 

 


Mr. Lesser: Does your training program include first 
aid training? 

Mr. Bell: We provide first aid training to just about 
whoever wants it. 

Mr. Lesser: Who do you require to have first aid 
training? 

Mr. Bell: We require all supervisors, leadmen, hook 
tenders, leaders of crews. 

Mr. Lesser: Using the voluntary nature offering the 
first aid, do you get a lot of volunteers? What 
percentage of the work force is trained in first aid? 

Mr. Bell: I'd say 35 percent (Tr. OR 375). 

 


As discussed above, there is no dispute that logging is 
a hazardous industry. All data sources in the record show 
that a significant number of accidents occur in the logging 
industry and that the severity of injuries sustained by 
loggers is greater than that suffered by employees in other 
industries. Loggers often work in isolated locations that 
are far from hospitals or health care providers that 
sometimes are accessible only by helicopters or vehicles 
designed to operate on the most rugged terrain (Ex. 9-20; 
Tr. OR 21). Accordingly, loggers need to be trained and 
equipped to handle the significant number of severe injuries 
that might arise. In many instances these trained employees 
will be the only persons available to render assistance at a 
critical time.

OSHA believes that first aid training for only a select 
few individuals, such as supervisors and fellers, is not 
adequate to ensure that injured loggers receive first aid 
that is timely and appropriate. First, when only a few 
selected employees are trained, they may not be close enough 
to the site of the accident to render assistance in time. 
The WIR survey indicates that more than one-half of all 
injuries reported occurred at cutting sites, that in most 
cases are remote from landings and from medical facilities 
(Ex. 2-1). The WIR survey is consistent with the OSHA FCI 
study, that indicated that more than 70 percent of logging 
employees killed were working at cutting sites (Ex. 4-61). 
One hearing participant reinforced this problem: 

 


The rigging crew is often 1,000 feet and sometimes 
5,000 feet from the landing. The work site is usually 
on rough, steep ground, and these workers often use 
hazardous cutting implements such as axes and chain 
saws. If the first aid trained person and the first 
aid kit are in the yarder, that can be 15 minutes or 
more from where the worst exposure is (Tr. OR 21). 

 


In addition, since the final rule allows employees to 
maintain contact with another employee by visual or audible 
contact, an employee may be miles from the contact person 
when radio communication is used. In such cases, the 
contact person may not be able to provide immediate first 
aid assistance. 



Second, limiting first aid training to all supervisors 
and some additional personnel may not be adequate when 
supervisors are not at the work site when an accident 
occurs. According to the State of Washington, logging 
supervisors usually have two or more logging crews working 
directly for them (Ex. 5-34). These logging crews are often 
dispersed over five square miles or more. In addition, in 
larger operations, foremen usually see each crew only once a 
day and rarely for more than one hour of the workshift. 
Another commenters said in his experience it was not 
uncommon to find a group of employees working in a location 
without a supervisor and no other employee in the group has 
a current first aid certificate (Ex. 91-5). 

Third, a logger's injuries may be of such severity that 
several persons trained in first aid may be needed to 
stabilize the injured employee and treat the injury. If 
only one employee is trained, the first aid assistance may 
not be sufficient. 

Fourth, when only one employee in a work site is 
trained, as the proposed rule contemplates, first aid will 
obviously be inadequate if the trained person is the one who 
is injured. (Although first-aid training does include 
instruction in self-aid, the injuries may be severe enough 
to incapacitate the trained employee.) For example, in a 
small working crew that has no supervisor, the feller may be 
the only employee who is trained in first-aid. If the 
feller is injured, there may be no other logger in that work 
crew who is trained to provide first aid. The WIR survey 
indicates that one-half of all loggers who were injured were 
performing felling tasks (i.e., felling, limbing, bucking) 
at the time. 

Fifth, when only a few employees receive first-aid 
training, there is a greater likelihood that there could be 
crucial gaps in coverage due to sickness, vacations, other 
leave, or employee turnover of those few who have received 
training. In addition, an employer may not know from day to 
day if an employee will be present that is holding a current 
first aid certificate (Ex. 5-7).

OSHA notes that some commenters opposed requiring every 
employee to have first-aid training because of the transient 
nature of the logging industry. OSHA finds that the 
commenters' argument does not support the position that 
fewer employees should be trained. If there is high 
employee turnover, it may be the trained employee who is not 
employed any longer. If work continues without a fully-trained person while a first-aid replacement is being 
trained, employees may be at great risk. By contrast, if 
work has to be stopped until a replacement can be trained, 
the employer could incur costs which could be prevented by 
having adequate first aid coverage in advance. If all 
employees working in the logging industry are required to 
have first-aid training, a pool of trained employees will 
always be available to employers for hiring. 

Fifth, requiring that each employee be trained 
eliminates confusion and may be less administratively 
burdensome than making a daily check and rescheduling of 
work assignments to assure that supervisors, fellers and 
some additional number of employees in each operating area 
hold current first aid training certificates. 

To ease the training burden for employers, the final 
rule does not require that the first-aid training be 
provided by the employer. Rather, the final rule requires 
that the employer assure that each employee performing 
logging operations receives or has received first-aid 
training and that the first-aid training/certificate is 
current. For example, as one means of complying with the 
final rule, the employer could make first-aid training a 
condition of hiring or continued employment. The employer 
would be free to hire only those persons who had previously 
obtained first-aid training and kept their certificate 
current. In addition, when there is employee turnover, 
trained employees will be able to bring their first-aid 
skills from one workplace to another and thus relieve the 
training burden for the new employer. 

OSHA is aware that some employers currently provide 
first-aid training and most likely will continue to provide 
such training. OSHA is also aware that a number of 
organizations and schools provide first-aid training that 
would meet the requirements of Appendix B. For example, the 
American Red Cross, the Mine Safety and Health 
Administration, State extension services, community 
colleges, and adult education programs all provide first-aid 
training that includes CPR. As such, OSHA does not believe 
that the requirement of assuring that all employees have 
received first-aid training that remains current will pose 
an unreasonable burden on any employer or employee. 



b. Elements of first-aid training.

 In the hearing 
notice, OSHA requested comment on the specific elements, 
such as CPR, that should be included in first-aid training. 
In the proposed rule OSHA did not specify the basic elements 
in which supervisors and fellers must be trained. Rather, 
OSHA proposed that first-aid training meet the requirements 
of courses provided by the American Red Cross, MSHA or an 
equivalent training program.

Several commenters recommended that OSHA require CPR 
training as part of required first-aid training (Ex. 5-42, 
5-49, 5-50, 9-2, 9-19). Both NIOSH and the U.S. Dept. of 
Interior supported the CPR training requirement. Because 
loggers, especially those deep in the woods are not close to 
medical facilities during the ``golden hour'' where 
resuscitation may save a person's life, OSHA agrees with the 
commenters that it is essential that all loggers be able to 
perform CPR. Therefore, in the final rule OSHA has included 
a requirement for annual CPR training. 

In addition, OSHA has specified other basic skills and 
knowledge in Appendix B (mandatory) that are important for 
providing aid to injured loggers in isolated settings. OSHA 
is aware that there are many well-recognized first-aid 
programs that have broad-based curricula which already 
satisfy OSHA requirements. 



5. Visual and audible contact.

 In the hearing notice 
OSHA requested comment on the maximum time and/or distance 
separation between employees. In the proposed rule, OSHA 
included a requirement that employees work within visual or 
audible contact of another employee, so that someone would 
be able to respond quickly in case of an accident or other 
emergency. The proposed rule prohibited the use of engine 
noise, such as from chain saws, as a means of contact. 
Various State logging standards also prohibit the use of 
chain-saw noise as a means of signaling (Ex. 2-17, 2-18, 2-19, 2-21, 2-22, 38J, 38K).


OSHA received many comments on the contact and 
signaling provisions. Many commenters testified that the 
proposed contact requirement is necessary (Ex. 5-14, 5-17, 
5-27, 5-74 through 5-92, 9-2, 9-3, 9-5, 9-13; Tr. W2 197-98). One commenter
said: 




We think that visual or audible contact is important 
and will save lives. There are also electronic 
devices, some sophisticated and some like citizen band 
radios, that can be used by forest workers to maintain 
audible contact by electronic means. We recommend that 
the existing proposed language be retained but modified 
perhaps to allow audible contact by electronic means 
(Tr. W2 197-98).

 


Certain commenters urged OSHA to make the contact 
requirement stricter than that proposed. One commenter said 
employees in solitary jobs also need to remain in contact 
and, therefore, should be provided with two-way radios (Ex. 
9-15). Another commenter said OSHA should require employees 
to remain within visual contact of another crew members (Ex. 
9-20). Finally, two commenters recommended that OSHA 
require employees to work within normal hearing or calling 
distance of another employee (Ex. 9-19; Tr. OR 679-81). 

However, several commenters expressed various concerns 
about the contact provision, and particularly the 
prohibition against chain-saw noise as a means of contact. 
First, some participants said the requirements would have an 
adverse impact on small employers, especially employers with 
work crews consisting of three or fewer loggers (Ex. 5-21, 
5-28, 5-35, 5-49, 5-53, 5-54, 5-70). For example, one 
commenter said:

 


This requirement may adversely affect the livelihood of 
many small-scale loggers in the South who may work 
alone in the woods, or operate a single mobile ground 
skidder or felling machine and are frequently out of 
contact with other phases of the logging operation (Ex. 
5-28). 

Another commenter stated: 

This requirement would not be practical for several 
reasons: 

(1) there are a number of logging contractors 
that work alone, 

(2) log crews with two or three members are often 
out of contact because the great distance between the 
faller and log header, 

(3) even at close range, visual and audible 
signals are attenuated by thick brush and loud 
machinery. 

My experience has been loggers will keep track of their 
fellow workers the best they can but, due to the nature 
of the job, individuals will be separated for certain 
lengths of time. To require loggers to be within 
signaling distance of one another will preclude the 
existence of one and two man log crews, working in 
thick brush, working in hilly topography, skidding long 
distances, the use of ear plugs or working with loud 
machines (Ex. 5-70).

 


Second, some commenters believed the contact 
requirement conflicted with the proposed requirement to 
maintain a distance of two tree lengths between work areas 
(Ex. 5-12, 5-29, 5-4, 5-67, 5-70). These commenters said 
that a separation of two tree lengths between work areas 
might make it impossible to maintain contact due to saw 
noise and obstructions such as hills or vegetation. One 
commenter explained:

If this code goes through and is enacted, it would change the timber falling industry in Alaska. Southeast Alaska is
a relatively new geological area. We work on steep ground that is broken up by draws, gullies, cliffs. We have our timber
fallers work together as partners. One works in one strip or one area of the hillside and the other one works in another
area of the hillside. For safety reasons, our company requires that they work at least three tree lengths apart. And
often with the broken up terrain, that precludes visual contact (Tr. OR 353). 




Third, comments were received on the prohibition of chain-saw noise as a signaling device. Some participants supported
the prohibition (Ex. 5-27, 5-34, 5-42). Other commenters argued that chain-saw noise is currently
being used as a means of contact in the logging industry and should be allowed in the final rule (Tr. W1 65; OR 86, 353-55,
356-58, 384-85, 694-96). For example, one commenter said the sound of chain saws is an indicator
that someone is working at a specific location (Tr. W1 65). Another commenter stated: 




[W]e have been counting on chain saw noise for years. Chain saw noise is possible, and by the way, that's my most dangerous
part of my job is to do a safety inspection or to go up and check on cutters in a strip, to approach cutters. And I listen
to the saw. And I can tell when they are putting a cut into a standing tree or bucking a log with the chain saw noise. If we
are not allowed to use chain saw noise as audible contact, that means we may have to go back to double jacking which is
a faller and a bucker working in tandem (Tr. OR 353-55). 




This participant also said that chain-saw noise should also be permitted because 103-decibel chain-saw engines
render 92-decibel personal alarm systems inadequate as means of audible contact (Tr. OR 355). 

Fourth, several commenters urged OSHA to adopt various alternatives and modifications to the proposed contact requirement
(Ex. 5-54, 5-55; Tr. OR 670-81). For example, commenters suggested that OSHA replace the contact
provision with a ``check-in'' requirement: 




In West Virginia, a cutting crew often consists of a worker who fells and limbs the trees and a worker who operates a skidder.
Consequently, it is often necessary that the feller be left alone in the woods, without audible or visual contact with
another worker, for short periods of time while the skidder operator is making the trip to the log landing. Also, it
is common practice for workers to be constantly checking on one another. Upon his return from the landing, the skidder
operator immediately checks on the feller; and, the feller, if the skidder operator does not return in the normal time
span, will check on the skidder operator. 

Considering the common small cutting crew size, the practice of constantly checking on one another, and the difficulties
involved in using an audible signal capable of being heard over distances, over machine noise, and through hearing
protection devices, it is our recommendation that this aspect of the Standard be changed to allow a worker to be out
of ``visual or audible signal contact with another person'' for short periods of time. Due to the normal time involved
for transporting a skidder load to the landing, unhooking, and returning, we recommend that this short time period
be established at 20 minutes (Ex. 5-54). 




Other commenters also suggested that OSHA allow employees to be out of contact from other employees for short periods
of time (e.g., 15 to 20 minutes, the time to take a load to the landing and return) (Ex. 5-54; Tr. OR 670-81).

OSHA has decided in the final rule to retain the requirement that employees work within visual or audible contact of
another employee. As discussed above, most commenters indicated that remaining in contact is important to the safety
of loggers. Several commenters said that supervisors use chain-saw noise to identify where and whether an employee
is working. However, they did not provide evidence that chain-saw noise provides an effective means of communicating
information from the employee or from the supervisor. For example, data and information available to OSHA indicates
that even though chain-saw noise is currently used as a means of maintaining contact, there are still reports from
OSHA case file investigations of loggers being injured and not being discovered until after the shift has ended (Ex.
1). In addition, chain-saw noise does not provide the cutter with an adequate means of communicating with others in
the event they have become injured or are in other trouble. Since all chain-saw noise indicates is whether an employee
is working, the cutter must wait until another employee recognizes that the lack of noise means the cutter needs assistance.
This may delay rendering that assistance. OSHA believes the cutter, not just the supervisor, needs to have a method
for communicating when necessary. Radios and telephones are modern communication methods that are increasingly
used in this logging industry. These methods, unlike chain-saw noise, provide immediate two-way communication.

<TEXT>
 

Although OSHA has decided to retain in the final rule the prohibition against use of chain-saw noise alone as a means
of contact, the final rule does provide employers with a great deal of flexibility in maintaining contact with employees.
First, permitting radio communication to be used as a means of contact allows contact to be maintained while at the
same time maintaining a two tree-length distance between adjacent occupied work areas. Second, permitting contact
to be maintained by radio or whistles allows employees to work alone rather than limiting employees to working in teams
that are within visual distance of each other. Allowing radio contact will also provide flexibility for small radio
crew operations when visual or voice contact may not be possible. Third, OSHA also believes that permitting radio
contact will not be unduly burdensome for the industry since many companies already are utilizing electronic communications
(Ex. 5-27; Tr. W2 227). 

With regard to the issue of equipment noise preventing radio communication, OSHA notes that radios are available
with ear phones that fit inside hearing protection muffs. Where such ear phones and hearing protectors are provided,
equipment noise will neither interfere with communication nor should result in occupational hearing loss. 

Because contact may be maintained by radio, OSHA has removed the exception to the contact requirement for ``single
employee assignments.'' OSHA believes that radio communication already is necessary in order for many of those single
employee jobs to be performed (e.g., watchman). As such, OSHA does not believe that extending the radio contact requirement
to all logging operations will unduly burden employers, while at the same time it will provide important protection
for all loggers. 



6. Chain-saw protective devices. 

In the proposed standard, OSHA did not include a provision requiring chain saws to be equipped with chain brakes or
other devices that prevent kickback. The proposed standard also did not require chain saws to meet any performance
criteria of any standards-setting organizations. Rather, OSHA proposed only to require employers to inspect and
maintain chain-saw safety devices when chain saws were so equipped. The hearing notice requested further comment
on the adequacy of various chain-saw safety devices and what regulatory action OSHA should take in the final standard
regarding chain saws. 

There was no dispute among commenters that chain-saw protective devices are necessary to prevent operators from
being injured. The record shows that the chain-saw bar can kick back in less than 0.3 seconds (Ex. 4-172). The
record also shows that average human reaction time, however, is only 0.75 seconds (Ex. 4-172). That means in
many cases the operator cannot take action quickly enough to avoid being struck by the chain saw. The record also shows
that many injuries in the logging industry are the result of chain-saw kickback. According to the WIR survey, 20 percent
of all logging injuries reported involved chain saws and almost two-thirds of those injuries were the result of chain-saw
kickback (Ex. 2-1). The Maine BLS survey also shows that chain-saw injuries account for a significant number
of logging injuries (26%) in that State (Ex. 4-175). Similar to the WIR survey, the Maine BLS survey indicated
that over half of all chain-saw accidents resulted from kickback. 



a. Devices to prevent chain-saw kickback. 

Information submitted to the docket indicates that there are four devices that exist to reduce or minimize the risk
of injury due to chain-saw kickback. These devices are chain brakes, bar tip guards, reduced-kickback guide bars,
and low- or reduced-kickback saw chains. Information about these devices was taken from a 1983 report prepared for
the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) (Ex. 5-13) as well as comments to the proposed rule. The discussion
that follows explains the different devices and their advantages and disadvantages. 

The 

chain brake

 is a device for stopping the saw chain when kickback occurs before the chain can contact the operator. The most common
type of chain brake is actuated when the operator's hand or arm hits the brake lever that is located immediately ahead
of the front handle. When kickback occurs, the chain brake may either be actuated by the operator's hand pivoting forward
on the handle, or by the hand being dislodged from the handle, striking the brake lever. According to the CPSC report,
chain brakes, unlike new technology chains and safety guide bars, do not have any adverse effect on the cutting effectiveness
of chain saws. The record also indicates that one of the advantages of chain brakes is that, unlike other protective
devices that can be removed, the chain brake is an integral part of the saw and is difficult to remove (Ex. 4-174).
As such, chain brakes deter the disabling of the kickback prevention system by the operator (Ex. 5-19).

The 

bar tip guard 

(or nose tip guard) is a device that 
is bolted or screwed onto the tip of the bar. Its primary 
function is to prevent contact with the tip of the bar from 
which kickback is generated. Commenters identified three 
problems with bar tip guards. First, one commenter said bar 
tip guards are not usable in felling and bucking of some 
trees (Ex. 9-16). This commenter said forward leaning trees 
usually require the bar tip to fell the tree safely. 
Second, two commenters said the hazards associated with 
bar tip guards outweigh their protective value (Ex. 5-42, 9-20). According to NIOSH bar tip guards reduce
kickback 
danger only under certain conditions, that is, when the log 
or limb is elevated and does not have any off-angle to cause 
pinching of the bar (Ex. 5-42). NIOSH concluded that the 
bar tip guard may pose greater hazards than saws without 
tips because they require the bucker to maintain working 
stances that are less stable. The other commenter said that 
the bar tip can get caught on limbs. Third, the major 
problem with bar tip guards is that they are removable (Ex. 
5-13, 5-13H). According to the CPSC report, the bar tip 
guard is removed by operators because it reduces the utility 
of the saw by preventing boring and the cutting of any logs 
that are wider than the guide bar. Evidence in the record 
indicates that bar tip guards are being removed by a 
significant number of operators: 



Only about half of the operators of saws so equipped 
always use such guards. About 36 percent never use 
them, and about 12 percent sometimes take them off the 
guide bar. Thus, while nose tip guards are effective 
anti-kickback devices, many operators remove them from 
their saws (Ex. 5-13). 



The Portable Power Equipment Manufacturers Association 
(PPEMA) submitted testimony from CPSC's own proceedings, 
which also acknowledged the extent to which bar tip guards 
are removed from chain saws: 



[T]he Commission received the benefit of a survey that 
was done on the part of the NESDA, National Equipment 
Servicing Dealers Association. They on their own 
surveyed hundreds of their dealers. * * * [T]heir 
survey corroborated my own personal observations, 
namely, that in real life practice users of chain saws 
in the droves are simply not using that nose tip, and 
while if it were used or if it were permanently 
established on the saw, it would be a complete barrier 
to kickback, the fact of the matter is because it's 
temporary and because it is removed, because in my view 
it affects in the case of the dealers, as you'll see 
from their comments, it affects the efficacy of the 
saw, it is taken off, and as a result provides no 
protection, zero. 
Just to cite from the survey, 73.5 percent of the 
responding dealers to the NESDA survey reported that 
only zero to five percent of the chain saws brought 
into their shops for repair, of the ones that were 
originally equipped with the nose guards, that 73.5 
percent of the dealers responded that only zero to five 
percent had nose guards in place. Another 9.3 percent 
reported that six to ten percent of such saws had nose 
guards in place, leaving only 17.1 percent of the 
dealers who put the figure of nose guards in place at 
something more than ten percent. 
The unmistakable conclusion is that the 
overwhelming majority of consumers are removing the 
nose guards from their saws and not putting them on in 
the first place. 
The survey also revealed that almost no consumers 
are interested in replacing nose guards that are not in 
place. Eighty-eight percent of the dealers, 88 
percent, stated that zero percent of their customers 
wanted replacements, and an additional 8.9 percent put 
the replacement request at a mere one to five percent 
(Ex. 5-13H). 



There are two different types of 

reduced-kickback guide 
bars.

 One is designed and manufactured with a taper from 
the back of the bar and has a correspondingly small radius 
of curvature at the tip of the bar. This type of bar is 
commonly referred to as a narrow nose bar. The other type 
of reduced kickback guide bar has a reduced radius nose but 
achieves its taper from the fact that the top and bottom 
edges of the bar a asymmetrical (the top and bottom edges 
are curved and have a different radius of curvature). This 
type bar is commonly called a banana bar because of its 
peculiar shape. According to the CPSC report, both the 
narrow nose bar and the banana bar have significant 
drawbacks, primarily in the useful life of the bar and chain 
and the efficiency of the chain saw. The narrow nose bar, 
because of its reduced radius of curvature at the tip, 
receives more stress at the tip, thereby requiring more 
frequent replacement. Because of its asymmetrical design, 
the banana bar cannot be merely turned over when the bottom 
edge of the bar becomes worn, but must be replaced. This 
type of bar also reduces the ability of the operator to use 
the saw for boring. This disadvantage is compounded if the 
saw also is equipped with a low- or reduced-kickback chain.

[T]he use of low-kickback guide bars results in a 
tradeoff of some reduction in utility for an 
improvement in safety. Industry sources have suggested 
that this may be an acceptable tradeoff for the less 
powerful saws which are probably purchased by 
consumers. Since the tradeoff involves a marginal 
improvement in safety, however, manufacturers are 
probably less willing to equip the more powerful, more 
performance oriented saws with the low-kickback guide 
bars (Ex. 5-13). 



Finally, the potential for kickback can be reduced by 
the 

low- or reduced-kickback chain. 

This chain is commonly 
referred to as new generation chain. Low kickback chain can 
be identified by an idler or spacer link between each of the 
cutting links. In other words, the chain has a left hand 
cutter link on the right side of the chain, followed by a 
spacer link, followed by a right hand cutter link on the 
left side of the chain followed by another spacer link 
before the sequence begins again. 
Although the low-kickback chain can reduce kickback 
energy by 40 to 90 percent, there are drawbacks to its use, 
according to the CPSC report. These drawbacks include: (1) 
New technology chains generally exhibit some loss in cutting 
efficiency (speed and ease of cutting), (2) these chains 
make cutting more tiring for the operator thereby causing 
more operator fatigue, and (3) the loss of cutting 
efficiency may adversely affect the life of the chain. The 
loss of cutting efficiency has been estimated to be anywhere 
from a 10 to 25 percent. OSHA has no estimates of the 
increase in operator fatigue and the degradation in the 
service life of the chain. 
Of the four protective devices, most commenters said 
OSHA should require chain saws to be equipped with a chain 
brake because it is the most used and most effective for 
professional logging operations (Ex. 4-175, 5-17, 5-19, 5-21, 5-27, 5-34, 5-42,
5-46, 9-3, 9-4, 9-13, 9-15, 9-18, 9-20; Tr. OR 536-37). Several of these
commenters said that 
all chain saws used at their establishments are equipped 
with chain brakes. These commenters also said that almost 
all manufacturers now produce chain saws with some kind of 
chain brake and that almost all chain saws manufactured for 
commercial logging operations now have chain brakes (Ex. 5-19; Tr. OR 185-87, 536). In addition, one commenter
said 
that manufacturers have improved earlier mechanical problems 
with chain brakes so that they are reliable in preventing 
kickback (Ex. 9-4). With regard to the effectiveness of 
chain brakes, one commenter said: 



The chain brake is, I'd say, one of the most important 
chain saw protective devices developed in modern 
history. In Montana all of our current professional 
saws are equipped with chain brakes. Most of our saws 
are in the four to six cubic inch range, primarily, 
Stihl and Husqvarna with a few other minor brands and 
seldom on job visitations do I find anyone who has 
disconnected the chain brake. It's so uncommon that 
it's startling when I find that any more.

<TEXT>
 

The other protective device that I see that's had 
substantial improvement is the throttle lock mechanism 
where it has to be held down with your palm in order 
for the trigger to operate. For years it was common 
that the first thing a logger did was he got a roll of 
black tape and he would tape that down so you didn't 
have to operate that. Through our progressive Montana 
Sawyer Safety Program and other efforts I brag to 
people that we now have developed a genetically 
superior timber faller in Montana that can now squeeze 
with his palm and pull with his trigger finger at the 
same time.

These two chain saw protective devices combined with 
leg protection have had a significant impact on the 
reduction of accidents in Montana relative to timber 
falling. In fact, it's been so significant that I 
don't even consider the other options of even any 
application to logging when we talk about the low 
kickback bar, the low kick-back chains and even the bar 
tipped guards. They may have individual special 
application but I'm thoroughly convinced with the chain 
brake, the throttle lock and the leg protection we've 
so significantly reduced chain saw injuries that any 
further attention is maybe some wasted effort and just 
further develops additional conflict (Tr. OR 536).




Mr. David Kludt, Logging Safety Program Supervisor for 
the State of Idaho, testified that 10 percent of all logging 
accidents each month are the result of chain-saw kickback 
and that these accidents could be drastically reduced by the 
use of chain brakes (Ex. 9-4). 

In addition, Maine BLS says that chain brakes have 
played a significant role in lessening the effects of chain-saw injuries in that State (Ex. 5-174). They reported
that 
only 13 percent of chain-saw accidents where chain brakes 
were present resulted in hospitalization, while nearly half 
of all other accidents required hospitalization. 

Some commenters, however, disputed the effectiveness of 
chain brakes for preventing kickback (Ex. 5-39, 5-59, 5-66). 
One of these commenters said chain brakes were not reliable 
and required frequent maintenance, however, no evidence or 
data were presented to support the contention (ex. 5-59). 
Another commenter said that a study showed that while chain 
brakes reduced kickback by 80 percent, non-kickback 
accidents showed a 400 percent increase (Ex. 5-66). 
However, the commenter also admitted that the study was from 
1972 and that chain brakes had undergone significant 
improvement since that time. Another commenter said chain 
brakes, depending on their design, could become entangled in 
the brush the saw is clearing and create a safety hazard 
(Ex. 5-39). The WIR survey, however, does not support the 
commenter's argument. None of the chain-saw operators 
reporting injuries said their chain brake had become caught 
(Ex. 2-1). 

b. 

OSHA regulatory action. 

Many commenters said that 
the final rule should include requirements for chain-saw 
protective devices (Ex. 5-17, 5-19, 5-21, 5-27, 5-34, 5-42, 
5-46, 9-3, 9-4, 9-13, 9-15, 9-18, 9-20; Tr. OR 536-37). 
However, some commenters, including chain-saw and chain-saw 
accessory manufacturers, said OSHA should include 
performance requirements for chain saws in the final 
standard rather than specification requirements (Ex. 5-4, 5-8, 5-13, 5-15, 5-26, 5-37,
5-59). Many of these commenters 
supported incorporating by reference the American National 
Standards Institute (ANSI) B175.1-1985 standard on ``Safety 
Requirements for Gasoline Powered Chain Saws'' (Ex. 5-4, 5-8, 
5-13, 5-15, 5-26, 5-37, 5-59). The ANSI standard specifies 
a performance criteria for manufacture and testing of chain 
saw safety features, such as protection from chain-saw 
kickback. One commenter summed up their rationale:





[T]he Status Report on Chain Saw Related Hazards since 
the 1985 Revision to The Voluntary Standard ANSI 
B175.1, which was prepared for the Consumer Product 
Safety Commission in March of this year, is a 
testimonial to the fact that the reduction in chain saw 
injuries is the result of adherence by manufacturers to 
the voluntary standard. There truly is little to be 
said in defense of OSHA when it chooses to knowingly 
ignore the demonstrated success of the chain saw 
voluntary standard, which equates compliance with the 
use of a combination of devices, in favor of an 
arbitrary and inexpert agency decision to the effect 
that one specific device, in and of itself, is superior 
to any other device or combination of devices permitted 
by the standard (Ex. 5-4).





These commenters stated that OSHA would create 
``confusion in the marketplace'' if OSHA adopted requirements 
that were significantly different from the ANSI chain-saw 
standard that all manufacturers have been voluntarily 
following (Ex. 5-4). 

Other commenters, however, opposed incorporating the 
ANSI standard in the final rule (Ex. 5-27, 5-48; Tr. OR 
118). These commenters said the ANSI standard was developed 
to protect consumer chain-saw users, not professional 
loggers:




The ANSI B175.1 Standard was developed from an injury 
data base that was consumer based and therefore its 
direct application to pro-logging may not be justified 
(Ex. 5-27).

Two commenters said that ANSI standards were not known 
to most loggers, were not readily available, and were not 
written in language that the average logger would comprehend 
(Ex. 5-27; Tr. OR 118). One of these commenters said OSHA, 
therefore, should put its requirements in the standard 
rather than requiring logging employers to obtain and read 
another document (Tr. OR 118). He added that placing the 
requirements in the regulatory text would increase 
compliance. 

As discussed above, many commenters supported a 
requirement that all chain saws be equipped with chain 
brakes rather than just referencing the ANSI standard. In 
general, these commenters said chain brakes were the most 
effective device to protect operators from kickback and to 
provide extra protection when the saws are carried between 
cutting jobs. In addition, one commenter supported a chain 
brake requirement for the following reason:




The U.S. should follow the lead of other countries 
(European) and require that all saws have an operating 
chain brake if purchased after the adoption of these 
regulations. The cost would be minimal since the 
majority of saws now come equipped with these devices. 
This would also help deter the disabling of the brake 
system by operating personnel (Ex. 5-19).




OSHA agrees with commenters that the final standard 
should include requirements on chain-saw protective devices. 
The final rule does incorporate by reference the ANSI B175.1 
consensus standard, but the Agency believes that the ANSI 
standard alone does not provide the necessary degree of 
safety for logging employees. Accordingly, for several 
reasons, the final rule also requires that chain saws placed 
into initial service after the effective date of the 
standard be equipped with chain brakes. First, there is 
considerable evidence in the record that chain brakes are 
effective and the most used device to prevent kickback. 
Second, they have strong acceptance by logging 
professionals, and as a result, already are standard 
equipment on almost all chain saws currently manufactured. 
Third, chain brakes do not have the disadvantages of the 
other protective devices. For example, unlike bar tip 
guards, chain brakes are not removed by operators. Unlike 
reduced-kickback guide bars and low- or reduced-kickback 
chains, chain brakes do not affect production efficiency. 
Fourth, other countries also have adopted provisions 
requiring chain saws to be equipped with chain brakes (Ex. 
5-19). 

Fifth, OSHA agrees with commenters who are concerned 
that, in order to maximize compliance, the standard be 
comprehensible to the average loggers. This is especially 
important for chain-saw safety, since many employees provide 
their own chain saws. These employees and their employers 
need plain and simple direction about what protection must 
be provided for each chain-saw operator. OSHA does not 
believe that the ANSI standard contains the type of 
information needed by those operating the chain saw. It 
requires the use of sophisticated equipment and exacting 
procedures that are beyond the expertise of the average 
logging employer. Much of the ANSI standard deals with a 
computer program for simulating chain-saw kickbacks and 
tests to determine the accuracy of the computer program. As 
such, the ANSI standard is primarily directed to 
manufacturers of chain saws, rather than employers and 
employees in the logging industry. For example, the 
standard states:




The purpose of this standard is to establish minimum 
safety requirements with respect to the manufacture of 
portable, hand-held, gasoline-powered chain saws (Ex. 
4-66).




The requirements of the ANSI standard are primarily 
within the unique purview of manufacturers, such as 
requirements for the throttle control system, handles, pull-type starters, fuel tanks and oil tanks, exhaust systems,

sound levels, and vibration. Only the following 
requirements are directed at the employer:




It shall be the responsibility of the owner to maintain 
the chain saw in accordance with the instructions in 
the owner's manual. 

Chain saws shall be used in accordance with the 
operating instructions and safety precautions listed in 
the owner's manual. It shall be the responsibility of 
the owner to see that such instructions and precautions 
are given to every operator who uses the saw (Ex. 4-66).




In addition, the ANSI standard does not require the 
employer to ensure that each chain saw used in their 
workplace is equipped with kickback protection. That is, the 
ANSI standard does not require the employer to ensure that 
kickback prevention devices are not removed or disabled by 
operators. By specifying that chain saws used by logging 
employees be equipped with chain brakes, OSHA emphasizes 
that responsibility for compliance with OSHA standards rests 
with the employer, not the manufacturer or the employee.

In order to retain flexibility in the final rule, OSHA 
is requiring chain saws placed in service after the 
effective date of this standard to be equipped with chain 
brakes or other protective device that prevents or minimizes 
kickback. OSHA notes that whatever kickback device is 
present, the final rule requires that it not be removed or 
otherwise disabled. 


7. Operator manuals or instructions.

 In the 
hearing notice OSHA raised two issues regarding operator 
manuals or instructions (referred to collectively as 
instructions) for machines: the location of instructions, 
and the experience of employers in obtaining manuals from 
manufacturers. 


a. Location of operator manuals or instructions.

 Both 
the existing pulpwood standard and the proposed standard 
contained provisions requiring either an operator's manual 
or set of instructions be kept with each machine. In 
addition, both stated that the instructions, at a minimum, 
must describe the operation, maintenance and safe practices 
for the machine. The proposed standard added a provision 
requiring each operator and maintenance employee to comply 
with the manual. 
All commenters generally agreed with the need to have 
instructions available to operators and maintenance 
personnel. Several hearing participants supported OSHA's 
proposal to require instructions to be kept with machines 
(Tr. W1 201, OR 168, 194). For example, one participant 
stated: 



We urge OSHA to require that operator manuals be kept 
on the machine. Operator manuals contain important 
personal safety and machine operational information 
which must be utilized during training and must be 
available for reference to assure safety for all 
different operating conditions. 
Efficient and productive logging operations go hand in 
hand with safe work practices and proper machine 
maintenance and operation. Ready and immediate access 
to safety and operational information is essential to 
minimize downtime caused by accidents (Tr. OR 168). 



Another commenter added that once instructions are 
placed back at the office, they are not used: 




Ms. Schuster: I just have one question. Do you 
have any idea of the percentage of equipment out there 
in the woods that does not currently have operator's 
manuals available? 
Mr. Carr: I'm afraid I'd have to agree, most of 
them probably do not. This is our concern as 
manufacturers that most of them do not. Most of the 
time they have taken them and put them in the office 
and that's the last they see of them. 
Mr. Schuster: You say most of them would have put 
them in the office. Would you say that many of them do 
have them available though somewhere, if not on the 
equipment? 
Mr. Carr: If somebody can find it (Tr. OR 194).

<DOCNO> FR941012-0-00078 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941012-0-00011 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Many commenters, however, stated that for several 
reasons instructions should not be kept with machines or 
instead should be distributed as part of the training 
program (Ex. 5-12, 5-34, 5-35, 5-67, 9-2, 9-3, 9-4, 9-5, 9-19,
9-22; Tr. W1 66, 134, 185, 235, W2 225, OR 31, 59, 263, 
378, 629). First, these commenters said instructions kept 
with machines would be damaged or destroyed. They stated 
that instructions would be subject to vandalism or would 
disappear if kept with machines or vehicles. They also said 
instructions would become dirty or be destroyed due to 
adverse weather in which machines and vehicles are operated. 
As a result, these commenters stated that they store 
operator instructions at the company office, in the crew 
transport vehicles or at the work site. 
Second, several commenters said that it was not 
necessary to keep instructions with machines because they 
have limited utility (Ex. 9-4; Tr. W1 134, 186, OR 80, 117, 
378, 430, 629). Some of these commenters said instructions 
pertain primarily to maintenance of machines and scheduling 
of maintenance and, therefore, should be kept where the 
maintenance will be conducted. Other commenters said that 
instructions contain such general information about machine 
operation that their only utility is for someone who is 
unfamiliar with the operation of the machine. Instead, 
these and other participants said the manuals should be used 
in operator training sessions. 
Third, some participants said that instructions are 
currently given to new employees to read as part of their 
orientation sessions (Tr. W1 66; OR 31, 263, 629). These 
participants also said that if operators need to refer 
routinely to instructions at the work site, they should not 
be allowed to operate the machine and should receive 
additional training rather than being allowed to rely on the 
instructions. 
After reviewing the comments and testimony received, 
OSHA has decided in the final rule to require that operating 
and maintenance instructions be available on the machine or 
in the area where the machine is being operated, such as at 
the landing or in a crew transport vehicle located in the 
area where the machine is being operated. OSHA believes 
ready access to instructions is important for several 
reasons. As OSHA explained in the preamble to the proposed 
rule, instructions are necessary not only for maintenance 
personnel but also for operators who are unsure or unaware 
of safe operating procedures pose hazards to themselves and 
co-workers. Maintaining these materials in the immediate 
work area of the machine assures their availability and 
increases the likelihood of their use when needed by the 
operator. 
OSHA also believes that instructions have utility for 
operators in specific circumstances. Instructions give the 
operator a ready reference source when a new or unique 
situation is encountered (e.g., operations on terrain where 
a combination of hazards are present, such as swampy, rocky 
or loose ground). If unusual problems or emergencies 
requiring prompt correction arise during operation, the 
instructions provide the operator with correct information 
to resolve the problem rather than guessing about a 
solution. In addition, some machine operators perform their 
own maintenance. By keeping instructions on the machine or 
in the immediate work area, these operators can quickly deal 
with maintenance issues as they arise. Therefore, OSHA 
believes that instructions are useful for the operator only 
when they can be immediately accessed rather than being 
housed at an office that may be miles from the work area or 
maintenance area. 
OSHA also agrees with commenters who said that if 
instructions are not kept in the work area of the machine 
they will not be used. OSHA is concerned that if 
instructions are not in the area where the machine is being 
operated, operators will be discouraged from stopping 
production to go get the instructions. Instead, employees 
will decide to ``take their chances'' in dealing with unusual 
problems or emergencies, which could result in serious 
injury. 
With regard to the issue of weather damage to 
instructions which are kept on the machine or in the machine 
work area, OSHA notes that a hearing participant pointed out 
that in recent years, manufacturers have been providing 
weather-resistant instructions which may be kept with 
machines (Tr. OR 205). Moreover, it should not be overly 
difficult for an employer to place the instructions in a 
weather-proof bag to keep them with the machine. 
OSHA does agree with commenters' position that if an 
operator must 

routinely

 refer to instructions in order to 
operate a machine or vehicle, additional training or 
supervision is necessary. The final rule does provide such 
additional training for that operator. However, there may 
well be instances in which the employee may need to consult 
the manual in order to deal with a problem that arises 
during the use of the equipment. For that reason, the 
instructions should be immediately available to employees. 
Therefore, OSHA is requiring in this final rule that 
instructions be maintained in the immediate work area of the 
machine so they will be available both to the machine 
operator and to maintenance personnel. 


b. Obtaining operator manuals or instructions.

 In the 
hearing notice OSHA also requested employers to discuss 
their experience with trying to obtain operating 
instructions or replacement instructions from dealers and 
manufacturers. OSHA wanted to gather information on the 
number of machines that come with instructions and on the 
degree of ease in obtaining replacement instructions. Very 
few participants commented in this issue.

<TEXT>
 

One hearing participant said that manufacturers do provide instructions with new equipment, but used machines that
are sold may have no instructions (Tr. OR 31). However, two hearing participants said that replacement instructions
are available either from the manufacturer or the dealer, and therefore, they have had no more difficulty in obtaining
instructions than in acquiring any machine replacement part (Tr. W1 201, OR 197). 
OSHA therefore believes that the requirement that instructions for machine be maintained will not be burdensome
for employers, even where employers must obtain replacement copies from the manufacturer. 


8. Riders. 

In the hearing notice OSHA requested comment on whether trainers should be permitted to ride on machines to observe
operator performance. The pulpwood logging standard prohibited riders or observers from riding on machines unless
seating and other protection were provided. The proposed standard continued that prohibition. 
Many commenters supported the current and proposed prohibition of riders on machines (Ex. 5-7, 5-22,
5-42, 9-3, 9-13, 9-18; Tr. W1 202, 205, 235, W2 227, OR 155, 169). These commenters said riders
should be prohibited, unless protection is provided since they are exposed to the same hazards as machine operators,
for whom seating, seat belts and other protection is required. NIOSH, for example, supported the prohibition for
the following reasons: 




Many logging operations occur on rough terrain which would expose any rider to a high risk of injury or death. Serious
errors made by a trainer or trainee under these conditions endangers both people; it must be recognized that logging
equipment is not designed for training purposes (i.e., the trainer cannot take control of the equipment from the trainee
in a safe, orderly fashion) (Ex. 5-42). 




NIOSH therefore recommended that training be conducted and completed in pre-worksite training where the environment
can be ``controlled'' instead of the employer conducting ``on- the-job'' training with machines that are not designed
to carry passengers safely. Another commenter agreed that the necessary operator training should be given, and the
operator should be afforded the opportunity to practice on level ground, before the operator moves into work areas.
This training and practice would allow operators to become proficient without requiring trainers to ride on the machines
(Tr. OR 155). 
Two commenters, including one who supported the exemption for trainers, stated that it was not absolutely necessary
to have the trainer riding on the machine in order to maintain communication with the machine operator (Ex. 5-27;
Tr. W2 227). They said communication could be accomplished through radio contact (one-way or two-way radios), thus
allowing the trainer to remain in a safe location on the ground. One of the commenters pointed out that this method is
currently used in logging operations in Scandinavian countries (Tr. W2 227).

Many commenters supported an exception permitting trainers to ride on machines (Ex. 5-12, 5-22, 5-28,
5-36, 5-45, 5-49, 5-53, 5-54, 5-55, 5-63, 5-74 through 5-92,
9-2, 9-5, 9-10, 9-13, 9-19; Tr. OR 32, 201, 206, 337). These commenters said that an exemption
be allowed because trainers were not as great since they ride for only short periods and, therefore, they are not exposed
to hazards to the same extent as machine operators. However, several commenters said that if instructors were permitted
to ride on machines that at least seat belts should be required and training should be conducted on level terrain (Ex.
5-27, 9-3, 9-13; Tr. OR 169). Another commenter said that trainers should not be permitted to ride
on machines during actual production because ``such conditions may not be conducive to rider safety'' (Ex. 5-54).

Other commenters said the exemption should include other employees in addition to training (Ex. 5-27, 9-2;
Tr. OR 206). One commenter supported expanding the exception to allow mechanics to ride on machines (Tr. OR 206). Another
commenter said that the exception should be permitted for large multi-purpose logging equipment where there is sufficient
room in the enclosed operator cab to permit another person to ride safely, even though there is not a second seat (Ex.
5-27). One commenter said fellers should be permitted to ride back to the landing at the end of the workshift (Ex.
9-2). However, none of these commenters provided any evidence that these riders were not exposed to the same
hazards as the machine operator. 
OSHA has carefully considered all comments and data in the record. OSHA agrees with the commenters that riders face
the same hazards as machine operators on moving equipment and that they need protection equivalent to that of the operator.
According to logging fatalities reported to OSHA between 1985-90, there were reports of riders killed when
machines roll over (Ex. 4-65). The OSHA FCI report also indicated that loggers have been killed riding on unauthorized
parts of machines (Ex. 4-61). Even those who opposed the prohibition on riders recognized that such an activity
is hazardous due to conditions of the work environment, such as unlevel terrain. In addition, the record indicates
that an exemption for trainers is unnecessary because other methods of communication between the trainee and trainer
are available and in use in the logging industry. As such, OSHA has retained the requirement in the final standard that
machines must have passenger protection equivalent to operator protection if the employer allows riders on machines.



9. Equipment protective devices. 

In the hearing notice OSHA raised two issues regarding protective devices for machines: the need and cost of retrofitting
machines with rollover protective structures (ROPS) and falling object protective structures (FOPS), and the appropriateness
of incorporating various consensus standards covering ROPS and FOPS into the logging standard by reference. 


a. Retrofitting. 

In the hearing notice OSHA requested comment on whether the final standard should require machines without ROPS and
FOPS to be retrofitted with those devices. The proposed standard would not have required retrofitting. In the proposed
standard, OSHA specified that certain machines placed in service after the effective date of the final standard to
be equipped with ROPS and/or FOPS meeting Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) minimum performance criteria. 
There was no opposition from commenters on the general requirement that certain machines used in logging operations
be equipped with ROPS


and/or FOPS. NIOSH stated that 80 deaths occurred due to logging machine rollovers from 1980-85 (Ex. 5-42).
This is approximately 13 deaths each year due to rollover accidents. Another commenter cited a study where 12 loggers
were killed in rollover accidents in the State of Washington from 1977-83 (Tr. W1 27). 


Several commenters said that machines without ROPS and FOPS should be retrofitted (Ex. 5-42, 5-54, 9-3,
9-13; Tr. W1 22). The West Virginia Forestry Association safety committee said that retrofitting was necessary
because operators were exposed to ``extreme danger'' if machines were used in the woods without such protective devices
(Ex. 5-54). In addition to the safety necessity of retrofitting, the committee said that retrofitting was economically
feasible for the industry as whole.

<TEXT>
 

Many commenters, on the other hand, while supporting 
ROPS and FOPS requirements for new machines, opposed 
retrofitting older machinery (Ex. 5-19, 5-22, 5-25, 5-27, 5-33, 5-53, 5-57,
5-74 through 5-92, 9-5, 9-17; Tr. W1 203, OR 
170). Their opposition was based on several reasons. 

First, commenters said that machines should not be 
required to be retrofitted to meet current standards when 
the installed ROPS and/or FOPS met industry standards in 
effect at the time of manufacture (Ex. 5-22; Tr. W1 203, OR 
170). One commenter said that older machines in the logging 
industry were equipped with rollover protection, but those 
machine structures still in service do not meet the revised 
industry standards (Ex. 5-22). 

Second, some commenters said that retrofitting machines 
would be very burdensome and costly, especially given the 
limited useful life of such machines (Ex. 5-74 through 5-92, 
9-5). They said retrofitting would be expensive because it 
would require complete rebuilding and testing of the frame 
structure. These commenters also said that employers would 
have to hire outside contractors to test the retrofitted 
equipment since most employers did not have the personnel, 
expertise or equipment to install and test protective 
structures (Ex. 5-35). In addition, other commenters said 
that the retrofitting requirement would be too burdensome 
for small employers, both in terms of absorbing the cost in 
small operations and in finding persons who could do the 
retrofitting (Tr. OR 119, 263, 307). 

Third, commenters indicated that the retrofitting 
requirement was not essential since most of the machines 
specified in the proposed standard already are manufactured 
with ROPS and FOPS as standard equipment (Tr. W1 184, 203, 
OR 170). For example, most log-skidders manufactured after 
1974 have ROPS and FOPS meeting the performance criteria 
specified by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE). 
Most mobile equipment used in the Southeastern United States 
already has ROPS or FOPS (Ex. 5-19). Other commenters said 
that skidders now come with fully enclosed cabs (Tr. W1 
184). 

After consideration of all the comments and information 
received in the rulemaking record, OSHA has decided for 
several reasons not to require machines placed into service 
before the effective date of this standard to be retrofit 
with ROPS and FOPS, provided that ROPS and FOPS have not 
been removed from machines so equipped at the time of 
manufacture. First, OSHA has determined that many of the 
machines currently in use already have protective structures 
meeting various performance criteria. The final standard 
requires that these protective structures continue to be 
maintained throughout the useful life of the machine, and 
that they be replaced where they have been removed (e.g., 
removed after machine accident). 

Second, many machines currently in use and virtually 
all machines recently manufactured meet the performance 
criteria specified in the proposed standard (Ex. 9-2; Tr. OR 
185-87). OSHA believes that older machines, that either do 
not have protective structures or have ROPS and FOPS meeting 
earlier standards, are few in number and are rapidly nearing 
the end of their useful life. As such, OSHA believes that 
most employers are substantially in compliance with the 
requirement for machine protective structures and will reach 
full compliance in short period of time. Therefore, OSHA 
determines that compliance with the protective structure 
requirement can be achieved without requiring retrofitting. 

b. 

Incorporation of standards by reference. 

In the 
hearing notice, OSHA requested comment on the 
appropriateness of incorporating by reference updated 
consensus standards governing machine protective devices. 
In the proposed standard OSHA required ROPS and FOPS to be 
installed, tested and maintained in accordance with the 
following SAE national consensus standards: SAE 1040c June 
1979 ``Performance Criteria or Rollover Protective Structures 
(ROPS) for Construction, Earthmoving, Forestry, and Mining 
Machines'' and J231 Jan 1981 ``Minimum Performance Criteria 
for Falling Object Protective Structures (FOPS).'' The SAE 
ROPS standard was updated in 1988 as was the SAE standard on 
``Deflection Limiting Volume-ROPS/FOPS Laboratory 
Evaluation.''

Several commenters discussed incorporation of updated 
standards (Ex. 5-10, 5-22, 5-57, 9-3, 9-13; Tr. W1 203). 
Most emphasized the need to reference the most up-to-date 
standards in the final rule. In addition, two commenters 
said OSHA should allow the use of standards from other 
standards producing bodies, such as the International 
Organization for Standardization (ISO) (Ex. 5-22, 5-57). 
Two commenters also recommended that OSHA harmonize its 
regulatory language with ISO and Mine Safety and Health 
Administration protective structure standards (Ex. 5-10, 5-22). However, two commenters opposed incorporation
by 
reference because they contend that other standards may not 
have followed the same notice and public comment rules as do 
OSHA standards (Ex. 9-3, 9-13). 

OSHA has considered the comments and in the final 
standard the Agency has decided to incorporate by reference 
the current SAE standards on ROPS and FOPS. While there was 
some comment about whether technical publications should be 
referenced in standards, OSHA believes it is better in this 
case to reference technical documents rather than spell out 
all of the many specifications the documents contain. Since 
the final standard is not requiring employers to retrofit 
machines, it is more important for employers to know that 
new machines they purchase meet the SAE standards. It is 
the manufacturer and not the employer who will have the 
expertise, personnel and equipment to do the necessary 
installation and testing of the protective structures as 
part of the manufacturing process, and it is the label of 
conformance placed on the equipment by the manufacturer that 
will be the method that the employer will usually use to 
demonstrate compliance with the protective structures 
requirement of the final standard. 



10. Manual felling. 

The hearing notice raised two 
issues regarding manual felling: should exceptions to the 
undercut requirement be allowed, and where should the 
backcut be required to be made? 



a. Undercut requirement. 

The proposed standard 
included a provision requiring each manually felled tree to 
be undercut. This provision also required that undercuts be 
of a size to guide the tree fall in the intended direction 
and to minimize the possibility of splitting. The purpose 
of this provision was to prevent trees from splitting, 
kicking back, or falling in an unintended direction, thereby 
injuring an employee. 

Some commenters supported the proposed requirement (Ex. 
5-42, 9-15; Tr. OR 485-88). One commenter said: 




[Undercutting] helps protect the feller from the butt 
of the tree riding back up the sawn notch and springing 
backwards over the stump towards him if the tree is 
felled uphill, or strikes something during its fall 
that pushes [the tree] backwards (Ex. 9-15)

<TEXT>
 

However, other commenters said OSHA should revise the 
undercut requirement in the final rule (Ex. 5-21, 5-39, 
5-46, 5-52, 5-63, 5-74 through 5-92, 9-1, 9-5; Tr. OR 265, 
284-88, 324-26). One commenter said OSHA should make 
undercutting a recommended practice in the final rule to 
allow for innovations in cutting techniques and to allow for 
consideration of various production requirements for cutting 
certain types of wood (e.g., veneer). 

Other commenters stated that OSHA should permit an 
exception to the undercut requirement for manual felling of 
saplings or unmerchantable trees, that is, of trees with a 
small diameter at breast height (DBH) (Ex. 5-21, 5-39, 5-46, 
5-63, 5-74 through 5-92, 9-1, 9-5; Tr. OR 265, 284-88, 
324-26). These commenters said that the hazards OSHA was 
attempting to protect against do not exist for saplings, 
therefore, undercuts are not necessary. For example, Mr. 
Alex Hanson, of AOL, stated: 




On the smaller, nonmerchantable timber that's two, 
three, four, five, six inches, generally not very tall, 
20 foot or less or maybe taller, and when you slash it, 
you push it over. It doesn't need a face to control 
the direction of fall. 



* * * * *



[W]hen trees start getting to be merchantable size, 
then you have safety problems. You get a seven inch or 
over tree, you want to know where it's going. You 
don't want to have it just fall anywhere. 



* * * * *



[Y]ou have to buck those merchantable trees. You have 
to cut the top out so you just don't want them going 
everywhere. You want things in line. And if they're 
everywhere, then it increases the risk for the buckers. 
Generally it's the same guy who is falling it, but you 
want to have things in an orderly fashion so that he's 
not having to go everywhere to buck the top. If 
they're just slashing it, it doesn't really matter 
where it goes because you're not having to go out there 
and limb and cut the tops out and create another hazard 
for yourself (Tr. OR 265, 284-88). 





However, other commenters disagreed with AOL about what 
size tree requires an undercut. One commenter said that 
undercuts are necessary for any tree that has more than a 
three-inch base (Ex. 9-16), while another commenter said 
undercuts were not necessary for trees with a seven-inch DBH 
(Tr. OR 421-22). 

The APA, however, said that even trees with a small 
DBH should be undercut: 




You heard from one of the associations who is 
recommending that with regard to what I call undercuts, 
they're also called face cuts, that they not be 
required on very small trees, and there was a 
discussion and possibly a recommendation of an 8-inch 
or 7-inch size limit. Unfortunately, I don't have any 
data. But we do know and I will watch to see if I can 
find any and submit it post hearing. I went through 
our files and could not find anything. But it is our 
perception, after studying these operations, that a 
tree that's 8 inches in diameter at breast height is 
probably about 12 inches in diameter at the stump, and 
whether it's an oak tree or a Douglas fir tree that's 
60 feet tall and 8 inches and 12, it's a significant 
mass of wood that is difficult to control to get on the 
ground and could cause and probably has caused injuries 
and maybe even deaths. There's enough mass there with 
a 60-foot tree ripping down, uncontrolled in its fall, 
to cause a death. And you heard from the Montana 
folks, that they have a little bit of a problem with 
that too (Tr. OR 485-88). 




Moreover, some commenters opposing the undercut 
requirement also admitted that undercuts were necessary for 
any merchantable tree, regardless of its size. They said 
that whenever a tree has a merchantable stem for a sawlog 
product, it must be undercut to protect the fiber recovery 
(Tr. OR 422, 487-88). They said undercutting was essential 
both for production reasons and safety considerations for 
employees bucking the felled tree. 

After considering the evidence in the record, OSHA 
believes a provision requiring that each tree manually 
felled be undercut is necessary to protect employees from 
injury. According to the WIR survey, four percent of 
employees injured said they had been using the wrong cutting 
method at the time of their accident (Ex. 2-1). The OSHA 
FCI report indicated that 10 fellers were injured because of 
misjudgments in cutting the tree (Ex. 4-61). 

As discussed above, undercutting helps protect the 
feller from injury by reducing the potential for the tree 
splitting and falling in an unintended direction or kicking 
back towards the feller. In the final rule, OSHA is also 
allowing an exception to the undercutting requirement when 
the employer demonstrates that felling the particular tree 
without an undercut will not create a hazard for an 
employee. OSHA believes that when the hazards of splitting 
trees, tree kickback and misdirected falls are not present, 
it may be appropriate to manually fell a tree without 
undercutting. OSHA notes that the employer bears the burden 
of demonstrating that the hazards discussed in this section 
are not present. OSHA also notes that the employers cannot 
make a blanket determination that trees of a particular size 
never pose the hazards discussed above if manually felled 
without an undercut. The condition of the tree and the 
surrounding area may make manually felling even a small a 
tree hazardous if it is not first undercut. The tree and 
those conditions must be assessed on a case by case basis to 
determine whether felling the tree without making an 
undercut would create a hazard for an employee.

<TEXT>
 

For two reasons, however, OSHA has decided against 
specifying an undercut exception for trees of a certain 
size. First, there is no agreement among the commenters on 
what size tree could be safely exempted from the 
undercutting requirement. There is evidence in the record, 
that manually felling trees of the size that some commenters 
say should be exempted from the requirement can pose a 
serious hazard to fellers (Tr. OR 265-69, 485-88). Also, 
while commenters agreed that unmerchantable trees did not 
require undercutting, none agreed on what size tree 
constituted an unmerchantable tree. The estimates of what 
sizes were considered to be merchantable trees varied 
greatly, from 3 to 10 inches DBH, depending on the type of 
wood being harvested (Ex. 5-46; Tr. OR 265, 485-88). And, 
as some commenters have pointed out, trees included in this 
range of sizes can pose hazards to fellers. 

Second, some commenters said that any tree that is 
considered merchantable is undercut, even if it is within 
the range of sizes that commenters say should be exempted. 
According to commenters the undercut is also made in 
merchantable trees to prevent splitting of the product (Tr. 
OR 284-88). As such, undercutting may be done on small 
trees in any event. 

OSHA does note that in many cases when trees are 
determined to be unmerchantable they are not manually felled 
but rather slashed by mechanical means (Tr. OR 265, 268-69, 
285-87, 421-22). This provision on undercutting does not 
apply to trees felled by mechanical means. 



b. Backcut requirement.

 The second issue 
regarding manual felling on which OSHA requested comment was 
where backcuts should be required to be made. In the 
proposed standard, OSHA required that backcuts be made above 
the horizontal cut of the undercut. The 1978 ANSI logging 
and various State logging standards contain similar 
requirements (e.g., Ex. 38K). 

Several commenters supported the proposed requirement 
(Ex. 5-42, 9-15). These commenters said a backcut above the 
horizontal cut is necessary to assure that the tree does not 
fall in an unintended direction. 

However, other commenters said OSHA should permit 
backcuts to be at the same level or below the level of the 
undercut (Ex. 5-28, 5-29, 5-42, 5-52, 9-1; Tr. W2 229-31, OR 
395-96, 421-24, 499-500). Some said that a same level 
backcut was more effective: 





</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941012-0-00085 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941012-0-00011 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Backcuts should be made on the same level as the point 
of the notch of the undercut. The hinge is what keeps 
the tree from kicking back, not the fact that the 
backcut is higher than the undercut. High backcuts run 
the risk of cutting off the hinge, actually increasing 
the danger of kickback (Ex. 5-52). 




Other commenters said that backcuts above the 
horizontal cut were not as critical when using the Humboldt 
undercutting method (Ex. 5-42, 9-15). They said that when 
the slanting cut of the undercut is angled downward, the 
tree is more likely to fall in the intended direction 
without kicking back. However, one of these commenters 
admitted that placing the backcut at the same level as the 
horizontal cut when using the Humboldt undercut method 
sacrificed safety for quality control: 




Quality control concerns with several companies 
dictate that only Humboldt undercuts are 
permissible with sawlog grade timber, so that wood 
loss is minimized by taking the notch wood out of 
the stump. Quality control often dictates that 
there must be a flush surface on the end of the 
log. To avoid having to make another cut to 
square up a log butt, fallers will attempt to make 
their backcuts meet the horizontal face cut as 
closely as possible. By doing this, they 
sacrifice the safety of the step that would have 
been left on the stump to catch a possible 
backwards-moving tree butt, and depend only on the 
downward-slanting face on the stump to hold the 
tree (Ex. 9-15).

 


Two commenters said the backcut requirement should be 
limited to those situations when tree kickback is a problem, 
which they contended was only on steep terrain, when felling 
uphill or through trees (Ex. 9-1, 9-4). Other commenters 
said that believed that the standard should provide more 
flexibility because variations frequently found on logging 
sites, such as lean of the tree and type of terrain, would 
make strict adherence to the regulation difficult (Ex. 5-19, 
9-9, 9-22; Tr. OR 206-7, 395-96). These commenters said 
that the cutting decisions should be left to the judgment of 
the experienced feller. 

After reviewing the evidence in the record, OSHA has 
decided that the proposed backcut provisions are necessary 
to protect fellers from being hit or crushed by the tree 
they are felling. As discussed above, the record shows that 
injuries and fatalities have occurred because of improper 
cutting methods. The purpose of undercutting and 
backcutting trees is to prevent the tree from splitting, 
felling an unintended direction or kicking back into the 
feller. OSHA agrees with ANSI and the various State plan 
States that the proposed backcut provisions are necessary to 
protect employees against these hazards. 

OSHA does not agree that backcutting should be limited 
only to those situations when tree kickback can occur. The 
record shows that hazards other than tree kickback 
necessitate the backcut requirement. Without appropriately-
placed backcuts, trees are more likely to split and/or fall 
in an unintended direction. While OSHA agrees that it is 
more likely that this could happen when trees are felled 
uphill, OSHA also believes the record shows that the 
possibility exists regardless of the terrain. According to 
the WIR survey, the single largest cause of injuries 
reported was being hit by a falling tree (Ex. 2-1). Almost 
one-half of all injuries reported were due to employees 
being hit or crushed by a falling tree. 

In the final rule OSHA has provided an exception to the 
backcut requirement. The final rule allows the backcut to 
be placed at or below the horizontal cut in tree pulling 
operations. Various State logging standards also provide 
this exception to the backcut requirement (e.g., Ex. 38K). 
OSHA believes this exception covers those situations in 
which a special cutting technique may be required, such as 
by Federal agencies.

V. Summary and Explanation of the Final Standard 



The revision of the pulpwood logging standard was undertaken in response to the concern on the part of OSHA to the number
of fatalities and injuries that occur each year in the logging industry. The industry itself admits that logging is
a high hazard industry. As discussed above, the injury and fatality incidence rates in the logging industry are among
the highest industry incidence rates in the country. 

The OSHA pulpwood logging standard, 1910.266, addressed only the hazards that exist in the pulpwood logging industry.
However, examination of the descriptions of accidents and other information available to the Agency indicates that
the same hazards exist for employees performing logging operations regardless of the end use of the harvested trees.


Many commenters supported the need for a comprehensive logging standard (Ex. 5-6, 5-10, 5-17, 5-18,
5-21, 5-22, 5-36, 5-41, 5-42, 5-46, 5-49, 5-59, 5-61, 5-65,
5-69; Tr. W1 pg 21, 73, 202). For example, one commenter said that in Maine it has generally been acknowledged
that both products (pulpwood logs and logs used for other purposes) come off the same job (Ex. 5-46). 

This final rule provides protection for all loggers involved in timber harvesting, including loggers employed as
part of a mill operation, regardless of the end use of the forest products (saw logs, veneer bolts, pulpwood, chips,
etc.). This standard fills the current gap in coverage by providing a basic level of protection for all loggers. OSHA
has changed the title of 1910.266 from ``Pulpwood Logging'' to ``Logging Operations'' in order to reflect the wider
coverage of this revised standard. In addition, OSHA has added and/or modified various provisions of the pulpwood
logging standard to address more adequately the hazards faced in different aspects of logging operations. OSHA also
has updated equipment specification requirements in the revised standard. 

Throughout the development of the revised standard, the Agency strove to promulgate a final rule that is effective,
and that is simple, concise, enforceable, and sustainable. 



Paragraph (a) Table of Contents



OSHA has added a table of contents to aid employers and other persons in using the revised standard. The table of contents
identifies the provisions that are included in the final standard and where specific requirements can be found. The
table of contents also is included because the final standard represents a significant reorganization of the elements
of the pulpwood logging standard. 

The identification of the major paragraphs will, hopefully, aid persons in reading and understanding the requirements
of this final rule. In order to add the table of contents, each of the subsequent paragraphs had to be renumbered. The
paragraph references in the following discussion of the individual provisions of the standard are to the paragraphs
of the final rule, unless otherwise noted. 



Paragraph (b) Scope and Application



This paragraph defines the scope and application of this standard. The existing standard applied only to pulpwood
logging operations. That standard adopted, pursuant to section 6(a) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the
American National Standards Institute, ANSI 03.1-1971 Safety Standard for Pulpwood Logging (hereafter 1971
ANSI standard) (Ex 2-13). Included in the 1971 ANSI standard were requirements for important safety practices
along with provisions pertaining to personal protective equipment, first aid and stationary and mobile equipment.


When ANSI revised the 1971 consensus standard in 1978, they expanded the scope of the standard to include all logging
operations. The revised ANSI standard adopted, virtually unchanged, many of the requirements of the 1971 pulpwood
logging standard, and applied those provisions to all logging operations throughout the nation. OSHA has taken a
similar approach in this rulemaking. In paragraph (b)(1), the Agency has expanded the scope of the pulpwood logging
standard, 1910.266, and to cover all logging operations regardless of the end use of the timber products.

In paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of the final rule, OSHA makes clear that the standard applies to all types of logging
operations, regardless of the end use of the wood. Logging operations, as defined in paragraph (c) of the final rule,
include, but are not limited to, marking, felling, bucking, limbing, debarking, chipping, yarding, loading, unloading,
storing, transporting machines and equipment from one site to another, and other operations associated with felling
and moving trees and logs from the stump to the point of delivery. Many commenters supported the application of the
standard to all types of logging and all logging operations (Ex. 5-6, 5-10, 5-17, 5-18, 5-21,
5-36, 5-42, 5-46, 5-48, 5-49, 5-54, 5-61, 5-65). 

One commenter said OSHA should exclude felling operations from the logging standard and cover only the movement of
felled trees from the stump to the mill (Ex. 17). This commenter said that felling activity is not the most hazardous
part of logging operations. OSHA believes the record does not support the commenters' recommendation. The record
clearly shows that felling activities are the most hazardous activities of the logging operation. According to the
WIR survey, more than one-half of all reported injuries involved various felling activities (Ex. 2-1). OSHA
believes that if the standard did not include hazards associated with felling the trees, that the majority of employees
in the logging industry would still be exposed to significant risk of injury and death. Therefore, in the final OSHA
has retained coverage of tree felling operations. 

Another commenter raised the issue about whether establishments that hire independent contractors to perform various
logging activities are considered employers covered by this standard (Ex. 5-23). The courts have held in various
OSHA cases that when the contractor exercises control over the means and methods by which the independent contractor
performs the work, that the contractor is regarded as an employer for purposes of this rule.

Martin,

 15 F.3d 1086 (9th Cir. 1994). 

See also Castillo 

v. 

Gibbons, 

704 F.2d 181, 188-93 (5th Cir. 1993). For example, establishments that provide independent contractors with
machines, such as yarders or forklift trucks, to perform the job are exercising control over the means by which the
job is performed. 

At paragraph (b)(1) of the final rule, the Agency has excluded from coverage the construction or use of cable yarding
systems. Cable yarding, as defined in the final standard, is the movement of felled trees or logs from the area where
they are felled to the landing on a system composed of a cable suspended from spars and/or towers. The definition further
states that the trees or logs may be either dragged across the ground by the cable or carried while suspended from the
cable. One of the end towers is located in the area where the trees or logs are attached to the cable yarding system and
the other end is at the landing. Cable yarding systems are used primarily when the terrain is extremely rugged and the
felled trees and logs are otherwise inaccessible. Important elements of the safe use of a cable yarding system include
the selection and use of climbing devices to install the system, preparation of head and tail spars and intermediate
trees or towers, component sizing, system rigging and system usage. There are generally three types of cable yarding
systems, namely, high lead, skyline and slackline. In a high lead system, the mainline is threaded through the mainline
block (pulley) that is attached near the top of the spar to obtain a lift of the logs being yarded. A skyline system is
one in which the line (cable) is hung between two or more supports on which a carriage or block travels. A slackline system
is a form of skyline system where the skyline is spooled on a drum so that the line can be raised or lowered. In all three
systems, the spars are usually held in part and restrained against movement by the use of guylines that are anchored
to the ground or another tree. Trees and logs may be moved by a cable yarding system by dragging them along the ground
or while they are suspended from the system.

In the preamble of the proposed rule, OSHA explained that this exemption was included due to the regional nature of
the use of cable logging systems. State plan States in the far west that have the most significant cable logging activity
have developed very detailed cable logging standards. Many commenters testified that the hazards of cable yarding
in those states have been adequately covered by the specific state standards (Ex. 2-18, 2-19, 2-20,
2-21, 2-23, 5-17, 5-27, 5-39, 5-45, 5-74 through 5-92, 38J, 38K). However,
some commenters discussed the need for increased regulation of cable yarding operations on the national level because
they assert there is increasing use of cable yarding in non-western regions of the country where no State standards
exist (Ex 5-19, 5-20, 5-36). 
After careful consideration of the comments, OSHA has decided to retain the exclusion for cable yarding operations
in this final rule for several reasons. First, the State logging standards that address cable yarding are detailed
specification standards that adequately address the unique hazards associated with the construction and use of
cable yarding in those particular States, that are all western States. For example, those standards deal with construction
of cable yarding systems on steep slopes that are predominently in those western States. Those State cable yarding
standards will not be affected by the Federal logging standard. Second, there is no evidence in this rulemaking record
that those standards are not addressing particular hazards associated with cable yarding in those States. Third,
OSHA agrees with the APA that the prevalent use of cable yarding is in those States that have their own standards that
include requirements for cable yarding. None of the commenters representing non-western logging establishments
indicated that cable yarding is being performed in their area or by their member companies. Fourth, OSHA believes
there is not sufficient information and data in the record regarding cable yarding activities in non-western States
to determine at this point whether the various cable yarding regulations of the western States would be appropriate
to apply nationwide. For example, logging in western States is usually clear cut logging while selective cutting
is more prominent in non-western states (Ex. 2-1). Other logging conditions vary across regions, such as tree
size and type, weather, and terrain. For example, logging operations in western States are three times more likely
to be on steep slopes, where skidding may be impossible (Ex. 2-1). OSHA believes that these differences might
affect what would constitute appropriate cable yarding rules for non-western States. Therefore, OSHA believes
this issue requires further study before the Agency promulgates a national cable yarding standard. 
However, OSHA emphasizes that the exclusion of cable yarding is only for the construction and use of the cable yarding
system itself. Other parts of the logging operation taking place where cable yarding systems are present will be covered
by this standard. Just as this standard extends the pulpwood logging standard to cover the same hazards experienced
elsewhere in the logging industry, OSHA believes that these same hazards need to be covered by this standard when cable
yarding operations are being performed. For example, the hazards for loggers felling trees exist regardless of how
the trees or logs are moved about the work site. To this end, the Agency has included in the final standard the felling
of the trees and the other operations that are conducted in conjunction with the use of a cable yarding system. 

It should also be noted that the use of yarding machines with winches for playing out and retrieving cable is not considered
cable yarding for the purposes of this standard. Therefore, this operation is covered by this final logging standard.
In this type of log retrieval, a yarding machine plays out cable, to which is attached a choker sling that is secured
to a tree or log. Once the sling is attached to the log, the cable is wound onto the drum and the tree or log is then yarded
by skidding while attached to and supported by the cable on the winch. This system of yarding is oftentimes used when
logging is being conducted along a roadway or other area where access to the area where the tree is felled is not practical
and the area where the yarder (skidder) is operating is on the roadway or in an accessible area.

At paragraph (b)(3) of the final rule OSHA emphasizes that this standard is not a totally ``vertical'' standard for
logging operations. That is, the requirements of this final rule are to be supplemented by other applicable requirements
found elsewhere in part 1910. When there is a corresponding provision elsewhere in part 1910 that addresses the same
hazard or condition of work as a provision of the logging standard, the more specific logging provision takes precedence
for logging operations. By contrast, when hazardous working conditions are not addressed or covered by the logging
standard, the other requirements of part 1910 apply. For example, employers in the logging industry must provide
employees protection against occupational noise exposure by meeting the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.95. Employers
in this industry must also comply with the permissible exposure limit for wood dust specified in 29 CFR 1910.1000 and
meet the field sanitation requirements of 29 CFR 1910.28. 

Several commenters raised the issue about what standards apply to the construction of roads and trails (Ex. 5-16,
5-44, and 5-63). These commenters said there was confusion about whether the entire part 1926 would be
applied to logging operations. Construction activities such as the building of roads and trails are not logging operations,
therefore they are covered by applicable construction standards and not the logging standard. As such, the use and
maintenance of the equipment to perform the construction of those roads and trails, such as graders, scrapers, front-end
loaders, and bulldozers, are covered by the construction standards. In addition, the building of roads and trails
to reach logging sites is not a logging operation, but is a construction activity that is carried out preparatory to
the logging activity. Therefore, in this final standard OSHA has removed references to road building construction
activities. Road building in conjunction with the establishment of a logging activity is no different than road building
to gain access to any other operation and is covered in the general construction standards. 

However, the felling of trees in preparation for the construction activities, such as the building of roads, is considered
to be a logging operation. To the extent that any employee is performing a logging operation in preparation for construction
activities, the employee is performing general industry work, and the requirements of this standard as well as other
applicable sections of part 1910, apply in order to safely fell those trees. For example, if trees are felled to prepare
for road construction, the requirements in this final rule and other sections of part 1910 apply. This reasoning also
applies to felling of trees in preparation for agricultural activities (e.g., felling trees to prepare land for crops).
Felling of those trees is general industry work and the requirements of this standard as well as other applicable sections
of part 1910 apply. To this end, OSHA has specifically referenced the applicability of the final logging standard
in 29 CFR Part 1928 to felling of trees in preparation of agricultural activities.

Paragraph (c) Definitions 



In paragraph (c), OSHA is adopting a number of definitions to clarify the meaning, intent and purpose of certain terms
contained in this standard. Several definitions contained in the pulpwood logging rule were deleted from the proposed
rule because the terms were no longer used in the regulatory text. In addition, 17 new definitions were added to the
proposal. In the final rule OSHA has added and changed several definitions to better reflect the intent of the Agency
and to aid interested persons in understanding the requirements of this standard. In addition, in the final rule OSHA
has deleted several proposed definitions. Many of these terms involved cable yarding and road construction activities,
that are not covered by this final rule. 

``Cable yarding'' is defined in this final rule as the movement of felled trees or logs from the area where they are felled
to a landing by attaching them to a suspended cable system. The supports for the cable that carries or supports the trees
or logs are called head and tail spars. Spars may be fashioned from standing trees or from metal towers (commonly called
metal spars). There may be additional intermediate spars if the cable run is of sufficient length to require intermediate
support. OSHA has specifically defined ``cable yarding'' in the final rule to aid persons in understanding the scope
of the exclusion from the standard for this particular type of logging operation. 

``Danger tree'' is defined in the final rule as any standing tree that presents a hazard to an employee due to conditions
such as, but not limited to, deterioration or physical damage to the root system, trunk, stem or limbs, and the direction
and lean of the tree. The tree may be dead or alive. This term was not contained in the proposed standard. Instead, the
related term ``snag'' was included and defined as any dead tree or portion thereof remaining standing. Also, the term
``widow maker'' was included in the proposed rule and defined as an overhanging limb or section of tree that could become
dislodged and drop to the ground. Several commenters said this term should replace the use of ``snag'' in the proposed
rule because the definition of snag implies that all dead trees are dangerous (Ex. 5-17, 5-50, 5-64,
17). Rep. Jolene Unsoeld, from the State of Washington, said that not all snags were dangerous to employees and many
were essential to the health of the wildlife community (Ex. 17). In this final rule, OSHA has decided to use the term
``danger tree,'' a term that is used in the State of Washington logging standard that is more inclusive of the various
conditions that could cause a tree to be dangerous (Ex. 2-22). 

``Designated person'' is defined in the final rule as an employee who has the requisite knowledge, training and experience
to perform specific duties. This definition is a close parallel to the definition of the term used in consensus standards
dealing with material handling equipment, such as the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, ASME B30.5-1989
with Addenda, ``Safety Standard for Mobile Cranes'' (Ex. 38DD and EE). In the ASME standard, a designated person is
defined as an employee who is selected or assigned by the employer as being competent to perform specific duties. In
this final rule, the Agency has amended that definition to indicate that the employee needs to have the knowledge,
training and experience to perform that job or duty for which he/she is designated. The possession of those attributes
is not a discretionary decision on the part of the employer but a mandatory prerequisite that the employee must possess.
Knowledge and competency are normally achieved through training or experience or a combination of those activities.


In this final rule a signal person, an explosive handler and user, a machine operator, a trainer, and a supervisor of
new and newly-trained employees must be designated persons. In these cases, the Agency recognizes that each of those
individuals must have knowledge, experience, and training to competently perform those tasks. For example, a signal
person needs to know the various signals to use when indicating that a particular operation or movement is to be made.
The signal person also must know and understand how the task is to be performed and the role of his signals in completing
the task safely.

``Domino felling'' is defined in the final rule as the partial cutting of several trees that are left standing and then
pushed over with a pusher tree. Domino felling is a dangerous practice that is prohibited by the final standard. When
one tree falls into or against another tree, the direction of fall of each tree may be altered to the point that either
tree may fall in an unexpected, and oftentimes, dangerous location. Whenever one tree is being felled and it strikes
another tree, the base of the tree being felled can kick back, striking the feller who has not moved away sufficiently
from the tree being felled. Additionally, one tree falling into another tree can result in the initial tree becoming
lodged in the second tree, thereby making it necessary for an employee to remove the lodged tree. 
``Health care provider'' is defined in this final rule as a health care practitioner operating within the scope of
his/her license, certificate, registration or legally authorized practice. As used in this standard, health care
providers are practitioners whose authorization qualifies them to approve first-aid kits that are to be used in the
logging industry. 
``Log'' has been defined in the final rule as a segment sawed or split from a felled tree. This term replaces the terms
section, log, bolt and tree length, that were all used in the pulpwood logging standard and the proposed standard.
The usual practice in the harvesting of large and/or tall trees is to cut them into shorter, more manageable lengths
before they are yarded so that they may be more easily handled and transported. In some cases, extremely large diameter
trees may be split lengthwise so that they can be handled and transported to the mill for further processing. Although
the practice of splitting a very large tree is not as common, the Agency has included a log as any section of tree, whether
that section has been cut or split from a tree. 
``Logging operations'' is defined in the final standard as operations associated with felling and moving trees and
logs from the stump to the point of delivery, such as, but not limited to, marking, felling, bucking, limbing, debarking,
chipping, yarding, loading, unloading, storing, and transporting machines, equipment and personnel from one site
to another. The proposed rule did not define logging operations. OSHA has included this definition in the final rule
to emphasize that this standard covers those operations involving the felling and moving of felled trees, as opposed
to other operations, such as road building that are preparatory to rather than part of logging operations. 
``Machine'' is defined in the final standard as a piece of equipment having a self contained powerplant that is operated
off-road and is used for the movement of materials. Machines include tractors, skidders, front-end loaders, scrapers,
graders, bulldozers, swing yarders, log stackers and mechanical felling devices, such as tree shears and feller-bunchers.
In the pulpwood logging and proposed standards, terms such as ``machine'' and ``equipment'' were used interchangeably
to describe a piece of equipment that is intended to be operated off-road and is used primarily for the movement of material.
Some commenters said they were confused about whether ``vehicles'' were included within the term ``mobile equipment,''
that had been broadly defined as the kind of equipment which includes mobility as part of its work function. Because
of the potential for confusion regarding the intention of the Agency in proposing requirements for off-road versus
on-road equipment, the Agency has defined both the terms ``machine'' and ``vehicle.'' The intent of the Agency in
including these terms is to distinguish between machines, whose primary area of operation is off-road and are primarily
material movers, and vehicles that include personnel and material conveyances operated on highways as well as off-road.

The operators of many vehicles (primarily trucks, tractor/trailers and buses) require special licenses or endorsements
to qualify as an operator of that type vehicle. In contrast, machine operators usually do not have to possess a special
license. Therefore, OSHA is defining and imposing different logging-related requirements for the operation of
machines and vehicles. The use of the term ``machine'' as used in this standard should not be confused with the use of
that term elsewhere in these general industry standards.

``Rated capacity'' is defined in the final rule as the maximum load that a piece of material handling equipment can
safely lift and move. This is a term that is commonly used when describing the capability of a piece of material handling
equipment. The rated capacity of a piece of material handling equipment is initially determined by the manufacturer
and documented in the operators manual and on the equipment. 
``Serviceable condition'' is defined in this final rule as that quality of a tool, machine, vehicle, or other device
to operate as it was intended by the manufacturer to operate. OSHA believes that there are many conditions that can
exist with a piece of equipment that would make it unserviceable, as well as other conditions that would not similarly
qualify. For example, seat covering material on a tractor that has become cracked, although uncomfortable, would
not normally qualify as a condition that would make the machine unserviceable. On the other hand, worn brakes or a leak
in the brake system would definitely make a machine or vehicle unserviceable. Additionally, cracked or broken gauges
and defective or leaking fuel systems are other conditions that would render a machine or vehicle unserviceable.

In the case of personal protective equipment, head protection that has a crack that would compromise the ability of
the hard hat to absorb further impact without injuring the employee is an example of an unserviceable condition. On
the other hand, a small dent in a hard hat would not necessarily render the head protection unserviceable. 
``Tie down'' is defined in the final rule as an assemblage of binder and strapping (either chain, cable, steel strips
or fiber webbing) that is used to secure a load to the bed of a transport vehicle. In the proposed rule, OSHA used the term
``binder'' to indicate the assembly that is used to secure a load to a vehicle during transport of that load. As pointed
out by two commenters (Ex. 5-7; Tr. OR 20), a binder is a component of a tie down and is the ratchet assembly that
is used to secure and tighten the strapping of the tie down. In this final rule, the Agency has corrected the definition.

``Vehicle'' is defined as a personnel conveyance and/or material handling equipment. Included are cars, buses,
trucks, trailers and semi-trailers. Although vehicles normally operate on public roads, their use is not limited
to that environment. Any of these pieces of equipment may operate not only on public roads, but may also be used to transport
personnel or materials off-road. For example, when a logging truck or tractor/trailer is moving a load of trees or
logs, the vehicle may have to traverse not only the logging trails or roads, but may have to operate on the public thoroughfares
to deliver its load to the mill or other off-loading point. This final rule covers the logging operation from the site
of the felling of the trees to the point of delivery of the trees or logs. 


Paragraph (d) General Requirements


Included in the general requirements paragraph of the final rule are requirements for personal protective equipment,
seat belts, first aid, fire extinguishers, environmental conditions, work areas, signaling and signal equipment,
overhead electric lines, flammable and combustible liquids and explosives and blasting agents. 


Personal Protective Equipment 


Paragraph (d)(1) contain requirements for personal protective equipment (PPE), including its use and maintenance,
and the inspection of PPE before its use during a workshift. Paragraph (d)(1) also specifies when employees must use
gloves, leg protection, logging boots, head protection, and eye and face protection. This final rule, however, does
not contain requirements for other types of personal protective equipment that are covered by other general industry
requirements contained elsewhere in part 1910 (i.e., hearing protection and respiratory protection). Paragraph
(b)(3) already makes clear that other requirements contained in part 1910 automatically apply when the logging standard
has not addressed a particular hazard or working condition. Therefore, since part 1910 already require the use and
maintenance of PPE, OSHA has included in paragraph (d)(1) only those items of personal protective equipment that
are not contained elsewhere in that part or that are in some way different from the requirements contained in elsewhere
in part 1910. As such, references to respiratory protection in subpart I of part 1910 and hearing protection at  1910.95
have been deleted from this final rule.

Paragraph (d)(1)(i) of the final rule requires that the employer assure that all PPE is maintained in a serviceable
condition. This employer responsibility applies whether the PPE is provided by the employer or provided by the employee.
One commenter recommended that OSHA include this provision in the final rule (Tr. W2 195). This provision parallels
the maintenance requirements of the general industry PPE standards. Specifically, 1910.132(b) also requires that
when employees are allowed to provide their own PPE, the employer is still responsible for assuring its proper maintenance.
OSHA has recognized that whether or not the employer pays for particular types of PPE that must be worn in the workplace,
the employer is responsible for assuring that required PPE is adequately protecting employees from workplace hazards.
The only way for the employer to assure that PPE adequately protects employees from workplace hazards is to inspect
the PPE and maintain it in the condition that it was intended by the manufacturer. The final rule, in paragraphs (d)(1)(i)
(PPE maintenance) and (ii) (PPE inspection), imposes such responsibilities directly on the employer. 
In order to assure that all PPE is maintained in a serviceable condition, paragraph (d)(1)(ii) requires that the employer
assure that all PPE be inspected before initial use during each workshift. This inspection will assist employers
in identifying whether any PPE is not functioning properly so that unserviceable equipment can be repaired or replaced.
This paragraph also requires that before work is commenced, the employer must repair defects or damage, or replace
the PPE. The Agency considers defects and damage to be conditions that detract from the ability of the product to perform
its intended function. For example, worn cuffs on leg protection that do not compromise the ability of the leg protection
to resist chain-saw cuts, is not a defect or damage within the meaning of this standard. However, a cut of the leg protection
and loss of the fibrous material that is used to resist the chain saw would definitely be a defect or damage. When there
is a defect or damage, the PPE must be repaired so that the condition no longer affects the serviceability of the item
or the item must be replaced before work commences.

Discussed below are the specific PPE requirements of the final rule. OSHA notes that each of the requirements of paragraphs
(d)(1)(iv) through (vii) require that the employer assures that the employee wears PPE meeting the requirement of
the final rule. It is the responsibility of the employer to assure that serviceable PPE is available and worn by employees
when required by the final rule. As discussed above in the Major Issues section, with the exception of logging boots,
these specific PPE requirements impose on the employer the obligation to provide such PPE at no cost to the employee.



Gloves



Paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this final rule requires that the employer provide, at no cost to the employee, and assure
that each employee handling wire rope wears cotton gloves or other equivalent hand protection. In the proposed rule,
OSHA specified that the employer provide hand protection consisting of suitable heavy-duty puncture-resistant
gloves when employees were working with wire rope. Several State logging standards also require the use of gloves
for employees working with wire rope (Ex. 2-18, 2-19, 2-20, 2-22, 2-23, 38K). 
OSHA received many comments regarding the proposed requirement (Ex. 5-7, 5-17, 5-20, 5-27,
5-29, 5-30, 5-32, 5-35, 5-39, 5-43, 5-44, 5-45, 5-51, 5-54,
5-55, 5-62, 5-74 through 5-92; Tr. OR 104). Many commenters objected to the requiring the use
of puncture resistant gloves, such as leather gloves, for logging operations. First, commenters argued that there
are no gloves that are puncture resistant in all circumstances (Ex. 5-54; Tr. OR 104). They argued that wire rope
can puncture even leather gloves. Second, several commenters indicated that cotton gloves have become the industry
standard and that their experience had shown that medium weight cotton gloves are considered safer than leather gloves
in logging operations when punctures can occur. According to these commenters, cotton gloves give the logger a better
feel of jaggers (broken wires in a wire rope) when they penetrate so the logger is able to quickly let go of the wire rope
(Ex. 5-17, 5-74 through 5-92). They added that break-away gloves are imperative when the wire rope
travels at high speed and reaction time is critical (Ex. 5-74 through 5-92). They said that cotton gloves,
but not leather gloves, will tear away from the hand when caught by a jagger rather than forcibly pulling the hand along
with the jagger, causing the employee to fall and possibly into the path of the log (Ex. 5-7, 5-74 through
5-92). These commenters argued that pulling of the hand and glove could make a minor hand injury more serious
such as making a small puncture wound a tear or laceration of the skin (Ex. 5-29). Third, one commenter indicated
that cotton gloves provide adequate protection because a review of their recordable accidents since 1982 indicated
that no employee wearing cotton gloves while handling wire rope had suffered an injury requiring medical attention
(Ex. 5-45). Fourth, these commenters said leather gloves are generally considered hazardous for logging operations
because they do not have good gripping ability on cable when wet (Ex. 5-7, 5-20, 5-43, 5-46).
These commenters asserted that cotton gloves provided better gripping ability in the same circumstances. 
Fifth, commenters argued that the required gloves must be applicable and efficient for a wide range of logging activities.
One commenter pointed out that employees who use saws also work with wire rope, and very few will take the time to change
gloves between each operation (Ex. 5-35). For these reasons, OSHA has, in this final rule, changed the requirement
for the use of hand protection to specify that cotton gloves or other equivalent hand protection must be worn when handling
wire rope. 


Leg protection.

 At paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the employer provide, at no cost to the employee,
and assure that each employee who operates a chain saw wears leg protection. This paragraph requires that the leg protection
be comprised of ballistic nylon or other material that the employer demonstrates provides equivalent protection.
In addition, this paragraph requires that the leg protection cover the full length of the thigh to the top of the boot
on each leg. 
The pulpwood logging standard did not have a requirement for the use of chaps or other leg protection. The proposed
rule would have required that chain-saw operators wear ballistic nylon or equivalent protection covering each leg
from upper thigh to boot top or shoe top. Both the State of Washington and the State of Oregon logging standards require
the use of leg protection by chain-saw operators (Ex. 2-22, 38K).

The need for and the use of leg protection was one of the issues raised in the hearing notice and has been discussed above
in the Major Issues section. The evidence in the record, as discussed above, strongly supports the need for a requirement
for leg protection for each chain saw operator in order to protect that operator against being injured by contact with
a moving saw chain. OSHA points out that the requirement for using leg protection applies to each employee who operates
any chain saw at any time on the job. This requirement includes the employee who is a regular chain saw operator as well
as the employee who occasionally uses a chain saw. Some commenters emphasized the need for any employee who uses a chain
saw, even occasionally, to wear leg protection (Tr. W1 193, W2 61, 115). Other commenters said OSHA should provide
an exception for employees who operate chains saws only occasionally (Ex. 5-20, 5-59). The Agency believes
that an employee who operates a chain saw for any duration needs leg protection. OSHA also notes that there were no comments
received saying leg protection was too burdensome for infrequent operators or for short duration use. 
In this paragraph, OSHA also has included an exception to the leg protection requirement for employees working from
bucket trucks and, in some instances, for climbers. OSHA has allowed the exception for those working in bucket trucks,
because the bucket work platform provides the necessary protection for these chain saw operators. 
With regard to climbers, OSHA has retained an exception in the final rule for certain situations. Climbers are not
required to wear leg protection when the employer demonstrates that a greater hazard is posed by wearing leg protection
in the particular situation. As the final rule makes clear, this is not a blanket exception for climbers. The employer
must evaluate the particular situation to determine whether there is a greater risk to the climber by wearing leg protection.
OSHA points out that the employer will bear the burden of demonstrating that leg protection poses a greater hazard
for the climber. OSHA received one comment that said leg protection should not be required because it was a hindrance
during tree climbing (Ex. 5-7). The fact that leg protection may be a ``hindrance'' is not in itself a showing
that leg protection poses a greater danger. When the hindrance is just that climbing goes more slowly when leg protection
is worn, the employer has not made the requisite showing that leg protection poses greater safety hazards. However,
when the employer shows that in wet conditions leg protection would substantially increase the likelihood of falling,
it may be appropriate in that case for the climber to refrain from using leg protection. In such cases, OSHA believes
that alternative methods for protecting the legs, such as light and pliable pads sewn into work pants, should be used
whenever feasible. 


Foot protection. 

At paragraph (d)(1)(v) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the employer assure that each employee wear foot protection,
such as heavy duty logging boots. This provision requires that the foot protection be waterproof or water repellant,
cover and provide support for the ankle, and protect the employee against chain-saw penetration. This paragraph
allows employees to wear sharp, calk-soled boots, or other slip-resistant boots, when the employer demonstrates
that they are necessary for the job, terrain, timber type, or weather conditions. However, this alternative foot
protection must otherwise meet the requirements of this paragraph. 
OSHA notes that when the logging boot itself does not provide protection from penetration by a chain saw, the employee
must use some additional foot protection, such as a foot cover, to provide that necessary protection. Information
in the record indicates such devices are commercially available in the logging industry, therefore, this provision
should not prove burdensome (Ex. 5-14).

Both the proposed and pulpwood logging standards contained provisions requiring that safety boots or shoes (excluding
low cut shoes) meet ANSI Safety Standards for Men's Safety-Toe Footwear. The proposal also would have allowed heavy
duty logging style boots with lug or calk soles to be worn when they are appropriate for the job, the terrain, the timber
type and weather conditions. Several State logging standards also require that employees wear logging boots (Ex.
2-17, 2-19, 2-20, 2-22, 2-23, 38K). 
While there was considerable comment on the proposed safety boot requirement, commenters generally supported the
need for a safety boot provision (Ex. 5-11, 5-17, 5-19, 5-24, 5-27, 5-28, 5-29,
5-33, 5-43, 5-50, 5-51, 5-54, 5-55, 5-63, 5-67, Tr. W1 63, 110, W2 115,
139). OSHA received the most comment on the issue of who must provide and pay for the safety boots. That issue has been
discussed at length above in the Major Issues section. 
OSHA also received considerable comment opposing the incorporation of the ANSI Z41.1 standard on safety shoes (Tr.
W1 147-148). Commenters from cold climate areas, such as Alaska, northern Washington, Idaho and Montana, opposed
the proposed requirement because they contended that the steel toes transmit the warmth produced by their feet, thereby
encouraging the onset of frostbite. 
For several reasons, OSHA has used performance criteria rather than incorporating by reference any foot protection
standard. First, the ANSI standard permits low-cut shoes that do not cover the ankle or provide ankle support. Second,
the ANSI foot protection standard is a testing rule for steel toes of safety shoes. While falling objects may pose a
hazard for logging employees, the greater hazard is penetration of the boot by a chain saw. The ANSI standard does not
address this hazard and it does not provide adequate protection to the entire foot, which is necessary. In addition,
as discussed above, steel-toed boots may cause problems for loggers working in extreme cold. OSHA received comment
about efforts to develop, manufacture and market protective footwear with fiberglass rather than steel toes, but
there is no accepted standard yet. Third, the ANSI standard does not address hazards that are unique to the logging
industry, such as wet conditions and penetration of the boot by a chain saw. Fourth, there is no evidence in the record
of any other consensus standard regarding logging boots. OSHA is aware of efforts by various organizations and associations,
in conjunction with the American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM), to develop test standards for personal
protective equipment that is intended to apply directly to loggers and the logging industry. These standards would
be similar to the various Canadian PPE standards developed by the Safety and Engineering Program Laboratory Services
(IRRST) (Ex. 5-72). 
Instead, the Agency has specified that logging boots that meet certain performance criteria must be worn by each employee.
OSHA has reviewed the rulemaking record and determined some of the most important performance characteristics that
are needed in order to deal with particular hazards that are present in logging operations (e.g., steep and uneven
terrain, wet and cold weather, chain-saw kickback). For example, two hearing participants testified that logging
boots must provide ankle support for the employee (Tr. W1 147, OR 222). Coverage and support of the ankle is necessary
to protect against lacerations and to prevent ankle injury when navigating the rugged terrain that characterizes
much of the logging environment. One commenter also said that logging boots must be waterproof or water repellent
so that the logger would not be exposed to getting trench foot or immersion foot (Tr. W1 147). Finally, commenters said
logging boots must provide protection against penetration by a chain saw if contact is made with the boot (Tr. W1 148,
195, W2 139). 
Several commenters also supported the proposed provision allowing lug or calk-soled boots to be used (Ex. 5-19,
5-28, 5-29). These commenters said that working conditions varied too greatly to require the use of one
type of boot sole for all logging regions. For example, one commenter said that calk boots are considered essential
for safe and secure walking on steep western forest terrain (Ex. 5-28). Another commenter stated that there
are situations in the south where smooth soled boots are adequate (Ex. 5-29). In addition, this commenter said
that there are conditions when calk boots might pose a greater danger, such as a machine operator who is continuously
mounting and dismounting a machine via steel platform steps where the calk boots could result in slipping or falling.
As a result, this commenter said that calk and sharp-soled boots should be limited to those situations when the type
of logging operation, terrain, timber size or weather conditions make their use appropriate. The U.S. Department
of the Interior also commented that calk-soled boots may contribute to certain types of logging injuries, such as
knee injuries (Ex. 5-50). Based on these comments, OSHA specifically allows sharp, calk-soled boots or other
slip-resistant type boots to be worn, provided the employer can demonstrate such boots are needed for the employee's
job, the terrain, the timber type or the weather conditions.

In order for the employer to demonstrate that such footwear is necessary, the employer must prove that three conditions
are met: (1) that the footwear is appropriate for use in the work environment; (2) the employee's duties require him/her
to work where the footwear is needed; and (3) that the use of the alternative footwear does not make the work less safe.
For example, if the area where the logging is being done is moist to wet and has a dense leaf cover, the use of calk-soled
boots (boots with spiked soles) would provide the logger with additional traction when walking and working on that
ground cover. On the other hand, such footwear is not appropriate when a machine operator spends little time working
on the ground (even if the same conditions as described above prevail) since spikes make frequent mounting and demounting
of the machine more hazardous. OSHA recognizes that slips, trips and falls are a major source of injury in the logging
industry, accounting for one third of the injuries to loggers (Ex. 2-1). 

OSHA is also requiring that when an employee wears calk-soled logging boots, the other foot protection requirements
of this paragraph must also be met. OSHA is aware that most calk-soled boots do not have steel-toes or other devices
that prevent penetration by a chain saw. However, OSHA is also aware that calk-soled boots are worn primarily by fellers
and buckers operating chain saws on steep terrain. Evidence in the record indicates that a vast majority of loggers
in western States, where the terrain is steep, wear calk-soled boots (Ex. 2-1). However, even in those States,
almost 20 percent of all injuries reported in the WIR survey involved chain saws. The vast majority of these injuries
happened when the logger was struck by the chain saw. Therefore, OSHA believes that it is necessary that even when an
employee wears calk-soled boots, he must also have foot protection providing protection against chain-saw penetration.
As stated above, when the boot itself does not provide that protection, the employee must wear some other device that
will provide the needed protection. The record shows there are such devices currently available on the market, therefore,
OSHA does not believe this additional requirement will be unduly burdensome (Ex. 5-14). 


Head protection. 

At paragraph (d)(1)(vi) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring each employee who is at risk of injury from falling or flying
objects to wear head protection. The head protection must meet the requirements of newly-revised subpart I of part
1910. Both the pulpwood logging standard and the proposed standard contained head protection requirements. The
pulpwood logging standard had identified the performance criteria that head protection was required to meet, but
did not specifically require employees to wear it. The proposed standard added that requirement and updated the performance
criteria for the required head protection. Several State logging standards also require that employees wear head
protection (Ex. 2-18, 2-19, 2-20, 2-22, 2-23, 38K). 
OSHA did not receive any comments opposing the required use of head protection and has retained the proposed provision
in the final standard. OSHA believes it is important to stress that in the logging industry head protection is necessary
to protect employees not only from falling objects, but also from flying objects. According to the WIR survey, 14 percent
of all injuries reported were to the head (Ex. 2-1). OSHA believes this hazard is present especially for fellers,
chain saw operators and persons performing chipping operations, however, there are other logging operations where
the potential for head injury also exists. 


Eye and face protection. 

Paragraph (d)(1)(vii) of the final rule requires that each employee who works in an area where there is a potential
for injury due to falling or flying object shall wear eye and face protection meeting the requirements of subpart I
of part 1910. This provision permits logger-type mesh screen to be worn when the employer demonstrates it provides
equivalent protection. The proposed rule also contained these provisions. The 1978 ANSI standard contained a similar
requirement. Eye and face protection is also required by several State logging standards (Ex. 2-18, 2-19,
2-22, 2-23, 38K). 
Two commenters said OSHA should require eye protection to be worn only in certain situations (Ex. 5-43 and 5-64).
One commenter stated: 




This is a good rule for some logging activities, such as felling, bucking, splicing, etc.; however, we do not feel that
this is necessary for choker setting and many machine operators, such as yarder, loader, feller-bunchers (Ex. 5-64).

After reviewing the evidence in the record, OSHA believes that a requirement mandating eye and face protection is
necessary. According to the WIR survey, 13 percent of all injuries reported involved the eyes and face (Ex. 2-1).
In the final rule, OSHA is requiring only that such protection be worn whenever there is the potential for head injury
due to falling or flying objects. OSHA agrees with the commenters that the potential for eye and face injury is present
especially for fellers, buckers and chippers, however, there are other logging operations in which the potential
for this type of injury also exists. In any logging operations when there is no danger of being struck by falling or flying
objects, eye protection is not required. 
Employers, under the PPE standard, will have to conduct a hazard assessment to determine when and where those hazards
may exist in the logging workplace. In some cases, the presence of the hazard will be obvious (e.g., fellers and buckers).
In other cases, working conditions may be such that there is no potential for injury (e.g., yarder operator working
inside an enclosed cab). 
As with the head protection provision, OSHA has retained the eye and face protection provision to alert the industry
that falling objects, in addition to flying objects, are a hazard for employees in the logging industry. 




First-Aid Kits 




At paragraph (d)(2) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that employers provide first-aid kits. The proposed standard
contained this provision. First aid kits are also required by every State Plan State logging standard. OSHA did not
receive any comments opposing this requirement in general. 

Paragraph (d)(2)(i) of the final rule requires that first-aid kits be at each work site when felling is being conducted,
at each landing and on each employee transport vehicle. The proposed rule stated that first-aid kits be provided ``at
the work site.'' Several commenters said that OSHA should define the term ``work site'' (Ex. 5-39, 5-53,
5-55, 5-63) in the final rule. They also said that having kits available at the landing should provide adequate
protection. However, another commenter said chain-saw operators working away from the landing need first-aid kits
and should each be required to carry a small first-aid kit that contains supplies to stop bleeding (Ex. 5-28).

In the final rule, OSHA has clarified its intention regarding having first-aid kits at each work site. First, the records
shows that first-aid kits are necessary at each work site when felling is being conducted and not just at landings.
According to the WIR survey, more than one-half of all injuries occurred at the cutting site, while only one-fifth
of the injuries were at landings (Ex. 2-1). OSHA believes that immediate assistance must be provided for injured
cutters. As discussed above in the Major Issues section, many logging establishments have central offices, but their
crews are performing operations miles from that central location. OSHA has received testimony that cutting crews
are often spread out and in remote locations (Ex. 5-34; Tr. OR 21). These commenters said crews are often located
more than one-half hour away from a central office or spread across five square miles. First-aid kits that require
that much time to access are of limited value to an injured employee. When an injury is severe, the lack of immediately
accessible first-aid materials and trained personnel could result in permanent disability or death. Therefore,
OSHA is requiring that first-aid kits be provided at each work site where trees are being felled. 
Second, OSHA is also requiring first-aid kits to be provided at each landing. As discussed above, one-fifth of all
injuries reported in the WIR survey occurred at landings (Ex. 2-1). First-aid kits at landings are also necessary
to provide assistance to other injured employees, such as those on skid trails. According to the WIR survey, nearly
one-fifth of employees injured were on skid trails. 
Third, OSHA is retaining the requirement from the proposed rule that first-aid kits be provided on each crew vehicle.
The WIR survey indicates that employees are injured on employer-built roads while enroute to and from work sites (Ex.
2-1). One commenter stated that requiring first-aid kits on each employee transport vehicle could result in
several kits being at each work site (Ex. 5-35). Nothing in the standard prohibits an employer from using the
employee transport vehicle kits by a felling crew during the workshift, provided they are returned to the crew vehicle
when it is moved at the end of the workshift.

<TEXT>
 

Paragraph (d)(2)(i) of the final rule also requires that the employer, in determining the appropriate number and
contents of first-aid kits, to consider the degree of isolation of the work site, the number of employees at the work
site and the hazards reasonably anticipated at that work site. The further a crew is from a central landing, the more
crucial a first-aid kit is for that remote crew. For example, large and well-supplied first-aid kits are needed where
crews are so remotely located that rescue units (either vehicles or helicopters) cannot get to the injured person
or not get there quickly. When crews are very small and located close to central landings smaller kits may be adequate,
when supplemented by kits at central landing areas that contain a more comprehensive supply of first-aid materials.

Paragraphs (d)(2) (ii), (iii) and (iv) all deal with the adequacy of the contents of first-aid kits. At paragraph (d)(2)(ii)
of the final rule, OSHA has specified that each first-aid kit must meet certain minimum content requirements. Those
minimum content requirements are delineated in mandatory Appendix A. OSHA received comments urging OSHA to specify
the contents needed for an ``adequately supplied'' first-aid kit (Ex. 5-21, 5-28, 5-50, 30). These
commenters also pointed out that several State logging standards specify minimum first-aid content requirements
(Ex. 2-18, 2-21, 2-22, 2-23, 38J, 38K). In addition, one commenter also provided a list of minimum
contents needed for logging first-aid kits. Based on these comments and OSHA's expert judgment, the items listed
in Appendix A are the type necessary for dealing with injured persons in remote areas of varying climatic conditions.
OSHA points out that the specified contents are minimally adequate for a small logging crew of two to three employees.
Where crews are larger, additional kits or kits with more supplies may be needed. In formulating this final rule, OSHA
included Appendix A (First-aid supplies) and Appendix B (First-aid training) to provide the employer with a definitive
means of determining the adequacy of the first-aid kits and the training that employees must receive. 
OSHA has deleted from the final paragraph the proposed requirement that first-aid kits include snake bite kits. OSHA
received several comments about this provision (Ex. 5-7, 5-17, 5-29, 5-35, 5-42, 5-50,
5-51, 5-55, 5-67). One commenter said this requirement should be deleted since there were no poisonous
snakes in his area (Ex. 5-7). Other commenters said that some snake bite kits were not effective in treating bites
or that they are outmoded and can do more damage than good (Ex. 5-17, 5-29, 5-35, 5-42, 5-50,
5-51, 5-55, 5-67). For example, NIOSH said that it is possible more serious injury will occur to a
person by improper use of a snake bite kit (Ex. 5-42). According to the Regional Snake Bite Control Center at the
University Medical Center in Cincinnati, OH, snake bite kits should not be used when medical treatment is available
within one hour of the bite (Ex. 5-42). OSHA has determined that, given the regional differences in the logging
industry, employers should be allowed to work with their health care provider to determine whether a snake bite kit
is necessary and what kind of kit would be of most assistance for loggers working in that area. One of the factors the
health care provider should consider is how far particular loggers are from medical facilities and trained medical
personnel.

<TEXT>
 

Paragraph (d)(2)(iii) requires a health care provider to review and approve annually the first-aid kits the employer
provides, both as to the adequacy of the kit's contents and the number of kits provided. OSHA has added this requirement
in the final rule for several reasons. First, 1910.151(b) already requires that first-aid kits be approved by consulting
physicians. OSHA is aware that health care providers in addition to physicians are qualified to approve first-aid
kits and OSHA wants to provide flexibility for employers in meeting this requirement. Second, 1910.151(b) only requires
initial approval of first-aid kits rather than periodic approval. However, OSHA believes that a periodic review
of first-aid kits is necessary and appropriate in the logging industry. This industry is one in which the workplace
is often not near medical personnel, infirmaries, clinics, or hospitals that are best able to treat logging injuries.
Therefore, it is important for a health care provider to assess the contents of first-aid kits to see that they contain
those supplies that will provide effective assistance for an injured worker. 

Once the kits are reviewed and approved, paragraph (d)(2)(iv) requires the employer to maintain the first-aid kits
in accordance with the approval conditions. Employers have the duty to ensure that first-aid kits are adequately
supplied and replenished as necessary. In addition, the employer is responsible for assuring that kit contents are
usable, that is, there is no spoilage or damage due to weather conditions. For example, employers need to periodically
check first-aid supplies to ensure that materials are still in clean and sterile condition. 



Seat Belts 



At paragraph (d)(3) of the final standard, OSHA is requiring the provision of seat belts for the operator of any vehicle
or any machine equipped with ROPS or FOPS and the use of seat belts by the vehicle and machine operator and passengers.
The pulpwood logging standard required the provision of seat belts on mobile equipment, but did not require the use
of seat belts by operators and passengers. The proposed rule required both the provision and use of seat belts by tractor,
equipment and personnel transport operators. In addition, the proposed rule allowed an exception to using seat belts
when the employer had ``reasonable cause to believe that safety of the operator is jeopardized by wearing a seat belt.''
The 1978 ANSI logging standard required logging machines to be equipped with seat belts. All State logging standards
also require the use of seat belts by operators and passengers of machines and vehicles. 

OSHA received many comments on the use of seat belts (Ex. 5-17, 5-19, 5-22, 5-35, 5-39,
5-45, 5-51, 5-54, Tr. W1 79, 113, 183, 213). The West Virginia Forestry Association recommended
expanding the seat belt requirement to require seat belts be installed and used in all personnel transport vehicles
because West Virginia did not have a state seat belt law (Ex. 5-4). Other commenters also recommended that OSHA
not permit any exceptions to the use of seat belts (Ex. 5-17, 5-22, 5-27, Tr. W1 183, 213). One commenter
reasoned that any exception would invite widespread abuse and seriously weaken OSHA's field enforcement capability
(Ex. 5-22). However, other commenters said that seat belts should not be required because they would unduly
restrict operators, would result in greater injury if an object entered the operator area (i.e., ``jillpoke''),
and would be hazardous for employees operating machines on steep terrain (Ex. 5-35, 5-45; Tr. W1 79, 113,
OR 31-2, 83, 120, 181). 

After reviewing the comments in the record and the available accident data, OSHA has decided in the final rule to eliminate
the seat belt exception for several reasons. First, the record shows that use of seat belts would save lives in the logging
industry (Ex. 4-129). A State of Washington study also reported 12 loggers killed in rollover accidents from
1977-83 (Ex. 4-129). All 12 of those employees were crushed by the machine when they were thrown from the
cab. This study concluded that all of those deaths might have been prevented if the employees involved had been wearing
seat belts because the ROPS and FOPS were still intact when the machine came to a rest. This study also concluded that
eliminating exemptions on seat belt use would save lives in the logging industry.

<TEXT>
 

Second, the record does not support the view that the operator's risk of being injured by a jillpoke entering the cab
is greater than the risk of injury from not wearing seat belts. Of the 105 logging fatalities reported to OSHA between
1985 and 1990, only one was caused by a jillpoke (Ex. 4-65). On the other hand, 7 fatalities occurred during machine
rollover accidents when either the machine operator or a rider was thrown from the machine and crushed because he was
not wearing a seat belt. NIOSH said that 80 deaths occurred due to logging machine rollovers from 1980-85 (Ex.
5-42). The State of Washington study indicated that 12 loggers were killed in machine rollover accidents and
no machine operators were killed during that period because of jillpokes (Ex. 4-129). California OSHA also
testified that their experience has been that the jillpoke hazard is far outweighed by the hazard of rollovers (Ex.
9-12). They provided examples of logging accidents in which the employee would not have died or been injured
if he had been wearing a seat belt. 


Third, OSHA has dealt directly with the hazard of jillpokes in the final rule. The final rule requires that all operator
cabs be equipped with screening or other material that will prevent objects from penetrating the cab. This requirement
is expected to prevent jillpoke injuries, therefore the seat belt exception is not necessary. 


Fourth, OSHA agrees with commenters that there should be no exception to the seat belt requirement for mobile machine
operators, especially those who operate on steep terrain. Mobile logging machines are operated on unlevel ground
and steep terrain where it is well-recognized that machine rollover and tipover is a primary danger. Seat belts will
restrain the operator in the cab and its protective structure rather than allowing the operator to try to jump free.
In most instances, when the operator tries to jump free he is pinned, crushed or hit by the machine, ROPS/FOPS or overhead
guard. Finally, OSHA notes that seat belts have been designed that keep operators restrained within the cab in the
event of a rollover or tipover, while at the same time providing them with maximum movement within the cab. One commenter
said these seat belts, which resemble carnival harnesses, have been designed by the Forest Engineering Research
Institute of Canada (Ex. 32). These seat belts would meet the requirements of this section while addressing the concerns
raised by the commenters. 


Paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of the final rule requires that each employee fasten the seat belt securely and tightly so that
the employee is restrained in the vehicle or machine cab in the event of an accident. Evidence in this record (Ex. 5-35;
Tr. W2 190) indicates that employees frequently keep their seat belts loose in order to move in the cab more easily.
However, if the machine rolls over, the loose seat belt may not be effective in keeping the operator in the cab. In such
cases, the operator may be thrown from the cab and pinned or crushed by the machine because the seat belt was too loose
to keep the operator fully contained in the cab. 


Paragraph (d)(3)(iv) of the final rule requires that machine seat belts meet the requirements of the Society of Automotive
Engineers standard (SAE J386 June 1985) for seat belts for construction machines. This incorporation by reference
of SAE J386 June 1985, has been approved by the Office of the Federal Register, in accordance with the requirements
of 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR Part 51. The final rule has been revised to reflect this approval and provides the requisite
information regarding access to the text of SAE J386, June 1985. This provision updates the proposed standard to incorporate
the latest SAE seat belt standard. There were no comments opposing this provision. 


Paragraph (d)(3)(v) of the final rule requires employers to assure that seat belts are not removed from any vehicle
or machine. This paragraph also requires the employer to replace the missing seat belts if seat belts were installed
in the vehicle or machine at the time of manufacture and have subsequently been removed. OSHA is aware that seat belts
are removed from machines because operators do not like to wear them. OSHA is requiring the replacement of seat belts
because the Agency believes they are essential in protecting machine and vehicle operators from being killed or seriously
injured in accidents. 


Paragraph (d)(3)(vi) of the final standard requires 
employers to assure that seat belts are maintained in a 
serviceable condition. Employers have the duty to ensure that seat belts are functioning properly and are not damaged.
The standard also requires inspection of seat belts as part of the general machine and vehicle inspection required
at the start of each workshift. (See discussion of maintenance in paragraphs (f) and (g)). 




Fire Extinguishers

At paragraph (d)(4) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring employers to provide and maintain a portable fire extinguisher
on each machine and vehicle. The extinguisher must meet the requirements of subpart L of part 1910. The pulpwood logging
and proposed standards required a fire extinguisher at locations where machines and vehicles are being operated.



Several commenters urged OSHA to limit this requirement (Ex. 5-21, 5-36, 5-39). Two of these commenters
said that fire extinguishers should only be required on heavy equipment and at refueling stations (Ex. 5-21,
5-36). The other commenter said fire extinguishers should only be required during forest fire seasons. 


OSHA has decided in the final rule to require extinguishers on each machine and vehicle for several reasons. First,
repeatedly in this rulemaking commenters have requested that OSHA more clearly define what constitutes a ``work
site,'' an ``operating area,'' or a ``work area.'' OSHA's intention in the proposed rule was that a fire extinguisher
be located where 

each 

machine and vehicle is operated, including areas where they are refueled. OSHA believes that requiring the fire extinguisher
be located on each machine most clearly conveys the Agency's intention that the fire extinguisher move with the machine
or vehicle as it is operated and refueled. 


Second, the potential for fire is a major concern in this industry (Ex. 5-20). It is important that extinguishers
be immediately available so that a fire can be extinguished before it goes out of control and endangers employees and
the forest. A fire extinguisher that is located at a landing where the machine begins its operation, may be of no use
when the machine is miles away from the landing picking up a load. 


Third, one of the areas where the potential for fire is great is during refueling of the machine. However, the proposed
standard only required the extinguisher to be located where machines and vehicles were being operated and did not
address refueling directly. If the extinguisher remains with the machine or vehicle, it will be there to protect against
fire hazards during refueling. 


Fourth, OSHA is aware that in many industrial settings, the extinguisher is already mounted on the machine or vehicle
so that it is immediately accessible when a fire occurs. Therefore, OSHA does not believe complying with this requirement
will pose a significant burden on the employer. 




Environmental Conditions 




At paragraph (d)(5) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that all work be stopped and that each employee move to a place
of safety when environmental conditions may endanger an employee in the performance of their job. This provision
also specifies that hazardous environmental conditions include, but are not limited to, electrical storms, high
winds, heavy rain or snow, extreme cold, dense fog, fires, mudslides, and darkness. The pulpwood logging and proposed
rules contained a similar provision, however, it only specifically identified electrical storms and high winds.
The 1978 ANSI logging standard also contained a similar requirement and, in addition, required logging operations
to cease when visibility is inadequate, unless artificial lighting is provided. All State logging standards, except
the State of Alaska, have provisions requiring work to cease when environmental conditions are hazardous to employees.



OSHA received several comments on this provision (Ex. 5-50, 5-51, 5-55, 5-66; Tr. W1 139).
Some of these commenters recommended expanding the conditions listed in this provision. These commenters also said
logging should be stopped when darkness impairs visual ability, unless artificial light is provided. One commenter
said they do not allow their employees to work in blowing snow, extreme cold or winds (Ex. 5-51). Another commenter
said OSHA should specify that the work stoppage requirement should be limited to only that work that is affected by
the environmental conditions (Ex. 5-55; Tr. W1 139). 


OSHA does not believe it is possible to delineate each and every environmental condition that would necessitate termination
of work and moving employees to a place of safety. OSHA is aware that the employer's judgment will be essential in carrying
out this provision in the various environmental conditions that affect different regions of this industry. However,
the criteria that must form the basis of the employer's assessment is uniform_when a reasonable employer would believe
that environmental conditions may endanger employees performing a specific job or operating a specific piece of
equipment, work must stop and the employees must move to a place of safety. For example, darkness may prevent a feller
from accurately assessing the distance between occupied work areas or the condition of the tree to be cut (e.g., loose
bark, damaged trunk or limbs). If the feller is not able to properly assess these conditions, he may endanger himself
and others in the area. Therefore, work would have to stop unless artificial light were available to alleviate the
danger. 


Another element of the determination as to whether an environmental condition may endanger an employee is the particular
job being performed and the tools of that job. For example, dense fog may endanger a feller because they may not be able
to see the top of the tree and accurately judge its lean. If such conditions exist, felling must be stopped. However,
fog may not necessarily endanger employees who are loading transport vehicles at a landing. In that case, the employees
might still be able to perform their job under such conditions.

Work Areas 



At paragraph (d)(6) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that work areas be so organized and spaced that the actions
of one employee will not create a hazard for any other employee. This paragraph also requires that each employee work
in a position or location that is within visual or audible contact with another employee. These provisions were adopted
from the proposed standard. The pulpwood logging and 1978 ANSI logging standards also recommended a two tree-length
distance between work areas. Requirements similar to the final rule exist in various State logging standards (Ex.
2-17, 2-18, 2-19, 2-20, 2-21, 2-22, 2-23, 38J, 38K). 

At paragraph (d)(6)(ii) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that work areas be assigned so that trees cannot fall into
adjacent occupied work areas. This provision also requires that the distance between adjacent occupied work areas
be at least two tree lengths of the trees being felled. The proposed rule and the 1978 ANSI logging standard contained
similar requirements. 

OSHA received comments supporting this provision (Ex. 5-29, 5-41, 5-67, 5-70; Tr. W2 163).
These commenters said that two tree lengths is already used in the industry to ensure safe spacing of work areas. Some
commenters, however, said that the provision should be limited (Ex. 5-28, 5-36, 5-39, 5-44,
5-49, 5-53, 5-54, 5-63, 5-74 through 5-92). One commenter said OSHA should require
minimum spacing requirements only when physical control of the timber was unpredictable, such as felling and skidding
(Ex. 5-28). Other commenters recommended that the requirement be limited to slopes that are greater than 25
or 35 percent (Ex. 5-21, 5-36, 5-39, 5-63). 

The purpose of these requirements is to protect employees in adjacent occupied work areas from being hit by misdirected
trees. One of the major causes of injury in the logging industry is being hit by a tree. According to the WIR survey, almost
one-quarter of all those injured were hit by a tree (Ex. 2-1). The State of Washington study showed that more than
65 percent of all employees were killed when they were hit by a tree or log (Ex. 4-129). In addition, the study showed
that almost nine percent of that reported fatalities resulted from an employee being hit by a tree being felled by another
employee (Ex. 4-129). 

Employees can be hit by a tree that falls in the wrong direction or by one that rolls or slides down sloping terrain. There
is no dispute that there is increased difficulty in directional felling on unlevel terrain. OSHA believes that these
work spacing requirements in the final rule will help to prevent these types of accidents. Moreover, adopting any
of the limitations that the commenters proposed would still leave employees exposed to other foreseeable hazards.
Since the two tree-length distance has become accepted practice in the industry, it appears that industry itself
recognizes the need for a minimum work spacing requirement and that the provision should not prove overly burdensome
for any establishments in the industry. 

In paragraph (d)(6)(ii) of the final rule OSHA is also requiring that employers assess conditions to determine whether
additional spacing between adjacent occupied work areas is necessary. Some of the conditions that employers must
examine include the degree of slope, the density of the growth, the height of trees, the soil structure, and other hazards
reasonably anticipated at that work site. This paragraph also requires that additional distance be maintained between
adjacent occupied work areas on any slope where rolling or sliding of logs is reasonably foreseeable. These provisions
were also contained in the proposed rule and in various State logging standards (Ex. 2-17, 2-18, 2-19,
2-20, 2-22, 38J, 38K). The 1978 ANSI logging standard also contained a similar requirement. 

Some commenters said greater distance should only be required when the slope is greater than 25 or 35 percent (Ex. 5-21,
5-36, 5-39, 5-63). These commenters, however, did not provide any information on why such a limitation
would provide adequate protection for employees. OSHA does not agree that greater distance may only be necessary
on such steep slopes. OSHA believes there is a potential for trees and logs to roll and slide on lesser slopes when conditions
such as snow and ice accumulation or wet soil are present. Therefore, OSHA does not believe that adequate protection
would be provided if the commenters' recommendation were adopted.

<TEXT>
 

Other commenters said that a greater distance on slopes should not be required when employees are working to the side
of each other, pointing out that the Alaska logging standard allows this (Ex. 5-74 through 5-92). OSHA
believes that the final standard is consistent with the Alaska logging standard. The final rule only requires that
a greater distance is required on any slope where rolling or sliding of trees or logs is reasonably foreseeable. Nothing
in the final rule requires a greater distance on slopes when there is no danger that an employee could be hit by a rolling
or sliding log. For example, when employees work side by side on a slope, rather than uphill and downhill from each other,
there is no danger that the employee will be injured by a rolling log. 

At paragraph (d)(6)(iii), OSHA is requiring that each employee, without exception, be located within visual or audible
contact of another worker. This provision must be read in conjunction with the requirements in paragraph (d)(7) specifying
what methods of audible contact may be used (i.e., not chain-saw engine noise). This requirement parallels the proposed
standard, however the proposed rule did not apply this requirement to motor vehicle operators, watchmen and other
single employee assignment jobs. The pulpwood logging standard required that employees work within the vocal range
of other loggers but also allowed employers to use an alternative procedure that provided for periodic checks of employee
welfare. 

Much of the comment on this requirement has already been discussed in the Major Issues section above. Some commenters
opposed various aspects of this provision (Ex. 5-29, 5-36, 5-39, 5-49, 5-53, 5-54,
5-67, 5-70, 5-74 through 5-92; Tr. W1 65). One commenter recommended allowing manual fellers
to be out of contact with other employees, such as skidder operators, for up to 20 minutes (Ex. 5-54). This commenter
said that was the amount of time necessary to transport a load to the landing and return to the cutting area. However,
the commenter has not provided any information or data to support why such an exception would still allow for adequate
protection for fellers. OSHA does not believe that permitting periods of time in which contact is not maintained will
provide adequate protection for employees. A chain-saw operator who severely cuts himself could bleed to death within
20 minutes. 

Other commenters opposed this provision because it would be difficult to comply with this requirement and maintain
the required two tree-length separation between adjacent work areas (Ex. 5-29, Tr. W1 pg 65). For several reasons,
OSHA believes employers will be able to comply with both requirements. First, this paragraph requires each employee
to be within visual or audible contact with ``another'' employee. It does not require that the person with whom contact
is maintained be in an adjacent work area. Second, the provision requiring at least two tree-length spacing between
adjacent occupied work areas is intended to prevent trees from falling from one work area into another. The purposes
of a visual or audible contact is to provide a method for employees to remain in contact in case of an emergency (e.g.,
a chain-saw operator requesting first aid after being cut by the saw, an employee alerting others of severe weather
approaching). Therefore, if employees are provided with radio communication, it would be possible for employees
whose work areas are spaced far apart to maintain contact with each other. 

Third, as discussed above in the issues section, the final rule does not require that visual contact be maintained.
Instead, audible contact may be maintained by the use of horns, whistles or radio communication. As such, employees
can be great distances from each other and still remain in contact satisfying the requirements of this provision.
Fourth, OSHA is also aware that many logging establishments are currently using radio communication to maintain
contact, that is the best evidence of its effectiveness.

As stated above, in this paragraph OSHA has eliminated all proposed exceptions to the requirement of maintaining
contact with another employee. As discussed above in the Major Issues section, OSHA has eliminated the proposed exceptions
for several reasons. First, various State standards do not include an exception to the contact requirement (Ex. 2-17,
2-18, 2-19, 2-20, 2-21, 2-22, 38J, 38K). Second, several commenters supported the proposal
that all employees remain in contact and indicated that they do maintain contact with all employees, including employees
in single employee assignments, via radio and telephone (Ex. 5-74 through 5-92). As a result, these commenters
suggested the exceptions may no longer be necessary (See also, Ex. 5-33). These commenters also reasoned that
all employees, including mobile machine operators performing single employee assignments, need a method of summoning
help in an emergency. OSHA agrees with these commenters. The Agency believes that the contact requirement will help
to provide prompt assistance to all employees who are injured or are otherwise in emergency situations. As discussed
above in the Major Issues section, with the advent of radio communication, it is feasible to maintain contact with
workers performing single employee assignments. 

OSHA notes that it is implied in this provision that not only will means for contact be provided, but also that contact
will be maintained with each employee. All but one State logging standard require check-in systems to assure that
contact is maintained (Ex. 2-17, 2-18, 2-19, 2-20, 2-21, 38J, 38K). In addition, several
commenters say they have initiated check-in systems to assure that employees working in remote locations are all
right. 

At paragraph (d)(6)(iv) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring the employer to account for each employee at the end of
the workshift. OSHA has adopted this provision from the pulpwood logging and the proposed standards. The 1978 ANSI
logging standard also contained a similar requirement. Several State logging standards also require check-in systems
at the end of the workshift to ensure no employees are left in the woods (Ex. 2-17, 2-18, 2-19, 2-20,
38K). Several commenters said that it was not necessary for small felling and bucking crews to be accounted for by anyone
other than the crew members (Ex. 5-21, 5-36, 5-39, 5-53, 5-63). In response, OSHA points
out that nothing in the final rule would prevent the employer from allowing a crew supervisor, for example, to account
for the rest of the crew at the end of the workshift. In such cases, the employer is responsible for establishing and
enforcing a regular system whereby there is a check on each employee at the end of the workshift. The most important
thing is that no employee is unaccounted for at the close of the shift. As with the contact requirement, OSHA believes
that this provision will help to assure timely assistance to employees in emergencies. 

In addition, end of shift accounting offers several other benefits to the employer and employee. First, the employer
can remain appraised of the progress made on the job during the last workshift. Second, any hazardous conditions that
were not contemplated during pre-shift meetings with employees can be relayed to the employer for dissemination
to other employees. Third, unserviceable tools and machines can be reported to the employer so that replacements
can be obtained or repairs can made before the next workshift. Therefore, OSHA has retained this provision in the final
standard. 

Several commenters said this provision would interfere with contracting situations when the logger is an independent
contractor (Ex. 5-21, 5-23, 5-36, 5-53, 5-55, 5-63). However, they did not provide
any evidence as to how this provision might conflict with contracting agreements. 


Signaling and Signal Equipment 



At paragraph (d)(7)(i) of this final rule, OSHA is requiring that hand or audible signals such as whistles, horns,
or radios, be utilized whenever noise, distance or other factors prevent clear understanding of normal voice communications
between employees. Paragraph (d)(7)(ii) prohibits the use of engine noise, such as from chains saws, as a means of
maintaining contact. These provisions supplement and support the requirement for the maintenance of audible or
visual contact contained in paragraph (d)(6)(iii). The proposed rule also contained a contact requirement. However,
it would not have prohibited the use of chain-saw noise as a means of signaling. The 1978 ANSI logging standard also
contained a requirement similar to the proposed rule. Several State logging standards also prohibit the use of chain-saw
noise as a signaling device (Ex. 2-22, 2-23, 38K). The Washington State logging 
standard requires fellers to carry whistles, which are to be used for no other purpose than to summon help (Ex. 2-22,
5-7).

OSHA received many comments on this provision opposing the prohibition of chain-saw noise as a signaling device,
that have been discussed above in the Major Issues section. Other commenters supported the provision, focusing their
comments on allowing communication devices such as telephones and radios in the final rule (Ex. 5-54, 5-70,
7-74; Tr. W2 197). One of these commenters supported the provision because the use of electronic communication,
such as citizen band radios, makes controlling trainees easier (Tr. W2 197). Another commenter supported the use
of whistles for signalling because they produce a very unusual sound in the woods that can be heard for a great distance
(Ex. 5-7). 
In general, there are two principal safety-related needs for a signalling system in logging operations. The first
is for the maintenance of communication between employees working in adjacent occupied work areas, both to warn other
employees of potential hazardous situations and to summon help in an emergency. The second need for a signaling system
is to provide guidance to the operators of machines and vehicles, such as cranes and other material handling machines,
when work site conditions prevent operators from seeing and controlling the operation. For example, if a crane is
used to move a load from below an overhang such as a cliff, a signal person might be needed to observe the load and to signal
the crane operator when and how to move the load. 
As discussed above in the Major Issues section, paragraph (d)(7)(ii) of the final rule prohibits the use of engine
noise as a signaling device. This paragraph does permit other locally and regionally recognized signals to be used.
This provision has been adopted from the proposed rule and the 1978 ANSI logging standard. OSHA did not receive any
comments opposing the use of locally or regionally recognized signals, therefore, the Agency has retained this provision
in the final rule. 
At paragraph (d)(7)(iii) of the final rule, OSHA has added a provision requiring that only designated persons give
signals except in an emergency. The proposed rule and the 1978 ANSI logging standard also contained this requirement.
Several State standards also require that only designated persons give signals (Ex. 2-18, 2-21, 2-22,
38K). As defined in this standard, a designated person is one who has the necessary knowledge, training and experience
to perform specific job tasks. OSHA did not receive any comments opposing this provision. 
OSHA has included this provision in the final rule for several reasons. First, OSHA believes that the signaling system
should be included in the employer's training-program so that employees who are called upon to act as signal persons
will know how to signal appropriately. This is especially important when an employee performs signaling to assist
with the safe operation or movement of a machine or load. It is also important that employees know the appropriate signals
in the event that help must be summoned. The employee requiring help needs to know what means are to be used to communicate
the necessary information and how to use those means of communication properly. In addition, other employees must
be trained in what they should listen for so they can avoid potential hazards or provide assistance. Second, OSHA believes
that employees without the necessary training should not be permitted to act as a signal person for assisting with
the operation and movement of machines and loads. When the signal person has not been adequately trained, the risk
of harm to the signal person, the machine operator and other employees in the vicinity is great. Third, the use of trained
signal persons should reduce the potential for conflicting signals that could create a hazard.

Overhead Electric Lines 


At paragraph (d)(8)(i) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that logging operations near overhead electric lines
be done in accordance with the requirements of 1910.333(c)(3). The proposed rule repeated some of the requirements
of 1910.333(c)(3). The pulpwood logging standard did not contain any provision regarding overhead electric wires.
All State logging standards contain restrictions regarding felling near power lines. 
One comment was received addressing minimum clearance from overhead lines (Ex. 5-34). This commenter suggested
that when the line voltage is unknown and other information indicates that the line is obviously high voltage, a minimum
clearance of 20 feet must be maintained from the line until the line voltage is established by the electrical system
operator. The separation distance recommended by the commenter would provide clearance that would only be warranted
by a 350 KV line. OSHA believes that maintenance of that great a separation distance is unnecessary in this rule. High
voltage lines of this order of magnitude are usually on tall transmission towers, therefore it is highly unlikely
any employee would come in contact with the line or have any means of getting near the line. 
OSHA believes that 1910.333(c)(3) adequately spells out the precautions and clearances that must be taken when working
near overhead lines. OSHA finds nothing indicating that logging is different from the rest of general industry, therefore,
the Agency does not believe a special provision is necessary to address the logging industry. 
At paragraph (d)(8)(ii) OSHA is requiring the employer to immediately notify the power company when any felled tree
comes into contact with a power line. This provision also requires each employee to remain clear of the area until the
power company advises there are no electrical hazards. OSHA has adopted this provision from the proposed standard.
OSHA did not receive any comments on this provision. 


Flammable and Combustible Liquids 


At paragraph (d)(9) of the final rule, OSHA is including requirements for the safe handling and use of flammable and
combustible liquids. As was proposed, the final rule requires such liquids to be stored, handled, transported and
used in accordance with subpart H of Part 1910. 
Two commenters opposed this provision (Ex. 5-7, 5-34). One commenter stated: 



After carrying a 40 pound saw, lunch, water, wedges and wrenches, the last thing the timber faller wants to add is more
weight. So when he goes to carry fuel and oil it's normally carried in labeled plastic containers, generally in sizes
not exceeding two quarts. To carry fuel in approved containers would do nothing more than add back injuries to the statistics
(Ex. 5-7). 



In response, OSHA points out that there are approved plastic storage containers available in small sizes, such as
two quart containers. Nothing in the final rule or subpart H of part 1910 prohibits employers from using small plastic
storage containers, provided they meet the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.106. Further under 29 CFR 1910.106, the maximum
allowable size of approved plastic fuel container is one gallon. OSHA does not believe that carrying one gallon or
less of fuel in a plastic container will substantially increase back injuries. 
At paragraph (d)(9)(ii) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that flammable and combustible liquids not be transported
in the driver's compartment or in any passenger-occupied area of a machine or vehicle. OSHA is aware that pick-up trucks
are often used to transport employees to a logging work site. Transportation of flammable and combustible liquids
in the passenger compartment of these vehicles exposes the driver and passenger to fire and explosion hazards and
is not a safe practice. 
At paragraph (d)(9)(iii) of the final rule, OSHA is 
requiring that each machine, vehicle and portable powered tool, such as chain saw, be shut off during refueling. OSHA
has added this requirement because it believes that when handling flammable and combustible liquids, it is essential
to eliminate sources of ignition. The requirement to shut off the engines of motor vehicles when they are refueled
is mandatory in most states and is clearly posted in service stations. Because OSHA believes that it is essential to
minimize the sources of ignition when refueling vehicles, the Agency has retained the requirement as proposed. 
At paragraph (d)(9)(iv) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that flammable or combustible liquids not be used to start
fires. The proposed rule contained a requirement that chain saw fuel not be used to start fires. While several commenters
supported this requirement (Ex. 5-21, 5-36, 5-74 through 5-92), other commenters, including
the State of Washington, opposed the provision (Ex. 5-34, 5-66). They said that loggers would use whatever
material they have to start a fire rather than losing production time to return to a vehicle to obtain materials. In
addition, the State of Washington said they were not aware of any injuries occurring as a result of this practice.

OSHA has carefully considered these comments. OSHA understands that in cold weather employees must be able to warm
their hands and feet to prevent frostbite and to maintain proper grip of tools. However, OSHA believes that the use
of a flammable liquid, such as gasoline, to start a fire can quickly result in an uncontrolled fire that endangers the
loggers and others in the vicinity. Other commenters have told OSHA about the dangers of fires, especially during
the dry season (Ex. 5-7, 5-21, 5-39). In particular, when an area is cold and wet, gasoline will not
volatilize or burn rapidly. However, as the fire gains intensity, the gasoline will evaporate more rapidly, causing
the fire to suddenly flame up and can rapidly get out of control. Instead of using gasoline or a gasoline mixture, there
are products available that are not combustible to start fires, such as fire starters comprised of sawdust and wax.
These products are small, light weight and will not suddenly accelerate their combustion. 
OSHA has deleted from the final rule the proposed requirement that chain-saw fuel not be used as a solvent. Two commenters
said that chain-saw fuel is recommended by manufacturer's as a cleaning solvent for chain-saws (Ex. 5-7, 5-34).
For example, manufacturers' specifications indicate that chain-saw fuel is the most effective solvent for cleaning
chain-saw air filters. OSHA agrees with the commenters and has eliminated the prohibition from the final rule. 


Explosives and Blasting Agents 


At paragraph (d)(10) of the final standard, OSHA is including requirements on the safe use of explosives and blasting
agents. Paragraph (d)(10)(i) of the final requires that explosives and blasting agents be stored, handled, transported
and used in accordance with the requirements of subpart H of this part. This provision has been adopted from the proposed
rule. The 1978 ANSI logging standard contained a similar requirement. All State logging standards contain requirements
on the use of explosives and blasting agents. There were no comments opposing this provision. 
Paragraph (d)(10)(ii) of the final rule requires that only designated persons handle or use such materials. As discussed
above, a designated person is one who possesses the requisite training, knowledge and experience to perform the specific
duties. The proposed rule and the 1978 ANSI logging standard also required that explosives only be handled by trained
and experienced personnel. All State logging standards also require that only trained employees handle explosives.
OSHA did not receive any comments on these provisions. 
At paragraph (d)(10)(iii) of the final standard, OSHA is requiring that explosives and blasting agents not be transported
in the driver compartment or any passenger-occupied area of a machine or vehicle. The proposed rule did not contain
a similar requirement. OSHA has added this provision in the final rule for the same reason that it included a similar
provision regarding flammable and combustible liquids. OSHA believes that employees may be gravely endangered
by riding over rough terrain and trails in close proximity to explosives. 


Paragraph (e) Hand and Portable Powered Tools


Paragraph (e) of this final rule contains requirements for the safe use of hand and portable powered tools, including
chain saws. For the most part, these requirements were derived from corresponding provisions in the pulpwood logging
standard. 
In the final rule OSHA has combined provisions regarding both hand tools and chain saws. This was done to provide uniformity
in how tools are addressed in the logging standard. In addition, OSHA has combined these provisions to reduce duplicative
provisions, such as those dealing with maintenance and inspection of tools.

General Requirements 





Paragraph (e)(1) deals with general requirements for all hand and portable powered tools. At paragraph (e)(1)(i)
of the final rule, OSHA is requiring employers to assure that each hand and portable powered tool is maintained in serviceable
condition. This employer responsibility applies whether the tool is provided by the employer or employee. This paragraph
adopts the proposed provision. All State logging standards contain similar requirements about the maintenance
of logging tools. 



OSHA received several comments on this provision (Ex. 5-35, 5-39, 5-53, 5-54, 5-62,
5-63, 5-66). These commenters supported the need for tools to be properly maintained. One commenter said
that lack of proper maintenance of chain saws contributes to a number of accidents (Ex. 5-35). However, most
of the commenters stated that the maintenance of tools that are supplied by employees should be the employees' responsibility
(Ex. 5-35, 5-53, 5-54, 5-62, 5-63, 5-66). 



One commenter stated:






We feel that it is not reasonable and it is burdensome to logging companies to have to be responsible for the condition
and safety of an 

employee's own tools.

 We feel very strongly that there should be a recognition of one's individual responsibility in this area. A more general
statement might be appropriate in this item simply stating that ``tools shall be properly maintained so as to assure
safe operation and shall be used only for their intended purpose and design'' (Ex. 5-39).






OSHA does not agree with these commenters. OSHA believes that the Agency's reasoning in including a maintenance provision
in the PPE section applies here as well (See summary and explanation of paragraph (d)(1)(i)). The requirement for
employers to assure that tools are maintained in a serviceable condition does not prohibit the employer from allowing
an employee to inspect, maintain and repair tools he provides. The employer's responsibilities for compliance with
standards and for safe working conditions that the OSH Act imposes, applies even if the employee provides the tools.




This paragraph is meant to be viewed in conjunction with paragraph (e)(1)(ii), that requires inspection of tools
before they are used in each workshift. As discussed above, ``serviceable condition'' is the state or ability of a
tool to operate as it was intended by the manufacturer. 



At paragraph (e)(1)(ii), OSHA is requiring that the employer assure that each tool is inspected before initial use
during each work shift. This paragraph also specifies the minimum elements to be inspected, such as chain brakes,
handles, guards, and controls, to assure that the tools are functioning properly. In the proposed standard, OSHA
specified that hand tools be checked during use to ensure continued serviceability. The proposed rule also required
chain saws to be ``frequently'' inspected. The proposed rule also contained elements that must be included in hand
tool inspections. The 1978 ANSI logging standard also required periodic inspection of tools. 



OSHA received comments on these provisions. Some commenters recommended that OSHA establish the frequency that
tools, such as chain saws, should be inspected (Ex. 5-21, 5-36, 5-39, 5-53). One commenter
objected to inspection of chain saws:






The need for chain saws to be ``frequently inspected'' should be clarified further. How often is frequently and who
would be responsible for the inspections? (Ex. 5-39).






OSHA believes that the final rule adequately addresses the commenter's concerns. First, OSHA explicitly identifies
the required frequency for inspection of tools. Second, nothing in the final rule prohibits the employer from allowing
the tool user or operator to conduct the workshift inspection, provided that such inspection and the required content
of the inspection are accomplished in the manner and time frame specified by OSHA. Finally, the standard specifies
the minimum elements that must be covered by the inspection. 



At paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the employer assure that each tool is used only for
purposes for which it has been designed. OSHA has adopted the provision from the proposed rule. The 1978 ANSI logging
standard also contained this requirement. OSHA received only one comment on this provision that supported its inclusion
(Ex. 5-39).

At paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that when the head of any shock, impact-driven or driving
tool begins to chip, it shall be repaired or removed from service. The proposed rule would have required that tools
be repaired when ``any mushrooming'' occurs. A similar requirement was contained in the 1978 ANSI logging standard.




The State of Washington opposed the proposed provision, stating that the language was too restrictive (Ex. 5-34,
9-10). The State said that as soon as a plastic wedge if firmly struck there will be some small amount of mushrooming.
In the final rule, OSHA has clarified this provision by requiring that the tool be repaired or removed from service
when it begins to chip. OSHA believes that this language more accurately describes the hazard that arises over time
with these tools. Over time there is a tendency for the steel in these tools to become brittle and chip. When a tool has
reached that point, continued use of the tool can cause metal fragments to chip off the tool and fly into the air, thereby
endangering employees. The metal fragments could be small enough to strike the eye or large enough to cause a sizeable
laceration. 



At paragraph (e)(1)(v) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the cutting edges of each tool be sharpened in accordance
with manufacturer's specifications whenever they become dull during a workshift. OSHA received little comment
on this provision. One commenter stated:






With regard to the sharpness of cutting tools, we have had some interpretive problem in California where fire suppression
agencies who have been requiring various tools to be razor sharp rather than sharp enough to do the task for which they
are intended. The result has been unnecessary cuts to employees who have inadvertently had incidental contact with
such tools. We would suggest that the word ``adequately'' be inserted between the words ``kept'' and ``sharp'' to
provide a more ``moderate'' meaning to this requirement. (Ex. 5-55).






The need for tools to be inspected and sharpened as necessary is well-recognized and has been a part of OSHA's and ANSI's
logging standards from the start. OSHA believes that the final rule adequately addresses the commenter's concerns.
OSHA has added to the final rule the requirement that tools be sharpened according to the manufacturer's specifications.
This addition has also been supported by other commenters (Ex. 5-51, 5-53, 5-55). 



At paragraphs (e)(1) (vi) and (vii) OSHA is requiring that each tool be stored and transported so it is not damaged and
will not create a hazard for an employee. These provisions require that racks, boxes, holsters or other means shall
be provided and used for transporting tools. These provisions parallel requirements contained in the proposed and
pulpwood logging standards. The proposed rule specified that tools be secured during transport but did not require
that storage containers be provided. In addition, these provisions as proposed were included in the 1978 ANSI logging
standard. OSHA received only limited comments on these provisions. Two commenters stated that the storage provision
was unnecessary and, at most, should be limited to cutting tools (Ex. 3-53 and 5-55). The other commenter
said that the proposed transportation provision was not protective enough (Ex. 5-7). This commenter stated
that outside boxes or storage units should be utilized especially for crew vehicles, because tools can bounce around
when transported in such a vehicle, particularly when the vehicle is operated on off highway roads or trails, and could
injure employees who are riding with the tools. 



OSHA believes that provisions for proper tool storage and transportation are necessary to protect employees from
injuries. Such provisions have been in OSHA and ANSI standards for many years. In this regard, however, OSHA also believes
that it is not necessary to require that tools be stored outside of passenger areas during transport if there are appropriate
containers or other means to adequately secure the tools. Therefore, in the final rule OSHA has clarified that employers
must provide and use some means, such as racks, boxes or holsters, of securing tools during transport. 




Chain Saws

At paragraph (e)(2) of this final rule, OSHA specifies various requirements for the proper use of chain saws in the
logging industry. OSHA believes these requirements are necessary to protect loggers from injury when using chain
saws. Several commenters also supported the proposed chain saw requirements as reasonable practices (Ex. 5-21,
5-36, 5-74 through 5-92). As discussed earlier, the WIR survey indicates that chain saw accidents
accounted for 20 percent of the reported accidents (Ex. 2-1). According to a Maine BLS, from 1980-87 there
were an average of 362 disabling chain-saw injuries each year (Ex. 4-176). 



In recent years there have been many improvements in chain saw safety due to the introduction of devices such as chain
brakes, bar tip guards, and reduced kickback bars and chains. Also, the availability of protective chaps and pads
of ballistic nylon or other lightweight protective materials have provided further protection for chain-saw operators.
OSHA believes that proper use of improved chain saws and personal protective equipment, and compliance with the work
practices will greatly improve the safety record of chain saw operations. OSHA also believes that proper training
in these requirements will result in better understanding of how these safety devices and work practices can work
to reduce chain-saw related injuries. 



At paragraph (e)(2)(i), OSHA is requiring each chain saw placed into initial service after the effective date of this
section be equipped with a chain brake. In addition, this paragraph requires that chain saws meet all other requirements
of the ANSI standard B175.1-1991 ``Safety Requirements on Gasoline-Powered Chain Saws.'' This incorporation
by reference of ANSI B175.1-1991, has been approved by the Office of the Federal Register, in accordance with
the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. The final rule has been revised to reflect this approval and provides
the requisite information regarding access to the text of ANSI B175.1-1991. 



Paragraph (e)(2)(i) also requires that each chain saw placed into service before the effective date of this section
be equipped with a protective device that minimizes chain-saw kickback. Finally, this provision also requires that
chain-saw kickback devices not be removed or otherwise disabled. 



The proposed rule did not require installation of chain brakes or other devices. The proposed rule did, however, require
that when such devices were present they should be inspected frequently and maintained. The need for devices to prevent
kickback was specifically raised as an issue in the notice of hearing. 



OSHA received many comments on whether chain-saw protective devices should be required in the final rule. These comments
have been discussed above in the Major Issues section. One commenter suggested that loggers be allowed to remove chain
brakes when, in the judgment of the operator the presence of the chain brake creates a hazard greater than the hazard
the brake was designed to avoid (Ex. 5-55). This commenter suggested that it is more hazardous to have a chain
brake when the saw is operated on its side and at other unspecified times. However, the commenter did not provide any
data or other evidence to support his contention. There is no other data or evidence in the record that chain brakes
may create additional hazards at any time during the cutting process. Additionally, OSHA believes that once the chain
brake is removed it is likely the operator will leave it off and remain exposed to injury from chain saw kickback. As
noted in the earlier discussion, commenters stated that removal of devices is occurring, thereby exposing the operator
to the risk of injury due to kickback. Therefore, OSHA is requiring that chain-saw kickback devices not be removed
or otherwise disabled. 



At paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that each gasoline-powered chain saw be equipped with
a continuous throttle system which stops the running chain when pressure on the throttle is released. This provision
has been adopted from the proposed rule. OSHA received one comment that stated that if the safety equipment that came
with the chain saw were in place, the accidents listed in the preamble would not have occurred (Tr. W1 66). Therefore,
this requirement has been retained in the final rule.

NIOSH recommended that OSHA require chain saws be equipped or retrofitted with mufflers meeting the chain-saw manufacturer's
specifications (Ex. 5-42). NIOSH said mufflers would be effective for noise reduction. OSHA has not adopted
NIOSH's recommendation. First, retrofit mufflers may cause operational difficulties. Second, retrofit mufflers
may also contribute to an increase in back pressure for the operator. 
Paragraphs (e)(2)(iii) through (e)(2)(xiv) specify various requirements for safe operation of chain saws. OSHA
believes these work practices are essential in reducing the number of injuries that occur to chain-saw operators.
According to the WIR survey, the vast majority of chain-saw injuries reported indicates that unsafe work practices
were involved (Ex. 2-1). In contrast, only four percent of chain-saw injuries were the result of equipment failure.

At paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the chain saw be operated and adjusted in accordance
with the manufacturer's instructions. This provision adopts the requirement contained in the proposed rule. OSHA
did not receive any comments opposing this requirement. 
At paragraph (e)(2)(iv) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the chain saw be refueled at least 20 feet from any
open flame or other source of ignition. This provision adopts the requirements contained in the proposed rule. This
requirement was also contained in the 1978 ANSI logging standard. The OSHA pulpwood logging standard required only
that chain saw operators be instructed to refuel the saw only in safe areas and not in areas conducive to fire. 
OSHA believes that a separation between a fueling area and any source of ignition, such as a cigarette, is necessary
to prevent ignition of vapors from spills or from overfilled chain-saw tanks. The final rule clarifies what constitutes
at least a minimal safe fueling area. OSHA did not receive any comments opposing this requirement. 
At paragraph (e)(2)(v) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the chain saw be started at least 10 feet from any fueling
area. This provision also adopts the requirement contained in the proposed rule. 
Only one commenter opposed this provision, saying that in some instances it would be impossible to move 10 feet from
a fueling area to start the chain saw (Ex. 5-7). However, no substantive evidence was presented. 
OSHA believes that when a chain saw is started, there is a potential that spilled fuel in the area could also become ignited.
For example, a faulty spark plug wire can cause an arc between the wire and metal casing, resulting in the igniting of
spilled fuel. In addition, the record shows that the danger of fire is a major concern in the logging industry (Ex. 5-20).
OSHA believes that this provision will help to reduce the potential for fires. 
At paragraph (e)(2)(vi) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the chain saw be started on the ground or where otherwise
firmly supported. The provision is the same as the requirement contained in the proposal and the pulpwood logging
standard. Two commenters opposed the requirement (Ex. 5-34, 5-35). One commenter stated: 



In many instances, there is not any way to comply, i.e., when a cutter is felling while standing on springboard jacks,
it would be a greater hazard for him to climb up carrying a running saw. This means that the chain saw must be started on
the springboard with no place left to rest the saw. The same situation occurs when limbing and bucking large trees after
they are on the ground. The cutter/bucker would have to climb up on the trunk while carrying a running saw. The proposed
standard should be amended to read ``

whenever possible

'' chain saws should be started [on the ground] (Ex. 5-34). 



The other commenter said starting the chain saw on the ground was not necessarily the safest way to start it, and, in
any event, saws equipped with chain brakes could be drop started when the chain brake is engaged (5-35). Another
commenter said that they had had no injuries resulting from starting chains saws when standing in an upright position
(Ex. 5-45). 
For several reasons, OSHA believes that this provision is necessary to protect chain saw operators. First, the record
supports the need for chain saws to be firmly supported when they are started. The WIR survey indicates that a significant
portion of chain saw injuries were related to the operator not having firm control or grip of the saw (e.g., didn't have
tight grip on saw, hand slipped into chain, operator fell on saw). While the survey does not indicate whether these
injuries occurred while the operator was starting the saw, the presence of these injuries does reinforce the need
for appropriate work practices that require proper support for equipment so the operator is able to maintain a firm
grip and control of the saw.

<TEXT>
 

Second, OSHA believes that there is a potential for injury when operators attempt to drop-start chain saws. There
is a potential for the operator to lose his grip when starting the saw. In addition, especially when the saw is not properly
adjusted, the engine can flood. This can cause the saw to fly upward and hit the operator. When the chain saw starts there
is potential for sudden movement of the chain because of the increase in rpm. Third, while OSHA believes that starting
the chain saw on the ground will provide the best control and support, OSHA is aware that there may be some circumstances
in which a chain saw cannot be started in this manner. Nonetheless, even in those circumstances, OSHA believes that
it is necessary for operator safety that the saw be firmly supported. Fourth, even when the chain brake is on, the saw
needs to be firmly supported when it is started. When the chain saw is started, the chain will move until the engine returns
to idle. If the chain saw is not firmly supported when the operator starts the engine, he could lose control of the saw
and the moving chain could strike and injure him. 
At paragraph (e)(2)(vii) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that chain brakes be engaged when the saw is started.
Although this requirement was not contained in the proposed rule, OSHA believes it is necessary for chain brakes to
be engaged when the engine is started. As discussed above, when chain saws are started, the chain will run momentarily.
When a chain brake is present, it will hold the chain when the engine returns to idle. However, when the chain brake is
not engaged, the chain may continue to run at idle, further exposing the operator to the hazard. OSHA believes that
the many comments recommending that the final rule require chain saws to be equipped with chain brakes, also imply
that the chain brakes should be properly engaged during use of the chain saw. In addition, none of those commenters
supporting a chain brake provision indicated that there were situations in which it would be safe to allow the chain
brake not to be engaged during operation of the saw. 
At paragraph (e)(2)(viii) of the final standard, OSHA is requiring that the operator hold the chain saw with both hands
during operation. This requirement does not apply when the employer can demonstrate that a greater hazard is posed
by keeping both hands on the saw in that particular situation. This provision is the same as the provision contained
in the proposed rule. The 1978 ANSI logging standard also recognized the occasional need for momentary release of
one hand from the saw in some situations. 
Some commenters urged OSHA to require that a chain saw must never be operated with only one hand (Ex. 5-34, 5-50,
5-66). One commenter said: 



Regardless of what organization recognizes and sanctions momentary one-handed chain saw use, it is extremely dangerous.
I do not agree it is necessary to operate a saw with one hand and place a wedge with the other. By so doing, the right hand
is on the pistol grip controlling the throttle, the left handling the wedge. If, during this one-handed process a kick
back should occur, the left hand which has the primary responsibility for maintaining a distance between the operator
and the saw chain is absent. Sufficient time exists between the initiation of the backcut and its completion for the
cutter to momentarily halt his sawing to insert a wedge (Ex. 5-66). 



The U.S. Dept. of Interior also said that chains saws should be held with both hands unless the motor is at idle (Ex. 5-50).
It is not difficult for chain-saw operators to put the saw in idle before removing one hand from the saw. Before placing
a wedge the feller can stop the chain by simply removing his finger from the throttle, that will idle the chain saw, thereby
reducing the possibility of injury resulting from operating the saw with only one hand. OSHA agrees that in this situation
as well as most other operating situations, the greater hazard is posed by removing the hand from the chain saw. According
to the WIR survey, 13 percent of chain-saw operators injured reported that their hand slipped into the chain or they
did not have a tight grip on the saw. However, OSHA believes there are other situations in which the hazard may be greater
if the operator attempts to hold the saw with two hands. For example, when an operator has climbed a tree to top the tree,
the operator may not be able to keep his balance if he tries to operate the saw with both hands. In that case, the safest
method may be to use one hand to control the saw and the other hand to steady himself.

OSHA notes that the employer bears the burden of demonstrating that a greater hazard exists by keeping both hands on
the saw in a particular situation. OSHA also notes that the limited exception involves a case-by-case determination
by the employer. 
At paragraph (e)(2)(ix) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the chain saw operator be certain of his footing before
starting to cut. This provision also requires that the chain saw not be operated in a position or at a distance that could
cause the operator to become off-balance, to have insecure footing, or to relinquish a firm grip on the saw. This provision
adopts requirements contained in the proposed rule. Commenters supported this provision (Ex. 5-7, 5-21,
5-34, 5-36, 5-55), and there were no comments opposing this requirement. 
OSHA believes this work practice will help to reduce the number of slip and fall injuries occurring in the logging industry.
According to the WIR survey, slips and falls account for 24 percent of all injuries and 13 percent of all chain saw injuries
reported resulting from operators falling on the saw. 
At paragraph (e)(2)(x) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that prior to felling a tree the chain saw operator clear
away brush or other potential obstacles that might interfere with cutting or using the retreat path. This provision
adopts the requirement contained in the proposed rule. There were no comments opposing this requirement. OSHA believes
this provision will help to reduce the number of injuries that result from loggers being hit by trees. According to
the WIR survey, 24 percent of all injured loggers were hit by trees (Ex. 2-1). In addition, of employees reporting
injuries, over one-fourth said that heavy brush, ground cover and hidden wood on the ground had contributed to their
accident. 
At paragraph (e)(2)(xi) of the final rule, OSHA is prohibiting cutting directly overhead with a chain saw. This provision
was contained in the proposed rule. Several commenters supported the proposed provision (Ex. 5-34, 5-42,
9-10) and no comments were received opposing it. 
At paragraph (e)(2)(xii) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the chain saw be carried in a manner that will prevent
operator contact with the chain and muffler. The proposed rule contained the same requirement. Evidence in the record
suggests that this work practice already is being used extensively in the logging industry (Ex. 5-66). Some
commenters said that for many years chain saw operators have carried the saw on their shoulder and used a felt and/or
leather pad to protect their neck and shoulder from being cut by the chain or burned by the hot engine (Ex. 5-21,
5-36, 5-63). OSHA notes that any other method of carrying the chain saw that prevents these hazards would
also meet this requirement. 
In paragraphs (e)(2)(xiii) and (xiv) of the final rule, OSHA is specifying requirements for carrying a chain saw.
In paragraph (e)(2)(xiii), OSHA is requiring that the chain saw be shut off or at idle before the operator starts a retreat
after cutting a tree. This provision also clarifies OSHA's intent that these work practices apply not only to carrying
the saw between cuts but also to retreating after a cut has been made. This provision has been adopted from the proposed
rule. 
NIOSH supported this provision, and further recommended that OSHA should require the chain brake to be engaged when
an operator is moving from one location to another, except while working on the same tree or log, regardless of distance
traveled (Ex. 5-42). Another commenter also supported the NIOSH recommendation (Ex. 5-52). However,
three other commenters opposed requiring saws to be at idle or shut off before starting a retreat (Ex. 5-7, 5-50,
5-66). One commenter said: 



The cutter may lose precious seconds worrying about compliance with the proposed standard, meanwhile a life could
be in danger. Better to immediately remove the cutter from the base of the tree than worry about the saw (Ex. 5-50).

 

OSHA believes that the requirement that chain saws be shut off or at idle before starting a retreat is necessary and
can be accomplished without creating additional hazards for the operator. First, OSHA believes that carrying a chain
saw with the chain moving may present a great hazard for the operator. The WIR survey indicates that a significant portion
of chain saw injuries result from the operator falling on the saw, the saw chain contacting the employee, or the operator's
hand slipping into the chain (Ex. 2-1).

<TEXT>
 

Second, as OSHA explained in the preamble to the proposed rule, the saw can be at idle rather than shut off, provided
that the chain brake is engaged. OSHA is allowing operators to comply by either method because it recognizes that idling
the saw with the chain brake engaged is as effective as shutting off the engine in terms of preventing serious lacerations
due to coming into contact with the moving chain. 
Third, OSHA does not think that idling the saw will add a significant amount of time to the operator's retreat. All the
operator must do to idle the chain saw and safely carry it is to release pressure on the throttle and grasp the front handle.
Fourth, in any event, chain saws are designed to be carried by the front handle rather than by the rear throttle. Carrying
the saw by the front handle is easier and there is no risk of the bar tip contacting the operator's leg or toe. Carrying
the saw by the rear throttle guard can cause the bar tip to swing downward and possibly strike the operator. Therefore,
OSHA believes that the operator should grasp the front handle thereby idling the saw. That way the operator will both
protect himself from a falling tree and from saw lacerations without undue difficulty. 
Paragraph (e)(2)(xiv) of the final rule requires that when the operator must carry the chain saw further than 50 feet
that the chain brake be engaged or, if there is no chain brake, that the saw be shut off. This provision also requires
that the chain brake be engaged or the saw shut off when carrying a saw for a lesser distance if conditions, such as but
not limited to, the terrain, underbrush and slippery surfaces, may create a hazard for an employee. 
The proposed rule also contained these provisions. The 1978 ANSI logging standard required that chain saws be shut
off when carried for a distance greater than from tree to tree. In addition the ANSI standard also required that when
the terrain and other physical factors, such as underbrush and slippery surfaces, make the carrying of a running saw
for such short distances, the saw shall be shut off for carrying. Some State logging standards also require the chain
saw to be shut off or at idle when moving from tree to tree (Ex. 2-18, 2-22). For example, the State of Washington
logging standard requires that after the chain-saw operator has felled the tree, the saw must be shut off or at idle
while moving to another tree (Ex. 2-22). This standard also requires the chain saw to be shut off when moving to
the next tree when hazardous conditions are present. 
Some commenters supported this provision (Ex. 5-27, 5-42, 5-66). One of these commenter said that
their experience had been that a chain-saw operator could carry a chain saw any distance without being injured, provided
the chain brake was engaged (Ex. 5-27). Another commenter supported the provision because carrying a running
chain saw any distance promotes additional fatigue that can also contribute to accidents and errors (Ex. 5-66).
The reasoning and explanation for shutting off chain saws before beginning retreat also applies to carrying chain
saws for longer distances. According to the WIR survey, 13 percent of all chain-saw operators were injured when they
fell on their saws (Ex. 2-1). OSHA believes this provision is necessary to reduce exposure to the hazard of a running
chain-saw chain. 


Paragraph (f) Machines



At paragraph (f) of this final rule, OSHA is promulgating requirements for stationary and mobile machines. These
provisions include requirements for machine operation, protective structures, overhead guards, machine access,
stability and reliability, exhaust systems and brakes. As previously defined, a machine is a piece of equipment having
a self-contained powerplant that is operated off-road and used for the movement of material.

<TEXT>
 

OSHA believes these machine requirements are necessary to protect operators and other employees who are in the area
where machines are being operated. According to the FRSI, 20 percent of all serious logging injuries involved machines
(Ex. 4-65). Of all serious injuries reported, almost eight percent of employees injured were struck by a logging
machine or vehicle. 
The record also shows that a significant number of logging employees are killed in machine accidents. The OSHA FCI
report indicates that 17 percent of all employees were killed in machine accidents. The State of Washington fatality
study in consistent with the FCI report. According to that study, almost 20 percent of the employee deaths resulted
from machine rollover or being struck by a machine (Ex. 4-129). 


General Requirements 


At paragraphs (f)(1)(i) and (ii) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring the employer to assure that each machine used
by an employee is maintained and inspected so that the machine remains in serviceable condition. The employer must
assure that any machine is inspected before initial use during a workshift, and that defects or damage be repaired
or the unserviceable machine be replaced before work is commenced. Maintenance and inspection requirements were
also contained in the proposed standard. 
Some commenters supported the general maintenance and inspection requirement for each machine (Ex. 5-10,
5-16). For example, one commenter said that daily cleaning and inspection of machines was a necessary element
of fire prevention as well as other workplace protection (Ex. 5-10). 
OSHA believes that the reasoning and explanation for the maintenance and inspection requirements for PPE and hand
and portable powered tools also applies to machines. (See discussion above of paragraphs (d)(1)(i), d(1)(ii), (e)(1)(i),
and (e)(1)(ii).) As with tools and PPE, OSHA is imposing on the employer the obligation of assuring that machines are
in serviceable condition. This obligation applies regardless of whether the employer or employee provides the machine.

OSHA notes that because a general machine maintenance and inspection requirement has been included in the final rule,
the Agency has deleted from the final rule proposed maintenance and/or inspection requirements for any particular
machine safety feature. 
At paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the employer assure that operating and maintenance
instructions are available on the machine or in the area where the machine is being operated. This paragraph also requires
that each machine operator and maintenance employee comply with the instructions. The pulpwood logging standard
and the proposal both specified that instructions be kept with each machine. The proposed rule also contained a provision
requiring operators and maintenance personnel to comply with the instructions. 
Some commenters supported the proposed provision, however, other commenters opposed requiring that instructions
be kept on machines. These comments have been discussed above in the Major Issues section. 


Machine Operation 


At (f)(2)(i) of this final rule, OSHA is requiring that machines be operated only by designated persons. As explained
above, a designated person is an employee who has the requisite knowledge, training and experience to perform specific
duties. 
OSHA has included this provision in the final rule for two reasons. First, this provision must be read in conjunction
with the training requirements in the final rule. The training provisions require that each machine operator be trained
and demonstrate the ability to safely operate a machine before he/she is allowed to work independently. This provision
reinforces the requirement that the employer not allow untrained personnel to operate machines. Second, training
and skill are particularly necessary in an industry when machines are being operated in adverse weather conditions
and on steep or unlevel terrain. Employees who have not been trained to safely operate a logging machine under such
conditions could injure themselves or others. As noted earlier, over one-third of all employees reporting injuries
in the WIR survey had never received any kind of training (Ex. 2-1).

In paragraphs (f)(2)(ii), (iii) and (iv) of the final rule, OSHA is specifying various requirements regarding stability
limitations for machines. Stability limitations of machines used in logging are determined by three factors: (1)
load size; (2) what is done with the load when it is being handled; and (3) the physical environment in which the machine
is being operated. These requirements address each of those factors. 
In paragraph (f)(2)(ii), OSHA is requiring that stationary logging machines and their components be anchored or
otherwise stabilized to prevent movement during operation. The proposed standard contained a provision requiring
that stability limitations of machines not be exceeded. The proposed standard also contained a provision specifying
that truck and crawler mounted rigid boom cranes and other yarders meet the stability requirements of the ANSI B30.2-1983
``Safety Code for Cranes, Derricks and Hoists_Overhead and Gantry Cranes'' or the ANSI B30.5-1982 ``Safety
Code for Cranes, Derricks and Hoists_Crawler, Locomotive and Truck Cranes.'' The pulpwood logging standard required
only that the operator be advised as to the stability limitations of the machine. Several commenters pointed out that
machines referenced in those standards were not used for logging operations (Ex. 5-17, 5-25, 5-29,
5-34, 5-51, 5-67). 
In the final rule OSHA has deleted reference to the ANSI standards because those machines are covered elsewhere in
part 1910. Overhead cranes are covered in 29 CFR 1910.179 and mobile cranes are covered in 29 CFR 1910.180. OSHA believes
that these standards adequately spell out the requirements for safe operation when operating cranes. OSHA finds
nothing indicating that the use of cranes is different from the rest of general industry, therefore, the Agency does
not believe a special provision is necessary to address the logging industry. In addition, most of the machines referenced
in the ANSI standards, overhead and gantry cranes, crawlers locomotive cranes and truck cranes; either are not used
or are infrequently used in logging operations covered by this standard. OSHA also has deleted the proposed provisions
on reliability and stability of cranes for the same reasons. 
At paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the rated capacity of any machine not be exceeded.
As discussed above, OSHA has defined rated capacity as the maximum load a system, vehicle, machine or piece of equipment
was designed to handle. This provision was not explicitly contained in the proposed standard. Rather, it was implied
as part of the requirement that machine operators comply with the operating manuals or instructions. The pulpwood
logging standard, however, did require that operators at least be advised about the load capacity of machines. 
OSHA believes that it is necessary to explicitly state this requirement in the final standard. When the rated capacity
of the machine is exceeded, rollover and tipover accidents occur. As discussed above, many logging injuries and deaths
are the result of machine rollover accidents. The State of Washington study showed that nine percent of the reported
logging fatalities resulted from machine rollover accidents (Ex. 4-129). The OSHA FCI report also showed that
10 percent of fatalities were due to machine rollover accidents (Ex. 4-61). The Agency believes that it is not
sufficient to merely inform operators of the machine's capacity, rather operators must be instructed that load capacities
shall not be exceeded. As part of the training of machine operators, the operator also needs to be instructed on how
to keep the load within the rated capacity and what foreseeable conditions or actions can affect the machine's rated
capacity.

At paragraph (f)(2)(iv) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that no machine be operated on any slope that is greater
than the maximum slope recommended by the manufacturer. In the proposed standard, this requirement was implied in
the provision that operators comply with operating manuals or instructions. The pulpwood logging standard had specified
that operators be advised of the stability limitations of the machine. As with the requirement on rated capacity,
OSHA believes this provision is necessary to reduce the potential for machine rollover and tipover accidents. Therefore,
the Agency has explicitly stated this requirement in the final standard. 

At paragraph (f)(2)(v) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring the operator to determine that no employee is in the path
of the machine before starting or moving the machine. This provision parallels the proposed rule. In the pulpwood
logging standard, the operator was required to walk completely around the machine before start up to ensure no employee
was in the area. There were no comments on the proposed requirement. OSHA believes this provision is necessary to reduce
the number of accidents when employees are struck by machines. According to the State of Washington study, 10 percent
of all logging fatalities occurred when employees were struck by machines (Ex. 4-129). The OSHA FCI report indicated
similar results. Eight percent of the employees killed were struck by a logging machine (Ex. 4-61). Therefore,
this requirement has been retained in the final rule. 

At paragraph (f)(2)(vi) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the machine be started and operated only from the
operator's station or as otherwise recommended by the manufacturer. This requirement adopts the provision contained
in the proposed rule. Again, there were no comments opposing this provision. Under normal conditions, the only safe
place for an operator to be during the use of a machine is at the operator's station. However, some types of material
handling equipment have more than one operator's station. In those situations, the operator may choose which available
operator's station to use when operating the machine. 

At paragraph (f)(2)(vii) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the machine be operated at such a distance from other
employees and machines that a hazard is not created for any employee. This requirement parallels provisions contained
in both the proposed standard and the pulpwood logging standard. OSHA did not receive any comment on the proposed requirement.
The reasoning and explanation for checking the area before starting or moving a machine applies to this provision
as well. The record shows that many employees are injured and killed when they are hit by logging machines (Ex. 2-1,
4-61, 4-129). Therefore, OSHA has adopted the provision as proposed.

At paragraphs (f)(2)(viii) and (ix) of the final rule, OSHA is prohibiting riders on machines and loads. At paragraph
(f)(2)(viii), OSHA is specifying that no employee, other than the operator, be allowed to ride on the machine unless
seating, seat belts and other protection equivalent to that provided for the operator is available for the rider.
There were no comments opposing this provision. In paragraph (f)(2)(ix), OSHA is prohibiting riding on any load.
These requirements parallel the provisions contained in the proposed rule. Several comments were received on these
provisions and have been discussed above in the Major Issues section. 
Paragraph (f)(2)(x) of the final rule requires that before any machine is shut down, the machine brake locks or parking
brakes shall be applied. This provision also requires that each moving element, such as but not limited to, blades,
buckets and shears, shall be grounded. As defined in the final rule, grounded means the placement of a component of
a machine on the ground or on a device where it is firmly supported. This requirement was also contained in the pulpwood
logging and the 1978 ANSI logging standards. The proposed rule would have required that the moving elements of any
machine be lowered to the ground. 
Several commenters said employers should be viewed in compliance with this provision if the moving element is placed
in on a device on the equipment designed to hold moving elements in a stationary, secure position (Ex. 5-74 through
5-92). This is the method used to ground moving elements on certain machines, such as knuckleboom loaders. OSHA
agrees with these commenters that it may be appropriate for the moving elements of a machine to be grounded if the moving
elements can be placed on a device that can hold it in a stationary and secure position. However, in those situations
when the machine does not have a device to place the moving element, the moving element must be lowered to the ground.
OSHA believes this provision is necessary because the record shows that logging employees are injured and killed
when they are crushed between equipment and equipment parts or struck by falling and swinging equipment components
(Ex. 4-61). 
Paragraph (f)(2)(xi) of the final rule requires that after each machine is shut down, pressure or stored energy from
hydraulic and pneumatic storage devices shall be discharged. This provision has been adopted from the proposed rule.
The 1978 ANSI logging standard also contained a similar requirement. OSHA believes this provision is necessary because
if pressure or stored energy is not discharged water will accumulate in the storage device thereby decreasing the
amount of fluid to carry out the function of the system. For example, many machines use air brake systems. If the compressed
air reservoir fills up with water and displaces the air, there may not be enough air to stop the machine. 
At paragraphs (f)(2)(xii) and (xiii) of this final rule, OSHA is adopting provisions for transporting machines.
Paragraph (f)(2)(xii) requires that the rated capacity of any vehicle transporting a machine not be exceeded. Paragraph
(f)(2)(xiii) requires that the machine be loaded, secured and unloaded so that it will not create a hazard for any employee.
These provisions parallel requirements contained in the proposed rule. OSHA did not receive any comments opposing
these requirements. 
OSHA believes that the reasoning and explanation on machine rated capacity (paragraph (f)(2)(iii)) applies as well
to transporting machines on trailers. Machines, as defined in this standard, are material handling equipment that
are not operated on the public highways. Therefore, they must be transported on trailers across public roads from
work site to work site. The loading and unloading of a machine on a trailer can be a hazardous event. The principal hazards
occur due to rollover of the machine as it is driven up or down the trailer ramp or the ramp failing under the weight of
the machine. Rollover can occur when a machine is not properly aligned when being driven onto or off a trailer or when
the machine operator unsuccessfully attempts to make minor corrections in the direction of travel of the machine
on the ramp. The latter case is particularly likely when the machine runs on tracks rather than wheels, and directional
corrections are much more difficult to achieve. OSHA believes these machine transport provisions are necessary
to prevent injury to machine operators and other employees in the area. 


Protective Structures 


At paragraph (f)(3) of this final rule, OSHA is adopting various requirements for protective structures on machines.

At paragraph (f)(3)(i) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the specified logging machines that are placed into
initial service after the effective date of the final standard be equipped with falling object protective structures
(FOPS) and/or rollover protective structures (ROPS). This provision applies to each tractor, skidder, swing yarder,
log stacker, and mechanical felling device, such as a tree shear or feller-buncher. This provision combines the FOPS
and ROPS requirements contained in the proposed standard. ROPS requirements are also contained in several State
logging standards (Ex. 2-18, 2-19, 2-20, 2-21, 2-22, 2-23, 38J, 38K). In addition,
FOPS and ROPS requirements are contained in OSHA Construction Safety Standards, 29 CFR Part 1926, and Agriculture
Safety Standards, 29 CFR Part 1928. 
OSHA received many comments supporting the FOPS and ROPS requirement (Ex. 5-6, 5-7, 5-10, 5-19,
5-21, 5-22, 5-35, 5-36, 5-54, 5-74 through 5-92) and did not receive any comments
opposing this provision in general. Many of the commenters addressed the issues of retrofitting machines with ROPS
and FOPS and incorporation by reference of SAE standards have been discussed above in the Major Issues section. 
One commenter said that the ROPS requirement should also apply to loaders on self-loading logging trucks (Ex. 5-7).
However, three other commenters said this machine should be excluded from the requirement because the machine would
not meet most state highway height restrictions if FOPS and/or ROPS were added to the operator station (Ex. 5-21,
5-36, 5-49). OSHA agrees with these three commenters and has not expanded the FOPS and ROPS requirements
to cover loaders on self-loading logging trucks. 
The necessity of ROPS and FOPS on logging machines is not disputed. Steep terrain, slippery or uneven ground, large
loads, top-heavy equipment with loads, and other environmental conditions and unsafe work practices increase the
potential for logging machine rollover. ROPS reduce the likelihood that operators will be crushed in the event their
machine rolls over. FOPS prevent falling objects such as trees, limbs and winch lines from penetrating the cab and
injuring the operator. As OSHA noted in the preamble to the proposed rule, ROPS and FOPS are standard features on all
currently manufactured logging machines. 
Based on other comments in the record, OSHA has made the following changes to the ROPS and FOPS provision in the final
rule: 
1. The ROPS and FOPS requirements have been incorporated in one provision because the SAE FOPS standard (J231, January
1981) specifies that only machines equipped with ROPS can also be equipped with FOPS. The ROPS-FOPS requirement of
the SAE standard was pointed out by three commenters (Ex. 5-16, 5-22, 5-57). 
2. Machines only used in construction activities, such as road building, rather than logging operations have been
deleted from this provision (e.g., graders, scrapers, bulldozers, front-end loaders). Construction machines
and activities continue to be covered under 29 CFR Part 1926. 
3. Forklift trucks have been deleted from this provision and included in a separate provision in the final standard
(see paragraph (f)(4)). One commenter pointed out that forklift trucks were manufactured with overhead guards rather
than ROPS and FOPS and, therefore, were not included in the SAE standards (Ex. 5-16, 5-47; Tr. W1 224)).

4. An exception to the ROPS and FOPS requirement has been added for machines capable of 360-degree rotation. Two commenters
pointed out that the mast assembly of these machines, usually converted excavators, protects against machine rollover
(Ex. 5-16, 5-22, 5-27, 5-39, 5-40, 5-49, 5-53, 5-63). In addition,
the boom structure provides crush protection during rollover or tipover (Ex. 5-16). 
At paragraphs (f)(3) (ii) and (iii) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that ROPS and FOPS be tested, installed and
maintained in accordance with the following Society of Automotive Engineers standards: ``Performance Criteria
for Rollover Protective Structures (ROPS) for Construction, Earthmoving, Forestry, and Mining Machines'' SAE
J1040, April 1988; ``Minimum Performance Criteria for Falling Object Protective Structures (FOPS)'' SAE J231,
Jan 1981; and ``Deflection Limiting Volume-ROPS/FOPS Laboratory Evaluation'' SAE J397, April 1988. This incorporation
by reference of SAE J1040; April 1988, SAE J231, Jan 1981, and SAE J397; April 1988, have been approved by the Office
of the Federal Register, in accordance with the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR Part 51. The final rule has
been revised to reflect this approval and provides the requisite information regarding access to the text of SAE J1040,
April 1988, SAE J231, 1981, and SAE J397, April 1988. 
These provisions update the requirements contained in the proposed rule. OSHA received various comments on incorporating
consensus standards by reference, and this issue has been discussed above in the Major Issues section. 
In paragraph (f)(3)(v) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the protective structure on each machine be of a size
that does not impede the operator's normal movements in the cab. This provision parallels the provision contained
in the proposed rule and the 1978 ANSI logging standard. OSHA did not receive any comments opposing this provision.

In paragraphs (f)(3)(vi) through (xii) specify requirements for enclosing the operator's cab. OSHA did not receive
any comments opposing these provisions in general. One commenter did recommend that OSHA replace these provisions
with a reference to the Society of Automotive Engineers J1084, April 1980, standard on force requirements for tractors
and skidders (Ex. 5-16). However, since the SAE standard does not cover all of the machines referenced in paragraph
(f)(3), OSHA has specified in the final rule the cab force requirements which are applicable to machines used in logging
operations. 
Paragraph (f)(3)(vi) of the final rule requires that the overhead covering of each cab be of solid material extending
over the entire canopy. This provision parallels the requirement contained in the proposed rule. 
Paragraph (f)(3)(vii) requires that the lower portion of the cab (up to the top of the instrument panel or 24 inches
(60.9 cm) if there is no instrument panel) be completely enclosed, except at entrances, with solid material to prevent
objects from entering the cab. The proposed rule stated generally that the lower portion of the cab be fully enclosed.
One commenter said that what constitutes the ``lower portion'' of the cab should be specifically defined (Ex. 5-16).
OSHA has incorporated the commenter's recommendation that the lower portion be defined as below the top of the instrument
panel or at 24 inches. 
Paragraph (f)(3)(viii) of the final rule requires that the upper portion of the cab be fully enclosed. The enclosure
must be made of mesh material with openings no greater than 2 inches (5.08 cm) at its least dimension or other material
that the employer demonstrates provides equivalent protection and visibility. This provision combines two requirements
contained in the proposed rule: full enclosure of the upper rear portion of the cab and enclosure extending forward
as far as possible from the rear corners of the cab sides. The proposed rule also required that the mesh material openings
be no greater than 13/4 inches. The 1978 ANSI logging standard also required metal mesh when glass alone is not sufficient
to provide operator protection. In the final rule, OSHA has combined these provisions because one commenter said
that ``upper rear portion'' and ``as far as possible'' were not adequately defined (Ex. 5-16). In addition,
OSHA has changed the final rule to allow mesh material with openings no greater than two inches, that one commenter
pointed out is the accepted standard in the western States (See Ex. 2-22, 5-71, 38K).

Some commenters said that OSHA should limit the types of vehicles requiring mesh material (Ex. 5-74 through
5-92). They said mesh should not be required on front-end loaders, log stackers, forklifts, scrapers and graders.
They contend some of these machines are used in log stacking areas where there is no danger of branches entering the
cab. In the final rule, OSHA has deleted front-end loaders, trucks, graders, and scrapers from paragraph (f)(3) because
they are used in performing construction activities rather than logging operations. With regard to log-stackers,
OSHA believes it is necessary for these machines to be equipped with mesh material or equivalent protection. Log-stackers
are used to raise and move trees as well as logs. In some cases trees are not topped until they are taken to the landing.
When trees still contain branches, they could enter the cab and injure the operator if no cab protection is provided.


Paragraph (f)(3)(viii) of the final rule also specifies that the cab may be enclosed with a material other than mesh,
provided the employer demonstrate that it provides equivalent protection and visibility. The proposed rule implied
that transparent material could be used but did not specify what level of protection it must provide. The 1978 ANSI
logging standard specified that when glass enclosures were used, they must be safety glass or its equivalent. 

OSHA did not receive any comments opposing this provision. One commenter stated that many machines are already enclosed
with other material, such as safety glass, that offers equivalent protection and visibility (Ex. 5-16). In
addition, the Society of Automotive Engineers SAE J1084, April 1980, ``Operator Protective Structure Performance
Criteria for Certain Forestry Equipment, Recommended Practice'' allows cabs to be enclosed with safety glass. 

OSHA notes that the employer bears the burden of demonstrating that when transparent material, other than safety
glass is used, that it provides both equivalent protection and visibility. 
Paragraph (f)(3)(ix) of the final rule requires that the upper cab enclosure allow maximum visibility. The proposed
rule required that the upper cab enclosure allow maximum visibility to the rear. OSHA believes that it is necessary
that the enclosure allow maximum visibility in all directions so that the operator and other employees in the area
are not injured. 

Paragraph (f)(3)(x) of the final rule requires that if transparent material, rather than mesh, is used to enclose
the upper cab, it shall be of safety glass or other material that the employer demonstrates provides equivalent protection
and visibility. This provision parallels the provision contained in the proposed rule. The proposed standard also
specified that a metal screen must also be used where transparent material alone does not provide adequate protection.
In the final rule, OSHA specifies the preferred transparent material (i.e. safety glass). OSHA agrees with various
commenters that when safety glass is used, additional metal mesh screens are not necessary. The final rule does allow
alternative material to be used, and makes clear OSHA's intent that it is the employer who bears the burden of proving
that the alternative material provides protection and visibility that is equivalent to safety glass. 

Paragraphs (f)(3) (xi) and (xii) of the final rule require that transparent material be kept clean and be replaced
when it is cracked, broken, scratched or damaged in any other way that may create a hazard for the operator. These requirements
parallel the provisions contained in the proposed rule and the 1978 ANSI logging standard. 

Paragraph (f)(3)(xiii) of the final rule requires that deflectors be installed in front of each cab to deflect whipping
saplings and branches. This provision also requires that deflectors be located so they do not impede visibility or
access to the cab. This provision adopts the requirement contained in the proposed rule. OSHA did not receive any comments
opposing the provision. 

Paragraph (f)(3)(xiv) of the final rule requires that the height of each cab entrance be at least 52 inches, or 1.3 meters,
from the floor of the cab. This provision has been adopted from the proposed rule. No commenters opposed this requirement.

Paragraph (f)(3)(xv) of the final rule requires that each machine operated near yarding systems (high lead and skyline)
shall be equipped with sheds or roofs of sufficient strength to provide protection from breaking lines. This provision
has been adopted from the proposed rule. There were no comments opposing this provision. 



Overhead Guards 



At paragraph (f)(4) of the final rule, OSHA is specifying that each forklift truck used in logging operations be equipped
with an overhead guard. The overhead guard must meet the requirements of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers
(ASME) B56.6-1987 (with addenda), ``Safety Standard for Rough Terrain Forklift Trucks.'' This incorporation
by reference of ASME B56.6-1987, has been approved by the Office of the Federal Register, in accordance with
the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR Part 51. The final rule has been revised to reflect this approval and provides
the requisite information regarding access to the text of ASME B56.6-1987. 

In the proposed rule, OSHA had included forklift trucks in the provisions requiring installation of ROPS and FOPS.
However, commenters informed OSHA that the manufacture of forklift trucks used in rough terrain conditions such
as the logging industry are covered by the ASME standard (Ex. 5-22, 5-47, Tr. W1 224), and that forklift
trucks are manufactured with overhead protection, rather than ROPS and FOPS (Ex. 5-47). 

OSHA believes that this overhead protection requirement is necessary and will adequately protect logging forklift
operators from falling objects. Since the mast assembly of the forklift truck prevents it from rolling onto its top,
ROPS protection is not necessary. When accidents do occur, forklift trucks are more likely to tip over on their sides.
OSHA believes that, in the event of a tipover, the seat belt requirement contained in this standard will prevent operators
from being pinned or crushed by the truck or overhead guard by safely restraining them within the cab. 

In paragraph (f)(4) OSHA has not included a provision excepting fork lift trucks placed into service before the final
rule from being equipped with overhead guards. The manufacturing requirements for rough terrain forklift trucks
have been in place since 1978. Since the useful life of these machines is approximately 10 years, OSHA is confident
that almost all forklift trucks currently used in the logging industry do contain overhead guards meeting the ASME
standard. 



Machine Access 



Paragraph (f)(5) of the final rule specifies various requirements regarding machine access. Paragraph (f)(5)(i)
of the final rule requires that machine access be provided for each machine when the operator or another employee must
climb onto the machine to enter the cab or an operating element to perform maintenance. This provision also requires
that the machine access system meet the requirement of the SAE J185 June 1988, standard on ``Recommended Practice
for Access systems for Off-Road Machines.'' This incorporation by reference of SAE J185, June 1988, has been approved
by the Office of the Federal Register, in accordance with the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR Part 51. The final
rule has been revised to reflect this approval and provides the requisite information regarding access to the text
of SAE J185, June 1988. 

The proposed rule and the 1978 ANSI logging standard also contained machine access provisions. The proposed rule
specified that steps, ladders, handhold, catwalks, or railings installed after the effective date of this standard
comply with the SAE J185, June 1981, or be in accordance with a design by a professional engineer which offers equivalent
employee protection. There were no comments opposing the proposed provision. 

OSHA believes this provision is necessary to prevent logging injuries due to slips and falls. The WIR survey indicated
that these types of injuries accounted for almost one-fourth of all logging injuries reported, and that 28 percent
of all injuries resulting from falls involved machines and vehicles (Ex. 2-1). OSHA believes that compliance
with the SAE standard, in conjunction with work practices and training, will prevent these types of accidents. OSHA
notes that in the final rule, the reference to the SAE standard has been updated from the 1981 to the 1988 edition.

Paragraph (f)(5)(ii) of the final rule requires that each machine cab have a second means of egress. This provision
has been adopted from the proposed rule. The 1978 ANSI logging standard also contained this requirement. According
to one commenter, nearly all logging machines currently in use have a second means of egress (Ex. 5-29). Therefore,
OSHA does not believe compliance with this provision will be burdensome. 

Paragraphs (f)(5) (iii) and (iv) of the final rule require that walking and working surfaces of each machine have slip
resistant surfaces and be kept free of waste, debris and other material which might result in slipping, falling or
fire. These requirements parallel provisions contained in the proposed rule. 

OSHA received three comments opposing these provisions (Ex. 5-7, 5-22, 5-55). These commenters
stated that the debris must be hazardous (Ex. 5-7) and that the requirement should be changed to indicate that
the walkways of machines should be ``substantially free'' of debris (Ex. 5-55). As discussed above, slips,
trips and falls account for a significant number of injuries in the logging industry. The Agency's primary intent
in this provision is to minimize the potential for employees to slip, trip or fall when mounting or dismounting a machine.
OSHA believes these provisions will reduce the hazards that result in those types of injuries. OSHA does not agree
with the characterization implied by the commenters that this provision requires employers to keep every machine
walking and working surface ``spotless'' at all times. OSHA is aware that in outdoors environments material may accumulate
on machine surfaces. OSHA is only requiring that when such accumulated material might result in a fire or in an employee
slipping or falling that it must be removed. 



Exhaust Systems 



Paragraph (f)(6) of the final rule contains various requirements regarding exhaust pipes and mufflers. Paragraphs
(f)(6) (i) and (ii) of the final rule require that exhaust pipes on each machine be so located that exhaust is directed
away from the operator, and be mounted or guarded to protect the employee from accidental contact. These provisions
have been adopted from the proposed rule. The 1978 ANSI logging standard also contained a similar requirement. OSHA
did not receive any comments opposing these provisions. 


Paragraph (f)(6) (iii) of the final rule requires that exhaust pipes be equipped with spark arresters. This provision
also provides that when an engine is equipped with a turbocharger, spark arresters are not required. The proposed
rule also required a spark arrester for each machine, but did not make an exception for machines equipped with turbochargers.



Several commenters said that spark arresters were not needed when engines are turbocharged (Ex. 5-10, 5-16,
5-17, 5-22, 5-25, 5-27, 5-55, 5-74 through 5-92). These commenters said
that the flow of exhaust gases through the turbocharger requires sufficient time for any sparks to be extinguished
and unburned fuel and particulate matter to be burned. One commenter said that functional turbocharged engines do
not produce exhaust sparks like normally aspirated engines (Ex. 5-27). For this reason, these commenters said
turbochargers were an acceptable substitute for spark arresters (Ex. 5-16). In addition, the U.S. Forest Service
allows turbochargers in lieu of spark arresters (Ex. 5-16). Based on this evidence, OSHA has incorporated an
exception to the use of spark arresters when the machine engine is turbocharged. 

Paragraph (f)(6)(iv) of the final rule requires that the muffler provided by the manufacturer, or the equivalent,
be in place at all times the machine is in operation. This provision is the same as the corresponding provisions of the
proposal and the pulpwood logging standard. OSHA did not receive any comments opposing this requirement.

Brakes 



Paragraph (f)(7) of the final rule specifies provisions regarding machine brakes. Paragraph (f)(7)(i) of the final
rule requires that the brakes must be sufficient to hold each machine and its maximum load on the slopes on which the
machine is being operated. As discussed above, rated capacity is the maximum load a machine was designed by the manufacturer
to handle. This provision was adopted from the proposed rule. Machine brake provisions are also included in various
State logging standards (Ex. 2-17, 2-18, 2-19, 2-22, 38J, 38K), and in the 1978 ANSI logging
standard. 

Several commenters supported this provision (Ex. 5-10, 5-16, 5-22). These commenters also said
that OSHA should include provisions requiring brakes to meet certain criteria in respective SAE and ANSI standards.


The variety of terrain encountered in logging operations makes the adequacy of brakes a critical safety issue. For
example, information presented in the preamble to the proposed rule indicated that an operator was unable to stop
the machine he was operating on a slope and the machine rolled over (54 FR 18799-80). The injured operator was
trapped in a cab for 45 minutes until he could be rescued. This provision requires that the braking system, that consists
of the service and emergency brakes, must be adequate to hold the machine and its maximum allowable load on the slope.
For certain machines (tractors and rubber tired skidders), employers can look to national consensus standards for
guidance on brake system performance (See SAE J1041, October 1991, ``Breaking System Test Procedure and Braking
Performance Criteria for Agricultural Tractors'' and SAE J1178, June 1987, ``Braking Performance_Rubber Tired
Skidders''). However, these standards do not cover all machines used in logging operations. Therefore, OSHA is specifying
certain minimum brake system requirements for all machines used in logging operations. 

Paragraph (f)(7)(ii) requires that each machine be equipped with a secondary braking system, such as an emergency
brake or parking brake. This provision also requires that the secondary system be effective in stopping the machine
and maintaining parking performance, regardless of the direction of travel or of whether the engine is running. These
requirements parallel the provisions contained in the proposed rule. These provisions are also contained in the
1978 ANSI logging standard. There were no comments opposing these provisions. 


Guarding 



Paragraphs (f)(8) (i) and (ii) of the final standard requires that each machine be equipped with guarding to protect
employees from exposed moving elements and flying objects. These provisions also require that guarding must meet
the requirements specified in subpart O of part 1910. These provisions clarify that guarding requirement also applies
to each machine used in debarking, limbing and chipping. The proposed standard also contained a provision requiring
machine guarding. The 1978 ANSI logging standard contained a similar requirement. 

Three commenters stated that the provision should be applied only to stationary equipment to prevent misapplication
to mobile equipment (Ex. 5-10, 5-22, 5-57). OSHA believes the record does not support the commenters'
recommendation. The Agency believes that both mobile and stationary machines pose a risk of injury due to exposure
to moving parts. According to the WIR survey, a significant number of employee injuries involved mobile equipment
(Ex. 2-1). OSHA believes that employees working with or near both types of machine need to be protected. Additionally,
requiring all machines to be guarded eliminates the ambiguity as to whether a machine is stationary or mobile (e.g.
mobile machines that are used in place, such as a trailer mounted chipper). 

OSHA notes that guarding satisfies the requirements of subpart O when it is in the form of a specially constructed and
installed barrier or when the structure of the machine itself prevents employee contact with the moving element of
the machine. Each machine shall be equipped with guarding to protect employees from exposure to moving elements,
such as but not limited to, shafts, pulleys, belts on conveyors, and gears, in accordance with the requirements of
subpart O of part 1910.

Paragraph (f)(8)(iii) of the final rule requires that the guarding on each machine be in place at all times the machine
is in operation. This provision was contained in the 1978 ANSI logging standard. This provision makes explicit OSHA's
intent in the proposed rule that machines be equipped with guarding and that such guarding not be removed or otherwise
disabled while the machine is in operation. If machine guarding is removed or disabled, employees still remain exposed
to the danger of moving elements and flying objects when they are near or using the machine. OSHA believes the reasoning
and explanation for requiring that chain-saw chain brakes be engaged when starting the machine and not be removed
is also applicable to this provision. 


Paragraph (g) Vehicles 



At paragraph (g) of the final rule, OSHA has included various requirements regarding vehicles when used off public
roads in logging operations. OSHA has decided to include a separate paragraph on vehicles in this final rule because
of the confusion commenters said existed in the definition and requirements regarding ``mobile equipment'' verses
``motor vehicles'' in the proposed rule (Ex. 5-16, 5-18, 5-19, 5-22). Certain of the proposed
provisions on vehicles were limited to personnel transport vehicles. In the final rule, OSHA has defined vehicles
to include trucks and trailers used to transport logs and machines, as well as personnel transport vehicles. Therefore,
the provisions covering vehicles apply to all vehicles used in any logging operation. OSHA believes that the reasoning
and explanation supporting the need for protection for those in personnel transport vehicles also apply to operators
and passengers of other vehicles. 

OSHA received some comment that employee-provided vehicles should be excepted from the standard's vehicle requirements
(Ex. 5-21, 5-36, 5-39). OSHA has not distinguished between employer-provided and employee-provided
equipment anywhere in this standard. OSHA believes that when any equipment is used in logging operations, the employer
is responsible for assuring that it is in proper working condition. However, this final standard does not address
the personal vehicle an employee drives on public roads. By contrast, when the employer allows employees to use their
own vehicles to transport themselves and other employees off public roads to and from logging work sites rather than
providing such transportation, those vehicles are exposed to the unique hazards of logging operations. Such vehicles
must be adequately equipped and properly running, just as employer provided vehicles must be, in order to cross what
may be difficult terrain and other hazardous conditions encountered enroute to and from the logging site. The OSH
Act imposes on the employer the responsibility for compliance with standards and for assuring safe conditions in
the workplace, even if the employee provides the vehicle for the logging operation.

OSHA believes it is necessary in the final rule to specify requirements for vehicles used to transport employees off
public roads and vehicles used to perform logging operations. The record shows that a number of injuries and fatalities
have occurred in the logging industry that involve vehicles (Ex. 2-1, 4-61, 4-129). 

At paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2), OSHA is requiring the employer to assure that each vehicle used to transport employees
off public roads or to perform any logging operation, including vehicles provided by employees, is maintained, and
is inspected before initial use during a workshift. These provisions also require that defects or damage be repaired
or the vehicle be replaced before work is started. These are the same general maintenance and inspection as required
for machine and tools. OSHA believes that the explanation and reasoning for including these provisions in the paragraphs
covering PPE, tools and machine apply here as well. (See discussion above of paragraphs (d)(1)(i), (d)(1)(ii), (e)(1)(i),
(e)(1)(ii), (f)(1)(i), and (f)(1)(ii).) 

OSHA has included paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) in the final rule in an effort to clarify its proposed intention. As
stated above, commenters said it was not clear in the proposed rule whether the definition of ``mobile equipment''
included both machines and vehicles, and therefore, whether the general maintenance and inspection requirements
applied to both types of equipment. ``Mobile equipment'' was defined in the proposal as that kind of equipment that
includes mobility as a part of its work function. In the final rule, OSHA is defining machines and vehicles separately,
and placing the requirements governing each in different paragraphs. In making these clarifications, however,
the Agency emphasizes that all mobile equipment used in logging operations, whether vehicles or machines, must operate
properly, and that maintenance and inspections are needed to assure that only properly functioning mobile equipment
is used. 

Paragraph (g)(3) of the final rule requires that the employer assure that operating and maintenance instructions
are available in each vehicle. This provision also requires that each vehicle operator and maintenance employee
comply with the instructions. These are the same provisions as required for machines. OSHA believes that the explanation
and reasoning for including these provisions in the paragraph covering machines applies to vehicles as well. (See
discussion above of paragraph (f)(1)(iii).) 

Paragraph (g)(4) of the final rule requires that the employer assure that each vehicle operator has a valid operator's
license for the class of vehicle being operated. This provision applies to all vehicle operators, not just employees
who operate personnel transport vehicles. The proposal applied the licensing requirement only to personnel transport
vehicle operators and no comments opposing the requirement were received. 

OSHA believes that it is also essential that an employee operating any type of vehicle possess a current license for
that vehicle. Any employee operating a vehicle for logging operations needs to have met the necessary qualifications
and shown that they have operated the vehicle in a manner responsible enough to maintain a current license. This provision
ensures that the employee has the proper kind of license for the type of vehicle being operated and the load being carried.


Paragraph (g)(5) of the final rule requires that mounting steps and handholds be provided on each vehicle whenever
it is necessary to prevent an employee from being injured while entering or leaving the vehicle. The proposed rule
specified that mounting steps and handholds be provided for every personnel transport vehicle. The 1978 ANSI logging
standard also contained a similar provision. 

One commenter opposed applying this provision to pickup trucks (Ex. 5-51). This commenter said steps would
rip off of high center pickup trucks during the ride. In addition this commenter said that steps would prevent access
of fire fighting vehicles to roads that have water barriers or speed bumps. OSHA does not believe the record supports
the exceptions recommended by the commenter. First, according to the WIR survey, 13 percent of all injuries resulted
from falls from vehicles (Ex. 2-1). Second, there are mounting steps for vehicles used in logging operations
that can be retractable or high enough to prevent contact with the ground while the vehicle is moving. In addition,
the record does not indicate that there are many speed bumps on logging roads. OSHA is aware that mounting steps and
handholds may not be necessary for every vehicle. OSHA is only requiring mounting steps when there is a danger that
an employee could be injured while entering or leaving the vehicle without being provided with such assistance.

Paragraph (g)(6) of the final rule requires that each seat be securely fastened to the vehicle. The final rule adopts
the proposed requirement and applies it to all vehicles used in logging operations. The 1978 ANSI logging standard
also contained this requirement. OSHA did not receive any comments opposing this provision. 
Paragraph (g)(7) of the final rule requires applies the requirements of paragraphs (f)(2)(iii), (f)(2)(v), (f)(2)(vii),
(f)(2)(x), (f)(2)(xiii) and paragraph (f)(7) to each vehicle used to transport any employee off public roads or to
perform any logging operation, including any vehicle provided by an employee. OSHA believes these general work practices
and brake requirements are necessary to prevent accidents involving vehicles as well as machines. OSHA believes
the reasoning and explanation for including these general provisions in the paragraph covering machines applies
here as well. 


Paragraph (h) Tree Harvesting


At paragraph (h) of the final rule, OSHA establishes various general and specific work practice requirements regarding
tree harvesting. OSHA believes these work practice requirements are necessary, especially given the high injury
rate in the logging industry. According to the WIR survey, in more than two-thirds of all reported injuries unsafe
working practices contributed to the accident (Ex. 2-1). The work practices specified in this paragraph address
those work practices that when not used contributed to accidents such as those reported in the WIR survey (e.g., co-worker
activity, working too fast, misjudging time or distance to avoid injury, using wrong cutting method). 
OSHA notes that those provisions in the proposed rule that specified requirements other than work practices (e.g.,
equipment specifications) have been moved to the applicable equipment specification paragraphs of the final rule.



General Requirements 


Paragraph (h)(1)(i) requires that trees not be felled in a manner that may create a hazard for an employee, such as,
but not limited to, falling on an employee, or striking a rope, cable, power line or machine. The proposed rule and the
1978 ANSI logging standard contained similar provisions. The proposed rule required that trees not be felled in a
manner that could endanger an employee.

Three commenters said that the proposed provision was too broad to be useful since they believed all felling activities
are dangerous (Ex. 5-21, 5-36, 5-63). While OSHA agrees that it may not be possible to eliminate all
hazards in a workplace, the employer does have the responsibility to prevent or minimize hazards the employer can
reasonably anticipate. To comply with this provision, it is incumbent on the employer to train employees in proper
felling work practices and to point out when employee actions or workplace conditions could create hazards for employees.

Paragraph (h)(1)(ii) requires that the immediate supervisor be consulted before felling is commenced, whenever
unfamiliar or unusually hazardous conditions necessitate the supervisor's approval. The final rule adopts the
provision contained in the proposed rule. One commenter supported the proposed requirement (Tr. W1 85). He said that
consulting supervisors when heavy accumulations of snow are present would prevent injuries. OSHA believes that
unusual, hazardous situations may arise during felling operations and the supervisor should be involved in making
decisions about the safest way to fell a tree. These situations may include, but are not limited to, felling very large
or tall trees; cutting trees whose lean, location or structure make it difficult to fell in the desired or a safe direction.
Adding the supervisor's knowledge, training and experience to the decision-making process should help to minimize
the hazards to loggers. In addition, this consultation process is especially important when logging crews are relatively
new and may not have dealt with such situations before. 
Paragraph (h)(1)(iii) of the final rule requires that no yarding machine be operated within two tree lengths of any
tree being manually felled. This provision has been adopted from the proposed rule. The 1978 ANSI logging standard
also contained a similar requirement. 
Several commenters raised questions about or discussed this provision (Ex. 5-12, 5-43, 5-67; Tr.
W1 104, W2 197). None of the commenters denied that yarding machine operators may be endangered when they operate too
close to manual felling activities. However, two commenters stated that the provision should be revised because,
in some circumstances, the assistance of a yarding machine is necessary to assure that the tree is felled in the desired
direction or to keep the area clear (Ex. 5-12, 5-67). For example, one commenter said that failure of yarders
to clear an area of a build up of felled trees or logs can result in timber breakage or can pose problems for fellers working
on slopes (Ex. 5-67). 
In general, OSHA believes that allowing yarding machines within two tree lengths of trees being manually felled would
pose a risk of harm to both the machine operator and the feller. First, a manual feller who is cutting a tree is concentrating
on that work activity and not on other logging activities in the area. If that tree were to fall on a yarding machine that
is too close to a manual felling operation, the machine operator could be injured by the tree. Second, it also is important
for their own safety that manual fellers work at a safe distance from yarding activities. Yarder operators and chasers
and choker setters concentrating on slinging and moving logs could cause injury to the feller if a tree or log were to
shift, roll or slide suddenly. 
Third, yarding machine operators are often working downhill from manual fellers. It may be dangerous for the operator
to approach the feller because the falling tree could roll or slide into the machine. Fourth, the requirements of this
paragraph can still be met even where the feller and yarder work as a team. After the feller has cut a tree and is moving
on to size up another tree for cutting, the yarder can remove the felled tree before the feller begins cutting the next
tree. The feller should check to make sure the yarder has removed the tree out of the work area before he starts cutting.
Therefore, OSHA believes that its general rule that each work area be separated by at least two tree lengths should
also apply to yarding and manual felling operations.

One commenter, who said that ``cat skidding crews'' in the northwest work in close proximity of tree fellers, suggested
that this provision should allow skidding directly away from a timber feller as long as the feller is not actively trying
to fell a tree (Ex. 5-43). OSHA notes that the final rule does not prohibit what the commenter suggests. The final
rule only says that yarding machines shall not be within a two-tree length distance while manual felling is in progress.
The final rule does not prohibit the yarding operator from clearing logs when the feller is not engaged in cutting trees.
While the feller is moving onto the next tree and assessing its condition, this provision allows yarder operators
to remove the trees that have been felled, provided that the other requirements or this paragraph have been met (e.g.,
the feller acknowledging that it is safe for the yarder to enter the work area). 
Paragraph (h)(1)(iv) of the final standard requires that no employee approach a felling operation closer than two
tree lengths of the tree being felled until the feller acknowledges it is safe to do so. This provision includes an exception
to the two-tree length requirement when the employer demonstrates that a team of employees is necessary to manually
fell a particular tree. The proposed rule and the 1978 ANSI logging standard also contained provisions specifying
that employees remain two tree lengths from the feller. The proposed rule did not contain the felling team exception.

Several commenters urged OSHA to permit exceptions to the two tree-length requirement (Tr. W1 152, 183-86,
W2 163, OR 126). These commenters discussed, for example, the need for shovelers to work in conjunction with fellers.

OSHA believes the two tree-length distance requirement is necessary for several reasons. First, a feller may not
be aware of approaching employees due to noise or the feller's concentration on the work. It is therefore possible
that employees may inadvertently enter an area where a tree is falling. This could result in injury to the approaching
employee, and even to the feller if he attempts to take corrective action. According to the WIR survey, six percent
of employees injured reported that co-worker activity had contributed to the accident (Ex. 2-1). The State
of Washington study indicated that eight percent of employees who were killed were hit by a tree being felled by another
employee (Ex. 4-129). According to the OSHA FCI report, nine logging employees were killed when they were struck
by a tree that was being cut by another logger (Ex. 4-61). Second, an approaching employee could be injured if
he is unaware of or misjudges the falling direction of a tree. The feller is the best judge of the direction that a tree
is likely to fall and, therefore, should be the one to signal when a work area is safe. Third, approaching employees
could be injured if a tree were to inadvertently fall in the wrong direction. The best way for employees to prevent such
injury is to remain clear of the work area while the felling operation is being conducted. Once the felling of the tree
is completed, the feller can signal that it is safe for other employees to approach. Therefore, OSHA believes the safer
approach for both the feller and other employees is to wait until the feller has acknowledged it is safe to enter the
felling area. 
OSHA has included an exception to this rule for particular situations when more than one employee is needed to manually
fell a particular tree. However, OSHA notes that this exception covers only manual fellers and those whom the employer
demonstrates are needed to assist in manually felling a tree (e.g., shovelers). It does not include mechanical felling
operations and it does permit machines to enter the manual felling area. In those situations, paragraphs (h)(1)(iii)
and (h)(1)(v) apply. If a machine is necessary to push or pull over a tree, the manual feller must move at least two tree
lengths away and must not enter the area until the machine operator acknowledges that it is safe. OSHA notes that this
is not a blanket exception for all team felling activities. The general rule is that no person is to approach a feller
until the feller has indicated it is safe to do so. The exception is meant to be applied on a case-by-case basis. That
is, the employer bears the burden of demonstrating that a particular tree or a particular felling situation requires
a team. Only then is more than one person allowed within the immediate work area. In addition, the employer bears the
burden of showing that a team is necessary to manually fell the tree in that particular situation.

Paragraph (h)(1)(v) of the final rule requires that no employee approach a mechanical felling operation closer than
two tree lengths of the tree being felled until the machine operator has acknowledged that it is safe to do so. The proposed
rule required that employees remain clear of any mechanical felling operation. 

OSHA received many comments recommending that OSHA apply the two tree-length minimum work distance to mechanical
felling operations as well (Ex. 5-18, 5-21, 5-34, 5-36, 5-39, 5-63, 5-74
through 5-92; Tr. W2 163, 197). These commenters said that such distance was needed, for example, to protect
other employees from flying metal fragments from broken mechanical disc saw blades. In addition, the reasoning and
explanation supporting the distance requirement for approaching fellers also applies to this provision. For example,
a feller-buncher operator who is not expecting an employee to enter the work area may move in reverse and not see the
employee in time to prevent an accident. OSHA has therefore added the two tree-length distance requirement to this
provision of the final rule. 

Paragraph (h)(1)(vi) of the final rule requires that each danger tree, including lodged trees and snags, be felled,
removed or avoided. When the danger tree is felled or removed, it must be felled or removed using mechanical or other
techniques that minimize employee exposure before felling is commenced in the area of the danger tree. When the danger
tree is avoided, it must be marked and no work be conducted within two tree lengths of the danger tree, unless the employer
demonstrates that a shorter distance will not create a hazard for an employee. As defined in the final rule, a danger
tree includes any standing tree that presents a hazard to employees due to conditions such as, but not limited to, deterioration
or damage to the tree, and direction or lean of the tree. 

The proposed rule required that lodged trees be marked and lowered to the ground using mechanical or other safe techniques
before any work is continued within two tree lengths of the lodged tree. The proposed rule did not allow any exceptions
to the two tree-length distance. Many State logging standards include requirements to fell danger trees or not to
commence work within a two tree-length distance of the danger tree (Ex. 2-19, 2-20, 2-22, 38J, 38K).


The record shows that danger trees pose many hazards for employees. According to the WIR survey, 15 percent of those
injured said that the dangerous conditions of the tree had contributed to their accident (Ex. 2-1). The OSHA
FCI report indicated that 23 logging employees were killed by danger trees (Ex. 4-61). 

OSHA received several comments on this proposed provision (Ex. 5-7, 5-21, 5-34, 5-39, 5-43,
5-74 through 5-92, 17; Tr. W1 187, W2 6-7). Some commenters supported the provision (Ex. 5-39,
5-34). Some commenters suggested that this provision conflicts with other federal regulations requiring
retention of some ``snags'' to preserve wildlife habitats in the area (Ex. 5-7, 5-27, 5-39, Tr. W2
6) and Rep. Jolene Unsoeld commented that OSHA should attempt to harmonize the final rule with various environmental
regulations (Ex. 17, 31). Other commenters said that OSHA's provision was excessive in those situations when a tree
is securely lodged a few feet above the ground (Ex. 5-21, 5-74 through 5-92; Tr. W1 187, W2 6-7).
Another commenter said that prohibiting any felling within two tree-lengths of a danger tree would take a large volume
of timber out of production, especially strips of trees on steep slopes (Ex. 5-43). 

OSHA has addressed the commenters' concerns in the final rule. First, OSHA is more explicitly stating in the final
rule that dangers trees may be avoided, when necessary, rather than being felled or removed. OSHA believes that this
requirement harmonizes with and does not conflict with the rules and regulations of other Federal agencies. The U.S.
Department of the Interior participated in this rulemaking and did not indicate that this provision was in conflict
with their regulations (Ex. 5-50). The change to the final rule further clarifies OSHA's proposed intent that
danger trees do not have to be felled or removed. This provision of the final rule only requires two actions of the employer.
One, when the employer wishes to fell a danger tree, it must be removed or felled before other trees in the area are felled.
Two, when the employer elects not to fell or remove a danger tree, the employer must not conduct any other felling in
that area. Therefore, when other regulations require the preservation of a particular snag, this final standard
requires only that fellers be protected from potential injury from the snag. This is accomplished by keeping all other
felling activity out of the immediate area of that snag.

Second, in the final rule OSHA has addressed the concerns of other commenters by allowing work to commence within two
tree lengths of a marked danger tree, provided that the employer demonstrates that a shorter distance will not create
a hazard for an employee. This change will assure the safety of logging employees without removing significant timber
from production. OSHA notes that the employer bears the burden of demonstrating that a distance of less than two tree
lengths will not create a hazard for an employee. Supervisors should actively participate in identifying and training
employees about providing safe distances. Whether a shorter distance does create a hazard is a case-by-case determination.
What constitutes a safe distance for other work to be conducted will require an evaluation of various factors such
as, but not limited to, the size of the danger tree, how secure it is, its condition, the slope of the work area, and the
presence of other employees in the area. For example, excessive root deterioration or damage might indicate that
the danger tree is unstable and that there is a possibility it could fall. In such case, a two tree-length distance would
be required. 

Some commenters recommended that OSHA designate dislodging a tree by felling another one into it as a safe technique
``in certain situations'' (Ex. 5-74 through 5-92). However, these commenters did not identify any situations
in which it would be safe to dislodge a tree in this manner. There is no information in the record that identifies any
situation in which it is safe to use domino felling to fell a danger tree. In fact, other commenters have indicated they
know of no situation when felling another tree into a danger tree is considered safe practice (Ex. 5-42, 5-46).
OSHA also believes that it is not safe to dislodge a tree in this manner. First, there are already hazards associated
with domino felling trees that are not danger trees. Trying to domino fell danger trees such as lodged trees can only
increase the seriousness of the hazard. One of the factors that makes a tree a danger tree is that the physical damage
to the tree may cause it to fall in an unintended direction. Felling another tree into the danger tree increases the
potential for a misdirected fall. Second, the possibility exists that danger trees being domino felled also will
become lodged, thereby increasing the number of trees to be avoided or removed and, consequently, increasing the
risk to employees when those lodged trees are removed. The safest way to remove a lodged tree, first is remove all unnecessary
employees from the area and then to hook the tree to a skidder, and pull the tree down (Ex. 5-43). Therefore, OSHA
is not permitting removal of any tree, including a danger tree, by domino felling (See discussion of paragraph (h)(1)(ix).


Paragraph (h)(1)(vii) of the final rule requires that each danger tree be carefully checked for signs of loose bark,
broken branches and limbs or other damage before it is felled or removed. This provision also requires that loose bark
and other damage that may create a hazard be removed before felling or removing the tree. This requirement has been
adopted from the proposed rule. In the proposed rule, OSHA specified that snags be carefully checked for dangerous
bark before they are felled and that accessible loose bark be removed before felling. 

One commenter opposed this provision (Ex. 5-65). This commenter said that removing loose bark increases dangers
from above since upper bark will slough off if lower bark is no longer supporting it. As such, this commenter recommended
that OSHA require loose bark to be pinned to the tree. OSHA has changed the final rule to include removing loose bark
or holding it in place.

Paragraph (h)(1)(viii) of the final rule requires that felling activity on any slope when rolling or sliding of trees
or logs is reasonably foreseeable be kept uphill from, or on the same level as, previously felled trees. This provision
has been adopted from the proposed standard and the pulpwood logging rules. Various State standards contain similar
requirements (Ex. 2-19, 2-22, 38K). 

OSHA received various comments on this provision (Ex. 5-7, 5-12, 5-16, 5-17, 5-53, 5-74
through 5-92). Several commenters said that OSHA should more clearly define what constitutes sloping terrain
(Ex. 5-16, 5-21, 5-53, 5-74 through 5-92). These commenters suggested that the provision
be limited to slopes exceeding 25 or 35 percent. They also indicated that mechanical felling in southern states should
be excluded because slopes are gentler and shorter than in other regions. 

The record shows that this provision is necessary to protect employees from being injured by rolling or sliding trees.
The WIR survey supports the need for this work practice requirement. According to the WIR survey, nearly three-fifths
of the workers who reported injuries said that their accidents occurred on moderately or steeply sloped terrain,
and 10 percent of all injured workers blamed the steep terrain for their accident (Ex. 2-1). The OSHA FCI report
indicated that 20 employees were killed when they were struck by rolling trees or logs (Ex. 4-61). 

OSHA has not adopted a precise minimum slope that would trigger this requirement or excempt any region from the requirement,
however, the final rule does address the commenters' concerns by limiting this provision to those sloping terrains
where rolling or sliding of felled trees is reasonably foreseeable. OSHA is aware that logging work sites are often
not completely level, and that many logging sites could be considered to be sloping terrain. Elements other than the
mere slope of the terrain also must be considered in determining whether there is a reasonable possibility that the
trees could roll or slide. When a given slope does not present the reasonable possibility that felled trees will slide
or roll, OSHA agrees that this requirement should not apply. However, when the terrain slopes to the degree that a reasonable
employer would believe that sliding or rolling is foreseeable, then this work practice requirement is necessary
to protect loggers from being injured. 

Whether a particular terrain slope poses a possibility that trees or logs may slide or roll requires an assessment
of the condition of the terrain. All conditions that might contribute to a hazard must be considered (e.g., tree size,
weather conditions). For example, when the terrain is either wet or covered with snow or ice, the possibility of trees
sliding and rolling is greater and these conditions must be considered in determining whether uphill felling is required.
As long as the hazard of sliding or rolling trees exists, felling must be done on the uphill side even if industry practice
has been downhill felling, or even if roads have generally been located on the tops of ridges. 

One commenter said that this provision of the final rule may be counter to some environmental considerations in timber
harvest plans which require opposite felling schemes (Ex. 5-7). However, the commenter has not provided substantive
information to support his assertion. OSHA has previously discussed the danger of manual felling operations being
conducted in adjacent work areas due to the potential for a felled tree falling into another work area. In light of that
the fact that most trees fall down hill when felled, the hazard to employees working below another felling activity
exposes those employees to an unacceptable risk of injury or death. 

Finally, one commenter said downhill felling should be permitted because it can reduce the feller's fatigue (Ex.
5-12). While NIOSH suggests that worker fatigue may be a factor in logging accidents, NIOSH did not recommend
downhill felling as being a method to reduce worker fatigue (Ex. 5-42). Rather, NIOSH said that the employer
should reduce worker fatigue and the potential for accidents that results from such fatigue by planning appropriate
work schedules. NIOSH suggested that the employer's planning of work schedules should include an evaluation of the
amount of heat stress, physical exertion and other factors contributing to fatigue in planning those work schedules.
OSHA agrees with NIOSH that planning appropriate work schedules rather than downhill felling would be the appropriate
way to reduce worker fatigue without exposing the employee to further hazards and to assure that jobs fit the capabilities
of the person. (OSHA is addressing these factors in its rulemaking on ergonomic safety and health management.)

Paragraph (h)(1)(ix) of the final rule prohibits the practice of domino felling. As previously discussed, domino
felling involves cutting wedges and making partial backcuts in a series of trees that form a continuous line. The last
tree is then felled into the line thus pushing the line of trees to the ground in a chain reaction fashion. 

 This requirement was not included in the proposed rule, however, several commenters urged OSHA to prohibit domino
felling in the final rule (Ex. 5-42, 5-46; Tr. W2 231, OR 659). NIOSH said that domino felling was a hazardous
practice because there was a loss of stability in the standing tree when it had been backcut (Ex. 5-42). Therefore,
NIOSH recommended that OSHA include a requirement in the final rule allowing only one tree to be felled at a time. There
are also other hazards associated with domino felling. First, when trees are used to knock down other trees, the likelihood
that the trees will not fall in the expected direction is greatly increased. A small miscalculation in the falling
direction can be significantly magnified down the line and result in serious injury to the feller or other employees
in the area. In addition, a falling tree could hit another object and either fall in another direction or become lodged.
This would require an employee to fell the lodged tree, which is a hazardous operation. 

 Second, the hazards can be magnified when domino felling is not successful in knocking down the entire line of trees.
The feller may be placed in an extremely hazardous situation if he must try to fell any of the line of trees that may remain
standing. For example, part of the line of trees may have fallen over and lodged against the standing tree. A feller
who attempts to fell the final standing tree(s) could be injured when the lodged line of trees and the final tree finally
do fall. The risk of injury is greater because it is more likely that the lodged trees may fall in an unexpected direction,
and the combined weight of the lodged trees further increases the risk. In this sense, the prohibition against domino
felling is similar to the requirement in the final rule that trees be felled in a manner that prevents them from striking
things such as ropes, cables, or power lines. For these reasons, OSHA is requiring that trees be felled one at a time
rather than allowing trees to be used to knock down other trees.

Manual Felling 

 

Paragraph (h)(2) of the final rule specifies various work practices for manual felling. OSHA believes these provisions
are essential to reduce the number of injuries that occur during felling activities. According to the WIR survey,
tree felling is the most dangerous activity in the logging industry. Of those who reported injuries in the WIR survey,
23 percent were engaged in felling trees at the time. 

 OSHA's FCI report also indicates that felling operations are the most hazardous operation in the logging industry
(Ex. 4-61). The report indicated that 43 percent of all employees who died did so when they were felling trees.


 The State of Washington study indicated that more than 40 percent of employees killed from 1977-83 were performing
felling operations (Ex. 4-129). This study concluded that many of the deaths would have been prevented had logging
employees been following safe work practices and had remained out of hazardous areas (e.g., adjacent occupied work
areas). 

 One commenter said that certain of the work practices proposed by OSHA should not be required of each feller (Ex. 5-54).
This commenter said the work practices did not take into account the variation in feller experience, production requirements,
and the trees themselves. This commenter also said the work practice requirements did not allow for innovations in
felling technology and for recognition of other safe ways to perform felling tasks. OSHA points out that these work
practice requirements have been widely recognized and accepted in the logging industry. Most of the State logging
standards contain most of these work practices (Ex. 2-17, 2-18, 2-19, 2-20, 2-23, 38J,
38K). These requirements were included in OSHA's pulpwood logging standard, that adopted the 1971 ANSI logging standard.
In addition, these requirements were contained in the 1978 ANSI logging standard. The ANSI standards are national
consensus standards which were developed, approved and followed by the logging industry itself. Presumably, they
represent what the industry has viewed to be necessary and reasonable to prevent injuries and deaths in this high hazard
industry. 

 In paragraph (h)(2)(i) of the final rule, OSHA requires that before a feller even begins felling a tree, a retreat path
must be planned and cleared. This provision also requires that the retreat path extend diagonally away from the expected
felling line. This provision also includes an exception to the diagonal retreat path when the employer demonstrates
that in the particular situation such a retreat path is not feasible or poses a greater hazard than an alternative retreat
path. The proposed rule contained a requirement for planning and clearing a retreat path before commencing cutting.
However, the proposed rule required that the retreat path ``extend back and diagonally to the rear'' of the expected
felling line. This language also was contained in the 1978 ANSI logging standard. 

 One commenter contended that a diagonal retreat path may not lead to the safest location in the felling area, therefore,
it would be inappropriate for OSHA to designate a required retreat direction in the standard (Ex. 5-35). The
record shows that the clearance of a retreat path so the feller is able to move rapidly and safely away from a falling
tree is essential to prevent injuries. According to the WIR survey, 24 percent of all reported injuries resulted from
being hit by a tree and half of these injuries involved falling trees. OSHA believes there are many kinds of hazards
that necessitate a quick and clear retreat path. For example, the tree being felled can split and part of the tree may
then fall in an unexpected direction. In heavily wooded areas, the tree being felled can strike another tree that can
cause the first tree or parts of either tree to fall or fly in an unexpected direction. In addition, planning and clearing
a path prior to cutting a tree is especially important when the terrain is covered with obstructions such as snow, water
or heavy undergrowth. These obstructions could cause the feller to be injured if they impede the feller's ability
to rapidly retreat or cause him to trip or fall. For these reasons, OSHA has retained the requirement to plan and clear
a retreat path before felling the tree.

OSHA has addressed in the final rule the concerns raised by the commenter. As a general rule, OSHA believes that a diagonal
retreat path is the safest location in the felling area. The ANSI standard, developed by persons experienced in the
logging industry, recognized that same general safe work practice. OSHA recognizes that when the retreat path is
planned prior to cutting, the employer may find that a diagonal retreat path poses greater hazards than an alternative
path. For example, excessive slopes, rocks or other trees in the path of a diagonal retreat may create hazards that
are not present in an alternative retreat path. In such cases, the final rule permits the employee to use an alternate
retreat path. 

 OSHA notes that the employer bears the burden of demonstrating that the diagonal retreat path poses a greater hazard.
OSHA also notes that the exception is a case-by-case determination. That is, the general rule requiring a diagonal
retreat path is to be applied in all manual felling activities. The exception only applies when the feller, in planning
a particular retreat path, determines that a diagonal retreat poses a greater hazard. 

 Paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of the final rule requires that before each tree is felled, conditions shall be evaluated in
the work area and precautions taken so a hazard is not created for an employee. Conditions that must be evaluated include,
but are not limited to, snow and ice accumulation, wind, lean of the tree, dead limbs and location of other trees. This
provision parallels the requirement contained in the proposed rule and the 1978 ANSI logging standard. 

 OSHA did not receive any comments opposing this provision. Many commenters discussed the hazardous nature of working
conditions in the logging industry, and noted that these conditions are constantly changing (Ex. 5-12, Tr.
W1 76, 88). Because conditions can change with each tree that is being felled, it is important that the feller assess
in advance the conditions and hazards that may be present. In order for fellers to understand what conditions and hazards
may be present and must be appraised, it is important that the employer should include this discussion in training
sessions and monthly safety and health meetings. 

 Paragraph (h)(2)(iii) of the final rule requires that each tree be checked for accumulations of snow or ice. This provision
also requires that accumulations of snow and ice that may create a hazard for an employee must be removed before felling
is started in the area or the area must be avoided. This provision parallels the requirement contained in the proposed
rule. 

 One commenter said that this provision would require logging establishments to cease felling operations during
winter months (Ex. 5-51). OSHA does not agree with the characterization that the commenters draw about the proposed
rule. OSHA is aware that logging operations are carried out in many types of weather conditions. OSHA does not believe
that this provision requires logging operations to close down during the winter. However, when accumulations of
snow and ice may create a hazard for an employee, that hazard must be removed or avoided. The record shows that removing
or avoiding hazardous accumulations of snow and ice is necessary to protect logging employees from injury. According
to the WIR survey, six percent of employees injured said that weather conditions such as snow and ice had contributed
to their accident (Ex. 2-1). 

 Paragraph (h)(2)(iv) of the final rule requires that when a spring pole or other tree is under stress, no employee other
than the feller may be closer than two tree lengths when the stress is released. This provision was included in the proposed
rule, however, the proposed rule did not require that employees be at least two tree lengths away. Rather, it required
that employees be in the clear when the stress is released. 

 Various commenters recommended that OSHA establish a uniform minimum safe distance for all work areas (Ex. 5-18,
5-21, 5-34, 5-36, 5-39, 5-63, 5-74 through 5-92; Tr. W2 163, 197). OSHA agrees
with these commenters and has included a minimum two tree-length distance in this provision. The record shows that
this distance is necessary to protect employees from being injured or killed by trees under stress. According to the
WIR survey, 11 percent of employees who reported injuries said that wood being under tension had contributed to their
accident (Ex. 2-1). The OSHA FCI report indicated that four employees were killed when they were struck by propelled
or whiplashing tree limbs (Ex. 4-61).

Paragraphs (h)(2) (v), (vi) and (vii) require undercutting and backcutting of each tree being felled. 
In paragraph (h)(2)(v) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that each tree being felled be undercut unless the employer
demonstrates that felling the particular tree without an undercut will not create a hazard for an employee. This paragraph
also requires that the undercut be of a size so the tree will not split and will fall in the intended direction. The proposed
rule contained a provision requiring undercutting of each tree being felled, however, the proposed provision did
not provide for any exceptions. OSHA received many comments on this provision, which have been discussed above in
the Major Issues section. 
At paragraphs (h)(2) (vi) and (vii) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that each tree be backcut. OSHA is also requiring
that the backcut allow for sufficient hinge wood to guide the tree and prevent it from prematurely slipping or twisting
off the trunk. OSHA is requiring that the backcut be above the horizontal cut of the undercut. In the final rule, OSHA
is allowing one exception to the backcut requirements. In tree pulling operations, the backcut may be at or below the
horizontal cut of the undercut. The proposed rule also contained provision requiring backcutting of each tree being
felled. The proposed rule did not allow any exceptions to the backcut requirement. OSHA received many comments on
these provisions, which have been discussed above in the Major Issues section. 



Bucking and Limbing 


Paragraph (h)(3) of the final rule establishes various necessary work practices for bucking and limbing activities.
According to the WIR survey, 12 percent of the reported logging injuries occurred when the employee was bucking or
limbing (Ex. 2-1). The OSHA FCI report showed that 16 employees were killed during bucking and limbing operations
(Ex. 4-61). The work practice requirements contained in this paragraph address the hazards presented by log
movement on slopes, by wind-thrown timber and by trees that are yarded for bucking. 
Paragraph (h)(3)(i) of the final rule requires that bucking and limbing that are done on any slope where rolling or
sliding of trees or logs is reasonably foreseeable must be done on the uphill side of the tree, unless the employer demonstrates
that it is not feasible for bucking or limbing to be done on the uphill side. This paragraph also requires that whenever
bucking or limbing is done on the downhill side, the tree must be secured against movement to prevent rolling or sliding.
The proposed rule also contained a provision requiring bucking and limbing to be done from the uphill side. 
This provision was supported by one commenter (Ex. 5-17). The record shows that bucking and limbing from the
uphill side is necessary to protect employees from being hit or crushed by rolling or sliding trees or logs. As discussed
above, according to the WIR survey, nearly three-fifths of workers who reported injuries were working on moderate
to steep terrain at the time of their accident, and 10 percent of all injured workers said steep terrain had been a factor
in their accident (Ex. 2-1). Bucking or limbing can cause loss of support for the tree and cause it to shift, roll
or slide unexpectedly. Blocking or chocking a tree on a slope can never provide as much protection as avoiding the hazard
in the first place. The record shows that the only work method in which it can be assured that an employee will not be hurt
by a rolling or sliding tree is by performing bucking and limbing on the uphill side. As such, bucking and limbing from
the downhill side is permitted only in those cases when the employer is able to demonstrate that it is not feasible to
work from the uphill side. In those particular cases, the tree must be restrained to reduce as much as possible the possibility
of the tree rolling or sliding. OSHA notes that the burden of demonstrating infeasibility is on the employer. In addition,
the issue of the infeasibility of bucking and limbing from the uphill side must be determined on a case-by-case basis
when the tree and the conditions in the area are carefully assessed.

Paragraph (h)(3)(ii) requires that when bucking or limbing wind-thrown trees, precautions must be taken to prevent
the root wad, tree butt, or logs from striking an employee. These precautions include, but are not limited to, chocking
or moving the tree to a stable position before bucking or limbing. The proposed rule also contained a requirement for
bucking or limbing wind-thrown trees. However, the proposed rule did not specify what precautions should be taken.

Several commenters said that the proposed provision was too general to be useful (Ex. 5-21, 5-36, 5-74
through 5-92). These commenters said that this was one of a series of proposed work practice requirements which
should be deleted from the final rule and included in topics that must be covered in training sessions. OSHA believes
that this work practice requirement is necessary to address the significant risk of injury during these activities.
According to the WIR survey, 12 percent of reported injuries occurred during bucking and limbing. OSHA does agree
with the commenters that these work practice requirements should also be addressed in training sessions. 


Chipping 


At paragraph (h)(4) of the final rule, OSHA has specified various work practices regarding chipping that is performed
at in-woods locations. Paragraph (h)(4)(i) of the final rule requires that access covers or doors not be opened until
the drum and disc is at a complete stop. The access covers and doors are the means by which employees are safeguarded
from the risk of contacting these parts while they are moving. This provision is adopted from the proposed rule. The
1978 ANSI logging standard also contains a similar provision. OSHA did not receive any comment opposing this provision.

OSHA believes that this requirement is necessary to keep employees away from the dangerous moving drums, discs, knives
and blower blades of a chipper. OSHA's FCI reported indicated that two employees have been killed while operating
a chipper or trying to free jammed logs (Ex. 4-61). The moving chipper mechanism presents significant hazards,
and employees need protection from contact with those mechanisms when they are moving. 
Paragraph (h)(4)(ii) of the final rule requires that infeed and discharge ports be guarded to prevent contact with
the disc, knives, or blower blades. This provision has been adopted from the proposed rule. There were no comments
opposing this provision. 
Paragraph (h)(4)(iii) of the final rule requires that the chipper be shut down and locked out in accordance with 29
CFR 1910.147 when an employee performs any servicing of maintenance on the chipper. The proposed rule required that
the chipper be shut down and locked out before an employee works in the infeed. 
OSHA did not receive any comments opposing lockout of the chipper while working on the infeed. OSHA received one comment
stating that lockout should be expanded to apply when an employee is working on the drive mechanism or chipping disc
(Ex. 5-28). The lockout/tagout standard, 29 CFR 1910.147, applies to servicing and maintenance of all machines
and equipment in which the 

unexpected

 energization or start up of the machine or equipment, or release of stored energy could cause injury to employees.
This includes machines and equipment used in logging operations. 
The lockout-tagout standard permits employers to either place a lock or tag on any machine before beginning servicing.
However, OSHA believes that the environmental conditions involved in logging operations necessitates the use of
locks rather than tags when servicing chippers. As OSHA stated in the preamble of the lockout/tagout standard, it
is intended to interact with any new or revised standard to address the use of specific control measures on an individual
basis (54 FR 36644, 36665, Sept. 1, 1989). Selection of the specific method of control, at that time, will reflect a
thorough evaluation of the extent of exposure to the hazard, the risk of injury involving the particular machine or
industry, and the feasibility of applying a particular method of control. OSHA also pointed in the preamble of the
lockout/tagout standard that damage to or loss of tagout devices is a serious drawback to the use of tagout. Logging
operations are carried out in all kinds of weather, including rain, snow, ice and wind, and there is a significant possibility
that tags could be damaged or lost. In such circumstances, OSHA believes only locking machinery will provide adequate
protection for employees who are servicing it. Therefore, OSHA is requiring chippers to be shut down and lockout out
before an employee performs any servicing or maintenance activities. 
Paragraph (h)(4)(iv) of the final rule requires that detached chippers be chocked during usage on any slope when movement
of the chipper is reasonably foreseeable. As with other mobile equipment that is intended to be operated from a stationary
position, the unexpected movement of the equipment can endanger employees who are either operating the equipment
or in the path of the equipment when it moves. The vibration caused by the operation of the equipment can enhance the
potential for unintended equipment movement. Chocking of mobile equipment to prevent movement is recognized throughout
industry as a necessary and appropriate means to prevent unintended movement. For example, OSHA requires in 29 CFR
1910.178(k)(1) that trailers be chocked before being boarded by powered industrial trucks.

Yarding 


Paragraph (h)(5) specifies various work practice requirements covering yarding activities. Paragraph (h)(5)(i)
of the final rule requires that logs not be moved until each employee is in the clear. This provision has been adopted
from the proposed rule. Movement of logs when employees are in the immediate area can result in an injury to those employees.

According to the WIR survey, almost 20 percent of employees injured were involved in yarding operations at the time
of their accident (Ex. 2-1). When a log is moved on uneven, unimproved terrain, the exact path that the log will
follow is impossible to predict. When they are being moved, logs may roll over, or the loose end of a log may flip back
and forth (fishtail). Movement in an unanticipated direction can cause the log to strike an employee, causing serious
injury. OSHA has included this requirement in the final rule to ensure that when logs are moved, all personnel must
be safely positioned and not exposed to a hazard. OSHA did not receive any comments opposing this provision. 
Paragraph (h)(5)(ii) of the final rule requires that each choker be hooked and unhooked from the uphill side or end
of the tree or log when rolling or sliding is reasonably foreseeable, unless the employer demonstrates that it is not
feasible in the particular situation to hook or unhook the choker from the uphill side. This provision also requires
that when the choker is hooked or unhooked from the downhill side, the log shall be securely blocked or chocked to prevent
rolling or swinging. The proposed rule also specified that chokers be hooked and unhooked from the uphill side when
feasible unless the log is securely blocked to prevent rolling or swinging. The 1978 ANSI logging standard also contained
a similar requirement. There were no comments opposing this provision. 
Employees who hook and unhook chokers on sloping terrains face the same hazard of rolling or sliding logs as do fellers,
buckers, limbers and other employees. According to the WIR survey, 19 percent of the injuries reported occurred during
choker setting, hooking and unhooking (Ex. 2-1). In addition, the WIR survey indicates that nearly three-fifths
of all workers injured were working on moderate to steep terrain at the time of their accidents. The final rule makes
clear OSHA's intention that all hooking and unhooking of chokers must be from the uphill side or end when rolling or
sliding is reasonably foreseeable. This is the only work location in which it can be assured that an employee will not
be hurt by a rolling or sliding tree. For this reason, hooking or unhooking chokers from the downhill side is not permitted
simply because the tree has been secured with a chock. Rather, the employer must evaluate on a case-by-case basis whether
it is possible to hook or unhook from the uphill side. Only when the employer has demonstrated that hooking or unhooking
the choker from the uphill side or end is not feasible in the particular situation is hooking or unhooking the choker
from the down hill side permitted. 
Paragraph (h)(5)(iii) of the final rule requires that each choker be positioned near the end of the log or tree length.
This provision was adopted from the proposed rule. There were no comments opposing this provision. 
Positioning a choker at the end of the log ensures that the log is moved along its longitudinal axis. Hooking up and skidding
a tree or log requires much less energy than trying to move the tree or log sideways. If an employee were to try to move
a tree or log by dragging it sideways (perpendicular to its longitudinal axis) the tree or log could become wedged behind
another tree, a rock, or a stump, causing the premature failure of the haulage equipment and the possibility of employee
injury if the restraint were to suddenly break or release the tree or log. Because of these hazards, the usual practice
in non-cable yarding is to skid or drag a tree or log when moving it. When trees or logs are skidded, the choker is hooked
to the end of the tree or log and it is pulled along the ground. 
Paragraph (h)(5)(iv) of the final rule requires that each machine be positioned during winching so the machine and
winch are operated within their design limits. The proposed rule required that the machine be positioned so that the
winch line is as near in alignment as possible with the long axis of the machine, unless the machine is designed to be
used under different conditions of alignment. 
One commenter opposed the proposed provision for several reasons (Ex. 5-34). First, the commenter said that
some machines, such as cats and skidders, are designed to sustain winching strain from a much broader angle than straight
behind the machine, therefore, the proposed provision was needlessly restrictive if the machine is being operated
within its rated capacity. Second, the commenter said it was not possible to comply with the provision in many situations.
For example, the commenter said arches are normally equipped with fairleads and grapples that swing sideways out
of alignment with the long axis of the machine. Third, the commenter said the provision would create a greater hazard
when winching is conducted on very steep terrain. In such cases, the commenter said, it is more important that the machine
be positioned to assure maximum stability rather than positioning the machine relative to the log being winched.





OSHA recognizes that exact alignment is not always possible in the woods. OSHA also recognizes that a machine may have
a winch mounted on it that may work off the side or front of the machine, and that aligning the winch line with the long
axis of the machine may not be the safest manner to operate the winch.

OSHA agrees with this commenter that what is most important is that the design limits of the machine and winch not be
exceeded. Therefore, OSHA has revised the wording of this provision to ensure that winching operations conducted
with machines are performed within the design limitations of the machines. 

Paragraph (h)(5)(v) of the final rule requires that no line be moved unless the yarder operator has clearly received
and understood the signal to do so. This provision also requires that when the yarder operator is in doubt, the operator
must repeat the signal and wait for a confirming signal before moving any line. This provision has been adopted from
the proposed rule. A similar provision also was contained in the 1978 ANSI logging standard and in various State logging
standards (Ex. 2-14, 2-18, 2-20, 38J). OSHA did not receive any comments opposing this provision.


OSHA believes that adequate communication is necessary for the safe movement of trees and logs. If the yarder operator
begins moving the tree or log before the choker setter or chaser has moved to a safe location, the choker setter or chaser
could be injured if struck or caught by a yarding line, carriage, or choker, or by the tree or log. 

Paragraph (h)(5)(vi) of the final rule requires that the load shall not exceed the rated capacity of the pallet or other
carrier. This provision has been adopted from the proposed rule. OSHA did not receive any comments opposing this provision.
This provision is an outgrowth of the requirement that the rated capacity of machines shall not be exceeded. In order
to prevent machines from rollovers and tipovers, it is also essential that loads on trailers not exceed the maximum
capacity the trailer was designed to carry and the machine was designed to transport. If loads exceed the maximum capacity,
the machine operator will be at greater risk of rollover or tipover. As discussed above, a significant number of fatalities
have occurred in the logging industry due to rollover accidents. NIOSH reported that 80 logging employees were killed
in machine rollover accidents from 1980-85 (Ex. 5-42). The State of Washington reported that 12 logging
employees were killed in rollover accidents from 1977-83 (Ex. 4-129). 

Paragraph (h)(5)(vii) of the final rule requires that towed equipment must be attached to the machine or vehicle in
such a manner as to allow a 90 degree turn, to prevent overrunning of the towing machine or vehicle and to assure that
the operator is always in control of the towed equipment. Towed equipment includes but is not limited to skid pans,
pallets, arches and trailers. This provision parallels the proposed requirement. There were no comments opposing
this provision. 

OSHA's intention in this provision is two-fold. First, OSHA believes this provision is necessary to help reduce the
potential for rollover of vehicles or machines that are moving equipment to various work sites. For example, a trailer
carrying a maximum load could tip over or roll over and cause the towing machine or vehicle to roll over if the loaded
trailer cannot make a full 90 degree turn. Second, this provision is necessary to help assure that material handling
equipment is not overloaded. This provision must be viewed in conjunction with the requirement that loads must not
exceed the rated capacity of the trailer or other carrier on which it is being towed. For example, when towed equipment
exceeds the rated capacity of the towing trailer, it may overrun the towing machine or vehicle. When the rate capacity
of the trailer is exceeded there is an increased likelihood that the operator may lose control over the towed equipment
and an accident could result. 
Paragraph (h)(5)(viii) of the final rule requires that each yarding machine or vehicle, including its load, must
be operated with safe clearance from all obstructions. This provision has been adopted from the proposed rule. There
were no comments opposing this requirement. 

Paragraph (h)(5)(ix) of the final rule requires that each yarded tree must be placed in a location that does not create
a hazard for an employee and be placed in an orderly manner so that the trees are stable before other work, such as bucking
or limbing, is commenced. The proposed rule required that trees yarded for bucking shall be safely located and stable
before bucking is commenced. There were no comments opposing this provision.

<TEXT>
 

In the final rule, OSHA has expanded this provision to provide that no work is commenced until yarded trees are stabilized
and safely located. OSHA believes it is necessary to apply this provision to all work done in the area of yarded trees.
The WIR survey indicates that the single greatest cause of accidents in the logging industry is being injured by a tree,
log or limb and a significant number of employees were injured performing bucking and limbing (Ex. 2-1). If operations,
such as bucking or limbing, are located too close to other work operations, unsuspecting loggers could be injured
by a rolling log. Moreover, if yarded trees or stacks of trees are not stabilized, loggers performing work activities
involving these trees could be at substantial risk of injury if the unstabilized trees move, shift or roll. 

In the final rule, OSHA has not retained two proposed requirements from this paragraph. The first would have required
the examination of spar trees for defects before they are rigged. This provision has been deleted because it relates
to the construction of cable yarding systems that is not covered by the final rule. 

The second provision would have required unstable trees and spars to be guyed to ensure stability. Some commenters
said that requiring employees to climb on and rig unstable trees presents a greater hazard than does felling an unguyed
tree (Ex. 5-17, 5-21). The weight of the climber and his rigging gear could cause the tree to break off and
fall over, resulting in serious injury or death to the climber. OSHA has addressed in other ways the hazards associated
with danger trees through other practice requirements. For example, the final rule requires danger trees to be felled
or removed before any work can be commenced in the area. 



Loading and Unloading 



Paragraph (h)(6) of the final rule specifies various work practice requirements regarding loading and unloading
trees onto transport machines or vehicles. These requirements were based on those in the 1978 logging standard and
various State logging standards (Ex. 2-17, 2-18, 2-19, 2-20, 2-22, 38J, 38K). OSHA believes
these work practices are necessary to protect employees from being hit by machines, vehicles, trees and logs during
loading and unloading. The WIR survey indicates that five percent of the injuries reported occurred during loading
or unloading (Ex. 2-1). The State of Washington study indicated that five percent of all deaths occurred during
loading and unloading operations (Ex. 4-129). 

Paragraph (h)(6)(i) of the final rule requires that the transport machine or vehicle be positioned to provide working
clearance between the vehicle and deck of trees or logs. This provision parallels the requirement contained in the
proposed rule. The 1978 ANSI logging standard contained a similar provision. 

Several commenters supported the need for adequate room between transport equipment and trees or logs (Ex. 5-21,
5-74 through 5-92). These commenters pointed out that room needs to be provided on the landing for the transport
machine or vehicle and its counterweights, especially when landings are on sloped terrain. The record supports these
commenters' position. According to the State of Washington study, almost 10 percent of all deaths reported occurred
when an employee was struck by mobile equipment and five percent of all deaths involved employees performing loading
operations (Ex. 4-129). OSHA believes that the employer must consider several factors in determining an adequate
work clearance for loading and unloading. These factors include, but are not limited to, the type of loading machine
and transport vehicle being used, the physical characteristics of the load being moved, and the layout of the area
where the operation is being conducted. For example, if the vehicle is a self-loading log truck, it will have to be positioned
close to the deck of logs to allow the truck to be loaded. On the other hand, if a crane or other material handling machine
is used to load and unload the transport vehicle, the machine must be positioned so that it can reach both the deck of
logs and the vehicle without exceeding the rated capacity of the machine. 

Paragraph (h)(6)(ii) of the final rule requires that only the loading or unloading machine operator and other personnel
that the employer demonstrates are essential shall be allowed in the work area during loading and unloading. This
provision parallels the provision contained in the proposed rule and in the 1978 ANSI logging standard. There were
no comments opposing this provision. OSHA believes this provision is necessary because, as discussed above, many
injuries and fatalities in the logging industry involve loading operations. For example, the State of Washington
study reported that three employees were killed when they were struck by logs falling from the transport vehicle during
loading (Ex. 4-129).

In the final rule, OSHA is clarifying its intention that the employer bears the burden of proving that personnel other
than the machine operator who are in the loading or unloading area are essential to that activity. OSHA notes that this
is a case-by-case determination that requires the employer to evaluate the needs and conditions present at the time.



Paragraph (h)(6)(iii) of the final rule requires that no transport vehicle operator remain in the cab during loading
and unloading if logs are carried or moved over the cab, unless the employer demonstrates that it is essential for the
operator to be in the cab. This provision also requires that when the transport vehicle operator remains in the cab
during loading or unloading operations, the employer must provide operator protection such as, but not limited to,
reinforcement of the cab. The proposed rule specifies that no transport vehicle operator remain in the cab during
loading and unloading unless the employer demonstrates that it was necessary for the operator to be in the cab. The
1978 ANSI logging standard contained a similar requirement. 

OSHA received many comments on this provision (Ex. 5-17, 5-21, 5-33, 5-34, 5-74 through
5-92). Several commenters stated that there were so many situations in which it is essential for transport vehicle
operators to be in the cab or on the vehicle during loading and unloading that the exceptions would overwhelm the rule
(Ex. 5-21, 5-34, 5-36, 5-74 through 5-92). For example, commenters said that self-loading
logging trucks must be operated by the driver from an elevated seat above the cab (Ex. 5-21, 5-36). In other
loading operations the operator is required to move the transport vehicle back and forth in the loading chute to position
the log on the load (Ex. 5-34). 

Several commenters said that the cab may be the safest place for the transport vehicle operator to be during loading
and unloading (Ex. 5-17, 5-33, 5-34). One commenter said that greater hazards were posed for the
operator when not in the cab (Ex. 5-34). For example, the operator outside the cab can be struck by logs that fall
off the load or come out of the jaws of the loading machine, or by the loading machine itself. This commenter pointed
out that in the State of Washington there have been numerous fatalities and serious injuries reported when the operator
was outside the cab, but none reported when the operator was in the cab (Ex. 5-34). As such, this commenter said
that many logging establishments will only permit logs to be unloaded if the transport vehicle operator is in the cab
(Ex. 5-34). 

OSHA believes the record shows that in some situations the safest place for the transport vehicle operator will be
in the cab (e.g., Ex. 4-129). The WIR survey appears to support this position, in that only three percent of all
injuries reported involved mobile equipment (Ex. 2-1). By contrast, almost one-fourth of all injuries reported
resulted from being hit by a tree or falling in the work site. However, there are some hazards to operators who remain
in cabs during loading and unloading. Any time logs are carried or moved over the cab, it is possible due to equipment
failure or operator error that the log could fall on the cab and seriously injure the operator. 

In other standards OSHA has recognized the hazard of carrying loads over people. These standards include requirements
that material handling equipment operators avoid this practice (

See

 29 CFR 1910.179, 29 CFR 1910.180, 29 CFR 1910.181). In many new self-loading trucks, the hoist mechanism is behind
the cab, a location which prevents the movement of logs over the cab (Ex. 5-71). In other situations, however,
logs are still moved or carried over the cab. It is not safe for the operator to be in the cab in those situations. Therefore,
when logs are carried or moved over the cab, the final rule requires that the operator not remain in the cab if the employer
has not demonstrated that it is essential for the operator to do so. If it is essential for the operator to be in the cab
when logs are carried or moved over the cab, the employer must provide protection for the operator. The final rule states
that this protection includes but is not limited to reinforcement of the cab.

Paragraph (h)(6)(iv) of the final rule requires that each log be placed on the transport vehicle in an orderly manner
and tightly secured. This provision parallels the requirement contained in the proposed rule. There were no comments
opposing this provision. 

OSHA believes that this provision is necessary to protect employees from the hazards that result from haphazard loading
and inadequately securing the load. For example, when the load is not properly stacked and/or tightly secured, logs
can swing in the tie downs and hit an employee. In addition, the load can shift and cause both the trailer and transport
machine or vehicle to rollover. Proper stowage of vehicle loads has the added advantage of providing, in most cases,
a more compact load with a lower center of gravity, one that is safer to move. 

Paragraph (h)(6)(v) of the final rule requires that the load be positioned to prevent slippage or loss during handling
and transport. This requirement parallels the provision contained in the proposed rule. OSHA did not receive any
comments opposing this provision. A load that is improperly positioned can roll or shift at any time, thereby potentially
endangering any employee who might be close at hand. 

Paragraph (h)(6)(vi) of the final rule requires that each stake and chock used to trip loads must be constructed so
the tripping mechanism is activated on the side opposite the release of the load. OSHA has adopted this provision from
the proposed rule. The 1978 ANSI logging standard also contained a similar provision. There were no comments opposing
this provision. OSHA believes this provision is necessary to protect employees from sudden or unexpected shifts
or movements of the logs when a load is released. Only by keeping employees out of the potential paths of the shifting
or moving logs can there be assurance that the employee will not be struck by a log. 

Paragraph (h)(6)(vii) of the final rule requires that each tie down be left in place over the peak log to secure the logs
until the unloading lines or other equivalent protection have been put in place. This provision also specifies that
a stake of sufficient strength to withstand forces of shifting logs shall be considered to provide protection equivalent
to a tie down, provided that the logs are not loaded higher than the stake. This provision parallels the requirement
contained in the proposed rule. 

The West Virginia Forestry Association supported this provision (Ex. 5-54). They said that several recent
serious logging accidents had occurred in their state because logs loaded too high have fallen off the transport vehicle.


Due to the vibration of the load during transport, the load can shift or move so that when the restraints are removed,
the load will roll or otherwise fall off the truck, thereby endangering the employee who must remove the restraints.
For this reason, OSHA has specified the necessary and appropriate work practices that must be followed to ensure the
safe unloading of transport vehicles. 

Paragraph (h)(6)(viii) of the final rule requires that each tie down be released only from the side on which the unloading
machine operates. This provision also permits two exceptions to this requirement in situations when the tie down
is released by a remote control device and when the employee making the release is protected by racks, stanchions or
other protection the employer demonstrates is capable of withstanding the force of moving and shifting logs. This
requirement parallels the provision contained in the proposed rule and the 1978 ANSI logging standard. 

Several commenters suggested that the exceptions to the release requirement be eliminated (Ex. 5-21, 5-36,
5-74 through 5-92). However, these commenters did not provide any discussion to support their position.
OSHA believes that adequate protection is provided in the alternate releasing methods that are excepted from this
provision to protect the machine or vehicle operator from being hit by moving or shifting trees or logs. 



Transport 



Paragraph (h)(7) of the final rule requires the transport vehicle operator to assure that each tie down is tight before
transporting the load. In addition, this paragraph requires that while en route, the operator shall check and tighten
tie downs whenever there is reason to believe that the tie downs have loosened or the load has shifted. The proposed
rule also contained a provision requiring the transport operator to assure that tie downs have been tightened and
to check and tighten the tie downs as necessary while en route. The 1978 ANSI logging standard contained a provision
similar to the proposed rule.

One commenter opposed the provision, believing that the provision required transport vehicle operators to implement
a regular schedule of stopping and checking on tie downs, regardless of whether there is reason to suspect they are
loose (Ex. 5-35). OSHA has more clearly stated its original intention in the final that the operator must check
tie downs whenever there is reason to believe they are loose or the load has shifted. For example, this would occur if
an operator can feel the load shift, or knows that the transport vehicle has hit an object or pothole which jarred the
load. OSHA believes this work practice is necessary to protect the transport vehicle operator from having an accident
due to logs shifting or breaking the tie downs. In addition, this provision is necessary to protect the transport vehicle
operator from being hit by shifting or moving trees when he unloads the vehicle. 



Storage 



Paragraph (h)(8) of the final rule requires that each deck of logs be stacked and located so it is stable and provides
each employee with enough room to safely move and work in the area. This provision has been adopted from the proposal.
The 1978 ANSI logging standard contained a similar requirement. There were no comments opposing this provision.


This provision combines two different requirements. First, this paragraph requires that decks and piles of logs
be constructed so they are stable. OSHA believes that decks must be carefully stacked so logs do not shift, roll or fall
off the deck and strike an employee who may be working or passing through the storage area. Second, this paragraph requires
that the work activities in the vicinity of the storage are well-planned so enough room is provided for those work activities
so that an employee is not harmed if the stacked logs shift, roll or fall. OSHA believes these work practices are necessary
to protect employees working in the landing area. According to the WIR survey, 20 percent of injuries reported involved
accidents at landing areas. 



Paragraph (i) Training 



In paragraph (i) of the final rule OSHA has specified various training requirements. For several reasons OSHA believes
training is a critical element in a integrated control program to reduce the number of accidents, and consequently,
the number of fatalities and injuries in the logging industry. First, the logging industry is a high hazard industry.
Employees need to be made aware of the various hazards so they can actively participate in making the workplace safe.
According to the WIR survey, 10 percent of the workers who reported injuries said that being unaware of the hazard had
contributed to their accident. 

Second, training is also essential in achieving compliance with the substantive requirements of the standard, including
the use of personal protective equipment and safe work practices. Without effective training, employees may not
be aware of how to perform their job safely or how the integrated controls can reduce injuries and fatalities. Third,
training is especially important in complying with the logging standard because the standard relies heavily on safe
work practices to prevent accidents from occurring. Employees who are not trained in how to perform their job safely
can put themselves and other employees at risk of injury. Various studies of accidents in the logging industry indicate
that poor work practices are a major contributing factor (Ex. 2-1, 4-3, 4-14, 4-15, 4-61,
4-63, 4-121, 4-125, 4-129, 4-138, 4-172, 5-20). For example, according
to an accident study conducted by one commenter, 40 percent of accidents were due to poor planning, 40 percent were
due to poor technique, and 15 to 18 percent were due to carelessness (Ex. 5-20). Only 2 to 5 percent of the accidents
were due to equipment failure. The WIR survey indicated that poor work practices of employees or a co-worker were a
contributing factor in more than one-half of all accidents reported (Ex. 2-1). OSHA's FCI report indicated
that unsafe work practices and misjudgments accounted for 42 percent of logging employees who were killed (Ex. 4-61).

<TEXT>
 

Fourth, training is necessary to correct unsafe behavior before it results in injury to the employee or others. In
the WIR survey, injured loggers reported that among the factors that contributed to the accident were coworker's
activity, misjudging time and distance needed to avoid injury, using wrong cutting methods and not paying full attention
to work. In addition, a State of Washington study of fatalities in the logging industry from 1977-83 concluded
that over 90 percent of the deaths had been preventable (Ex. 4-129). Therefore, when unsafe behavior is observed,
it is important that proper work practices be reinforced through additional training. Fifth, according to the WIR
survey, more than one third of all those injured had never received training. Moreover, more than one half of injured
loggers working in non-western States (i.e., States without logging standards and training requirements) had never
received training. 

Sixth, the logging industry itself supports the value of training in reducing accidents (Ex. 4-181, 5-6,
5-17, 5-19, 5-20, 5-22, 5-29, 5-33, 5-42, 5-43, 5-44, 5-45,
5-47, 5-59, 9-5, 9-6; Tr. W2 125, OR 566). Many commenters said their accident rates decreased
after they implemented a training program (Ex. 5-33, 9-5, 9-6; Tr. W2 125, OR 566). One company achieved
a 63-percent reduction in lost workdays within a year of implementing training (Tr. W2 125). The Montana Logging Association
reported that member companies had decreased accidents by 52 percent after implementing training (Tr. OR 566). A
study for the International Woodworkers of America found a 71-percent reduction in accidents in establishments
in the Pacific Northwest region who had implemented training programs (Ex. 4-181). 

Paragraph (i)(1) requires that training be provided for each employee, including supervisors, at no cost to the employee.
The proposed rule also required each employee to be trained. This provision clarifies OSHA's intent that supervisors
also must receive training. OSHA believes that it is important that supervisors be trained since they are responsible
for making work assignments, determining work areas, providing consultation when hazardous situations arise,
determining when new employees can begin to work independently, and identifying and correcting unsafe job performance
of employees they supervise. 

Some commenters raised the issue of cost and availability of training programs, especially for small establishments
(Ex. 5-19, 5-32, 5-51). However, other commenters said there are training resources that are readily
available for logging establishments (Ex. 5-20, 5-27, 5-52, 5-69, 36, 9-1). These include
logging associations and companies which currently offer logging training programs and traveling training seminars,
and video tapes which are available to employers. For example, the Alaska Timber Insurance Exchange has established
a video library for policyholders to use as training supplements (Ex. 9-15). The American Pulpwood Association
said it was developing a logging training that was to be available by the end of 1989 (Ex. 5-27). The Associated
Oregon Loggers has also developed logging training programs for member companies (Ex. 36). One training company
indicated it was currently providing a variety of different logging training programs in six different States (Ex.
5-20). OSHA also notes that several commenters have expressed their willingness to work with OSHA to train loggers
(Ex. 5-18, 5-20, 5-27, 5-47, 5-52, 5-69). 

Paragraph (i)(2) requires that training be provided as follows: as soon as possible but not later than the effective
date of this section for initial training of each current employee who has not previously received training; prior
to initial assignment for each new employee who has not previously received training; whenever an employee is assigned
new work tasks, tools, equipment, machines or vehicles; and whenever an employee demonstrates unsafe job performance.
When the proposed rule did not require initial training for each current employee, the proposed rule would have required
training prior to initial assignment; annual retraining of each employee; and retraining whenever changes in job
assignment would expose the employee to new or additional hazards. OSHA received many comments on the training provisions,
some of which have already been discussed above in the Major Issues section.

Many commenters raised the issue of whether experienced and/or previously trained employees would be required to
be retrained (Ex. 5-19, 5-21, 5-28, 5-29, 5-33, 5-35, 5-39, 5-43, 5-49,
5-74 through 5-92, 9-1; Tr. W1 63, OR 85). Some commenters favored training of all workers, regardless
of their previous employment experience (Ex. 5-19, 5-28, 5-29, 5-35). Other commenters said
that previously trained or experienced workers should be excepted from training requirements (Ex. 5-21, 5-36,
5-39, 5-43, 5-49, 5-52, 5-74 through 5-92). 
As discussed above in the Major Issues section, OSHA believes that employees who have never received training must
be trained, regardless of their level of experience. The need to provide training for experienced loggers who have
not previously received such training is supported by the WIR survey, that indicates that over one third of those injured
had never received training and 56 percent of those injured had worked in the logging industry for 5 years or more. By
contrast, only 22 percent of those injured had worked in the logging industry for one year or less. In addition, the
WIR survey indicates that the employees who were injured performed the activity in which they were injured on almost
a daily basis. (OSHA is allowing an exception to initial training for previously trained employees. See discussion
of paragraph (i)(5)). 
OSHA also received several comments on annual retraining of employees. Some commenters said annual retraining is
necessary (Ex. 5-34, 5-43, 9-3, 9-9, 9-13, 9-20). One commenter said that machine
operators should be retrained at least annually (Ex. 5-34). However, other commenters questioned the need
for annual retraining of loggers and suggested that retraining could be handled in regular safety and health meetings
(Ex. 5-19, 5-29, 5-43). One commenter also said retraining should be limited to an ``as needed basis''
(Ex. 5-19). 
OSHA has addressed these concerns in the final rule. Instead of an annual retraining provision, the final rule contains
provisions requiring employers to hold safety and health meetings at least once a month (paragraph (i)(11)), and
to retrain any employee who demonstrates unsafe job performance. OSHA agrees with the commenters that these new provisions
are more responsive to addressing new hazards and unsafe job performance than is an annual retraining requirement.
These provisions also require the employer to address unsafe job performance immediately. These provisions require
the employer to address new hazards as they appear in the workplace in monthly safety and health meetings. In addition
to being more responsive to hazards as they appear in the workplace, OSHA believes these provisions will be less burdensome
on employers, especially small employers with limited resources. OSHA anticipates that only a portion of employees
will need to be retrained due to unsafe job performance. Also OSHA believes that for many employers ongoing monthly
safety and health meetings will be incorporated into job planning meetings that are well-established in the logging
industry. (Safety and health meetings are addressed further in discussion of paragraph (i)(11)). 
OSHA received comments supporting the need for training of new inexperienced employees and training employees assigned
to new job tasks, tools, equipment, machines or vehicles (Ex. 5-19, 5-21, 5-28). There were no comments
opposing these provisions, therefore, OSHA has retained these requirements in the final rule.

OSHA has added the requirement of retraining of employees demonstrating unsafe job performance based on practice
in the industry. OSHA received comment that some employers who are providing training do require retraining where
unsafe job performance is identified (Ex. 29). 
The proposed rule also contained minimum training elements that included recognition of safety hazards associated
with the employee's particular work tasks and the protective and preventive measures to deal with those hazards;
recognition and prevention of general safety hazards in the logging industry; and safe use and maintenance of any
machine, equipment or tool used by an employee. One commenter agreed that training should list the hazards of each
step of an employee's job and describe how these particular hazards could be controlled (Ex. 5-17). There were
no comments opposing this provision. 
In the final rule, OSHA has added the requirement that employees be trained in the procedures, practices and requirements
of the employer's work site in recognition of the number of comments who describe the logging industry as highly transient
(Ex. 5-21, 5-74 through 5-92). While new employees may be experienced and well-trained in the recognition
of hazards of the job and in the safe use of equipment of the trade, they may be unaware of the operating protocol of a particular
establishment, such as how work activities are organized, or what system of signals is being used. OSHA has also added
a provision in the final rule requiring that each employee be trained in the requirements of this section. OSHA believes
it is important that employees know the various provisions of this section so they can actively participate in contributing
to their own protection. This provision is included in other OSHA standards (e.g., 29 CFR 1910.132, 29 CFR 1910.146,
29 CFR 1910.1047). 
Paragraph (i)(4) of the final rule permits the employer to limit training of an employee due to unsafe job performance
and for any employee assigned to new work tasks, tools, equipment, machines or vehicles to those content elements
in paragraph (i)(3) that are relevant to the circumstances giving rise to the need for training. The proposed rule
did not contain a similar provision. OSHA has added this provision to reduce the burden of the training requirement
by allowing employers to focus the additional training on the elements necessary to prepare the employee to safely
perform the job or operate a new piece of equipment. For example, OSHA is aware that an employee who is assigned to operate
a new machine, may not need retraining in recognition of general hazards in the logging industry or the requirements
of the logging standard. 
In paragraph (i)(5) of the final rule OSHA establishes certain exceptions to the training requirement. Current and
new employees who have received training previously do not need to be retrained in those elements of paragraph (i)(3)
for which they have received training. This paragraph also reinforces that each current and new employee must still
receive training in those elements for which they have not previously been trained. Even though certain limited exceptions
to the training requirements are allowed, this paragraph reinforces that the employer is responsible for ensuring
that each current and new employee can properly and safely perform the work tasks and operate the tools, equipment,
machines and vehicles used in their job. The proposed rule would have required new employees to be trained, regardless
of whether they were experienced or had been trained previously, before initial assignment. The proposed standard
also would have required each new and current employee to receive annual retraining. 
Several commenters were confused about who was required to be trained under the proposed rule and many commenters
opposed retraining of previously trained workers (Ex. 5-21, 5-33, 5-35, 5-39, 5-43,
5-53; Tr. W1 63, OR 85). According to these commenters, employees move from employer to employer and requiring
retraining of each new employee would be both duplicative and costly. As discussed above in the Major Issues section,
OSHA has addressed the commenters' concerns by allowing previous training to be acceptable in lieu of new initial
training for both current and new employees. In order to determine whether the training exception is applicable to
a particular employee, the employer must first ascertain whether previous training has satisfied the training content
requirements of paragraph (i)(3). Determining whether previous training meets the requirements of this section
should not be difficult with regard to current employees. Employers can examine their training materials to ensure
that each of the training content requirements has already been covered in training sessions. OSHA notes that each
current and new employee will at least have to be trained in the requirements of this new standard. OSHA believes that
many employers will provide training on the new final rule in the monthly safety and health meetings

It may, however, require additional effort for the employer to determine whether a new employee has received training
that meets the requirements of the final rule. An employer cannot merely ask the new employee whether he has been trained.
Rather, under the training certification requirements of this paragraph (see paragraph (i)(10)), the employer
must make a determination of whether and when the past training was adequate to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph.

To determine whether past training was adequate, the employer will have to go through two steps. First, the employer
must inquire whether the new employee had training in each of the elements specified in paragraph (i)(3). When the
new employee indicates that he has not received training in a particular element, the employer will need to provide
training in that element. Second, when the employee indicates that he had received training in each of the required
elements, the employer must then determine whether the particular training was adequate. Most likely, the employer
will make that determination while the new employee is working under close supervision of a designated person, as
required by this paragraph. When the new employee, who has been previously trained, can demonstrate the ability to
safely perform the job independently, the employee can then determine and certify that previous training had been
adequate. 
At paragraph (i)(6) of the final rule, OSHA requires that each new employee and each employee who is required to be trained
by this paragraph, to work under the close supervision of a designated person until the employee is able to demonstrate
the ability to safely perform the new job independently. The proposed rule contained two provisions specifying initial
close supervision. One provision specified initial close supervision for all power tool and machine operators and
associated maintenance personnel. The second provided initial close supervision for each new employee, and each
newly trained employee. In addition, the State of Oregon logging standard requires initial close supervision for
new employees and requires experienced new employees to demonstrate their competence before being allowed to perform
the job independently (Ex. 38K). 
Several commenters supported this provision (Ex. 5-22, 5-42, 5-33, 5-39, 5-53, 5-55,
5-63, 9-9; Tr. W1 91-92, 172-73, OR 151-52, 216, 373, 377, 410). NIOSH said it was important
in the logging industry to have an adequate balance of classroom and on-the-job training (Ex. 5-42). NIOSH said
working with a designated person would be especially effective for pointing out poisonous plants to inexperienced
workers (Ex. 5-42). Several commenters also supported limiting this provision to only inexperienced workers
(Ex. 5-33, 5-39, 5-53, 5-62, 5-74 through 5-92). 
OSHA has carefully considered the comments and has decided for several reasons that it is necessary in the final rule
to retain the requirement that each new and each newly-trained employee work under the close supervision of a designated
person initially. There are several reasons for this determination. First, this requirement acts as a final check
on the competency of a newly-trained employee by allowing the employer to measure in practical terms how well the employee
has absorbed the training. Second, this provision is also a measure of the general effectiveness and adequacy of the
employer's training program. When employees are not able to demonstrate the ability to perform the job safely, the
employer needs to review and correct the training program and retrain the workers. 
Third, OSHA believes this provision is essential given the inclusion of an initial training exception in the final
rule for previously trained workers. As discussed earlier, more than 60 percent of all loggers who reported injuries
in the WIR survey had been previously trained (Ex. 2-1). This data supports the need for safeguards to integrating
new employees into the workplace if initial training of each new employee is not required. Finally, this provision
is also a safeguard for integrating newly-trained employees and employees whose unsafe job performance has necessitated
retraining. 
Paragraph (i)(7) of the final rule specifies various requirements regarding first-aid training for each employee,
including supervisors. Paragraph (i)(7)(i) of the final rule requires that the employer assure that each employee
receives or has received first-aid and CPR training. This provision also requires that first-aid training meet at
least the requirements of Appendix B. The proposed rule would have required only supervisors, fellers and at least
one additional person in each operating area to have first-aid training. The proposed rule also would have required
that the first-aid training content meet the training programs of the American Red Cross, the Mine Safety and Health
Administration (MSHA) or other equivalent program.

As discussed above in the Major Issues section, OSHA is expanding the requirement on first-aid training to all employees.
According to the WIR survey, more than one-half of all injuries occurred at cutting sites, that in most cases are remote
from medical facilities and personnel (Ex. 2-1). Also as discussed above in the Major Issues section, OSHA is
not requiring employers to provide the first-aid training. The employer can meet the requirements of the standard
by assuring that employees he hires already have taken first-aid training. The employer can also meet this requirement
by requiring any worker in his employ to take a first-aid training course from any organization in the community whose
program meets the requirements of this standard. In addition, the standard does not require repeat first-aid training
for workers who have received first-aid training previously, provided the training has met the content requirements
of this standard and their first-aid certificate is current. 


With regard to first-aid training content, Appendix B specifies the minimum content of required first-aid training.
This content list includes training in emergency situations that are most likely to arise in the logging industry,
such as control of bleeding and shock, immobilization of injured persons, treatment of sprains and fractures, and
treatment of contact with poisonous plants or animals. 


For several reasons, in the final rule, OSHA has specified the minimum first-aid training requirements rather than
simply referring to programs provided by various organizations. First, the content list is in keeping with OSHA's
goal of developing performance language standards. Second, the content list in Appendix B focuses on the types of
situations that are most likely to occur in the logging industry and in remote work sites. General first-aid training
programs may not thoroughly cover the kinds of situations found in the logging industry. Third, the content of training
programs offered by various organizations may change and an element crucial to first aid in remote outdoor locations
may be dropped. By specifying the minimum content, the standard places training organizations on notice as to what
elements their program must include in order to meet the requirements of this standard. 


Fourth, by expressing the first-aid training requirements in performance language, OSHA is providing employers
with maximum flexibility. Employers will not have to research the Red Cross and MSHA training programs to see if a training
program offered locally by another organization meets the requirements of this standard. In addition, by specifying
the content, the standard leaves employers free to develop their own first-aid training program or rely on outside
organizations to provide first aid training. Fifth, since the final standard permits employers to require their
employees to take first-aid training rather than providing the training, it is important to provide employees with
an understandable criteria for determining whether the training program they select meets the requirements of this
standard. 


Paragraph (i)(7)(ii) of the final rule requires that the employer assure that each employee receives first-aid training
at least every three years and receives CPR training at least annually. The proposed rule did not contain a similar
requirement. Most first-aid training organizations require retraining at the above frequency in order to maintain
a current certificate (Ex. 5-42). OSHA agrees with these organizations that it is necessary to refresh one's
first-aid skills on a regular basis. Since these skills are not usually used on a daily basis, trained persons may become
less able to render these skills over time without periodic refresher training. In addition, what constitutes the
best first-aid techniques and procedures changes over time. Employees need to be retrained so their skills include
the best and most current practices. 


Paragraph (i)(7)(iii) of the final rule requires that the employer assure that each employee's first aid and CPR training
and/or certificate of training remain current. The proposed rule did not contain a similar requirement. OSHA believes
this provision is essential given the inclusion of the exception in the final rule for previously trained workers.
In addition, it is essential because employers can comply with the first-aid training provisions without actually
providing the training themselves. In essence, this provision is similar to the provision in paragraph (i)(5) reinforcing
that the employer is responsible for assuring that the employee can safely perform the job, even if the employer has
not been required to actually provide the training. Regardless of whether the employer provides training or allows
employees to take a first-aid program offered by another organization, the employer is still responsible for assuring
that employees can render first aid properly if called upon.

At paragraph (i)(8) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that training be conducted by a designated person. As discussed
above, a designated person is an employee who has the requisite knowledge, training and experience to perform the
specific duties. The proposed rule did not contain a similar requirement. 


Some commenters said that it was important that training be conducted by a qualified or certified person (Ex. 9-3,
9-13, 9-16). OSHA has included this provision in the final rule because the Agency wants to assure that
regardless of whether employers rely on their own personnel to conduct training or utilize outside experts, the person
providing training must have the necessary qualifications and background in the subject matter being taught. 


Paragraph (i)(9) of the final rule requires that training required by this section be presented in a manner that the
employee is able to understand. This provision also requires that the employer assure that training materials are
appropriate in content and vocabulary to the educational level, literacy and language skills of the employees being
trained. A similar provision was not contained in the proposed rule. OSHA has added this provision in the final rule
as a way of ensuring that all employees, regardless of their cultural or educational background, will receive adequate
training on how to perform their job safely. OSHA notes that this requirement applies to both logging and first-aid
training. 


Paragraph (i)(10) requires the certification of training. While this provision was not contained in the proposed
rule, several commenters stressed the need to document training (Ex. 9-16, 9-18; Tr. OR 137, 558-59,
643-44). OSHA agrees with these commenters that documenting training is necessary. First, in the final rule
OSHA has allowed prior training to be acceptable in lieu of initial training. In the proposed rule, OSHA had required
that each new employee, regardless of experience and prior training, receive training prior to initial assignment.
In order to accept prior training in lieu of new training, OSHA believes employers must establish a process for determining
whether the prior training was adequate. The certification procedure provides that process without imposing a significant
burden. Second, several commenters said that many establishments do not currently document training (Tr. W1 95,
OR 92). As such, employers do not have any records to indicate whether appropriate training has been provided. 


Third, some commenters testified that all training programs should be written programs (Ex. 5-17, 5-42).
While many large logging establishments already have implemented impressive written training programs, OSHA is
also aware that a written training and recordkeeping requirement would impose a paperwork burden and significant
burden on small employers in this industry (Ex. 5-44). OSHA believes that training certification is a less burdensome
way of documenting whether employees have been adequately trained. OSHA notes that the time and costs of training
certification have been included in the final regulatory impact analysis. 


Paragraph (i)(10)(i) of the final rule requires that the employer verify compliance with paragraph (i) of this section
by preparing a written certification record. This provision also requires that the written certification record
contain the name or other identity of the employee trained, the date(s) of the training, and the signature of the person
who conducted the training or the signature of the employer. In addition, this provision requires that if the employer
relies on training conducted prior to the employee being hired or prior to the effective date of this section, the certification
record shall indicate the date the employer determined the prior training was adequate rather than the date of actual
training. The proposed rule did not contain a certification requirement.

The Agency is adding this new provision to the final rule in large part because it is allowing prior training to be accepted
in place of a new round of training. OSHA recognizes, given the transient nature of the workforce in this industry,
that in many cases an employer will be unable to identify the date on which previous training was provided by another
employer. In those cases, OSHA believes that knowing the date of the prior training is not as important as the employer's
determination as to whether the prior training is adequate. As such, OSHA is requiring employers to certify on what
date they determine the prior training to be adequate. In the final rule OSHA has included a measurable way to determine
when and whether prior training had been adequate. The final rule requires that each new employee work under close
supervision of a designated person until the employee demonstrates the ability to safely perform the job independently.
In most cases, therefore, this demonstration date will constitute the certification date. 


Paragraph (i)(10)(ii) of the final rule requires that the most recent training certification be maintained. This
provision has been included to limit the number of records that the employer is required to maintain on training. 


Paragraph (i)(11) of the final rule requires that the employer hold safety and health meetings as necessary and at
least each month for each employee. This provision allows safety and health meetings to be conducted individually,
in crew meetings, in larger groups, or as part of other staff meetings. The proposed rule did not contain a safety and
health meeting requirement. Many State logging standards also require regular safety and health meetings in the
logging industry (Ex. 2-17, 2-22, 2-23, 36, 38K). For example, the State of Washington logging standard
requires safety meetings to be held monthly and whenever work is started at a new work site. 


Many commenters supported the need for regular and ongoing safety and health meetings for both inexperienced and
experienced workers (Ex. 5-7, 5-19, 5-28; Tr. W1 93-95, 163, OR 92, 110, 137, 197, 204, 276,
335, 374, 643-44, 691-92). Several of these commenters indicated that many establishments in the industry
already hold safety and health meetings on a regular basis. Several commenters said safety and health meetings were
an effective way of informing employees about hazards and keeping their safety awareness high (Ex. 5-19, 5-28;
Tr. W1 93-95, 163, 189-90, OR 92, 110, 137, 204, 276, 374, 643-44). One commenter said that documented
monthly safety and health meetings were necessary on all logging operations ``to instill the necessary safe work
attitude in all logging employees'' (Ex. 5-28). Commenters also said safety and health meetings were good for
providing targeted information (Tr. W1 94, 164, 189, OR 110, 204-05, 373, 643). For example, they said safety
and health meetings were a way of informing employees about recent accidents and about lapses in safe work practices,
and to alert employees about conditions and hazards peculiar to the job to be performed or the site to be logged that
day. 


Commenters also said that safety and health meetings were necessary for both inexperienced and experienced loggers
(Ex. 5-19, 5-28, 5-45; Tr. OR 335). One of these commenters said: 






We don't feel that just new employees or green men ought to be sitting in safety and health meetings. Repetition increases
retention, and everyone can benefit if they've heard it a hundred times. Maybe they forgot it 99 [times] and it might
save their life or their buddy's life the next day (Tr. OR 335). 







OSHA agrees with these commenters that safety and health meetings are necessary to reinforce proper work practices
and to alert employees to particular hazards which are present in the workplace. OSHA believes that regular safety
and health meetings will provide adequate retraining for employees in the logging industry, and that these meetings
are necessary in lieu of requiring annual retraining of experienced workers.

Paragraph (j) Effective Date 



As stated in paragraph (j), this final rule becomes effective 120 days after publication of the revised rule and preamble
in the 

Federal Register

. Employers must be in compliance with all requirements of this section by the effective date. One commenter recommended
a three-year delay in the effective date of this final rule to allow for manufacturers' design and lead time and retrofitting
of old equipment (Ex. 5-22). OSHA believes that 120 days is a reasonable compliance time for this standard for
several reasons. First, the Agency is not requiring retrofitting ROPS and FOPS on old machines or chain brakes on chain
saws. Those equipment requirements apply only to machines and chain saws placed into initial service after the effective
date. OSHA believes that replacement of safety devices that have been removed, such as seat belts, should not require
additional compliance time. Second, in the final rule OSHA has not adopted any equipment requirements that are not
already standard safety features of equipment currently manufactured and readily available. Therefore, additional
compliance time is not warranted. 

Finally, OSHA believes that allowing 120 days for employers to come into compliance will provide employers with adequate
time to familiarize themselves with the final rule, to purchase needed equipment, and to develop and conduct required
training. 

OSHA notes that the requirements of the existing pulpwood logging standard remain in effect until the effective date.




Paragraph (k) Appendices 



In paragraph (k) of the final rule, OSHA is specifying that Appendix A on contents of first-aid kits and Appendix B on
content of first-aid training are mandatory. First-aid kits must contain at least the items listed in Appendix A to
meet the requirements of paragraph (d)(2). First-aid training programs must cover the topics listed in Appendix
B to meet the requirements of paragraph (i)(7). Appendix C contains a listing of comparable ISO standards to those
Society of Automotive Engineer standards referenced in the final rule. These SAE standards cover ROPS, FOPS, seat
belts and machine access. The information contained in Appendix C (Corresponding ISO Agreements) is purely informational
and is not intended to create any additional obligations not otherwise imposed or to detract from existing obligations.




2. Summary and Explanation of Technical Amendments to 29 CFR 1910.269(r) and 29 CFR 1928.21(a)(3) 



In this 

Federal Register

 document OSHA is also issuing technical amendments to the Electric Power Generation standard (29 CFR 1910.269) and
to the standards for the agriculture industry (29 CFR 1928.21(a)(3)). Both standards have included a reference to
the existing logging standard. OSHA intends that both standards now reference the revised logging standard in place
of the pulpwood logging standard. 



VI. Regulatory Impact Analysis, Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, and Environmental Assessment 



A. Introduction 



The purpose of the revision of the existing pulpwood logging standard, 29 CFR 1910.266, is to protect all loggers from
the hazards encountered during timber harvesting regardless of the end use of the wood. Hazards are present, for example,
due to falling, rolling or sliding trees and logs, the use of hazardous equipment such as chain saws, and improper work
practices. According to BLS, these hazards resulted in an accident incidence rate of 15.6 injuries per 100 full-time
workers in 1991, which is nearly twice the incidence rate of 7.9 injuries per 100 full-time workers for overall private
sector. The number of lost workdays in logging in 1991 was 274.8 per 100 full-time workers, which is about three times
that of manufacturing and four times that of the overall private sector. 

The existing logging standard applies only to the logging of wood that is used to make pulp for paper and paperboard.
Other logging operations are not covered by the existing standard. However, other general industry safety and health
standards in Part 1910, such as but not limited to, Occupational Noise Exposure (29 CFR 1910.95), Lockout/Tagout
(29 CFR 1910.147), and Personal Protective Equipment (29 CFR Subpart I), apply to non-pulpwood logging operations,
as well as the General Duty clause of the OSH Act (Section 5(a)(1)). 

The final rule expands the coverage of the pulpwood logging standard to include 

all

 logging operations, regardless of the end use of the wood. Many of the provisions in the pulpwood logging standard
have been retained in this standard. Some provisions have been modified, such as those requiring safety and first-aid
training for all employees, and personal protective equipment. In certain cases, work practices have been made more
specific.

It should be noted that six State Plan States (Alaska, California, Hawaii, Michigan, Oregon, and Washington) have
developed logging standards that cover all logging operations and are not limited to just pulpwood logging. 

This Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) has been prepared by OSHA in compliance with Executive Order 12866 and the
Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.). The analysis was developed based on information and comments
in the OSHA logging docket and informal public hearings. 



B. Affected Industries and Workers 



For purposes of analysis, logging operations in the United States were divided in four relevant geographical regions_the
North, the South, the Rocky Mountains, and the Pacific Coast. The leading States in logging employment in 1987 were
Oregon, Washington, Alabama and Georgia, which accounted for 40 percent of logging employment. The final rule will
affect approximately 72,100 employees engaged in logging operations covered by the final rule and 11,936 logging
establishments. Almost 94 percent of all logging establishments employ fewer than 20 employees and 60 percent of
all logging employees work in small establishments. These estimates do not include independent contractors. 

Affected workers include, but are not limited to, fellers and buckers, who cut the trees; skidder and yarder operators,
choker setters, and chasers, who are responsible for delivering a felled tree to the landing; and loader operators
and truck drivers, who load the trees onto trucks for transport to a mill. Although all stages of logging present hazards
to workers, the loggers most at risk are manual felling crews rather than those who operate mechanical harvesting
equipment and are protected by enclosed cabs. 



C. Technological Feasibility Determination 



The work practice and training provisions as well as the requirements regarding personal protective equipment and
equipment protective devices in the final rule are technologically feasible. The fact that the requirements of the
standard already are being achieved in the logging industry is the best evidence of feasibility. The record shows
that many logging establishments are currently providing the training, equipment protection devices and personal
protective equipment that would meet the requirements of the new standard. In addition, the record also shows they
are operating under the same work practices as those required by the standard. Based on the record, OSHA has determined
that numerous logging establishments of all sizes are already in compliance with most of the provisions of the final
standard. In addition, equipment protective devices and personal protective equipment which are required by the
final rule are all commercially available. Therefore, OSHA has determined that the final rule is technologically
feasible. 



D. Costs of Compliance 



OSHA estimated compliance costs using data in the record on current practices and exposed population, including
a report prepared by Centaur Associates, Inc. (Ex. 3). Based on all the data and evidence in the record, OSHA estimates
that first-year costs associated with compliance will be $14.3 million. Total annualized cost of compliance with
the standard is estimated to be $12.5 million. Table 22 shows the summary of costs of compliance with the final rule.

<TEXT>
 

Of the total annualized cost, 43 percent is attributable to inspection and maintenance of logging equipment. Training
costs, which include safety and first-aid training as well as monthly safety and health meetings, account for 32 percent.
Personal protective equipment accounts for about 21 percent of total annual costs. First-aid kits for 1.9 percent.
Replacement of operator manuals or instructions accounts for 1.5 percent and replacement of seat belts removed from
machines and vehicles accounts for about 0.6 percent of total costs. 


D. Benefits of the Revised Standard 


The record shows that injury rates in the logging industry are high. In 1991, there were 15.6 injuries per 100 workers
in the logging industry as compared to an injury incidence rate of 7.9 and 11.2 per 100 workers in the private industry
and manufacturing sectors, respectively. Lost workday rates are especially high in the logging industry, indicating
that most logging accidents are serious. Based on the data in the record, OSHA estimates that there are approximately
158 fatalities, 6,798 lost workday injuries, and 3,770 nonlost workday injuries annually in the logging industry.

The revised standard mandates a variety of methods of control to reduce hazards in the logging industry. Included
in the standard are provisions for personal protective equipment, machine protective devices, equipment inspection
and maintenance, work practices, and training. The revised standard is expected to significantly reduce the number
of accidents, and, consequently, fatalities and injuries that occur in the logging industry. The ability of the revised
standard to reduce accidents, injuries and fatalities depends largely on this integrated program of controls to
deal with the range of hazards that exist in logging operations. For this reason, the effects of the overall standard
on workplace safety is expected to be greater than the effects of the elements of the standard when considered individually.
OSHA estimates that compliance with the final standard will prevent 111 fatalities, 4,759 lost workday cases, and
2,639 nonlost workday cases annually (Table 23). These estimates were developed based on the comprehensiveness
of the standard in dealing with the range of workplace hazards in logging.

F. Economic Feasibility Determination 


The projected economic impact of the final standard on the logging industry is small. The cost of full compliance with
the standard represents only 0.1 percent of the value of shipments for this industry as a whole. Although these annual
costs of compliance represent a relatively insignificant amount of total shipments, some firms will bear more costs
than others depending on their existing compliance with the various provisions of the standard. 
The annual cost of compliance per logging establishment ranges from about $38 in California where firms are at a high
level of compliance with their own State logging standard, to an average of $1,300 per establishment in the South where
no comprehensive logging standards exists. These annual costs per establishment are insignificant when viewed
in terms of other costs incurred by logging employers. It is expected that the costs of compliance with the final rule
are too small to have a significant effect on price, employment, production, or profit rates. 
The impact of compliance with the final rule is expected to fall primarily on small businesses, because the vast majority
of logging establishments employ fewer than 20 workers. The record shows that most large logging establishments
are already in compliance with many of the provisions of the final rule. However, many small firms are also located
in States that have comprehensive logging standards. These firms are currently in compliance with these standards
and are able to operate while incurring these costs. Even if it is assumed that small firms will bear all the costs of
compliance with the final rule, the economic impact is still small. OSHA estimates that the average cost per small
firm is substantially less than 0.5 percent of the average annual value of shipments per firm and will be more than offset
by the probable decrease in workers' compensation costs resulting from fewer injuries. Even small establishments
that operate on less than a full-time basis could incur the costs of compliance without experiencing an economic disruption
that would threaten the competitive structure of the industry or cause any dislocation. 
Based on these estimates developed from data and evidence in the record, OSHA has concluded that the economic impact
of the standard would not threaten the stability or profitability of the logging industry. In addition, neither the
Gross National Product (GNP), the level of international trade, the price of consumer goods, nor the level of employment
would be significantly affected. 


G. Regulatory Flexibility Certification 


In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Assistant Secretary has made a preliminary assessment of
the impact of the rule on small entities. As discussed above, the estimated compliance costs for small firms (i.e,
those employing fewer than 20 workers) are estimated to be less than 0.5 percent of the average annual value of shipments
per firm and will be more than offset by the probable decrease in workers' compensation costs resulting from reduction
in logging accidents. As is the case for compliance costs for all firms covered under the standard, the costs of compliance
for small firms would be very small compared with net income. Therefore, OSHA does not anticipate the final rule will
have a significant impact on small firms. 


H. Environmental Impact Assessment 


The revisions to the standard have been reviewed in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental
Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321, 

et seq

.), the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) (40 CFR 1500), and the Department of Labor (DOL)
NEPA Procedures (29 CFR 11). As a result of this review, OSHA has determined that the rule will have no significant environmental
impact. 
The provisions focus on training, work practices, personal protective equipment, and protective devices on equipment
in order to reduce worker fatalities and injuries. In general, these provisions do not impact on air, water, or soil
quality, plant or animal life, the use of land, or other aspects of the environment. The revisions are considered excluded
actions under Subpart B, Section 11.10 of the DOL NEPA regulations.

VIII. Statutory Considerations 


A. Introduction 



OSHA has described the hazards confronted by employees who work in the logging industry and the measures required
to protect affected employees from those hazards in Section I, 

Background,

 and Section III, 

Summary and Explanation of the Standard, 

respectively, earlier in this preamble. The Agency is providing the following discussion of the statutory mandate
for OSHA rulemaking activity to explain the legal basis for its determination that the logging operations standard,
as promulgated, is reasonably necessary to protect affected employees from significant risks of injury and death.

Section 2(b)(3) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act authorizes ``the Secretary of Labor to set mandatory occupational
safety and health standards applicable to businesses affecting interstate commerce'', and section 5(a)(2) provides
that ``[e]ach employer shall comply with occupational safety and health standards promulgated under this Act''
(emphasis added). Section 3(8) of the OSH Act (29 U.S.C. 652(8)) provides that ``the term `occupational safety and
health standard' means a standard which requires conditions, or the adoption or use of one or more practices, means,
methods, operations, or processes, reasonably necessary or appropriate to provide safe or healthful employment
and places of employment.'' 
In two recent cases, reviewing courts have expressed concern that OSHA's interpretation of these provisions of the
OSH Act, particularly of section 3(8) as it pertains to safety rulemaking, could lead to overly costly or under-protective
safety standards. In 

International Union, UAW 

v. 

OSHA, 

938 F.2d 1310 (D.C. Cir. 1991), the District of Columbia Circuit rejected substantive challenges to OSHA's lockout/tagout
standard and denied a request that enforcement of that standard be stayed, but it also expressed concern that OSHA's
interpretation of the OSH Act could lead to safety standards that are very costly and only minimally protective. In


National Grain & Feed Ass'n 

v. 

OSHA, 

866 F.2d 717 (5th Cir. 1989), the Fifth Circuit concluded that Congress gave OSHA considerable discretion in structuring
the costs and benefits of safety standards but, concerned that the grain dust standard might be under-protective,
directed OSHA to consider adding a provision that might further reduce significant risk of fire and explosion.

OSHA rulemakings involve a significant degree of agency expertise and policy-making discretion to which reviewing
courts must defer. (See for example, 

Building & Constr. Trades Dep't, AFL-CIO 

v. 

Brock, 

838 F.2d 1258, 1266 (D.C. Cir. 1988); 

Industrial Union Dep't, AFL-CIO 

v. 

American Petroleum Inst., 

448 U.S. 607, 655 n. 62 (1980).) At the same time, the agency's technical expertise and policy-making authority must
be exercised within discernable parameters. The lockout/tagout and grain handling standard decisions sought from
OSHA more clarification on the agency's view of the scope of those parameters. In light of those decisions, OSHA believes
it would be useful to include in the preamble to this safety standard a statement of its view of the limits of its safety
rulemaking authority and to explain why it is confident that its interpretive views have in the past avoided regulatory
extremes and continue to do so in this rule. 
Stated briefly, the OSH Act requires that, before promulgating any occupational safety standard, OSHA demonstrate
based on substantial evidence in the record as a whole that: (1) The proposed standard will substantially reduce a
significant risk of material harm; (2) compliance is technologically feasible in the sense that the protective measures
being required already exist, can be brought into existence with available technology, or can be created with technology
that can reasonably be developed; (3) compliance is economically feasible in the sense that industry can absorb or
pass on the costs without major dislocation or threat of instability; and (4) the standard is cost effective in that
it employs the least expensive protective measures capable of reducing or eliminating significant risk. Additionally,
proposed safety standards must be compatible with prior agency action, must be responsive to significant comment
in the record, and, to the extent allowed by statute, must be consistent with applicable Executive Orders. These elements
limit OSHA's regulatory discretion for safety rulemaking and provide a decision-making framework for developing
a rule within their parameters. 


B. Congress Concluded That OSHA Regulations Are Necessary To Protect Workers From Occupational Hazards and That
Employers Should Be Required To Reduce or Eliminate Significant Workplace Health and Safety Threats 


At section 2(a) of the OSH Act (29 U.S.C. 651(a)), Congress announced its determination that occupational injury
and illness should be eliminated as much as possible: ``The Congress finds that occupational injury and illness arising
out of work situations impose a substantial burden upon, and are a hindrance to, interstate commerce in terms of lost
production, wage loss, medical expenses, and disability compensation payments.'' Congress therefore declared
``it to be its purpose and policy * * * to assure so far as possible every working man and woman in the Nation
safe * * * working conditions [29 U.S.C. 651(b)].'' 
To that end, Congress instructed the Secretary of Labor to adopt existing federal and consensus standards during
the first two years after the OSH Act became effective and, in the event of conflict among any such standards, to ``promulgate
the standard which assures the greatest protection of the safety or health of the affected employees [29 U.S.C. 655(a)].''
Congress also directed the Secretary to set mandatory occupational safety standards [29 U.S.C. 651(b)(3)], based
on a rulemaking record and substantial evidence [29 U.S.C. 655(b)(2)], that are ``reasonably necessary or appropriate
to provide safe * * * employment and places of employment.'' When promulgating permanent safety or
health standards that differ from existing national consensus standards, the Secretary must explain ``why the rule
as adopted will better effectuate the purposes of this Act than the national consensus standard [29 U.S.C. 655(b)(8)].''
Correspondingly, every employer must comply with OSHA standards and, in addition, ``furnish to each of his employees
employment and a place of employment which are free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause
death or serious physical harm to his employees [29 U.S.C. 654(a)].''

``Congress understood that the Act would create substantial costs for employers, yet intended to impose such costs
when necessary to create a safe and healthful working environment. Congress viewed the costs of health and safety
as a cost of doing business. * * * Indeed, Congress thought that the 

financial costs 

of health and safety problems in the workplace were as large as or larger than the financial costs of eliminating these
problems [

and serious injuries [

Whirlpool Corp. 

v. 

Marshall, 

445 U.S. 1, 11 (1980)].'' ``We know the costs would be put into consumer goods but that is the price we should pay for the
80 million workers in America [S. Rep. No. 91-1282, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. (1970); H.R. Rep. No. 91-1291,
91st Cong., 2d Sess. (1970), reprinted in Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, Legislative History of the
Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, (Committee Print 1971) (``Leg. Hist.'') at 444 (Senator Yarborough)].''
``Of course, it will cost a little more per item to produce a washing machine. Those of us who use washing machines will
pay for the increased cost, but it is worth it, to stop the terrible death and injury rate in this country [

Id. 

at 324; see also 510-511, 517].''

 

[T]he vitality of the Nation's economy will be enhanced by the greater productivity realized through saved lives
and useful years of labor. 
When one man is injured or disabled by an industrial accident or disease, it is he and his family who suffer the most immediate
and personal loss. However, that tragic loss also affects each of us. As a result of occupational accidents and disease,
over $1.5 billion in wages is lost each year [1970 dollars], and the annual loss to the gross national product is estimated
to be over $8 billion. Vast resources that could be available for productive use are siphoned off to pay workmen's compensation
and medical expenses. * * * 
Only through a comprehensive approach can we hope to effect a significant reduction in these job death and casualty
figures. [

Id.

 at 518-19 (Senator Cranston)]

 

Congress considered uniform enforcement crucial because it would reduce or eliminate the disadvantage that a conscientious
employer might experience when inter-industry or intra-industry competition is present. Moreover, ``many employers_particularly
smaller ones_simply cannot make the necessary investment in health and safety, and survive competitively, unless
all are compelled to do so [Leg. Hist. at 144, 854, 1188, 1201].'' 
Thus, the statutory text and legislative history make clear that Congress conclusively determined that OSHA regulation
is necessary to protect workers from occupational hazards and that employers should be required to reduce or eliminate
significant workplace health and safety threats. 


C. As Construed by the Courts and by OSHA, the OSH Act Sets a Threshold and a Ceiling for Safety Rulemaking That Provide
Clear and Reasonable Parameters for Agency Action


OSHA has long followed the teaching that section 3(8) of the OSH Act requires that, before it promulgates ``

any

 permanent health or safety standard, [it must] make a threshold finding that a place of employment is unsafe_in the
sense that significant risks are present and can be eliminated or lessened by a change in practices [

Industrial Union Dep't, AFL-CIO 

v. 

American Petroleum Inst., 

448 U.S. 607, 642 (1980) (plurality) (

Benzene

); emphasis was supplied in original].'' When, as frequently happens in safety rulemaking, OSHA promulgates standards
that differ from existing national consensus standards, it must explain ``why the rule as adopted will better effectuate
the purposes of this Act than the national consensus standard [29 U.S.C. 655(b)(8)].'' Thus, national consensus
and existing federal standards that Congress instructed OSHA to adopt summarily within two years of the OSH Act's
inception provide reference points concerning the least an OSHA standard should achieve (29 U.S.C. 655(a)). As a
result, OSHA is precluded from regulating insignificant safety risks or from issuing safety standards that do not
at least lessen risk in a significant way. 
The OSH Act also limits OSHA's discretion to issue overly burdensome rules, as the agency also has long recognized
that ``any standard that was not economically or technologically feasible would 

a fortiori 

not be `reasonably necessary or appropriate' under the Act. See 

Industrial Union Dep't 

v. 

Hodgson 

[499 F.2d 467, 478 (D.C. Cir. 1974)] (`Congress does not appear to have intended to protect employees by putting their
employers out of business.') [

American Textile Mfrs. Inst. Inc., 

452 U.S. at 513 n. 31 (a standard is economically feasible even if it portends `disaster for some marginal firms,' but
it is economically infeasible if it `threaten[s] massive dislocation to, or imperil[s] the existence of,' the industry)].''

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941012-0-00160 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941012-0-00011 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

By stating the test in terms of ``threat'' and ``peril,'' the Supreme Court made clear in ATMI that economic infeasibility
begins short of industry-wide bankruptcy. OSHA itself has placed the line considerably below this level. (See for
example, ATMI, 452 U.S. at 527 n. 50; 43 FR 27,360 (June 23, 1978). Proposed 200  u g/m3 PEL for cotton dust did not raise
serious possibility of industry-wide bankruptcy, but impact on weaving sector would be severe, possibly requiring
reconstruction of 90 percent of all weave rooms. OSHA concluded that the 200  u g/m3 level was not feasible for weaving
and that 750  u g/m3 was all that could reasonably be required). See also 54 FR 29,245-246 (July 11, 1989); American
Iron & Steel Institute, 939 F.2d at 1003. OSHA raised the engineering control level for lead in small nonferrous
foundries to avoid the possibility of bankruptcy for about half of small foundries even though the industry as a whole
could have survived the loss of small firms. Although the cotton dust and lead rulemakings involved health standards,
the economic feasibility ceiling established therein applies equally to safety standards. Indeed, because feasibility
is a necessary element of a ``reasonably necessary or appropriate'' standard, this ceiling boundary is the same for
health and safety rulemaking since it comes from section 3(8), which governs all permanent OSHA standards. 
All OSHA standards must also be cost-effective in the sense that the protective measures being required must be the
least expensive measures capable of achieving the desired end (ATMI, at 514 n. 32; 

Building and Constr. Trades Dep't, AFL-CIO 

v. 

Brock, 

838 F.2d 1258, 1269 (D.C. Cir. 1988)). OSHA gives additional consideration to financial impact in setting the period
of time that should be allowed for compliance, allowing as much as ten years for compliance phase-in. (See 

United Steelworkers of Am. 

v. 

Marshall, 

647 F.2d 1189, 1278 (D.C. Cir. 1980), 

cert. denied, 

453 U.S. 913 (1981).) Additionally, OSHA's enforcement policy takes account of financial hardship on an individualized
basis. OSHA's Field Operations Manual provides that, based on an employer's economic situation, OSHA may extend
the period within which a violation must be corrected after issuance of a citation (CPL. 2.45B, Chapter III, paragraph
E6d(3)(a), Dec. 31, 1990). 
To reach the necessary findings and conclusions that a safety standard substantially reduces a significant risk
of harm, is both technologically and economically feasible, and is cost effective, OSHA must conduct rulemaking
in accord with the requirements of section 6 of the OSH Act. The regulatory proceeding allows it to determine the qualitative
and, if possible, the quantitative nature of the risk with and without regulation, the technological feasibility
of compliance, the availability of capital to the industry and the extent to which that capital is required for other
purposes, the industry's profit history, the industry's ability to absorb costs or pass them on to the consumer, the
impact of higher costs on demand, and the impact on competition with substitutes and imports. (See 

ATMI 

at 2501-2503; 

American Iron & Steel Institute 

generally.) Section 6(f) of the OSH Act further provides that, if the validity of a standard is challenged, OSHA must
support its conclusions with ``substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole,'' a standard that courts
have determined requires fairly close scrutiny of agency action and the explanation of that action. (See 

Steelworkers, 

647 F.2d at 1206-1207.) 
OSHA's powers are further circumscribed by the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, which
provides a neutral forum for employer contests of citations issued by OSHA for noncompliance with health and safety
standards (29 U.S.C. 659-661; noted as an additional constraint in 

Benzene 

at 652 n. 59). OSHA must also respond rationally to similarities and differences among industries or industry sectors.
(See 

Building and Constr. Trades Dep't, AFL-CIO 

v. 

Brock, 

838 F.2d 1258, 1272-73 (D.C. Cir. 1988).)

OSHA safety rulemaking is thus constrained first by the need to demonstrate that the standard will substantially
reduce a significant risk of material harm, and then by the requirement that compliance is technologically capable
of being done and not so expensive as to threaten economic instability or dislocation for the industry. Within these
parameters, further constraints such as the need to find cost-effective measures and to respond rationally to all
meaningful comment militate against regulatory extremes. 





D. The Logging Operations Standard Complies With the Statutory Criteria Described Above and Is Not Subject to the
Additional Constraints Applicable to Section 6(b)(5) Standards 



Standards which regulate hazards that are frequently undetectable because they are subtle or develop slowly or after
long latency periods, are frequently referred to as ``health'' standards. Standards that regulate hazards, like
explosions or electrocution, that cause immediately noticeable physical harm, are called ``safety'' standards.
(See National Grain & Feed Ass'n

 v. 

OSHA (NGFA II),

 866 F.2d 717, 731, 733 (5th Cir. 1989). As noted above, section 3(8) provides that 

all

 OSHA standards must be ``reasonably necessary or appropriate.'' In addition, section 6(b)(5) requires that OSHA
set health standards which limit significant risk ``to the extent feasible.'' OSHA has determined that the revised
PPE standard is a safety standard, because the revised PPE standard addresses hazards, such as molten metal, falling
objects and electricity, that are immediately dangerous to life or health, not the longer term, less obvious hazards
subject to section 6(b)(5). 

The OSH Act and its legislative history clearly indicate that Congress intended for OSHA to distinguish between safety
standards and health standards. For example in section 2(b)(6) of the OSH Act, Congress declared that the goal of assuring
safe and healthful working conditions and preserving human resources would be achieved, in part: 



* * * by exploring ways to discover latent diseases, establishing causal connections between
diseases and work in environmental conditions, and conducting other research relating to health problems, in recognition
of the fact that occupational health standards present problems often different from those involved in occupational
safety. 




The legislative history makes this distinction even clearer: 




[The Secretary] should take into account that anyone working in toxic agents and physical agents which might be harmful
may be subjected to such conditions for the rest of his working life, so that we can get at something which might not be
toxic now, if he works in it a short time, but if he works in it the rest of his life might be very dangerous; and we want to
make sure that such things are taken into consideration in establishing standards. [

Leg. Hist.

 at 502-503 (Sen. Dominick), quoted in 

Benzene

 at 648-49] 




Additionally, Representative Daniels distinguished between ``insidious `silent killers' such as toxic fumes,
bases, acids, and chemicals'' and ``violent physical injury causing immediate visible physical harm'' (

Leg. Hist.

 at 1003), and Representative Udall contrasted insidious hazards like carcinogens with ``the more visible and well-known
question of industrial accidents and on-the-job injury'' (

Leg. Hist.

 at 1004). (See also, for example, S. Rep. No. 1282, 91st Cong., 2d Sess 2-3 (1970), U.S. Code Cong. & Admin.
News 1970, pp. 5177, 5179, reprinted in 

Leg. Hist.

 at 142-43, discussing 1967 Surgeon General study that found that 65 percent of employees in industrial plants
``were potentially exposed to harmful physical agents, such as severe noise or vibration, or to toxic materials'';


Leg. Hist.

 at 412; 

id.

 at 446; 

id.

 at 516; 

id.

 at 845; International Union, UAW at 1315.) 

In reviewing OSHA rulemaking activity, the Supreme Court has held that section 6(b)(5) requires OSHA to set ``the
most protective standard consistent with feasibility'' (

Benzene

 at 643 n. 48). As Justice Stevens observed:

 


The reason that Congress drafted a special section for these substances * * * was because Congress
recognized that there were special problems in regulating health risks as opposed to safety risks. In the latter case,
the risks are generally immediate and obvious, while in the former, the risks may not be evident until a worker has been
exposed for long periods of time to particular substances. [

Benzene

, at 649 n. 54.] 




Challenges to the grain dust and lockout/tagout standards included assertions that grain dust in explosive quantities
and uncontrolled energy releases that could expose employees to crushing, cutting, burning or explosion hazards
were harmful physical agents so that OSHA was required to apply the criteria of section 6(b)(5) when determining how
to protect employees from those hazards. Reviewing courts have uniformly rejected such assertions. For example,
the Court in 

International Union, UAW

 v. 

OSHA,

 938 F.2d 1310 (D.C. Cir. 1991) rejected the view that section 6(b)(5) provided the statutory criteria for regulation
of uncontrolled energy, holding that such a ``reading would obliterate a distinction that Congress drew between
`health' and `safety' risks.'' The Court also noted that the language of the OSH Act and the legislative history supported
the OSHA position (

International Union, UAW

 at 1314). Additionally, the Court stated: ``We accord considerable weight to an agency's construction of a statutory
scheme it is entrusted to administer, rejecting it only if unreasonable'' (

International Union, UAW

 at 1313, citing 

Chevron U.S.A., Inc.

 v. 

NRDC,

 467 U.S. 837, 843 (1984)).

The Court reviewing the grain dust standard also deferred to OSHA's reasonable view that the Agency was not subject
to the feasibility mandate of section 6(b)(5) in regulating explosive quantities of grain dust (

National Grain & Feed Association

 v. 

OSHA

 (NGFA II), 866 F.2d 717, 733 (5th Cir. 1989)). It therefore applied the criteria of section 3(8), requiring the Agency
to establish that the standard is ``reasonably necessary or appropriate'' to protect employee safety. 

As explained in Section III, Basis for Agency Action, and Section V, Summary and Explanation of the Standard, and Section
VI, Summary of the Final Regulatory Impact Analysis and Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, of this preamble, OSHA
has determined that logging operations pose significant risks to employees (158 fatalities, 6,798 lost workday
injuries, and 3,770 nonlost workday injuries each year). The Agency estimates that compliance with the logging operations
standard will cost $12.8 million annually and will reduce the risk of the hazards encountered during logging operations
(i.e., 111 fatalities, 4,759 lost workday injuries, and 2,639 nonlost workday injuries). This constitutes a substantial
reduction of significant risk of material harm to the 72,100 logging industry employees affected. The Agency believes
that compliance is technologically feasible because the rulemaking record indicates that the hazard control measures
required by the standard have already been implemented, to some extent, for all the logging operations covered by
the standard. Additionally, OSHA believes that compliance is economically feasible, because, as documented by
the Regulatory Impact Analysis, all regulated sectors can readily absorb or pass on compliance costs and economic
benefits will exceed compliance costs. 

As detailed in Section V, Summary and Explanation of the Standard, and in Section VI, Summary of the Final Regulatory
Impact Analysis and Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, the standard's costs, benefits, and compliance requirements
are reasonable and consistent with those of other OSHA safety standards, such as PPE ($52.4 million annual cost of
compliance and will prevent 4 fatalities and 102,000 injuries annually) and Grain Handling ($5.9 to 33.4 million
annual cost of compliance and will prevent 18 fatalities and 394 injuries annually) (

Cf.

, 59 FR 16359, April 6, 1994). 

OSHA assessed employee risk by evaluating exposure to hazards in the logging industry. The Regulatory Flexibility
Assessment, Section VI above, presents OSHA's estimate of the costs and benefits of the revised logging standard.


OSHA has considered and responded to all substantive comments regarding the proposed logging standard on their merits
in Section IV, Major Issues, and Section V, Summary and Explanation of the Standard, earlier in this preamble. In particular,
OSHA evaluated all suggested changes to the proposed rule in terms of their impact on worker safety, their feasibility,
their cost effectiveness, and their consonance with the OSH Act. 


IX. Recordkeeping 



This final rule does not contain any recordkeeping requirements. 


X. Federalism

This standard has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12612, 52 FR 41685 (October 30, 1987), regarding
Federalism. This Order requires that agencies, to the extent possible, refrain from limiting State policy options,
consult with States prior to taking any actions that would restrict State policy options, and take such actions only
when there is clear constitutional authority and the presence of a problem of national scope. The Order provides for
preemption of State law only if there is a clear Congressional intent for the agency to do so. Any such preemption is
to be limited to the extent possible. 

Section 18 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH Act), expresses Congress' clear intent to preempt State
laws relating to issues with respect to which Federal OSHA has promulgated occupational safety or health standards.
Under the OSH Act a State can avoid preemption only if it submits, and obtains Federal approval of, a plan for the development
of such standards and their enforcement. Occupational safety and health standards developed by such Plan-States
must, among other things, be at least as effective in providing safe and healthful employment and places of employment
as the Federal standards. 

The logging standard is drafted so that loggers in every State would be protected by general, performance-oriented
standards. To the extent that there are State or regional peculiarities caused by the types of timber to be logged,
the terrain, the climate or other factors, States with occupational safety and health plans approved under Section
18 of the OSH Act would be able to develop their own State standards to deal with any special problems. Moreover, the
performance nature of this proposed standard, of and by itself, allows for flexibility by States and loggers to provide
as much safety as possible using varying methods consonant with conditions in each State. 

In short, there is a clear national problem related to occupational safety and health in the logging industry. While
the individual States, if all acted, might be able collectively to deal with the safety problems involved, most have
not elected to do so in the twenty-four years since the enactment of the OSH Act. Those States which have elected to participate
under Section 18 of the OSH Act would not be preempted by this standard and would be able to deal with special, local conditions
within the framework provided by this performance-oriented standard while ensuring that their standards are at
least as effective as the Federal standard. State comments are invited on this proposal and will be fully considered
prior to promulgation of a final rule. 


XI. State Plan Standards 



The 25 States with their own OSHA approved occupational safety and health plans must adopt a comparable standard within
six months of the publication date of the final standard. These States are: Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut
(for State and local government employees only), Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota,
Nevada, New Mexico, New York (for State and local government employees only), North Carolina, Oregon, Puerto Rico,
South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Virgin Islands, Washington, and Wyoming. Until such time as
a State standard is promulgated, Federal OSHA will provide interim enforcement assistance, as appropriate, in these
States.

(b) Scope and application. 

(1) This standard establishes safety practices, means, methods and operations for all types of logging, regardless
of the end use of the wood. These types of logging include, but are not limited to, pulpwood and timber harvesting and
the logging of sawlogs, veneer bolts, poles, pilings and other forest products. This standard does not cover the construction
or use of cable yarding systems. 

(2) This standard applies to all logging operations as defined by this section. 

(3) Hazards and working conditions not specifically addressed by this section are covered by other applicable sections
of Part 1910. 

(c) Definitions applicable to this section. 

Arch.

 An open-framed trailer or built-up framework used to suspend the leading ends of trees or logs when they are skidded.




Backcut (felling cut).

 The final cut in a felling operation. 



Ballistic nylon. 

A nylon fabric of high tensile properties designed to provide protection from lacerations. 



Buck.

 To cut a felled tree into logs. 



Butt.

 The bottom of the felled part of a tree. 



Cable yarding.

 The movement of felled trees or logs from the area where they are felled to the landing on a system composed of a cable
suspended from spars and/or towers. The trees or logs may be either dragged across the ground on the cable or carried
while suspended from the cable. 



Chock.

 A block, often wedge shaped, which is used to prevent movement; e.g., a log from rolling, a wheel from turning. 



Choker.

 A sling used to encircle the end of a log for yarding. One end is passed around the load, then through a loop eye, end fitting
or other device at the other end of the sling. The end that passed through the end fitting or other device is then hooked
to the lifting or pulling machine. 



Danger tree.

of tree, dead limbs, and the location of other trees, shall be evaluated by the feller and precautions taken so a hazard
is not created for an employee. 

(iii) Each tree shall be checked for accumulations of snow and ice. Accumulations of snow and ice that may create a hazard
for an employee shall be removed before felling is commenced in the area or the area shall be avoided. 

(iv) When a spring pole or other tree under stress is cut, no employee other than the feller shall be closer than two trees
lengths when the stress is released. 

(v) An undercut shall be made in each tree being felled unless the employer demonstrates that felling the particular
tree without an undercut will not create a hazard for an employee. The undercut shall be of a size so the tree will not
split and will fall in the intended direction. 

(vi) A backcut shall be made in each tree being felled. The backcut shall allow for sufficient hinge wood to guide the
tree and prevent it from prematurely slipping or twisting off the stump. 

(vii) The backcut shall be above the level of the horizontal cut of the undercut. Exception: The backcut may be at or
below the horizontal cut in tree pulling operations. 

(3) 

Bucking and limbing. 

(i) Bucking and limbing on any slope where rolling or sliding of trees or logs is reasonably foreseeable shall be done
on the uphill side of each tree, unless the employer demonstrates that it is not feasible to buck or limb on the uphill
side. Whenever bucking or limbing is done from the downhill side, the tree shall be secured with chocks to prevent it
from rolling, sliding or swinging. 

(ii) Before bucking or limbing wind-thrown trees, precautions shall be taken to prevent the root wad, butt or logs
from striking an employee. These precautions include, but are not limited to, chocking or moving the tree to a stable
position. 

(4) 

Chipping (in-woods locations). 

(i) Chipper access covers or doors shall not be opened until the drum or disc is at a complete stop. 

(ii) Infeed and discharge ports shall be guarded to prevent contact with the disc, knives, or blower blades. 

(iii) The chipper shall be shut down and locked out in accordance with the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.147 when an employee
performs any servicing or maintenance. 

(iv) Detached trailer chippers shall be chocked during usage on any slope where rolling or sliding of the chipper is
reasonably foreseeable. 

(5) 

Yarding. 

(i) No log shall be moved until each employee is in the clear. 

(ii) Each choker shall be hooked and unhooked from the uphill side or end of the log, unless the employer demonstrates
that is it not feasible in the particular situation to hook or unhook the choker from the uphill side. Where the choker
is hooked or unhooked from the downhill side or end of the log, the log shall be securely chocked to prevent rolling,
sliding or swinging. 

(iii) Each choker shall be positioned near the end of the log or tree length. 

(iv) Each machine shall be positioned during winching so the machine and winch are operated within their design limits.


(v) No yarding line shall not be moved unless the yarder operator has clearly received and understood the signal to
do so. When in doubt, the yarder operator shall repeat the signal as it is understood and wait for a confirming signal
before moving any line. 

(vi) No load shall exceed the rated capacity of the pallet, trailer, or other carrier. 

(vii) Towed equipment, such as but not limited to, skid pans, pallets, arches, and trailers, shall be attached to each
machine or vehicle in such a manner as to allow a full 90 degree turn; to prevent overrunning of the towing machine or
vehicle; and to assure that the operator is always in control of the towed equipment. 

(viii) The yarding machine or vehicle, including its load, shall be operated with safe clearance from all obstructions.

(ix) Each yarded tree shall be placed in a location that does not create a hazard for an employee and an orderly manner
so that the trees are stable before bucking or limbing is commenced. 

(6) 

Loading and unloading. 

(i) The transport vehicle shall be positioned to provide working clearance between the vehicle and the deck. 

(ii) Only the loading or unloading machine operator and other personnel the employer demonstrates are essential
shall be in the work area during loading and unloading. 

(iii) No transport vehicle operator shall remain in the cab during loading and unloading if the logs are carried or
moved over the truck cab, unless the employer demonstrates that it is necessary for the operator to do so. Where the
transport vehicle operator remains in the cab, the employer shall provide operator protection, such as but not limited
to, reinforcement of the cab. 

(iv) Each log shall be placed on a transport vehicle in an orderly manner and tightly secured. 

(v) The load shall be positioned to prevent slippage or loss during handling and transport. 

(vi) Each stake and chock which is used to trip loads shall be so constructed that the tripping mechanism is activated
on the side opposite the release of the load. 

(vii) Each tie down shall be left in place over the peak log to secure all logs until the unloading lines or other protection
the employer demonstrates is equivalent has been put in place. A stake of sufficient strength to withstand the forces
of shifting or moving logs, shall be considered equivalent protection provided that the logs are not loaded higher
than the stake. 

(viii) Each tie down shall be released only from the side on which the unloading machine operates, except as follows:


(A) When the tie down is released by a remote control device; and 

(B) When the employee making the release is protected by racks, stanchions or other protection the employer demonstrates
is capable of withstanding the force of the logs. 

(7) 

Transport. 

The transport vehicle operator shall assure that each tie down is tight before transporting the load. While enroute,
the operator shall check and tighten the tie downs whenever there is reason to believe that the tie downs have loosened
or the load has shifted.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The FHWA is adopting regulations to implement subsections 105 (b) and (c) of the Hazardous Materials Transportation
Act of 1975 (HMTA) as amended by the Hazardous Materials Transportation Uniform Safety Act of 1990 (HMTUSA). The regulations
include Federal standards and procedures which the States and Indian tribes must follow if they establish, maintain,
or enforce routing designations that (1) specify highway routes over which placarded non-radioactive hazardous
materials (NRHM) may and may not be transported within their jurisdictions, and/or (2) impose limitations or requirements
with respect to highway routing of such hazardous materials. Included are amendments to the procedures in 49 CFR part
397, subpart E, relating to Federal preemption and waivers of preemption, and new procedures for the resolution of
disputes involving State or Indian tribe NRHM routing designations. States and Indian tribes are also required to
furnish updated NRHM route information for publication by the FHWA. The existing motor carrier regulations with
NRHM routing requirements have been incorporated into this regulation, along with the new requirements which require
motor carriers to comply with the NRHM routing designations of States and Indian tribes. The intent of these requirements
is to ensure that NRHM are moved safely and that commerce is not burdened by restrictive, uncoordinated, or conflicting
requirements of various jurisdictions.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



On November 16, 1990, the Hazardous Materials Transportation Uniform Safety Act of 1990 (HMTUSA) (Pub. L. 101-615,
104 Stat. 3244) was enacted and amended the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act of 1975 (HMTA) (Pub. L. 93-633,
88 Stat. 2156). The FHWA was delegated the responsibility by the Secretary, as published in the 

Federal Register

 (56 FR 31343, July 10, 1991; 49 CFR 1.48), to implement subsections 105 (b) and (c) of the HMTA (now codified at 49 U.S.C.
  5112 and 5125 (1994), Pub. L. 103-272, 108 Stat. 745). This included the rulemaking and program
responsibility for hazardous materials highway routing, with the exception of currently pending applications
for inconsistency rulings and non-preemption determinations which remain a responsibility of the Research and
Special Programs Administration (RSPA).

Section 5112(b) of title 49, United States Code, requires the Secretary to establish by regulation standards for
States and Indian tribes to use in establishing, maintaining, and enforcing these routing designations. These Federal
standards shall provide for enhancement of safety; public participation; transportation of hazardous materials
between adjacent areas; consultation with other States, Indian tribal and local governments; through highway routing;
reasonable time to reach agreement between affected States or Indian tribes; avoidance of unreasonable burden on
commerce; timely establishment of State and Indian tribe routing; reasonable routes to terminals and other facilities;
State responsibility for local compliance; and a number of ``factors'' for States and Indian tribes to consider.
Section 5112(b)(2) prohibits the Secretary from assigning specific weights to the ``factors to consider'' in the
Federal standards, but Sections 5125(c) and 5112(d) do provide for Federal preemption and dispute resolution of
State and Indian tribe routing designations to allow for consistent application of the Federal standards among adjacent
jurisdictions. 

Section 5112(c) also requires the Secretary, in coordination with the States, to periodically update and publish
a list of currently effective hazardous materials highway route designations. 

The FHWA recognizes that 49 CFR 177.810 exempts State and local regulations and ordinances regarding the kind, character,
or quantity of any hazardous material, except radioactive materials, transported through urban tunnels used for
mass transportation from parts 170 to 189 of the hazardous materials regulations. However, this section does not
exempt State, Indian tribes and local governments from having to comply with the routing regulations applicable
to the transportation of Class 7 (radioactive) materials (49 CFR 397, subpart D) or the routing regulations established
herein. Therefore, tunnel routing designations are now subject to the same Federal standards and procedures as are
other highway routing designations. 

To assist the States and local governments in the development of routes, the DOT published ``Guidelines for Selecting
Preferred Highway Routes for Highway Route Controlled Quantity Shipments of Radioactive Materials'' (latest edition
DOT/RSPA/OHMT-89/01 dated August 1992) and ``Guidelines for Applying Criteria to Designate Routes for Transporting
Hazardous Materials'' (latest edition DOT/RSPA/OHMT-89-02 dated July 1989). The latter publication
is being updated to provide guidance on the Federal standards in this regulation. Both guides are useful in developing
highway routing requirements for hazardous materials. These documents are available to the public through the National
Technical Information Service, Springfield, Virginia 21661. 

The FHWA published a notice of proposed rulemaking and a notice of public hearings entitled ``Transportation of Hazardous
Materials; Highway Routing'' in the 

Federal Register

 on August 31, 1992 (57 FR 39522). The FHWA requested comments from any interested parties to be submitted to Docket
MC-92-6 by October 30, 1992. In addition, the FHWA held four public hearings to solicit comments from interested
parties in October at Washington, D.C.; Dallas, Texas; San Francisco, California; and Rosemont, Illinois. 



Discussion of Comments 



A total of fifty-six commenters responded to this proposed regulation by written submission to the docket and/or
presentation at the public hearings. The commenters represented a total of fifty-two organizations, including
twenty-seven commercial/trade affiliated organizations representing shippers and carriers, fourteen State
government organizations, five local governments, three Federal agencies, one Indian tribe, one citizens' group,
and one consulting firm. 

Nineteen commenters supported and eight opposed the overall format and/or intent of the proposed regulations. The
remaining commenters did not express overall opposition or support for the regulation but did comment on specific
parts of the regulation. Fifty-four commenters discussed details of the proposed rule, and many recommended changes
to various aspects of the rule. The following topics were of main concern.

Definitions 


Definitions were discussed by fifteen commenters who recommended clarification of some definitions and additional
definitions for some terms used in the regulation. These comments were submitted from eight members of the shipper-carrier
industry, four States, one local government, one Federal agency and a citizens' group. 
Nine commenters recommended clarification of the definition of ``routing designations.'' The main concern was
that routing designations broadly defined could include licenses, permits, bonds, and other restrictions or requirements
which might not be route-specific. In response to these concerns, the FHWA has clarified routing designations to
include route-specific features, such as: designations of routes, restrictions on routes, curfews/time-of-travel
restrictions on routes, lane restrictions, routing bans, port-of-entry requirements, and weight restrictions
on routes which are specifically related to NRHM. Common State, Indian tribal, or local regulatory requirements
are not ``routing designations'' when they are not route specific. These can include fee, bonding/insurance, notice,
escort, permit, registration, inspection, and communication requirements which are generally applied to entire
jurisdictions rather than specific highway routes. Such jurisdictional restrictions are not covered under this
regulation. Their possible preemption is determined by the RSPA, not the FHWA. Other restrictions on motor vehicles
that are not specific to the transportation of hazardous materials, such as height, weight, or width restrictions
for roads and bridges, or prohibitions on the use of downtown streets by trucks over certain sizes, are not affected
by this regulation. 


Motor Carrier Responsibilities for Routing 


Five commenters recommended clarifying the applicability of the rule to placarded and marked vehicles. These commenters
were concerned that the regulation would be applicable to placarded NRHM transport while other motor carrier regulations
are applicable to both placarded and marked NRHM transport. The FHWA has amended  397.67(b), which deals with
the motor carriers responsibilities, to include motor vehicles that are marked or placarded.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941012-0-00182 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941012-0-00013 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

One State recommended that reasonable deviation cover highway and law enforcement situations that require a driver
to take an alternative route. The FHWA agreed with this recommendation and amended  397.67(b)(3) to provide
for highway agency detours, such as in work zones, and law enforcement situations. 
The FHWA also amended the terms ``Class A or Class B explosives'' to ``Explosives, in Class 1, Division 1.1, 1.2, 1.3''
so as to be consistent with the current terminology in the Hazardous Materials Regulations (49 CFR 171-180).



Quantities of NRHM 


Four commenters recommended limiting the placarded quantity and type of NRHM for which the regulation applied, such
as to bulk rather than to vehicles transporting small individual cylinders of hazardous materials. The FHWA did not
adopt this recommendation because 49 U.S.C.  5112(a)(1) requires that the highway routing regulations apply
to a vehicle if such vehicle is transporting in commerce a hazardous material for which placarding of the vehicle is
required. This section authorized the Secretary of Transportation to extend application of the regulations to other
hazardous materials, but did not authorize limiting their application to only ``in bulk'' hazardous materials.



Factors 


Twenty-four commenters discussed the factors which States and Indian tribes must consider in developing NRHM routing
designations. These commenters included twelve shippers and carriers, four States, three local governments, three
Federal agencies, one citizens' group and one consulting firm. Eleven commenters recommended clarification of
the factors and development of specific measures or benchmarks by which the factors could be evaluated. These commenters
were concerned that the factors can be applied differently by various jurisdictions, resulting in different routing
designations. Sixteen commenters indicated that specific risk criteria should be considered more important than
the other factors, while seven commenters recommended the Federal government establish minimum criteria for each
of the factors. The FHWA declined to adopt these recommendations because the HMTUSA specifically provided the States
and Indian tribes with the flexibility to determine how each standard should be applied. 
Five commenters mentioned the importance of providing updated Federal guidelines for analyzing the factors; five
commenters recommended additional factors, including accident histories, the use of tunnels, and hours of service
for drivers; and several commenters recommended clarification of the terms ``unreasonably burden commerce,''
``climatic conditions,'' and ``congestion factors.'' In response to these comments, the FHWA revised several of
the factors. The factor on ``terrain considerations'' was amended to include both accident severity and clean up
of spills; ``alternative routes'' was amended to specifically consider safety; ``climatic conditions'' was amended
to provide examples, such as snow, high winds, ice, and fog; and ``consideration of accident history'' was added to
the congestion factor. Additionally, the FHWA is in the process of updating the guidelines for analyzing routing
designations and intends to address each of the factors in the updated publication. 


Grandfather Provision 


The notice of proposed rulemaking contained a section incorporating the grandfather clauses included in the HMTA
as amended by the HMTUSA. One clause provides that routing designations established before November 16, 1990, are
not required to comply with the factors discussed in  397.71 of the regulation. Another clause provides that
the routing designations established before the date of issuance of these regulations do not have to be in accordance
with the routing standards dealing with public participation, consultation with other jurisdictions, and timeliness.

The FHWA received numerous comments from the public expressing their concern that incorporation of these grandfather
clauses in the regulation resulted in unnecessary confusion. The FHWA agrees. A strict reading of the grandfather
clauses would make the factors established in this regulation retroactively applicable to routing designations
established after enactment of the HMTUSA on November 16, 1990. It would be impracticable and unduly burdensome on
the States and Indian tribes to interpret the statute in such a manner. The FHWA would be applying to these routing designations
factors that did not exist in Federal regulations at that time. As a result, the FHWA has decided to apply the factors
established in this final rule prospectively from 30 days after the date of publication in the 

Federal Register

. 
This action should not be interpreted to mean that the routing designations established prior to the publication
of the final rule are not subject to Federal preemption. These routing designations are still subject to Federal preemption
under 49 U.S.C.  5125(a), if_




(1) Complying with a requirement of the State, political subdivision, or tribe and a requirement of this chapter or
a regulation prescribed under this chapter is not possible; or 
(2) The requirement of the State, political subdivision, or tribe, as applied or enforced, is an obstacle to accomplishing
and carrying out this chapter or a regulation prescribed under this chapter.

Jurisdictional Coordination 


Twenty-two commenters addressed the issue of jurisdictional coordination between Federal, State, Indian tribal,
and local governments in the routing designation process. These commenters included ten members of the shipper-carrier
industry, eight States, two local governments, one Federal agency, and one consulting firm. Fourteen commenters
expressed concern about the role of the Federal government versus State and local governments. Many of the commenters
did not recommend changes to the regulation but expressed their concerns about the administration of this regulation.

Eleven commenters discussed the potential for conflicts between States, between local jurisdictions, and between
States and local jurisdictions. Eight commenters were concerned that the required communications between States,
Indian tribes, and local jurisdictions would not be adequately coordinated. The FHWA revised  397.71(b)(3)(i),
dealing with consultation with others, to provide for better interagency coordination. 
Comments from shippers and carriers recommended increasing the State, Indian tribal, or local governments' burden
in establishing and administering a routing designation. For example, their recommendations included requiring
States to produce a risk analysis for each class of NRHM for a specific route designation and for each route designation
that transfers risk from one jurisdiction to another. They also recommended that States develop consistent standards
to be used by all local jurisdictions. State and local governments, on the other hand, expressed concerns about the
proposed requirements that would be imposed on them in establishing and maintaining routing designations. These
comments focused on the administrative burdens associated with the proposed requirements, such as those involving
records maintenance, public hearings, and those that would require a finding that any routing designation would
enhance public safety. 
The FHWA believes that the increased requirements proposed by the shipper and carrier industries would unduly burden
State and local governments without producing a corresponding safety benefit. Similarly, the FHWA believes that
the requirements proposed in the NPRM are the minimum necessary to ensure that States or Indian tribes adopting routing
designations fully and fairly consider all of the factors required under the law. Accordingly, the FHWA is promulgating
this final rule without a change in the proposed coordination requirements for establishing and administering route
designations. 
Two commenters recommended that States or local governments be allowed to have varying standards which could differ
based on the type and quantity of material involved. The FHWA believes that no changes are necessary since States are
already provided the latitude to determine how the standards in this regulation or any additional standards a State
or Indian tribe select are to be applied. 


Dispute Resolution, Preemption, and Waivers of Preemption 


Preemption, waivers of preemption, and dispute resolution procedures were discussed by fourteen commenters. These
commenters included nine members of the shipper-carrier industry, three States, one Federal agency, and one citizens'
group. Four commenters addressed eligibility or standing to petition under the dispute resolution process, with
three commenters recommending the local jurisdiction be eligible to participate in the dispute resolution process.
The FHWA decided not to adopt these recommendations because the HMTUSA authorizes the FHWA only to resolve disputes
between States and between States and Indian tribes. The FHWA believes that States will consider the views and concerns
of local jurisdictions in formulating their positions on preemption and preemption waiver determinations. Additionally,
the dispute resolution procedures provide affected local jurisdictions with notice and the opportunity to participate,
through their State, in the process. 
Eight commenters addressed waiver of preemptions. Two suggested that local governments could use this process to
circumvent State administration of routing designations, another recommended the FHWA prevent local governments
from seeking a waiver of preemption when the State has disapproved the designation, and one remarked that the waiver
of preemption process provides protection for jurisdictions where unique circumstances justify extraordinary
routing measures. The FHWA has decided not to adopt these recommendations because it believes that the finding required
by 49 CFR 397.219 (that the waived routing designation provide an equal or higher level of highway safety to the public
without unreasonably burdening commerce) is sufficient to ensure that the waiver process is not used arbitrarily.
Additionally, States are able to express their views as part of the process.

Four commenters discussed the status of a routing designation pending a preemption determination, with three recommending
the use of an administrative stay until the determination is issued. Another recommended the interim status of a routing
designation be decided by the FHWA. Two commenters recommended an administrative appeals process. The FHWA believes
no changes are necessary because the procedures in 49 CFR part 397, subpart E, maintain the status of a highway routing
pending a preemption determination and provide for administrative reconsideration and judicial review. 
The FHWA, in considering all the comments and the current provisions in subpart E of 49 CFR part 397, determined that
the proposed provisions should be incorporated into the existing procedures in subpart E rather than being included
as redundant procedures unique to this final rule. Consequently,  397.79 Preemption determination procedure;
 397.81 Waivers of preemption;  397.85 Timeliness; and  397.87 Judicial review of preemption
or waiver of preemption decision have been removed and this final rule has been amended to refer to the applicable sections
of subpart E, and subpart E is amended to refer to the provisions of this final rule. 


Public Notification 


Public notification procedures were discussed by twenty-nine commenters. This included seventeen members of the
shipper-carrier industry, five States, three Federal agencies, two local governments, one citizens' group and
one consulting firm. Thirteen commenters discussed public participation. Highway users tended to recommend more
public notification through publications, such as newspapers or the 

Federal Register

, while two government agencies recommended reducing the publication requirements because of costs. Additionally,
five commenters discussed public hearing requirements and recommended providing an opportunity for a public hearing
rather than requiring a public hearing. The FHWA has revised the regulation to grant States and Indian tribes discretion
to hold public hearings on proposed NRHM routing designations after providing the public with notice and an opportunity
to comment. The FHWA also believes publication of the notice for both the comment period and the public hearing, if
one is held, to be most appropriately administered at the State and Indian tribe level, through publications, such
as the official register of the State regulations, rather than through publication in the 

Federal Register

. 


Reporting of Routing Designations 


Ten commenters discussed the requirement for State and Indian tribes to report routing designations to the FHWA.
The majority recommended the FHWA frequently publish new and existing route designations in the 

Federal Register

. Several also recommended that States and Indian tribes, as a prerequisite, be required to report their intention
to establish a route designation to the FHWA for publication in the 

Federal Register

. Upon further review, the FHWA determined it would be more practical and appropriate to provide some form of current
information on established routing designations; consequently, the FHWA is considering alternative methods,
such as establishing an electronic bulletin board, to update and provide this information to the public in a timely
manner along with publishing annual lists of routing designations in the 

Federal Register

. 


Signs, Maps and Lists of Routing Designations 


Ten commenters were concerned about the use and availability of road signs and maps. Highway users were generally
in favor of requiring the use of road signs. They recommended that routing designations be enforceable only to the
extent they are signed. Several States, notably California and Colorado, have successfully operated rather extensive
and efficient routing systems through the use of lists and maps rather than signs. The requirement to sign all routing
designations could also be a considerable administrative and economic burden for States which have or develop extensive
routing designations. Therefore, the FHWA declines to adopt this suggestion.

Reasonable Routes to Terminals and Other Facilities 



Reasonable access to terminals and other facilities was discussed by fifteen commenters, including twelve shippers
and carriers, one State, one Federal entity, and one local agency. 

Nine commenters representing shippers and carriers of fuels and farm supplies recommended more flexibility be provided
for their products in designating route restrictions because many of their deliveries are local and unplanned. Seven
of these commenters, mostly representing short-haul, irregular route carriers, recommended they be exempted from
the proposed limits on reasonable access deviations, because they could impose a financial burden on them. The FHWA
declined to adopt these recommendations because the HMTUSA was specific on providing the States and Indian tribes
with the flexibility to accommodate local and special interests which may be unique to an area's geographic or commercial
situation. 

Three government agencies recommended a larger maximum deviation distance, whereas three carriers recommended
a shorter maximum deviation. In response to these comments, the FHWA amended  397.71(b)(7) by replacing the
proposed requirement that such routes or deviations not exceed twice the distance of the most direct route with a requirement
that States or Indian tribes which establish or provide for reasonable access to and from designated routes use the
shortest practicable route based upon consideration of 13 factors listed in paragraph (b)(9) of that section. 

Several commenters recommended clarification of the applicability of reasonable access and through routing provisions
to local deliveries. The FHWA revised the reasonable access provisions to also apply to pickup and deliveries. 



Through Routing 



Through routing issues were discussed by twenty-seven commenters, including nineteen shippers and carriers, three
Federal agencies, three States, one Indian tribe, and one citizens' action group. Fifteen commenters recommended
a decrease in the maximum deviation distance and two commenters favored an increase to as much as twice the distance
of the most direct route. Four commenters recommended elimination of percentage-based permissible routing deviations
and suggested that consideration of the factors would be adequate. Three commenters also indicated that it was inappropriate
to use an arbitrary percentage to determine the length of permissible deviations when such a percentage has no correlation
to safety. Four commenters recommended clarifying how the maximum deviation limitation would be applied to each
designated routing encountered during a trip or to the sum of all deviations contained in an entire trip. Seven commenters
recommended clarifying the difference between through routing and reasonable routes to terminals and other facilities,
and when the separate regulations are applicable. Several of the commenters recommended that deviations from through
routing should only be implemented when the deviation is safer than the through route or at least as safe and not an unreasonable
burden on commerce. The FHWA has revised the section on through routing to consider public safety and economic burden
(rather than use only percentages and mileage measurements). The revised section provides a relationship between
route deviations and public safety and requires that new routing designations have substantially lower relative
risk than the current routing. When the relative risk of the routing deviation is not substantially lower, the potential
economic effect becomes a significant factor.

Discussion of Final Rule 



Purpose and Scope 



The FHWA is implementing the requirements of the HMTUSA in a new subpart C, Routing, in Part 397 of Title 49, Code of Federal
Regulations. This regulation implements the requirements of the HMTUSA by establishing Federal standards and procedures
which States and Indian tribes are required to follow if they establish, maintain, or enforce routing designations
for the highway transportation of non-radioactive hazardous materials. The intent of these requirements is to ensure
that NRHM are moved safely and that commerce is not burdened by restrictive, uncoordinated, or conflicting requirements
of various jurisdictions. The standards and requirements of this regulation, however, allow for the flexibility
intended in the HMTUSA. The FHWA will not designate routes used for transporting NRHM. Any State or Indian tribe that
chooses to establish, maintain, or enforce NRHM routing designations is required to comply with the Federal standards
established in this regulation. The States and Indian tribes are also required to ensure that any NRHM routing designations
by political subdivisions under their jurisdiction are established, maintained, and enforced in accordance with
this regulation. Any NRHM routing designations that fail to comply with the standards can be preempted. Any State,
political subdivision thereof, Indian tribe, business, organization, or individual affected by a NRHM routing
designation can apply to the Federal Highway Administrator (Administrator) for a preemption determination pursuant
to 49 CFR 397, subpart E, which contains procedures for Federal preemption determinations, waivers of preemptions,
and petition for reconsideration. Procedures for dispute resolution are included in this final rule (49 CFR 397,
subpart C). 

The regulations require States and Indian tribes to report existing NRHM routing designations within their boundaries
to the FHWA and, thereafter, to report any additions or changes to these routing designations 60 days after the effective
date of designation. 



Applicability 



The provisions of this regulation are applicable to States, including any political subdivisions, and Indian tribes
that establish, maintain, or enforce any highway routing designations over which placarded NRHM may or may not be
transported. The regulation also contains several provisions which are applicable to motor carriers transporting
NRHM. 

This regulation requires States, including political subdivisions, and Indian tribes to comply with Federal standards
in establishing NRHM highway routing designations and to follow certain procedures. This regulation also requires
States and Indian tribes that establish, maintain, or enforce routing designations to report these routing designations
to the FHWA. 



Motor Carrier Responsibility for Routing 



Motor carriers transporting NRHM as of the effective date of this regulation are required to comply with the NRHM routing
designations of States or Indian tribes. Where States and Indian tribes have not established NRHM routing designations,
motor carriers are required to operate in accordance with 49 CFR 397.67, previously set forth in 49 CFR 397.9(a), over
routes that avoid heavily populated areas, places where crowds are assembled, tunnels, narrow streets, or alleys.
The routing plan requirements previously set forth in 49 CFR 397.9(b) for transporting Class 1 explosives, divisions
1.1, 1.2, 1.3, as defined in 49 CFR 173.50 and 173.53, have also been incorporated into the same section.

<TEXT>
 

The Federal regulations for highway routing of Class 7 (radioactive) materials, 49 CFR 397, subpart D, remain unchanged
by this regulation. 


State and Indian Tribe Jurisdiction Over Routing 


States and Indian tribes are required to comply with this regulation if they impose routing designations for NRHM.
If a political subdivision of a State wishes to impose NRHM routing designations, the State is required to ensure that
the political subdivision follows these regulations, including coordination with and approval by the routing agency
designated by the Governor. The State is responsible for all NRHM routing designations that local jurisdictions
establish, including resolving any disputes between local jurisdictions. The regulation requires the States and
Indian tribes to designate routing agencies who will be responsible for ensuring that all NRHM routing designations
are made in accordance, and substantively comply, with the procedural requirements of the Federal standards. 


Procedures for States and Indian Tribes 


1. Federal Standards 


This regulation establishes standards which closely follow the specific requirements of 49 U.S.C.  5112(b)
and include procedures for States and Indian tribes to follow if they impose routing designations for NRHM transportation
by motor carriers. The Federal standards provide for enhancement of safety; public participation; consultation
with other State, local, and tribal governments; through routing; reasonable time to reach agreement between affected
States or Indian tribes; not unduly burdening commerce; timely establishment of State and Indian tribe routing;
reasonable routes to terminals; State responsibility for local compliance; and a number of ``factors to consider.''
The list of ``factors to consider'' which States (political subdivisions) and Indian tribes are required to use in
regulating routing is contained in  397.71 of this final rule and includes the factors required by 49 U.S.C.
 5112(b)(1)(I) and additional factors addressing climatic conditions, congestion, and accident analysis.
In accordance with 49 U.S.C.  5112(b)(2), the FHWA will not assign any specific weight to be given by the States
or Indian tribes in considering the factors. Additionally, in analyzing these factors, the States or Indian tribes
shall use the most current version of ``Guidelines for Applying Criteria to Designate Routes for Transporting Hazardous
Materials'' or an equivalent routing analysis. 


2. Public Information and Reporting Requirements 


Section 5112(c) of title 49, United States Code, requires the Secretary, in coordination with the States, to periodically
update and publish a list of current hazardous materials highway routing designations. Accordingly, the FHWA will
compile and publish annually in the 

Federal Register

 a listing of all hazardous materials routing designations. The FHWA will also maintain a list of all current designations,
including additions and changes, and provide this information, upon request, to interested parties. To comply with
this requirement, the FHWA is, through this regulation, requiring States and Indian tribes to initially submit,
to the FHWA, information on all the existing NRHM routing designations within their boundaries. After the initial
submission, any new or changed NRHM routing designation shall be submitted to the FHWA 60 days after the routing designation
takes effect. 
The States (political subdivisions) and Indian tribes are required to use methods such as maps, listings, road signs,
or some combination of these measures as may be needed to adequately inform the public of their NRHM routing designations.

3. Dispute Resolution 


Disputes involving highway routing agreements between political jurisdictions within a State are to be resolved
by the State's routing agency. Unresolved disputes involving through highway routing or routing designation agreements
between States or Indian tribes may be submitted to the Administrator for resolution. Details of the dispute shall
be furnished to the Administrator by the petitioner, together with a description of what was done to try to settle it,
plus a recommendation of the actions that should be taken by the Administrator to resolve the dispute. The FHWA has
revised  397.75 of this regulation to clearly set forth the importance of public safety in any routing designation.
The State or Indian tribe filing the petition for dispute resolution shall be responsible for providing a comparative
risk analysis for the proposed routing designation and the current routing condition. Once a dispute is submitted
to the Administrator, no court action may be taken for one year or until after a decision by the Administrator, whichever
occurs first. 


4. Judicial Review of Dispute Decision 


A party to a dispute who is adversely affected by a dispute resolution decision of the Administrator can obtain judicial
review of the decision if such court action is filed within 90 days after the Administrator's decision becomes final.



5. Preemption Determinations and Waivers of Preemption 


On September 24, 1992, the FHWA published an interim final rule (57 FR 44132) amending 49 CFR 397 by adding a subpart
E which established procedures applicable to preemption determinations and waivers of preemption. This final rule
amends subpart E to make these procedures applicable to NRHM routing designations which are now included in subpart
C. 
Any highway routing designation established, maintained or enforced by a State, a political subdivision thereof,
or an Indian tribe is preempted if: 
(1) Compliance with both the highway routing designation and any requirement of chapter 51 of title 49, United States
Code, or of a regulation prescribed thereunder is not possible; 
(2) The highway routing designation, as applied or enforced is an obstacle to accomplishing and carrying out chapter
51 of title 49, United States Code, or the regulations prescribed thereunder; or 
(3) A State or Indian tribe establishes, maintains or enforces any routing designation that does not comply with the
procedural and substantive requirements of the Federal standards set forth in this regulation. 
Any person, including a State, political subdivision thereof, or Indian tribe, affected by a NRHM routing designation
can apply to the Administrator for a determination of whether such routing designation is preempted. 
A State, political subdivision, or Indian tribe may apply to the Administrator for a waiver of preemption. The Administrator
is authorized to waive preemption of a NRHM routing designation, based on a determination that it provides equal or
better protection to the public than these regulations would provide, and it does not unreasonably burden commerce.



Technical Amendments 


Public Law 103-272 (108 Stat. 745), enacted on July 5, 1994, codified certain U.S. transportation laws as title
49, United States Code. Like other transportation statutes, the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act was repealed
and its contents restated in title 49. This final rule changes the citations contained in the NPRM to conform to the
provisions of the new law.

Rulemaking Analyses and Notices 


Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review) and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures 


This rulemaking document was reviewed under E.O. 12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review.'' The FHWA has determined
that this regulation is a significant regulatory action within the meaning of that Order. This rulemaking is considered
a significant regulation under Department of Transportation regulatory policies and procedures because of substantial
congressional and public interest. This interest involves minimizing risks while allowing reasonable highway
routing for the transportation of NRHM. The regulation does not require the establishment of NRHM routing designations
or the use of Federal preemption determinations, waivers of preemption, and dispute resolution, but does provide
standards and procedures which are required to be followed if these actions are taken. The FHWA believes that for those
States or Indian tribal governments which choose to adopt routing designations, the benefits from implementing
these regulations, such as NRHM routing designation continuity, public participation, uniform standards, and
preemption and dispute resolution procedures, will be greater than the costs, such as providing the required documentation,
coordination, and analysis which allow discretion in level of detail. The FHWA anticipates that the economic impact
of this regulation will be minimal based upon a regulatory evaluation. 


Regulatory Flexibility Act 


In compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act 
(Pub. L. 96-354; 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the FHWA has evaluated the effects of this regulation on small entities
such as Indian tribes, local governments, and small businesses. The HMTUSA requires the Secretary to adopt standards
which States and Indian tribes must follow if they establish, maintain, or enforce NRHM routing designations (specific
highway routes over which NRHM may or may not be transported within their jurisdictions, limitations or requirements
for highway routing). The regulation does not require the use of NRHM routing designations or Federal preemption
determinations, waivers of preemption, and dispute resolution, but provides standards and procedures which are
required to be followed if these actions are chosen to be used. The discretionary nature of the actions allows for cost
saving options to be used in balancing the needs in commerce and the risks in the transportation of NRHM. To date, relatively
few States and local jurisdictions have chosen to establish NRHM routing designations. The FHWA has concluded that
the regulation does not substantially affect the ability of, or cost to, local jurisdictions establishing needed
NRHM routing designations. The preemption and dispute resolution procedures provide all entities more effective
and efficient means of resolving routing issues. Based on this evaluation, the FHWA certifies that this regulation
does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 


Executive Order 12612 (Federalism Assessment) 


This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612.

The HMTUSA requires the Secretary to adopt standards which States and Indian tribes must follow if they establish,
maintain, or enforce NRHM routing designations (specific highway routes over which NRHM may or may not be transported
within their jurisdictions, limitations or requirements for highway routing). The regulation recognizes the State
and Indian tribal role in the designation of highway routes for NRHM while de-emphasizing the role of local governments.
The regulation provides for discretion by the States and Indian tribes as to whether they impose NRHM routing designations.
Each State and Indian tribe is free to establish NRHM routing designations tailored to its own needs in accordance
with the Federal standards, using the DOT ``Guidelines for Applying Criteria to Designate Routes for Transporting
Hazardous Materials,'' or an equivalent routing analysis which adequately considers overall risk to the public.
States and localities have a better understanding of the relative safety of the highways within their jurisdictions
than does the Federal government. 
The regulation limits the policymaking discretion of the States, their political subdivisions and Indian tribes.
The regulation is necessary, however, to achieve the purposes and implement the requirements of the HMTUSA. Accordingly,
it is certified that this action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles, criteria, and requirements
contained in Executive Order 12612 and, it has been determined that this action does not have sufficient federalism
implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

 397.71 

Federal standards. 



(a) A State or Indian tribe shall comply with the Federal standards under paragraph (b) of this section when establishing,
maintaining or enforcing specific NRHM routing designations over which NRHM may or may not be transported. 

(b) The Federal standards are as follows: 

(1) Enhancement of public safety. The State or Indian tribe shall make a finding, supported by the record to be developed
in accordance with paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) and (b)(3)(iv) of this section, that any NRHM routing designation enhances
public safety in the areas subject to its jurisdiction and in other areas which are directly affected by such highway
routing designation. In making such a finding, the State or Indian tribe shall consider: 

(i) The factors listed in paragraph (b)(9) of this section; and 

(ii) The DOT ``Guidelines for Applying Criteria to Designate Routes for Transporting Hazardous Materials,'' DOT/RSPA/OHMT-89-02,
July 1989

1

 or its most current version; or an equivalent routing analysis which adequately considers overall risk to the public.






(2) Public participation. Prior to the establishment of any NRHM routing designation, the State or Indian tribe shall
undertake the following actions to ensure participation by the public in the routing process:

(i) The State or Indian tribe shall provide the public with notice of any proposed NRHM routing designation and a 30-day
period in which to comment. At any time during this period or following review of the comments received, the State or
Indian tribe shall decide whether to hold a public hearing on the proposed NRHM route designation. The public shall
be given 30 days prior notice of the public hearing which shall be conducted as described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of
this section. Notice for both the comment period and the public hearing, if one is held, shall be given by publication
in at least two newspapers of general circulation in the affected area or areas and shall contain a complete description
of the proposed routing designation, together with the date, time, and location of any public hearings. Notice for
both the comment period and any public hearing may also be published in the official register of the State. 
(ii) If it is determined that a public hearing is necessary, the State or Indian tribe shall hold at least one public
hearing on the record during which the public will be afforded the opportunity to present their views and any information
or data related to the proposed NRHM routing designation. The State shall make available to the public, upon payment
of prescribed costs, copies of the transcript of the hearing, which shall include all exhibits and documents presented
during the hearing or submitted for the record. 
(3) Consultation with others. Prior to the establishment of any NRHM routing designation, the State or Indian tribe
shall provide notice to, and consult with, officials of affected political subdivisions, States and Indian tribes,
and any other affected parties. Such actions shall include the following: 
(i) At least 60 days prior to establishing a routing designation, the State or Indian tribe shall provide notice, in
writing, of the proposed routing designation to officials responsible for highway routing in all other affected
States or Indian tribes. A copy of this notice may also be sent to all affected political subdivisions. This notice
shall request approval, in writing, by those States or Indian tribes, of the proposed routing designations. If no
response is received within 60 days from the day of receipt of the notification of the proposed routing designation,
the routing designation shall be considered approved by the affected State or Indian tribe. 
(ii) The manner in which consultation under this paragraph is conducted is left to the discretion of the State or Indian
tribe. 
(iii) The State or Indian tribe shall attempt to resolve any concern or disagreement expressed by any consulted official
related to the proposed routing designation. 

(iv) The State or Indian tribe shall keep a record of the names and addresses of the officials notified pursuant to this
section and of any consultation or meeting conducted with these officials or their representatives. Such record
shall describe any concern or disagreement expressed by the officials and any action undertaken to resolve such disagreement
or address any concern. 
(4) Through routing. In establishing any NRHM routing designation, the State or Indian tribe shall ensure through
highway routing for the transportation of NRHM between adjacent areas. The term ``through highway routing'' as used
in this paragraph means that the routing designation must ensure continuity of movement so as to not impede or unnecessarily
delay the transportation of NRHM. The State or Indian tribe shall utilize the procedures established in paragraphs
(b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section in meeting these requirements. In addition, the State or Indian tribe shall make
a finding, supported by a risk analysis conducted in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, that the routing
designation enhances public safety. If the risk analysis shows_
(i) That the current routing presents at least 50 percent more risk to the public than the deviation under the proposed
routing designation, then the proposed routing designation may go into effect.

(ii) That the current routing presents a greater risk but less than 50 percent more risk to the public than the deviation
under the proposed routing restriction, then the proposed routing restriction made by a State or Indian tribe shall
only go into effect if it does not force a deviation of more than 25 miles or result in an increase of more than 25 percent
of that part of a trip affected by the deviation, whichever is shorter, from the most direct route through a jurisdiction
as compared to the intended deviation. 
(iii) That the current route has the same or less risk to the public than the deviation resulting from the proposed routing
designation, then the routing designation shall not be allowed. 
(5) Agreement of other States; burden on commerce. Any NRHM routing designation which affects another State or Indian
tribe shall be established, maintained, or enforced only if: 
(i) It does not unreasonably burden commerce, and 
(ii) It is agreed to by the affected State or Indian tribe within 60 days of receipt of the notice sent pursuant to paragraph
(b)(3)(i) of this section, or it is approved by the Administrator pursuant to  397.75. 
(6) Timeliness. The establishment of a NRHM routing designation by any State or Indian tribe shall be completed within
18 months of the notice given in either paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section, whichever occurs first. (7) Reasonable
routes to terminals and other 
facilities. In establishing or providing for reasonable access to and from designated routes, the State or Indian
tribe shall use the shortest practicable route considering the factors listed in paragraph (b)(9) of this section.
In establishing any NRHM routing designation, the State or Indian tribe shall provide reasonable access for motor
vehicles transporting NRHM to reach: 
(i) Terminals, 
(ii) Points of loading, unloading, pickup and delivery, and 
(iii) Facilities for food, fuel, repairs, rest, and safe havens. 
(8) Responsibility for local compliance. The States shall be responsible for ensuring that all of their political
subdivisions comply with the provisions of this subpart. The States shall be responsible for resolving all disputes
between such political subdivisions within their jurisdictions. If a State or any political subdivision thereof,
or an Indian tribe chooses to establish, maintain, or enforce any NRHM routing designation, the Governor, or Indian
tribe, shall designate a routing agency for the State or Indian tribe, respectively. The routing agency shall ensure
that all NRHM routing designations within its jurisdiction comply with the Federal standards in this section. The
State or Indian tribe shall comply with the public information and reporting requirements contained in  397.73.

(9) Factors to consider. In establishing any NRHM routing designation, the State or Indian tribe shall consider the
following factors: 
(i) Population density. The population potentially exposed to a NRHM release shall be estimated from the density
of the residents, employees, motorists, and other persons in the area, using United States census tract maps or other
reasonable means for determining the population within a potential impact zone along a designated highway route.
The impact zone is the potential range of effects in the event of a release. Special populations such as schools, hospitals,
prisons, and senior citizen homes shall, among other things, be considered when determining the potential risk to
the populations along a highway routing. Consideration shall be given to the amount of time during which an area will
experience a heavy population density.
(ii) Type of highway. The characteristics of each alternative NRHM highway routing designation shall be compared.
Vehicle weight and size limits, underpass and bridge clearances, roadway geometrics, number of lanes, degree of
access control, and median and shoulder structures are examples of characteristics which a State or Indian tribe
shall consider.

(iii) Types and quantities of NRHM. An examination shall be made of the type and quantity of NRHM normally transported
along highway routes which are included in a proposed NRHM routing designation, and consideration shall be given
to the relative impact zone and risks of each type and quantity. 
(iv) Emergency response capabilities. In consultation with the proper fire, law enforcement, and highway safety
agencies, consideration shall be given to the emergency response capabilities which may be needed as a result of a
NRHM routing designation. The analysis of the emergency response capabilities shall be based upon the proximity
of the emergency response facilities and their capabilities to contain and suppress NRHM releases within the impact
zones. 
(v) Results of consultation with affected persons. Consideration shall be given to the comments and concerns of all
affected persons and entities provided during public hearings and consultations conducted in accordance with this
section. 
(vi) Exposure and other risk factors. States and Indian tribes shall define the exposure and risk factors associated
with any NRHM routing designations. The distance to sensitive areas shall be considered. Sensitive areas include,
but are not limited to, homes and commercial buildings; special populations in hospitals, schools, handicapped
facilities, prisons and stadiums; water sources such as streams and lakes; and natural areas such as parks, wetlands,
and wildlife reserves. 
(vii) Terrain considerations. Topography along and adjacent to the proposed NRHM routing designation that may affect
the potential severity of an accident, the dispersion of the NRHM upon release and the control and clean up of NRHM if
released shall be considered. 
(viii) Continuity of routes. Adjacent jurisdictions shall be consulted to ensure routing continuity for NRHM across
common borders. Deviations from the most direct route shall
