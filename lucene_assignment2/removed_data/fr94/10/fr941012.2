<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of determination.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In accordance with Title 13, United States Code, Sections 182, 224, and 225, I have determined the Census Bureau needs
to collect data 
covering year-end inventories, annual sales, and purchases to provide a 
sound statistical basis for the formation of policy by various 
governmental agencies. These data also apply to a variety of public and 
business needs. This annual survey is a continuation of similar 
wholesale trade surveys conducted each year since 1978. It provides on 
a comparable classification basis annual sales and purchases for 1994 
and inventories for 1993 and 1994. These data are not available 
publicly on a timely basis from nongovernmental or other governmental 
sources.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Census Bureau is authorized to take 
surveys necessary to furnish current data on subjects covered by the 
major censuses authorized by Title 13, United States Code. This survey 
will provide continuing and timely national statistical data on 2 
wholesale trade for the period between economic censuses. The 1992 
Economic Censuses are currently being tabulated. The data collected 
in this survey will be within the general scope and nature of those 
inquiries covered in the economic censuses. 



The Census Bureau will require selected firms operating merchant 
wholesale establishments in the United States (with sales size 
determining the probability of selection) to report in the 1994 Annual 
Trade Survey. We will furnish report forms to the firms 
covered by this survey and will require their submission within thirty 
days after receipt. The sample will provide, with measurable 
reliability, statistics on the subjects specified above. 

This survey has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget, 
in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act, Public Law 96-511, as 
amended, and was cleared under OMB Control No. 0607-0195. We will 
provide copies of the form upon written request to the Director, Bureau 
of the Census, Washington, D.C. 20233. 

Based upon the foregoing, I have directed that an annual survey be 
conducted for the purpose of collecting these data.

Notice of Amended Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Fresh Cut Roses From Colombia

A. Grupo Andes 


In determining whether Grupo Andes had a viable home market for the preliminary determination, the Department relied
upon the narrative of Grupo Andes's July 22 submission, which indicated that its home market was not viable when, in
its appendix to this submission, Grupo Andes provided data which demonstrated that its home market was viable. Thus,
although there was data on the record which established that Andes' home market was viable, we did not pursue further
Grupo Andes home market sales data for the preliminary determination. Therefore, the Department's initial viability
determination for Grupo Andes was erroneous, as was the Department's decision not to take additional action in regard
to Grupo Andes' home market sales. Therefore, the Department was left with no option but to preliminarily assign Grupo
Andes a margin based on BIA. Because the Department considers its initial unintentional error to be ministerial,
and because correction of that error would result in a change of at least 5 absolute percentage points in, but not less
than 25 percent of, the preliminary margin for Grupo Andes, that error constitutes a significant ministerial error
under proposed 19 CFR 353.15(g)(4) (57 Fed. Reg. 1131, 1132 (January 10, 1992)), the Department's proposed regulation
for correcting significant ministerial errors in preliminary antidumping and countervailing duty determinations.
The Department thus has determined to amend its preliminary determination to establish a preliminary margin for
Grupo Andes based upon its data on the administrative record. 

The Department further will (1) require Grupo Andes to submit its home market sales listing; (2) investigate, if necessary,
whether Grupo Andes made home market sales at prices below its cost of production; and (3) conduct verification of
all information submitted. 



B. Grupo Benilda 


Two business days before the Department's preliminary determination, Grupo Benilda filed a pre-verification submission
which appeared to contain such extensive additions and corrections to its original response as to constitute an entirely
new response. The Department thus determined initially that the submission called into question the integrity of
the response as a whole and preliminarily assigned Grupo Benilda a margin based on BIA. Subsequently, the Department
has determined that Grupo Benilda's September 8 submission, rather than representing a new response, in fact contained
minor data corrections to its response. Because that initial determination in regard to the September 8 submission
was an unintentional error which the Department considers to be ministerial, and because correction of that error
would lead to a change of at least 5 absolute percentage points in, but not less than 25 percent of, the preliminary margin
for Grupo Benilda, that error constitutes a significant ministerial error pursuant to the Department's proposed
regulation outlined above. The Department thus has determined to amend its preliminary determination to establish
a preliminary margin for Grupo Benilda based upon its data on the administrative record prior to its September 8 submission.



C. All Others Rate 


Because the preliminary dumping margins for Grupo Andes and Grupo Benilda have changed, the preliminary weighted-average
``all others'' rate has also changed. (See Suspension of Liquidation section of this notice, below.) 


Use of Third Country Prices/Constructed Value 


For a discussion of the proper basis for Foreign Market Value, see the Department's September 12, 1994, preliminary
determination (59 FR 48284, September 20, 1994). 


Fair Value Comparisons 


To determine whether sales of fresh cut roses from Colombia to the United States were made at less than fair value, we
compared the United States price (USP) to the foreign market value (FMV), as specified in the ``United States Price''
and ``Foreign Market Value'' sections of this notice. For all U.S. prices, we used weighted-average monthly U.S.
prices (see the September 12, 1994, concurrence memorandum). 


United States Price 


For sales by both Grupo Andes and Grupo Benilda, we based USP on purchase price, in accordance with section 772(b) of
the Trade Act of 1930, as amended (``the Act''), when the subject merchandise was sold to unrelated purchasers in the
United States prior to importation and when exporter's sales price (ESP) methodology was not otherwise indicated.

<PARENT> FR941012-2-00002 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In addition, where certain sales to the first unrelated purchaser took place after importation into the United States,
we based USP on ESP, in accordance with section 772(c) of the Act. 
We made company-specific adjustments, as follows: 


A. Grupo Andes 


For Grupo Andes, we calculated purchase price based on packed, f.o.b. prices to unrelated customers in the United
States. We made deductions, where appropriate, for foreign inland freight. 
We calculated ESP based on packed prices to unrelated customers in the United States. We made deductions, where appropriate,
for foreign inland freight, air freight, U.S. Customs duties, U.S. and Colombian indirect selling expenses including
inventory carrying costs, and U.S. direct selling expenses including credit expenses. 
For roses that were further manufactured into bouquets after importation, we adjusted for all value added in the United
States, including the proportional amount of profit or loss attributable to the value added, pursuant to section
772(e)(3) of the Act. We added packing to reported U.S. prices. For the cost of merchandise subject to further manufacturing,
in addition to the adjustments cited in the section on FMV, below, for constructed value, we (1) corrected the U.S.
general expenses to reflect a percentage of cost of goods sold, and (2) recalculated interest expense to exclude the
CV offset. 



B. Grupo Benilda 


For Grupo Benilda, we calculated purchase price based on packed, f.o.b. prices to unrelated customers in the United
States. We made deductions, where appropriate, for foreign inland freight. 
We calculated ESP based on packed prices to unrelated customers in the United States. We made deductions, where appropriate,
for foreign inland freight, air freight, U.S. customs duties, U.S. brokerage and handling expenses, credit expenses,
Colombian Flower Council expenses, the greater of U.S. commissions to the related reseller or U.S. indirect selling
expenses incurred, Colombian indirect selling expenses, including inventory carrying costs and other indirect
selling expenses. For those ESP sales where Grupo Benilda did not report airfreight, U.S. duty, and U.S. brokerage
and handling expenses, we applied, as BIA, the highest reported value for each such expense (see the Department's
September 9, 1994, concurrence memorandum.) 


Foreign Market Value 


In order to determine whether there were sufficient sales of fresh cut roses in the home market to serve as a viable basis
for calculating FMV, we compared the volume of home market sales of roses to the volume of third country sales of roses
in accordance with section 773(a)(1)(B) of the Act. Based on this comparison, we determined that Grupo Benilda had
a viable home market with respect to sales of roses during the POI and, therefore, we based FMV for Grupo Benilda on home
market sales where those sales were above the cost of production. For Grupo Andes, we based FMV on constructed value
(CV). 

We based FMV for Grupo Benilda on two six-month periods. Period one is January 1993 through June 1993, and period two
is July 1993 through December 1993. For a further discussion of these periods, see the September 12, 1994, concurrence
memorandum. 


A. Grupo Andes 


For Grupo Andes, we calculated FMV based on CV, in accordance with section 773(e) of the Act. We calculated CV based
on Grupo Andes' cost of cultivation, plus general expenses, profit and packing in the United States. For total general
expenses, including selling and financial expenses (SG&A), we used the greater of reported general expenses
or the statutory minimum of ten percent of the cost of cultivation. For CV profit, we used the greater of the weighted-average
reported profit during the POI or statutory minimum of eight percent of the cost of cultivation and general expenses,
in accordance with 19 CFR 353.50(a)(2) and section 773(e)(B) of the Act. We adjusted Grupo Andes' CV data (1) to correct
the export quantity sold to agree to information reported in the supplemental section A; and (2) to base selling and
packing expenses on information provided in the sales response.

<DOCNO> FR941012-2-00006 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941012-2-00002 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

For CV to purchase price comparisons, we made circumstance of sales adjustments for direct selling expenses including
credit expenses. 


 For CV to ESP comparisons, we made deductions, where appropriate, for direct selling expenses including credit expenses.
We also deducted from CV the weighted-average indirect selling expenses, including inventory carrying costs up
to the amount of indirect selling expenses incurred on U.S. sales, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(b)(2). 


 

B. Grupo Benilda 


 

Because we found ``reasonable grounds to believe or suspect'' that Grupo Benilda sold roses in Colombia at prices
below their COP, we initiated a COP investigation to determine whether it had home market sales that were made at less
than their respective COPs, in accordance with section 773(b) of the Act. (See the September 8, 1994, memorandum from
Richard W. Moreland to Barbara R. Stafford.) 


 In accordance with section 773(b) of the Act, we examined whether Benilda sold roses below the cost of production in
significant quantities over an extended period of time. In keeping with our practice involving perishable products,
if more than 50 percent of Grupo Benilda's sales of roses, on a model-specific basis, were at prices above the COP, we
did not disregard any below-cost sales pursuant to section 773(b) of the Act, because we determined that Grupo Benilda's
below-cost sales were not made in substantial quantities within an extended period of time. (See Certain Fresh Winter
Vegetables From Mexico 45 FR 20512 (1980).) If between 50 and 90 percent of Grupo Benilda's sales, on a model-specific
basis, were at prices below the COP, and the below cost sales were made within an extended period of time, we disregarded
only the below-cost sales. Where we found that more than 90 percent of Grupo Benilda's sales, on a model-specific basis,
were at prices below the COP, we disregarded all sales and calculated FMV based on CV. 


 In order to determine whether Grupo Benilda's home market sales were above the COP, we calculated COP based on the sum
of Grupo Benilda's cost of cultivation, general expenses, and packing; we calculated CV based on the sum of Grupo Benilda's
COP plus profit. For total general expenses, including selling and financial expenses, (SG&A) we used the greater
of reported general expenses or the statutory minimum of ten percent of the cost of cultivation. For CV profit, we used
the greater of the weighted-average reported profit during the POI or the statutory minimum of eight percent of the
cost of cultivation and general expenses, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.50(a)(2) and section 773(e)(B) of the Act.
We adjusted Grupo Benilda's COP and CV data to (1) correct an error in the company's calculation of average interest
expense; (2) include the entire amount of the 1993 labor bonus; and (3) disallow the company's exclusion of certain
G&A expenses.

<PARENT> FR941012-2-00002 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In accordance with 19 CFR 353.58, we compared Grupo Benilda's U.S. sales to home market sales made at the same level
of trade, where possible. 


 For those home market sales above the cost of production, we based FMV on packed, f.o.b. farm prices to unrelated customers.



 For home market price to purchase price comparisons, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.56(a)(2), we made circumstance-of-sale
adjustments, were appropriate, for differences in credit expenses. 


 For home market price to ESP comparisons, we made deductions for the weighted-average home market indirect selling
expenses, including, where appropriate, inventory carrying costs, up to the amount of the greater of either indirect
selling expenses incurred on U.S. sales or related-party commissions paid on U.S. sales, in accordance with 19 CFR
353.56(b)(1). We also made deductions, for home market credit expenses. For all price-to-price comparisons, we
also deducted home market packing costs and added U.S. packing costs, in accordance with section 773(a)(1) of the
Act. 


 For CV to purchase price comparisons, we made circumstance of sales adjustments for credit expenses. 


 For CV to ESP comparisons, we made deductions, where appropriate, for credit expenses. We also deducted from CV the
weighted-average home market indirect selling expenses, including inventory carrying costs, up to the amount of
the greater of either indirect selling expenses incurred on U.S. sales or related-party commissions paid on U.S.
sales, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(b)(2). 


 

Currency Conversion 


 

Because certified exchange rates for Colombia were unavailable from the Federal Reserve, we made currency conversions
for expenses denominated in Colombian pesos based on the official monthly exchange rates in effect on the dates of
the U.S. sales as certified by the International Monetary Fund. 


 

Verification 


 

As provided in section 776(b) of the Act, we will verify the information used in making our final determination. 


 

Suspension of Liquidation 


 

In accordance with section 733(d)(2) of the Act, the Department will direct the U.S. Customs Service to continue to
require a cash deposit or posting of bond on all entries of subject merchandise from Colombia for Grupo Andes, Grupo
Benilda and for the all-others rate at the newly calculated rate, that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for
consumption on or after the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

. The suspension of liquidation will remain in effect until further notice. The weighted-average dumping margins
are as follows:

 Notice of Amendment to Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On November 24, 1993, the Department of Commerce (the Department) submitted to the Court of International Trade (CIT)
the final results of redetermination pursuant to a remand in 

Pulton Chain Co.,

 v. 

United States

 (Slip Op. 93-202, October 18, 1993). On December 14, 1993, the CIT affirmed our redetermination (Slip Op. 93-235).
In accordance with that affirmation, we are hereby amending the final results of the administrative review for the
April 1, 1981, through March 31, 1982, and the April 1, 1982, through March 31, 1983, periods with respect to Pulton
Chain Co. (Pulton). Pulton's rate is 5.22 percent for the 1981-1982 period and 5.45 percent for the 1982-1983
period. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


On October 18, 1993, the CIT, in 

Pulton Chain Co.,

 v. 

United States

 (Slip Op. 93-020, October 18, 1993), remanded to the Department for redetermination the final results of the

April 1, 1981, through March 31, 1982, and April 1, 1982, through March 31, 1983, administrative reviews of the antidumping
finding on roller chain, other than bicycle, from Japan (38 FR 9226; 
April 12, 1973). 
In the Department's final results of administrative review, the dumping margin for Pulton roller chain sold or imported
into the United States during the periods April 1, 1981, through 
March 31, 1982, and April 1, 1982, through March 31, 1983, was 15.92 percent. Pulton's dumping margin for those final
results was based on best information available (BIA), in accordance with Section 776(c) of the Tariff Act of 1930,
as amended, (the Act) (

see Roller Chain from Japan, Final Results of the Antidumping Duty Administrative Reviews,

 56 FR 32175 (July 15, 1991)). 
On October 18, 1993, the CIT remanded this case to the Department ``to apply BIA rates based on the calculated rates
for other exporters during the period at issue, or to calculate an actual antidumping duty rate for [Pulton]'' (

see Pulton Chain Co.

 v. 

United States

 (Slip Op. 93-202)). 


Final Remand Results 


In accordance with the CIT's order, the Department revised its final results with respect to Pulton for the 1981-1982
and 1982-1983 administrative reviews of roller chain from Japan. On the basis of the BIA margins sanctioned
by the CIT, we determined that the revised weighted-average margin for Pulton for the period April 1, 1981, through
March 31, 1982, is 5.22 percent and the weighted-average margin for Pulton for the period April 1, 1982, through March
31, 1983, is 5.45 percent. 




FINAL RESULTS OF REDETERMINATION: 


On December 14, 1993, the CIT affirmed our redetermination (Slip Op. 93-235). In accordance with that affirmation,
we are hereby amending the final results of the administrative review for the April 1, 1981, through March 31, 1982,
and the April 1, 1982, through March 31, 1983 periods with respect to Pulton. Pulton's rate for the 1981-1982
period is 5.22 percent and for the 1982-1983 period it is 5.45 percent. 
The Department shall determine, and the Customs Service shall assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate entries.
The Department will issue appraisement instructions directly to the Customs Service. 
This notice is in accordance with section 516(a)(e) of the Act.

Notice of partially closed meeting.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Pursuant to the Federal Advisory Committee Act, 5 U.S.C. app. 2, notice is hereby given that the National Technical
Information Service Advisory Board (the ``Board'') will meet on Monday, November 7, 1994, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. and
on Tuesday, November 8, 1994, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. The session on November 8, 1994 will be closed to the public.



The Board was established under the authority of 15 U.S.C. 3704b(c), and was chartered on September 15, 1989. The Board
is composed of five members appointed by the Secretary of Commerce who are eminent in such fields as information resources
management, information technology, and library and information services. The purpose of the meeting is to review
and make recommendations regarding general policies and operations of NTIS, including policies in connection with
fees and charges for its services. The agenda will include a progress report on NTIS activities, an update on NTIS plans
to assist Depository Libraries, an update on the progress of FedWorld, and a discussion of NTIS' long range plans.
The closed session discussion is scheduled to begin at 9 a.m. and end at 4 p.m. on November 8, 1994. The session will be
closed because premature disclosure of the information to be discussed would be likely to significantly frustrate
implementation of NTIS' business plan.

<DOCTITLE>Proposed Changes to Administrative Protective Order Procedures in Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Proceedings,
APO Application Form and Standard APO</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice and request for comment on proposed changes to administrative protective order (APO) procedures in antidumping
and countervailing duty proceedings, APO application form and standard APO.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The International Trade Administration (ITA) of the Department of Commerce is considering three significant changes
in its APO practice: (1) The adoption of a single revised application for an APO containing all of the conditions the
ITA will require concerning the use and limited disclosure of hard copy and electronic APO information; (2) the adoption
of a single, standard APO to be placed on the record of each case by the administering office, and (3) the issuance of
an approved APO list of signatories to the APO. The revised application and APO respond to the concerns and requests

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



Background 



ITA's APO procedures apply to the vast quantity of proprietary information ITA receives in the course of its administrative
antidumping duty (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) proceedings from both foreign governments and companies, and
the U.S. domestic industry. The Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. 1905, prevents a federal agency from disclosing business
proprietary information unless a specific exemption is provided by statute. Section 777 of the Tariff Act of 1930,
19 U.S.C. 1677a, however, provides an exemption for the ITA from the Trade Secrets Act, and permits limited disclosure
of business proprietary information under an APO to representatives of parties to specific proceedings for which
the proprietary information was submitted. The purpose of limited disclosure is to provide representatives with
the information necessary to fully represent the interests of the parties in open and fair proceedings. 

The ITA last revised its APO application, procedures, and relevant regulations in 1989 in order to implement the provisions
of The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (the Omnibus Trade Act) affecting access under APO. The Omnibus
Trade Act broadened the scope of disclosure of business proprietary information under APO, required direct service
of APO information on authorized parties, and established statutory deadlines for the release of APO information.
Given the dramatic increase in the amount of information submitted in ITA's proceedings, as well as in the increased
desire for access to electronic media, the 1989 APO application and procedures reflected ITA's concerns that information
in both hard copy and electronic form be adequately protected. 

Under these still current procedures, ITA's APO application and the APO itself contain detailed restrictions on
the use and distribution of proprietary information. A party's representative submits an APO application, and the
ITA generally issues an APO to that representative. Except for instances where a party is represented by co-counsel,
a party may have only one representative for each proceeding. If a party wishes to have an additional representative,
it must operate through the single representative. Any time a party wishes to add or change a representative, it must
file an additional APO application, and the ITA will issue an amended APO.

After 5 years of experience with the 1989 procedures, and after consultation with the Bar Committee representing
the International Law Section of the District of Columbia Bar, the Section of International Law and Practice of the
American Bar Association, the International Trade Commission Trial Lawyers Association, and the Customs and International
Trade Bar Association (the Committee), we believe it is time to reevaluate and revise our procedures. The Committee
polled its members on various issues. Through this cooperative effort, the ITA is proposing changes that reduce the
micromanagement of a representative's handling of business proprietary information, allow for two independent
representatives to have APOs in a proceeding, and provide for the issuance of a single APO on the record in each proceeding,
rather than the issuance of multiple APOs to each representative. We believe that the proposed changes will provide
for effective and practicable protection of business proprietary information, expedite issuance of APOs and APO
amendments, and reduce the number of APO violations. 


Proposed Changes


The proposed changes to the APO application and the procedures are discussed below. 


(1) Revised Application for APO 


At the recommendation of the Committee, we propose removing overly restrictive conditions in the application for
APO and the APO itself, while retaining the critical restrictions necessary to protect the APO information. The proposed
changes will streamline the process for both the parties and the ITA. Under current procedures, ITA issues one APO
for proprietary information submitted on hard copy, and a different APO for proprietary information submitted on
electronic medium, the so-called ``computer tape'' APO. The tape APO contains numerous additional restrictions.

The proposed APO application incorporates three restrictions concerning electronic data and eliminates additional
conditions that the ITA has traditionally placed in its computer tape APOs. The significant changes to the APO application
are set forth below. 


Representation


The proposed APO application (Items 1 and 7) allows a party to the proceeding to have two independent representatives.
Item 7 of the application defines a ``representative'' as an attorney or non-legal specialist associated with a single
firm, who is acting on behalf of the party to the proceeding. Separate applications can be filed by applicants from
more than one law firm or non-legal specialist firm acting on behalf of the party or parties to the proceeding. When
an interested party has representatives from two different firms, the lead representative that will be the primary
contact for the Department must be identified. A ``lead'' representative must be designated either in the transmittal
letter to the ITA, or in the APO application, if more than one representative is retained. A non-legal specialist may
function as the ``lead'' representative. The ITA does not wish to consider authorizing more than two representatives
(i.e., firms) on behalf of a party as it may cause confusion and create difficulties in administering the proceeding.

<TEXT>
 

The current application for APO requires that an attorney assume responsibility for a non-legal ``other representative''
if an attorney has been retained to represent a party to the proceeding. The proposed modification will allow a party
greater flexibility in its choice of representation and would allow a party to hire a second representative, an economic
consultant or ``other representative,'' separate from a law firm. In addition, the ITA will only allow a non-legal
representative access to proprietary information if that representative has a relatively active practice before
the ITA, so that barring practice before the ITA is an effective sanction in the event the representative abuses the
APO system. In this circumstance, the ITA will consider the non-attorney applicant's established practice before
the ITA and proven reliability before granting the requested APO. 


Word Processing Duplication of APO Application


The proposed APO application (Item 2) allows the applicant to produce page 1, and the names of the representatives
and their affiliations (Items 29 and 30) on a word processing system to facilitate the application process. To prevent
unauthorized alteration of the content of the substantive requirements contained in the application, the main body
of the application may only be photocopied by the applicant. 
Parties have requested that the ITA consider allowing the entire application to be reproduced on the applicant's
word processing system to facilitate the application process. Based on prior practice we do not find this acceptable
because of the possibility of an inadvertent error in the preparation of the application by the applicant, and because
ITA would be required to review every application to ensure it was consistent with the standard form. In the past the
ITA allowed applicants to submit versions of the ITA's applications that had been prepared on the applicants' own
word processing system, and at times found that applicants made significant changes. The increased review time made
it difficult for the ITA to issue APOs in a timely fashion. 
To address the concerns of the Bar Committee's request, however, we have revised the format of the application containing
the terms and conditions of disclosure, and are proposing that the sections of the application that require typing
from the representatives be reproduced on the applicants' word processing system. Page 1 of the application identifies
the case and the segment of the proceeding in which access to proprietary data is being sought. It also identifies the
request as the original application or an amended request. Items 29 and 30 require the applicant's name, signature,
date of application, firm, and the identification of admission to a bar or court if an attorney, and any professional
associations for a non-attorney ``other representative''. The main body of the application, however, may only be
photocopied by the applicant. In continuing to require that the main portion of the application be photocopied only,
and allowing page 1, and Items 29 and 30 to be reproduced on a word processing system, the ITA will limit the time necessary
for administrative review, and also facilitate the application process for the applicant. 
An alternative is to permit a representative to reproduce the entire form on its word processing equipment, but certify
that it is identical to the ITA standard form, and agree that any if there are any discrepancies, the parties are bound
by the standard form. We invite comments on these proposals. 


Time Limits 


The ITA is searching for a practice that will reduce the number of untimely applications. In accordance with the current
regulations, the present application sets forth strict deadlines. Timeliness in submitting an application for
APO continues to be a major issue of concern for the ITA and the applicant. The ITA does not wish to impair a party's ability
to fully represent its client. The ITA, however, must impose an application deadline in order to properly administer
the APO function, and the earlier in the proceeding, the more efficient the process for the ITA. 
The proposed application changes the deadline as set forth in 19 CFR 353.34(b) or 355.34(b) to require that the application
be filed with the first written submission made by a party after it has retained a representative, but in no event later
than the date the case briefs are due (Item 5). A written submission is any written correspondence by a representative
with the ITA in the course of an AD or CVD proceeding on behalf of a party to the proceeding. The proposed change in this
area mandates a firm deadline, however it will allow greater flexibility for a party to retain a representative at
a later date in the proceeding. The representative must apply for an APO with its first written submission made on behalf
of its client. Failure to apply at that time would result in a subsequently filed application for APO being denied as
untimely. Applications filed after the date the case briefs are due will not be approved. 
Another alternative is to require parties to file a notice of appearance, and to file the APO application with the notice
of appearance. The ITA also intends to remind parties in its notices of initiation of a proceeding to file an early APO
application. We invite comment on these two proposals, as well as other suggestions on what procedures the ITA can
implement to obtain timely APO applications early in proceedings. 


Electronic Business Proprietary Information Defined


The proposed application defines the term ``electronic data'' to include (1) proprietary data submitted by a party,
generated by the ITA, or entered by the recipient on computer tape, disk, diskette, or any other electronic computer
medium, and (2) all electronic work products resulting from manipulation of this data, as transferred in any form
onto any other electronic computer medium, such as tape, disk, diskette, Bernoulli cartridge, removable disk pack,
etc. (Item 9 of the proposed APO application).

<DOCNO> FR941012-2-00016 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941012-2-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The term ``electronic data'' has been defined in the ITA's current ``computer tape'' APOs. Because the ITA will no
longer issue applicant-specific ``computer tape'' APOs under the proposed system, the definition has been moved
to the application. The conditions that the ITA will require for the routine use and protection of ``electronic data''
will be in the application. The specific ``computer tape'' requirements to ensure protection of electronic information
are discussed below. 



Request for Information 



The proposed application requires all parties to obtain an APO covering all business proprietary information submitted
in the proceeding, but allows the applicant the choice of receiving hard copy information only, or hard copy and electronic
information (Item 10 of the proposed application). Furthermore, parties may waive the right to be served with the
business proprietary information of other parties in which they have no interest. 

The statute and regulations provide for the release of all business proprietary information in a proceeding (19 U.S.C.
1677f(c)(1)(A) and 19 CFR  353.34 or 355.34). In practice, however, the ITA has not always required parties
to request all proprietary information, and has allowed parties to request only the information they wanted to receive.
For administrative convenience, in the 1992 steel investigations the ITA asked parties to request access to ``

all

 business proprietary information'' under APO. We have continued this practice in current proceedings, and most
parties are now routinely requesting access to all proprietary information under APO. Furthermore, as in the steel
investigations, parties may waive the right to be served with the business proprietary submissions of other respondents
in which they have no interest. Respondents' counsel will, however, be required to accept submissions by petitioners
that may contain business proprietary information of several parties. The adoption of this practice will allow parties
to prepare only one APO version of business proprietary documents and will not require the preparation of multiple
APO-specific versions for each party. Additionally, it will reduce the possibility of APO violations because all
parties subject to APO will have access to all information. In order to ensure that parties are provided with a means
of identification for multiple source data in submissions, the ITA will amend   353.32 and 355.32 of the
Department of Commerce's regulations to provide specific instruction concerning the identification of this information.
This will greatly assist all parties in providing their clients with needed information to present their case while
minimizing the risk of inadvertent disclosure. 


The APO application also provides the applicant with the choice of receiving hard copy information only, or hard copy
and electronic information. Should the applicant choose to receive electronic information, the applicant does
not need to provide any additional documentation to the ITA concerning this portion of the APO request. The ITA will
no longer require an explanation of the applicant's computer system or the procedures that will be followed in working
with information in electronic form because the applicant will now be required to establish its own procedures to
ensure the protection of APO information in electronic and hard copy form. The Bar Committee emphasized that it was
not necessary for the ITA to set forth specific requirements/restrictions in the application or the APO because they
were unnecessary and overly restrictive, considering the experience that has been gained by the Trade Bar in working
with business proprietary information subject to APO. 



Internal Procedures 



A primary area of concern noted by the Bar Committee is the ITA's perceived micromanagement of the APO area. Under current
APO practice, specific procedures are mandated by the application and APO. In our discussions, the Bar Committee
frequently stressed the experience that has been gained by the Trade Bar in working with business proprietary information
subject to APO. The Bar Committee emphasized that it was not necessary for the ITA to set forth detailed requirements
or restrictions in the application or in the APO, such as the requirement that the use of APO data be restricted to the
business office premises, the prohibition concerning the facsimile transmission of APO data, or the requirement
that an APO Log be maintained. In response to this concern, we have removed these requirements and restrictions from
the proposed application, and now require the applicant to establish its own internal procedures to protect the APO
information, rather than have the procedures mandated by ITA (Item 13 of the application). To assist a party in establishing
its own adequate internal procedures, the ITA will maintain guidelines concerning general procedures for protecting
APO information and more specific suggestions concerning the establishment of written office procedures. The quality
of a party's internal procedures will be taken into consideration by the ITA in an APO violation investigation.

<TEXT>
 

The major burden we are placing on parties is that they adopt procedures to ensure that the applicant does not disclose
any of the APO information to anyone other than the submitter and other persons authorized to have access to the information
in accordance with the requirements set forth in the DOC's regulations. We are continuing to require that the applicant
use the information solely for the segment of the ITA proceeding in which it is submitted. Any other use of the information,
including its use before the International Trade Commission in its proceeding, is a violation of the ITA's APO. 



Protection of Electronic Business Proprietary Information 



The proposed application prohibits the applicant from seeking assistance from the ITA in handling or processing
electronic data/medium served on the applicant by a party other than the ITA (Item 14 of the application). In an effort
to reduce the complexity of the proposed standard APO, and to avoid any misconceptions on this matter, we have included
this condition from the ``computer tape'' APOs in the proposed application. 

The ITA is responsible for conducting its proceedings within statutory deadlines and does not possess the capability
of providing instruction to parties who may be unfamiliar with computer processing. Should a party experience difficulty
in handling or processing electronic data/media served on them pursuant to an APO, the party should seek assistance
from the provider of the information. The ITA, of course, will provide appropriate assistance concerning electronic
information prepared and released by the ITA. 

The proposed application requires the applicant to ensure that APO information entered on computers will only be
resident in the computer at times when programs are actually being run, and will not be accessible via modem or network
(Items 15 and 16). These requirements are also taken from the ``computer tape'' APOs. 

The ITA's ``computer tape'' APOs have been a major area of concern for the Trade Bar. Generally it is felt that the ITA
has been overly restrictive in its requirements concerning electronic data. The standard ``computer tape'' requirements
were developed in response to the Court of International Trade's directive that the ITA craft an administrative protective
order specifically designed to provide a heightened degree of protection necessary to protect sensitive electronic
data. In light of the experience we have now gained in routinely releasing this information under APO, and in view of
the comments we have received from the Trade Bar, we have determined that two conditions, as set forth in items 15 and
16 of the application, are critical to the protection of this sensitive data. Electronic information resident in
a computer is most vulnerable. Therefore, we believe that electronic data released under APO should only be resident
in a computer when it is actually being used (Item 15). At the time it is resident in the computer and programs are actually
being run, access via modem or network must be rendered impossible (Item 16). Compliance with these two conditions
will prevent unauthorized access via electronic means. 



Certification Requirements 



There are two separate certification requirements in the proposed application. The first concerns the departure
of a representative from a firm, and the second concerns the transition from an ITA APO to a judicial protective order.
The proposed application requires the applicant to certify to the ITA compliance with the terms of the APO prior to
departure from the applicant's current firm, and to submit a new application if appropriate (Item 17). This procedure
does not change the established practice. 

Although the current application requires an applicant to notify the ITA if any of the facts in the application change,
many parties are not certain of the procedures that should be followed when an individual subject to an APO leaves a
firm prior to the completion of the proceeding. Item 17 provides particular guidance to the applicant, and sets forth
within the application specific procedures to be followed. Additionally, the proposed APO Guidelines outline the
preferred procedure for handling the transfer of APO information should a change in representation occur during
the course of a segment of a proceeding. 

The proposed application requires the applicant to certify to the return or destruction of the APO information within
ten business days of the expiration of the time for filing for judicial or panel review at the end of the case (Item 18).
Failure to do so is a violation of the APO. The ITA is making renewed efforts to ensure that this important provision
is strictly adhered to. The ITA is publishing reminders in its 

Federal Register

 notices reminding parties about this requirement. In the proposed application, we have significantly increased
from the two-day time limit required by the current application. The current application requires that applicants
certify to the return or destruction of APO information within two business days of the expiration of the time for filing
for, or intervening in, a judicial or panel review at the end of the case. The increase in time to ten business days allows
the applicant sufficient time to be notified of a judicial or panel appeal. The ITA has routinely granted extensions
to this deadline when requested, and will adjust this deadline for the convenience of the parties. The extended deadline
is reasonable, and does not compromise the security of the APO information.

<DOCNO> FR941012-2-00018 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941012-2-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The proposed application requires the applicant to provide a copy of the judicial protective order (JPO) to the appropriate
ITA official (Item 19). This will assist the ITA in tracking the certifications required by Item 18 above. This item
provides the ITA with an additional safeguard to confirm that APO information is properly protected at the conclusion
of a case. The certification required by Item 18, or a copy of a JPO required by this condition, will assist the ITA in
tracking the final disposition of materials released under APO.



The following items have not changed. 



Items 3, 4 and 6 provide basic instructions for the filing and service of the application, and refer the applicant to
the appropriate sections of the ITA regulations that pertain to the release of proprietary information under APO.
Items 20 through 25 require the applicant to (1) acknowledge sanctions for the breach of the conditions of the protective
order, (2) inform the ITA if any of the facts in the application change during the existence of the requested APO, (3)
affirm that all statements in the application are true, accurate, and complete, (4) agree to be bound by the terms stated
in the APO, (5) assume responsibility for the violation of the APO by any employees of the firm who are granted access
to APO information, and (6) identify the party represented. Items 26 and 27 require an attorney applicant or non-attorney
applicant to answer particular questions concerning any other relationship the applicant may have with that party.
Item 28 requires the identification and signatures of support staff and reiterates the assumption of responsibility
for any violation of the protective order by those individuals.



(2) The Proposed Standard APO



We are proposing that a standard APO be placed on the record of each segment of a proceeding shortly after the initiation
notice is published in the 

Federal Register

. It should be understood that the ``standard APO'' will be specific to each segment of a proceeding, thereby allowing
for modifications, if necessary, to fit the specific circumstances of different proceedings. Generally, however,
the standard APO is the version on which we are seeking comment. The ITA's current practice is to issue one standard
APO to all of the applicants from the same firm; ``other representatives'' retained by the attorney or non-attorney
representative are listed on the same APO. The placement of one APO on the record of each segment of the proceeding would
eliminate specific APOs for the separate parties and streamline the administrative process.

The proposed APO contains the standard language that is already used in ITA APOs, and requires the release of all business
proprietary information in a proceeding which the submitting party agrees to release or the ITA determines to release,
except for the information noted below that is exempt from APO release in accordance with statute and regulations:
customer names in an investigation only (Section 135(b) of the Customs and Trade Act of 1990 specifically amended
Section 777 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1677f) to prohibit the release of customer names by Commerce during
any investigation which requires an injury determination by the International Trade Commission until either an
order is published as a result of the investigation or the investigation is suspended or terminated.); privileged
information; classified information; and specific information of a type for which the ITA determines there is a clear
and compelling need to withhold from disclosure.

The proposed APO sets forth three procedures regarding electronic data. Procedures 1 and 2 are taken from the current
``computer tape'' APO. Procedure 1 requires direct service of electronic data on a party authorized to receive information
in this form and requires that the electronic information submitted to the ITA be APO releasable in its entirety. Procedure
2 requires the requesting party to pay the submitter of the electronic data for copying costs and the medium if the applicant
requests access to information in electronic form. Procedure 2 does not, however, set a recommended price structure
for the electronic data/medium. Although current ``computer tape'' APOs suggest a price limit for the reproduction
costs of a computer tape or floppy disk/diskette, we do not believe that the ITA should be involved in pricing materials
over which we have no direct knowledge. The APO requires the party requesting electronic data to pay all reasonable
costs incurred by the submitter of the data for the copying of its electronic data released to the applicant. It states
that reasonable costs may include the cost of the electronic medium and the cost of copying the complete proprietary
version of the electronic data/medium submitted to the ITA in APO releasable form. The APO further states that the
amount charged for copying the electronic data may not include costs borne by the submitter of the electronic data
in the creation of the electronic data/medium submitted to the ITA for use in presenting its case. Procedure 3 releases
electronic data generated by the ITA through established procedures. The ITA has not released its own proceeding-specific
computer programs and resulting output in electronic form under APO on a routine basis. Procedures are now being developed
to provide for the release of this information when it is requested. We have not required that all parties ask for release
of electronic data in order to limit proliferation of information in this sensitive form.

(3) The Proposed APO Service List



The final change to ITA procedures implementing a streamlined APO process is the issuance of an ITA APO Service List
that contains the names of the approved applicants. The ITA's current practice is to (1) issue a specific standard
APO to the representatives of a party from the same firm or firms, (2) send a letter to parties to the proceeding who are
required to serve proprietary information as a result of the APO being issued, and (3) amend the APO as requests for
amendment are submitted. The adoption of an APO Service List would provide a single list designating all parties authorized
to receive proprietary information under the APO. As requests for amendment are received, the APO Service List would
be amended. The proposed APO list would be made available to parties through the Central Records Unit, in Room B-099
of the main Commerce building.

The adoption of this procedure would not, however, address the responsibility of the ITA to provide the APO Service
List to counsel who are not located in the Washington, DC. area and parties who do not have counsel and are, also, not
located in the Washington, DC. area. In the foreseeable future, the ITA intends to make the service list available
electronically, and parties can easily determine who is on the service list. In the meantime, we welcome proposals
on how out-of-town parties can most efficiently receive timely notice of the service list.



Unchanged APO Administrative Procedures



The filing requirements for APO applications will not be changed by the adoption of the proposed procedures for APO.
The ITA will continue to approve or deny APOs within the established deadlines (19 CFR 353.34(b)(5) or 355.34(b)(5)).
Should there be an objection to either the issuance of an APO to a particular party, or an objection to the release of
particular information, the ITA will continue to address these issues in a separate decision memorandum in accordance
with 19 CFR 353.34(c) or 355.34(c).



Required Regulation Changes



Should the proposed APO Application and Standard APO be adopted, it will be necessary to amend the following four sections
of the ITA Regulations accordingly:

(1) Sections 353.34(b) and 355.34(b) regarding the application deadline;

(2) Sections 353.31 and 355.31 regarding the identification of multiple source data;

(3) Sections 353.34(a) and 355.34(a) regarding customer names in an investigation only; and

(4) Sections 353.32(a)(2) and 355.32(a)(2) to provide a means of identification of customer names in an investigation
only, such as double bracketing ([[ ]]).



Additional Considerations



The Bar Committee requested that the ITA consider alternate means of providing expedited treatment for APO approval.
One proposal was to allow one lead signatory to apply from each law firm or consulting firm and to give that individual
the authority and responsibility for granting access to other professionals within the firm. We do not believe that
this is a workable procedure because it does not permit any representative or the ITA to know who has access to APO material
at a given moment. Nor does it permit other parties to the proceeding an opportunity to comment on the acceptability
of the individual seeking access under APO. While the ITA does not seek approval from parties prior to the granting
of an APO, the ITA does consider objections if any are made. ITA regulations require that the application for APO be
served on all parties to the proceeding in order to notify all parties of the APO request and to provide the opportunity
for comment. If an applicant needed expedited approval on a request for an amended APO, approval could be obtained
by the applicant from the parties whose information would be disclosed under the APO prior to the submission of the
APO application, which would then preclude need for a comment period.

Another proposal was to have the ITA approve a roster of members of a representative's firm, and the lead representative
could add any member of the roster to its APO at any time. If a roster is approved by the ITA, however, it might be just as
easy to add all approved members to the service list when they are approved. The ITA seeks comments on these approaches
and any other suggestions.

It was also suggested that the ITA provide ``APO Guidelines'' to assist firms in handling business proprietary information
released under APO. The ITA will make ``APO Guidelines'' available, and will also hold a public training session on
implementation of the changes that are adopted.

Finally, the Committee report addressed the problem of public summaries at length but did not propose any solutions.
The ITA is a strong advocate of public summaries that a representative can use for a constructive dialogue with his
or her client. We invite proposals to address the problems parties have in making public summaries of proprietary
information.

To calculate constructed value, petitioner adjusted its own manufacturing costs for a standard black zinc plated
wheel insert for known differences in costs between the United States and Taiwan. We adjusted the reported material
costs to account for revenue received by petitioner from the sale of scrap material. Because the plating costs included
selling, general and administrative expenses as well as the profit of petitioner's plater, we have adjusted the plating
expenses to exclude these amounts. 

For overhead, utilities were adjusted using a ratio of Taiwanese to U.S. electricity costs. Other components of petitioner's
overhead were adjusted using the ratio of Taiwanese to U.S. labor costs. Certain components of overhead were not adjusted
by petitioner. Because we view this industry sufficiently labor intensive to justify using the ratio of Taiwanese
to U.S. labor costs to adjust overhead, we have applied the labor ratio uniformly to all components of overhead (except
utilities). Additionally, because petitioner allocated overhead expenses (inclusive of expenses related to petitioner's
plating operation) over payroll expenses (exclusive of plating wages), we have added plating wages to petitioner's
calculation of payroll expenses. 

Petitioner provided two hourly wage rates for Taiwanese manufacturing workers, one obtained from private research,
the other obtained from a public source. Because of the Department's preference for publicly available information,
we selected the latter and adjusted it as follows: 1) we disallowed petitioner's inclusion of an annual bonus because
petitioner's wage rate calculation did not include bonuses; and 2) we inflated the wage rate for one year instead of
two, as calculated by petitioner, because we determined that the wage rate was from 1992. The statutory minimum percentages
of 10 percent for selling, general and administrative expenses and eight percent for profit were relied upon in petitioner's
calculation. 

After the above adjustments were made, the recalculated dumping margin for wheel inserts produced on a screw machine
is 46.28 percent. 



Initiation of Investigation 



Pursuant to section 732(c) of the Act, the Department must determine, within 20 days after a petition is filed, whether
a petition sets forth an allegation necessary for the initiation of an antidumping duty investigation, and whether
the petition contains information reasonably available to the petitioner supporting the allegation. 

We have examined the petition for wheel inserts from Taiwan, as amended, and have found that it meets the requirements
of section 732(b) of the Act. Therefore, we are initiating an antidumping duty investigation to determine whether
imports of wheel inserts from Taiwan are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value.
If this investigation proceeds normally, we will make our preliminary determination by February 22, 1995. 


International Trade Commission (ITC) Notification 



Section 732(d) of the Act requires us to notify the ITC of these actions and we have done so. 



Preliminary Determinations by the ITC 



The ITC will determine by October 30, 1994, whether there is a reasonable indication that imports of wheel inserts
from Taiwan are materially injuring, or threaten material injury to, a U.S. industry. Pursuant to section 733(a)
of the Act, a negative ITC determination will result in the investigation being terminated; otherwise, the investigation
will proceed according to statutory and regulatory time limits. 

This notice is published pursuant to section 732(c)(2) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.13(b).

<DOCTITLE>Certain Textile Mill Products From Colombia; Notice of Conversion </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 International Trade Administration/Import Administration, Department of Commerce.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Conversion of the Scope of the Suspended Investigation from the Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated
to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule.


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On April 15, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the 

Federal Register

 the proposed conversion of the Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated (TSUSA) to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule
(HTS) for the suspended countervailing duty investigation on certain textile mill products from Colombia (59 FR
18101). Interested parties were invited to comment on the proposed conversion. No comments were received concerning
the scope of the suspended countervailing duty investigation on certain textile mill products from Colombia; therefore,
no changes have been made.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



In 1985, the Department suspended the countervailing duty investigation on certain textile mill products and apparel
from Colombia (C-301-401) (50 FR 9863; March 12, 1985). The scope of the suspended investigation was originally
defined solely in terms of the TSUSA item numbers; no narrative product description was provided. On January 1, 1989,
the United States fully converted from the TSUSA to the HTS, pursuant to section 1211 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness
Act of 1988. The suspended investigation was terminated in 1990, and the HTS conversion was never implemented. However,
the Court of International Trade (CIT) ordered that the suspended investigation be reinstated (except with regard
to apparel from Colombia) in its decision dated May 7, 1992 (

Belton Industries, Inc.

 v. 

United States

, slip op. No. 92-64). The CIT ruling was upheld by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on September 7,
1993 (

Belton Industries, Inc. 

v. 

United States

, 6f.3d 756). As a result, the suspended investigation was reinstated effective May 18, 1992 (

see 

58 FR 54552, October 22, 1993, and decision memorandum dated February 25, 1994). Therefore, the Department took action
to conform the scope of the investigation with the tariff classification system of the HTS. 

The Department, with the assistance of the U.S. Customs Service and the U.S. International Trade Commission, analyzed
the TSUSA-defined scope and identified those HTS numbers that reasonably correspond with the TSUSA-defined scope
of the subject suspended investigation. On April 15, 1994, the Department published a proposed conversion (59 FR
18108) and invited interested parties to comment on this proposed conversion. Because no comments were received,
the Department has not changed the HTS numbers for the scope of the suspended investigation on certain textile mill
products from Colombia from those published in the proposed conversion. The HTS numbers for this suspended countervailing
duty investigation are found in the attached Appendix.

Intent To Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) on the Relocation of Navy Reservists From the Naval Reserve
Readiness Center at Lake Union and the Replacement of the Army Reserve Center at Fort Lawton, Seattle, WA

In compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and 40 CFR 1500-1508, the Army Reserve and Navy
Reserve will prepare an EIS for the relocation of the Naval Reserve Readiness Center at Lake Union and the replacement
of Army Reserve training facilities currently located in the 500 Area of Fort Lawton.

Acting as Joint Lead Agencies, Chief of the Naval Reserve and the U.S. Army Reserve will analyze the environmental
impacts of alternative approaches to meeting each agency's needs. In conducting the analysis, the lead agencies
will involve the public and other agencies. The process will be documented in Draft and Final Environmental Impact
Statements (EISs).

Currently, the Navy reservists in the Seattle area train at the Naval Reserve Readiness Center at Lake Union, located
near the center of the city. The City of Seattle wishes to acquire that facility and incorporate it into a development
project called the Seattle Commons. In light of this, Congress has requested that the Navy identify and evaluate alternative
locations for a new Reserve Center to replace the Lake Union facility.

In addition, the Army Reserve training facilities located within the 500 Area of Fort Lawton are in deteriorating
condition and require replacement. The Army Reserve will consider replacement alternatives of these facilities
in the same EIS.

The agencies' preferred alternative is to construct and operate a new, 120,000 square foot Joint Use Reserve Center
at Fort Lawton. This new facility would be at a different location from the facilities the Army Reserve presently uses
for weekend training and would accommodate the indoor training needs of approximately 1,300 Army and Navy Reservists.
The Chief of Naval Reserve and the U.S. Army Reserve propose that the new Joint Use Reserve Center site be in the southwest
corner of Fort Lawton, near the existing Army Reserve Headquarters offices.

The EIS will evaluate other sites within Fort Lawton, as well as other Federally-owned sites in the Seattle area. The
agencies' decisionmakers will also consider alternatives involving separate, rather than joint facilities. They
will also consider the alternative of taking no action. The evaluations of the reasonable alternatives will be documented
in the EIS and made available for public review and comment before the agencies reach a decision as to how they will meet
their needs for new facilities.

The agencies will hold a public meeting in November to help determine the scope of the EIS. At this meeting the Navy and
the Army will describe the proposed action and will solicit comments from citizens, agencies and organizations about
the issues and the alternatives to be addressed in the EIS. The date and time of the meeting will be publicized in the
Seattle Post-Intelligencer and the Magnolia News.

The Navy Reserve and the Army Reserve welcome comments on the process. Questions about the EIS process may be directed
to Mr. Don Morris At (206) 396-5976. Comments may be addressed to: Engineering Field Activity, Northwest, Naval
Facilities Engineering Command, (Attn: Don Morris, Code 232DM), 3505 N.W. Anderson Hill Road, Silverdale, WA 98383-7929.
Please provide comments by 15 December 1994.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of restricted eligibility.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Energy announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.7(b), it intends to conduct a competitive Program Solicitation
No. DE-PS22-95PC95200, and to award, on a restricted eligibility basis, financial assistance (grants)
in support of advanced coal research to U.S. colleges and universities. These grants will be awarded to a limited number
of proposals selected on the basis of scientific merit, subject to the availability of funds. The solicitation is
expected to be available on October 7, 1994, and proposals must be received by the designated DOE office on December
2, 1994. The solicitation will be distributed on 31/2'', double-sided/high density discs in Word Perfect 5.1 format.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Through Program Solicitation DE-PS22-95PC95200, the DOE is interested in applications from U.S. colleges
and universities (and university-affiliated research centers submitting applications through their respective
university) for research and advanced concepts related to coal science that have the potential to improve our fundamental
scientific and technical understanding of the chemical and physical processes in coal conversion and utilization.


Eligibility



Applications under this solicitation may be submitted in response to the requirements of the (1) University Coal
Research (UCR) Core Program, (2) Joint University/Industry Coal Program, or (3) Technical Topic 8 (CO

2

 Ocean Disposal Experimentation).

Applications in response to the UCR Core Program or the Joint University/Industry Coal Research Program must address
coal research in one of seven technical topics: (1) Coal Science; (2) Coal Surface Science; (3) Reaction Chemistry;
(4) Advanced Process Concepts; (5) Engineering Fundamentals and Thermodynamics; (6) Environmental Science; or
(7) Minimization of Environmental Impact.

For Technical Topic 8, CO

2

 Ocean Disposal Experimentation, the DOE is seeking applications for experimental research to ascertain the scientific
and technical feasibility of promising methods of ocean disposal of carbon dioxide (CO

2

). Carbon dioxide can be disposed in the ocean as a gas, solid or liquid. The three most economical methods of ocean disposal
are thought to be hydrate formation, dense plume formation and unconfined release, at depths of 200m-1500m (``A Research
Needs Assessment for the Capture, Utilization and Disposal of Carbon Dioxide from Fossil-Fuel Powered Plants.''
Volume I, Energy Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Mass.; pp. 13-19 (DE-FG02-92ER30194.A000,
August 1993)). Other identifiable, more costly methods of disposal include dry ice injection and very deep ocean
injection.

Details on the UCR Core Program, the Joint University/Industry Coal Research Program and Technical Topic 8, eligibility
requirements, budget limitations and technical topic descriptions are contained in the Program Solicitation.



Awards



DOE anticipates awarding financial assistance (grants) for each project selected. Approximately $5.1 million
is available for the Program Solicitation: $4 million is for the UCR Core Program and should provide funding for about
21 financial assistance grants (max. DOE funding of $200,000 per award); $0.8 million in set-aside for the Joint University/Industry
Coal Research Program, which should support 2 grants (max. DOE funding of $400,000 per award); and $0.3 million is
set-aside for Technical Topic 8, which should support one grant.



Solicitation Release Date



The Program Solicitation is expected to be ready for mailing by October 7, 1994. Applications must be prepared and
submitted in accordance with the instructions and forms in the Program Solicitation and must be received by the Department
of Energy by December 2, 1994.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Solicitation for financial assistance applications, Biomass Power for Rural Development.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), pursuant to the DOE Financial Assistance Rules, 10 CFR 600.7, is announcing its
intention to solicit responses for Federally cost shared collaborative projects that integrate electricity generation
and rural development through biomass based renewable energy.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Through Cooperative Agreements, DOE is proposing to undertake renewable energy commercialization projects through
biomass based renewable energy technologies under provisions of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct):



Public Law 102-486. It is the mutual goal of the DOE and USDA to promote opportunities for rural development and
sustainable power generating capacity by establishing a market infrastructure that integrates dedicated feedstock
supply systems and advanced biomass power production. DOE and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) are working
to accelerate the establishment of integrated biomass power production systems through Federally cost shared,
vertically integrated, economically sustainable closed-loop biomass power generation systems.

Respondents are encouraged to form partnership with the agriculture community, industry, power producers, educational
institutions, State and local governments, and other interested parties, to pursue deployment of integrated biomass
systems. The partnerships shall demonstrate how cooperative efforts can lead to sustaining, economically viable,
closed-loop biomass power generation. The projects selected should focus primarily on the production of power from
energy crops, however, projects proposing coproduction will also be considered if power is the primary output. Projects
proposing the utilization of biomass wastes or residue will also be considered, as long as dedicated energy crops
are the primary fuel source.

Projects selected under this solicitation may be eligible for Federal funds through DOE cost sharing and may also
be eligible for funds through existing USDA authorities and programs. As such, respondents are encouraged to identify
USDA authorities and programs and their applicability to this project. The required end-goal of the program is for
sustaining operations without Federal assistance.

Respondents will be required to submit a feasibility study which addresses technical, environmental and economic
aspects of project implementation and a business plan indicating project sustainability following Federal assistance.
Eleven studies are currently funded through the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) to evaluate economic
development through biomass technologies and systems. The integrated biomass systems being studied are inclusive
of feedstock production and commercial scale conversion technologies for the production of electric power and liquid
biofuels. Additional information regarding these studies is available upon request through DOE.

Solicitation number DE-RP36-95G010052 will include complete information on the program including
technical aspects, funding, application preparation, and selection and proposal evaluation criteria. Multiple
awards are anticipated, subject to the availability of appropriations on or before September 30, 1995. Issuance
of the solicitation is planned for December 1, 1994 with responses due 120 days following solicitation release. Requests
for the solicitation must be in writing and directed to Ruth E. Adams. Facsimiles are acceptable and can be transmitted
to (303) 275-4790.

Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion
to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules.
Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to jurisdiction conferred upon the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission by Sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice and
procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application
if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter
finds that a grant of the certificate is required by the public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene
is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further notice of
such hearing will be duly given.
Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for Natural to appear or

<DOCTITLE>Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation; CNG Transmission Corporation; Notice of Intent To Prepare an Environmental
Assessment for the Proposed Flex-X/CNG Project and Request for Comments on Environmental Issues </DOCTITLE>




October 5, 1994.
 


The staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or the Commission) will prepare an environmental assessment
(EA) that will discuss the environmental impacts of the construction and operation of facilities proposed in the
Flex-X/CNG Project.
 This EA will be used by the Commission in its decision-making process to determine whether an environmental impact
statement is necessary and whether to approve the project. 






Summary of the Proposed Project 



Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation (Texas Eastern) has an existing natural gas pipeline system consisting
of various diameter pipe that extends from the State of Texas and offshore Louisiana through the Appalachian area
to the Eastern Seaboard in the Philadelphia and New York area. Texas Eastern wants to expand and modify its facilities
to transport an additional 105,000 dekatherms of natural gas per day (Dthd) to CNG Transmission Corporation (CNG)
and wants Commission authorization to construct and operate the following facilities needed to transport those
volumes: 

 13.9 miles of 36-inch-diameter replacement pipeline in two segments in Pennsylvania: 

Uniontown Discharge mileposts (Mps) 1048.47 to 1058.18 for 9.7 miles in Fayette and Somerset Counties. 

Bedford Discharge Mps 1106.65 to 1110.87 for 4.2 miles in Bedford County. 

 6,500 horsepower (hp) of compression at its existing Uniontown Compressor Station in Fayette County, Pennsylvania.



The Texas Eastern pipeline facilities were originally proposed as part of the Liberty Pipeline Project in Docket
Nos. CP92-720-000 and CP92-720-001. These facilities were discussed in our Notices of Intent
dated January 22 and December 22, 1993. The Liberty Project applications were dismissed by the Commission without
prejudice on August 12, 1994. 

CNG wants to provide transportation of 105,000 Dthd from Texas Eastern to three utilities, an electric generation
plant, and a cogeneration developer. To provide this transportation, CNG wants Commission authorization to construct
and operate about 8,000 hp of compression (two 4,000-hp electric motor-driven compressor units) at a new station
to be known as CNG's Chambersburg Compressor Station, in Franklin County, Pennsylvania. 

The general location of the project facilities is shown in appendix 1.






Land Requirements for Construction 



Texas Eastern's proposed replacements would be built adjacent and parallel to existing rights-of-way. Texas Eastern
intends to use an 85-foot-wide construction right-of-way. About 60 feet of the planned 85-foot width would use existing
right-of-way. Consequently, about 25 feet of new clearing would be required in most areas. Following construction,
the disturbed area would be restored and the 25 feet of new clearing would be allowed to revert to its former land use.


Additional working space would be required adjacent to the planned construction right-of-way at areas of steep side
slopes, and in most areas where topsoil would be segregated (agricultural and residential areas). Additional working
space would also be required adjacent to road and stream crossings. 



The EA Process 



The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires the Commission to take into account the environmental impacts
that could result from an action whenever it considers the issuance of a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity.
NEPA also requires us to discover and address concerns the public may have about proposals. We call this ``scoping''.
The main goal of the scoping process is to focus the analysis in the EA on the important environmental issues. By this
Notice of Intent, the Commission requests public comments on the scope of the issues it will address in the EA. All comments
received are considered during the preparation of the EA. State and local government representatives are encouraged
to notify their constituents of this proposed action and encourage them to comment on their areas of concern. 

The EA will discuss impacts that could occur as a result of the construction and operation of the proposed project under
these general headings:




 Geology and soils 
 Water resources, fisheries, and wetlands 
 Vegetation and wildlife 
 Endangered and threatened species 
 Land use 
 Cultural resources
 Hazardous waste
 Air quality and noise




We will also evaluate possible alternatives to the proposed project or portions of the project, and make recommendations
on how to lessen or avoid impacts on the various resource areas. 

Our independent analysis of the issues will be in the EA. Depending on the comments received during the scoping process,
the EA may be published and mailed to Federal, state, and local agencies, public interest groups, interested individuals,
affected landowners, newspapers, libraries, and the Commission's official service list for this proceeding. A
comment period will be allotted for review if the EA is published. We will consider all comments on the EA before we recommend
that the Commission approve or not approve the project. 



Currently Identified Environmental Issues 



We have already identified several issues that we think deserve attention based on a preliminary review of the proposed
facilities and the environmental information provided by Texas Eastern and CNG. Keep in mind that this is a preliminary
list. The list of issues may be added to, subtracted from, or changed based on your comments and our analysis. Issues
are: 

 The proposed pipelines would cross five perennial waterbodies.

<TEXT>
 

 The proposed pipelines would cross 15 wetlands, 3 of which are greater than 500 feet wide at the crossing location.


 The proposed new compressor station would convert about 17.0 acres of agricultural land to industrial use.




Public Participation 



You can make a difference by sending a letter addressing your specific comments or concerns about the project. You
should focus on the potential environmental effects of the proposal, alternatives to the proposal (including alternative
routes), and measures to avoid or lessen environmental impact. The more specific your comments, the more useful they
will be. Please follow the instructions below to ensure that your comments are received and properly recorded: 

 Address your letter to: Lois Cashell, Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol
Street NE., Washington, D.C. 20426; 

 Reference Docket Nos. CP94-6-001, et al.; 

 Send a 

copy 

of your letter to: Mr. Jeffrey Gerber, EA Project Manager, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol
Street NE., Room 7312 Washington, D.C. 20426; and 

 Mail your comments so that they will be received in Washington, D.C. on or before November 4, 1994. 

If you wish to receive a copy of the EA, you should request one from Mr. Gerber at the above address. 



Becoming an Intervenor 



In addition to involvement in the EA scoping process, you may want to become an official party to the proceeding or become
an ``intervenor''. Among other things, intervenors have the right to receive copies of case-related Commission
documents and filings by other intervenors. Likewise, each intervenor must provide copies of its filings to all other
parties. If you want to become an intervenor you must file a Motion to Intervene according to Rule 214 of the Commission's
Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214) attached as appendix 2. 

The date for filing timely motions to intervene in this proceeding has passed. Therefore, parties now seeking to file
late interventions must show good cause, as required by Section 385.214(b)(3), why this time limitation should be
waived. Environmental issues have been viewed as good cause for late intervention. You do not need intervenor status
to have your scoping comments considered. 

Additional information about the proposed project is available from Mr. Jeffrey Gerber, EA Project Manager, at (202)
208-1121.

<DOCTITLE>City of Colorado Springs; Availability of Final Environmental Assessment</DOCTITLE>



October 5, 1994.



In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's
(Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order 486, 52 FR 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing reviewed
an application to amend the license for the Stanley Canyon Hydroelectric Project located on West Monument Creek,
El Paso County, Colorado. The application's major proposed changes are: (1) Construction of a new aboveground regulating
reservoir and underground tailrace and transfer conduits, (2) a shorter and realigned transmission line, and (3)
removal from the project boundary of certain facilities no longer needed for the project. A Final Environmental Assessment
(FEA) was prepared for the application. In the FEA, Commission staff finds that approving the application would not
constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.

Copies of the FEA are available for review in the Public Reference Branch, Room 3104, of the Commission's offices at
941 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, D.C. 20426.

<DOCTITLE>Special Research Grant Program Notice 95-03: Pre-Freshman Enrichment Program (PREP) </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of Energy Research (ER), U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice inviting grant applications.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Office of University and Science Education Programs (OUSE) of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), announces
its interest in receiving grant applications from four-year and two-year (community colleges) institutions of
higher education that will support the development of programs and approaches to encourage underrepresented populations
in science-based careers. Examples of these approaches include, but are not limited to, summer institutes and academic
year activities that prepare students in science and mathematics subject matter and motivate them to take future
college-preparatory courses in science, mathematics, and engineering.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The DOE has, as a part of its mission, a goal to increase the number of science, engineering and mathematics professionals
that are available to perform its research and development mission and is authorized in the Energy Reorganization
Act of 1974 to ``* * * assure an adequate supply of manpower for the accomplishment of energy research
and development programs by sponsoring and assisting in education and training activities in postsecondary institutions,
vocational schools and other institutions * * *'' 42 U. S. C. 5813 (11). 


Specifically, DOE's concern is based on the consideration that the future supply of science and engineering manpower
is threatened by two factors: fewer students enrolling in science-based courses in high school and fewer students
available to join the science, engineering and math pool due to declining birth rates. Students who have completed
the ninth grade in high school often decide not to take another science-based course. Once the traditional math/science
sequence is disrupted, it is too late for students to meet the minimum requirements for admission to college and university
science and engineering programs. 
The primary purpose of PREP is to alleviate manpower shortages in science, engineering and math careers by preparing
and guiding students entering sixth through tenth grades (have not completed the tenth grade) in the selection of
college-preparatory courses in science, mathematics and engineering. Therefore, in accordance with 10 CFR 600.7(b)(1),
eligibility for awards under this notice is limited to four-year accredited institutions of higher education which
grant baccalaureate degrees in science, mathematics and engineering and to two-year institutions (community colleges).
Community colleges are encouraged to maintain articulation agreements with four-year institutions which offer
degrees in science, mathematics and engineering. Eligibility is restricted to these institutions because they
offer the science, mathematics and engineering degrees which the student participants entering sixth through tenth
grade will be encouraged to pursue.
PREP projects are required to have a summer component and an academic year component. The summer component must be
no less than four continuous weeks, reaching a minimum of 24 students in grades six to ten (have not completed the tenth
grade). These 24 students must participate in the program for four continuous weeks. The academic year component
should provide enough time for meaningful followup. Typically, PREP grantee institutions work collaboratively
with local school districts, local industry, students' parents and peers to ensure success. If a previous PREP award
recipient, the applicant should describe the progress or results of work accomplished. Other elements which may
strengthen applications include, but are not limited to: interdisciplinary approach to teaching science and mathematics;
the use of role models and field trips; and students' active participation in hands-on activities. DOE financial
support is expected not to comprise the totality of funding for an individual project. In FY 1995, projects were supported
at 46 institutions. DOE funds of approximately $2 million were augmented by over $2.3 million in non-DOE (private
industry and university) funds and it is desirable that applications for the FY 1996 program indicate similar non-DOE
support.
Contingent upon availability of appropriated funds, DOE expects to make several two-year grants in FY 1996 to meet
the objectives of the program. The amount of each grant award will be limited to a maximum of $42,000 or $21,000 per year.
Information about the development and submission of applications, eligibility, limitations, program requirements,
evaluation and selection processes, and other policies and procedures may be found in the ER Application Guide, and
10 CFR Part 605. The application kit and guide is available from the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of University
and Science Education, ET-32, Washington, D.C. 20585. Telephone requests may be made by calling (202) 586-8949.

The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Number for this program is 81.049. 
This notice requests further that the ``Detailed Description of Research Work Proposed'' component of a complete
grant application as established by 10 CFR 605 should not exceed 15 double-spaced, typed pages. This description
of work should include: (1) The conceptual design and how that design relates to program objectives; (2) the target
audience(s) the project will serve and efforts planned to serve that audience; (3) the mechanisms to be used to organize
and manage the project, including the roles and responsibilities, financial and otherwise, of any partnerships;
(4) the monitoring and evaluation plan, including how those plans can be used for possible modification; (5) the planned
outcomes and how these outcomes will be assessed and reported; and (6) the anticipated significance of the project
and how it will be confirmed.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice inviting grant applications.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Office of University and Science Education Programs of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), in keeping with the
energy-related mission of DOE, announces its interest in receiving Financial Assistance applications from museums
that will support development of or replication of successful projects, exhibits, and programs in the media of informal
energy-related science education. The media of informal science education include but are not limited to: Interactive
exhibits, hands-on activities, and film/video productions. Examples of energy-related areas within the fundamental
energy sciences include high energy and nuclear physics, nuclear science and technologies, global warming, waste
management, energy efficiency, new materials development, fossil energy resources, renewable energy, health
effects research including the human genome, emerging energy technologies, risk assessment, energy/environment,
space exploration initiative, public science literacy, and other timely topics. The purpose of the program is to
fund the development, use, and/or replication of creative informal science education media which focus on energy-related
science and technology. Replication of informal science education funded under this program or other DOE supported
programs will be considered. 



For the purpose of this notice, ``museum'' means: An established nonprofit institution serving the public on a year-round
basis, providing interactive exhibits, demonstrations, and informal educational programs designed to further
public understanding of science and technology. The term also includes organizations referred to as science centers,
science-technology centers and youth museums. Thus, museums, as defined in this document, are eligible to submit
Financial Assistance applications.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The DOE is strongly committed to increasing the public's science literacy as well as increasing the number of students
interested in science and technology careers. Projects which are designed to enhance public awareness of, and to
encourage all young people to consider careers in, science and technology are strongly desired. While the application
must be submitted by a museum, collaborative efforts are encouraged. Such efforts by potential applicants may include:
Partnerships of several small museums, of a small and large museum, or of a history museum and youth museum in collaboration
with museum organizations; and cooperative enterprises which utilize the scientific and technical expertise of
the DOE laboratories, industry, and the broader educational community in conjunction with a museum. 



As a part of DOE's effort to promote public science literacy; enhance the Nation's mathematics, science, and engineering
education; and fulfill the National Education Goal of ``by the year 2000, U.S. students will be first in the world in
science and mathematics achievements,'' eligibility for awards under this notice is restricted to U.S. museums
which will offer informal energy-related science education. In accordance with 10 CFR 600.7(b)(1), this restriction
is necessary to support established U.S. institutions which provide a valuable supplement to formal education and
will enhance meeting the national education goals. While this program anticipates awarding grants only from Fiscal
Year 1996 appropriations, the period of support of a grant may extend up to two years. 

Before preparing a formal application, potential applicants are asked to submit a brief preapplication in accordance
with 10 CFR 600.10(d)(2) and (3), which consists of no more than two pages of narrative describing the major project
objectives and method of accomplishment to be utilized by the applicant to determine the effectiveness of the intended
exhibit or media forum, collaborators, advisors, dissemination plan, work schedule, and approximate cost of the
project to DOE. 

The purpose of the preapplication is to give the program staff the opportunity to determine the level and appropriateness
of interest in the project or activity. The program staff will also look at the approach the museum is considering.
Each museum will receive a written response to its preapplication. Once you have submitted a preapplication, however,
you may submit a formal application, regardless of the written response to the preapplication. Telephone and telefax
numbers are required to be part of the preapplication. 

A formal application consists of an original and seven copies, a copy of the museum's Internal Revenue Service nonprofit
determination letter, and other documents as stated in the Application Guide for the Office of Energy Research Financial
Assistance Program.

<DOCTITLE>Proposed De Minimis Settlement Under Section 122(g) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation
and Liability Act; In the Matter of MIG/Dewane Landfill, Belvidere, IL</DOCTITLE>




<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Request for public comment.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Notice of 

De Minimis 

Settlement: in accordance with Section 122(i)(1) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act of 1980, as amended (``CERCLA''), notice is hereby given of a 

de minimis

 settlement concerning past and estimated future response actions at the MIG/Dewane Landfill, Belvidere, Illinois.
U.S. EPA Region 5 has submitted the proposed agreement to the U.S. Department of Justice for review concurrent with
this request for public comment. This settlement will not be finalized until the approval process set forth in Section
122(g)(4) of CERCLA has been completed.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

One hundred forty-one parties executed binding certifications of their consent to participate in the settlement.
These parties will pay approximately $2,800,000 in settlement payments for response costs related to the MIG/Dewane
Landfill Site, if the United States Environmental Protection Agency determines that it will not withdraw or withhold
its consent to the proposed settlement after consideration of comments submitted pursuant to this notice.


U.S. EPA may enter into this settlement under the authority of Section 122(g) of CERCLA. Section 122(g) authorizes


de minimis 

settlemants with potentially responsible parties (``PRPs'') that contributed hazardous substances to a site where
those contributions were small and where the toxicity of the substances contributed is not significantly different
from the other agreement proposed to settle with parties who are each responsible for less than 00.60% of the total
volume of hazardous substances sent to the site. Settling 

de minimis 

PRPs will be required to pay their fair share of the past and estimated future response costs at the site. The settlement
payment amount includes three levels of premiums against estimated total response costs to account for potential
cost overruns, the potential for failure of the remedies selected to clean up the site, and other risks. The three levels
are 50% (for those Settling PRPs who are signatories to the 1991 Administrative Order on Consent for Remedial Investigation/Feasibility
Study at the MIG/Dewane Landfill), 100% (for those Settling PRPs who did not receive general or special notice of potential
liability prior to the 

de minimis 

settlement notice), and 200% (for those parties who received general or special notice of potential liability prior
to the 1991 Administrative Order on Consent but who did not choose to sign the order)

A copy of the proposed Administrative Order on Consent and additional background information relating to the settlement,
including a list of parties to the settlement, are available for review and may be obtained in person or by mail from
Thomas C. Jacobs (Mail Code CS_29A), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago,
Illinois 60604.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will receive written comments relating to this settlement for thirty days
from the date of publication of this notice.

Title:

 Evaluation of Mandated Drinking Water Filtration and its Effects on Community Health (EPA No. 1727.01).


Abstract:

 This is a new collection of information to support setting Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs) in drinking water as
required under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). Under SDWA section 1442 (a)(1)(D) the Administrator may conduct
research studies to explore ``improved methods...including improvements in water purification and distribution,
and methods of assessing the health related hazards of drinking water.'' The purpose of this study is to gather information
on the effects of water filtration on the presence of regulated (total coliform) and potentially regulated (

Giardia

, 

Cryptosporidium

, and enteroviruses) microorganisms in drinking water; and to assess the level of disease associated with their presence
in drinking water.
This voluntary collection of information consists of: (1) A feasibility study to determine the appropriateness
and willingness of utilities to participate in a large scale study, and subsequently; (2) a large scale environmental
health study to compare health data from selected households with corresponding water monitoring data from selected
water utilities prior to, and following, the installation of water filtration systems. 
For the feasibility study, questionnaires will be sent to a selected sample of water utilities and will request information
on characteristics of the drinking water delivery system, water quality monitoring data, and existence of historical
monitoring records. The questionnaire will also ask whether utilities will be willing to participate in the environmental
health study.
From the results of the feasibility study, three water utilities will be selected as sites for the environmental health
study. The study will focus on gathering information from selected households serviced by these sites over a nine
month period prior to, and following, the installation of drinking water filtration systems at these sites. An individual
from each participating household will: (1) Provide general demographic and underlying health condition information;
and (2) complete a monthly checklist indicating any respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms experienced during
the month for each household member.


Burden Statement:

 Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 1 hour per response for utilities
and 8 hours for households annually, including time for reviewing the questions, gathering the data needed, and completing
and reviewing the information. 


Respondents:

 Water utilities and selected households.


Estimated Number of Respondents:

 126 utilities, 900 households.


Estimated Number of Responses per Respondent:

 1.


Frequency of Collection:

 One time.


Estimated Total Annual Burden on Respondents:

 140 hours for utilities, 7,290 hours for households.
Send comments regarding the burden estimate, or any other 
aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to:

Title:

 Municipal Water Pollution Prevention (MWPP) Program Evaluation (EPA No. 1728.01). 


Abstract:

 This is a new collection of information to support the self-auditing of municipal wastewater treatment facilities
under the EPA's MWPP program, as authorized under section 104 of the Clean Water Act (CWA). CWA section 104(b) (7),
as implemented through EPA's MWPP guidance (March 1991), authorizes EPA to develop effective and practical processes,
methods, and prototype devices for the prevention, reduction and elimination of pollution. The MWPP self-audit
is needed to provide managers of municipal wastewater treatment facilities a framework with which to diagnose problems
and design actions to deal with them. This information collection applies to MWPP programs that are presently operated
by EPA Regions 6 and 10, and does not apply to State-delegated programs. These EPA Regions may choose to make the preparation
and submission of the self-audit to the EPA region mandatory under the authority of CWA section 308(a).
Respondents conducting the MWPP self-audit may use the EPA self-audit form, or alternative methods, to provide information
documenting: (1) Actual, design, and potential influent flow and loadings, and number of overflows and bypasses;
(2) operator needs, training and certification practices; (3) biosolids treatment, storage and disposal capacity;
(4) facility age; (5) effluent quality versus permit limits; (6) new requirements (impact of changed water quality
standards); (7) financial status of the facility; (8) collection system information; and (9) other information
necessary to clarify responses. 
Facility operators will prepare a corrective action plan and resolution that will be submitted with the self-audit
to facility owners (i.e. municipal governing bodies) for review and approval. Facility owners will then forward
the audit and relevant materials to the EPA Regional Office. 
The information may be used by facility owners/operators and local officials to assist in resource allocations and
encourage efficient use of existing facilities. EPA Regional Offices will use this information to target assistance
and develop priorities to better meet facility and municipality needs. 


Burden Statement:

 Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 26 hours for facility operators
and 2.5 hours for facility owners, for an estimated average of 28.5 hours per response including time for reviewing
questions, gathering the data needed, completing and reviewing the information, and submitting the information
to the EPA Region.


Respondents:

 Subject operators and owners of municipal water treatment facilities in EPA Regions 6 and 10.


Estimated Number of Respondents:

 865.


Estimated Number of Responses per Respondent:

 1.


Frequency of Collection:

 Annual.


Estimated Total Annual Burden on Respondents:

 24,650 hours.
Send comments regarding the burden estimate, or any other 
aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to:

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Public Law 102-375 requires that the Policy Committee (which oversees the 1995 White House Conference on Aging)
formulate and approve a proposed agenda for the Conference and that this proposed agenda be published in the 

Federal Register

 for public comment.



The statutory language urges the 1995 White House Conference on Aging (WHCoA) to work jointly with States, individuals,
and public and private organizations to develop a proposed agenda which reflects the major issues facing older Americans
and their communities. The collection of public comments began immediately after President Clinton formally called
for the 1995 WHCoA in February 1994. Special emphasis has been placed on soliciting suggestions and ideas from a wide
range of sources_especially from the grassroots.

Input received from a variety of local, state, regional and national events conducted on behalf of the WHCoA over the
past several months points toward an agenda which goes beyond traditional boundaries and paints a broader picture
of aging_an agenda that looks at the present and the future. This Conference should examine a wide range of issues,
including the needs and contributions of today's and tomorrow's older citizens. This far-reaching examination
is evident in the broad support which has emerged for a theme and issues which incorporate the generational aspects
of aging. Congress also included the generational issue in the statute by mandating that the Conference look at the
interdependence of generations, the contributions of older individuals to societal well-being and the commonality
of problems facing both older and younger individuals.

Initial suggestions from the grassroots for Conference themes and agenda issues have been used by the Policy Committee
to develop the proposed agenda for the 1995 WHCoA. Over 400 pre-conference events have been held around the country
to develop policy recommendations for building the agenda for the Conference.



Part I. Themes



Below is a listing of proposed themes from which we expect the final theme for the Conference to emerge based primarily
on the public comments received. These four proposed themes are:

 

Aging into the 21st Century: Generations Working Together for a Better Community.

 Investing in an Aging Society into the 21st Century: Independence, Opportunity and Dignity for All Americans.

 Investing Now in America's Future: A Lifetime of Productivity and Opportunity.

 America Now and into the 21st Century: Growing Older with Independence, Opportunity and Dignity.

The public is invited to indicate a preferred theme from among these alternatives or to suggest additional themes
for consideration by the Policy Committee.



Part II. Issues



This part of the proposed agenda is a listing of major issues and subissues derived from a variety of sources, including:




(1) Recommendations from past White House Conferences on Aging;

(2) Recommendations produced by events preceding the 1995 WHCoA; and

(3) Input from national aging organizations, professionals and advocates.




We are eliciting comments on the relative importance of these issues and subissues. We are also seeking suggestions
on ways to link the various issues and subissues.

The major issues and subissues identified by the Policy Committee are listed below in alphabetical order:



Arts and Humanities

As previously mentioned, comments are invited on the above list as well as on other issues and subissues which should
be addressed at the Conference. Public comment is also invited on a strategy for effectively linking issues and subissues
both for discussion and for developing recommendations.

It is anticipated that a large number of responses will be received from the public during the comment period. All comments
received will be reviewed and answered. The Policy Committee will establish priorities among the issues based on
public response to the proposed agenda. These prioritized issues will ultimately provide the foundation for the
final Conference agenda which will be published in the 

Federal Register

. Conference delegates will receive information about the final agenda in advance of the Conference to allow them
to prepare and actively participate in the 1995 WHCoA.



Part III. Post-Conference Action on Recommendations



During the Conference, delegates will begin the process of establishing priorities for action among the recommendations
they produce. Immediately after the Conference, the Advisory Committee (appointed by the President), followed
by the Policy Committee, will be responsible for further developing the prioritized recommendations of the Conference
for inclusion in the proposed Conference report. 

This proposed report will be submitted to each State Governor for review and comment as required by the Statute. After
reviewing the comments of the Governors, the Policy Committee will prepare and approve an initial report of the Conference
to be published in the 

Federal Register

. The Policy Committee will also prepare a separate report on the necessary administrative and legislative actions
to implement the recommendations in the Conference report. 

The final Conference report will serve as a catalyst as well as provide a blueprint for proposed post-WHCoA implementation
activities. This action-oriented blueprint will provide the framework for immediate and longer-term actions to
implement the Conference's highest priority recommendations. This blueprint will also identify areas and tasks
in which the public and private sectors, governmental and non-governmental organizations and agencies, can play
a role in implementing the Conference recommendations. These may include private initiatives as well as the enactment
of public policies and laws affecting aging Americans, their families and their communities now and into the 21st
century.

Notice of Availability of Funds For Fiscal Year 1995 




Introduction 


The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces that applications are being accepted for Injury Prevention
and Control Research Grants for fiscal year (FY) 1995. The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the
health promotion and disease prevention objectives of Healthy People 2000, a PHS-led national activity to reduce
morbidity and mortality and improve the quality of life. This announcement is related to the Healthy People 2000 chapter
on Unintentional Injuries. (To order a copy of Healthy People 2000, see the section Where to Obtain Additional Information.)



Authority 


This program is authorized under Sections 301 and 391-394 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 241 and
280b-280b-3). Program regulations are set forth in Title 42 CFR Part 52. 


Eligible Applicants 


Eligible applicants include all non-profit and for-profit organizations. Thus State and local health departments
and State and local governmental agencies, universities, colleges, research institutions, and other public and
private organizations, including small, minority and/or woman-owned businesses are eligible for these research
grants. Current holders of CDC injury control research projects are eligible to apply. 


Smoke-Free Workplace 


The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote
the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and
mental health of the American people. 


Availability of Funds 


Approximately $2.0 million is projected to be available in FY 1995 to fund 6 to 9 grants. The amount of funding actually
available may vary and is subject to change. New grant awards will not exceed $300,000 per year (including both direct
and indirect costs). Grant applications that exceed the $300,000 per year cap will be returned to the investigator
as non-responsive. Research grant supplements will generally be no more than $75,000 (including both direct and
indirect costs). Awards will be made for a 12-month budget period within a project period not to exceed 3 years. Continuation
awards within the project period will be made on the basis of satisfactory progress demonstrated by investigators
at work-in-progress monitoring workshops, the achievement of workplan milestones reflected in the continuation
application, and the availability of Federal funds. In addition, if funds are available, continuation awards may
be eligible for increased funding to offset inflationary costs. 


Purpose 


The purposes of this program are to: 
A. Support injury prevention and control research on priority issues as delineated in Injury Control in the 1990s:
A National Plan for Action and Healthy People 2000. 
B. Encourage professionals from a wide spectrum of disciplines such as engineering, medicine, health care, public
health, behavioral and social sciences, and others, to undertake research to prevent and control injuries. 
C. Evaluate current and new intervention methods and strategies for the prevention and control of injuries. 
D. Encourage professionals from a wide spectrum of disciplines such as medicine, health care, public health, behavioral
and social sciences, and others to undertake research to prevent and control unintentional injuries.

Program Requirements 



The following are applicant requirements: 

A. A principal investigator who has conducted research, published the findings, and has specific authority and responsibility
to carry out the proposed project. 

B. Demonstrated experience in conducting, evaluating, and publishing injury control research (as previously defined)
on the applicant's project team. 

C. Effective and well-defined working relationships within the performing organization and with outside entities
which will ensure implementation of the proposed activities. 

D. An explanation of how research findings could lead to the development of injury control interventions within 3-5
years of project start-up. Furthermore, how the research findings might be disseminated and implemented through
organizations (such as public health agencies) or systems, both public and private. 

E. The ability to carry out an injury control research project. 

F. The overall match between the applicant's proposed theme and research objectives, and the program priorities
as described under the heading ``Programmatic Interests'' and Injury Control in the 1990s: A National Plan for Action
and Healthy People 2000. 






Note: 

Grant funds will not be made available to support the provision of direct care services. 




Eligible applicants may enter into contracts, including consortia agreements (as set forth in the PHS Grants Policy
Statement) as necessary to meet the requirements of the program and strengthen the overall application. 



Programmatic Interests 



Grant applications for unintentional injury prevention and control research are sought. The focus of grants should
reflect the broad-based need to control injury morbidity, mortality, disability, and costs. Special consideration
may be given to applications requesting one or two years of funding. One-year pilot projects are encouraged. 

In prevention, there is special programmatic interest in research which evaluates the effectiveness of interventions
in preventing injuries or reducing their impact and develops the basic sciences of injury (i.e., biomechanics and
epidemiology). This research might evaluate one or more different approaches to implementing a specific intervention
strategy for which there is already existing evidence of effectiveness (e.g., protective helmets for bicycle riders,
energy-absorbing playground surfaces, lowered tap water temperatures, etc.). In addition, there is a need to develop
new intervention strategies or examine intervention strategies for which evidence of effectiveness is either sparse
or totally lacking (e.g., public education and information campaigns, teaching infants to swim, interior design
innovations to prevent falls among older persons, etc.). Interventions chosen for evaluation should have a significant
potential for reduction in injury morbidity, mortality, disability, or cost. Special consideration will be given
to grant applications which target populations at high risk for injuries and their consequences, including adolescents,
children, racial and ethnic minorities, rural residents, farm families, and people with low incomes. 

In acute care, there is special programmatic interest in intensifying the role of the emergency department and in-patient
hospital trauma services in regard to public health surveillance and prevention of traumatic injuries. In acute
care settings, identifying underlying risk factors for injury and intervening to reduce or eliminate them can help
minimize the impact of violence, substance abuse, and other factors associated with injury recidivism. There is
also a need to assess the impact of national and State health care reforms on prehospital emergency medical services,
emergency department care of the injured, in-patient trauma care, and rehabilitation services. There is interest
in the identification of optimal methods for diagnosing and treating patients who have sustained major trauma, including
central nervous system injuries, burns, and multiple organ system injuries.

In rehabilitation, there is programmatic interest in clinical research and clinical trials on improved approaches
to comprehensive rehabilitation. This includes research directed towards minimizing the secondary complications
of injury including pressure sores, contracture, muscular atrophy, skeletal deformity and other definable conditions.
This research should cover methods of their prevention and take into account the injured person's need for education
to prevent recurrent medical problems and the role of the family in preventing secondary conditions. Population-based
and longitudinal studies are needed to better establish the prognoses and rehabilitation needs of patients with
traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, burns, and severe sensory loss. 

In biomechanics, there is special programmatic interest in brain and spinal cord injury. This interest includes
the biomechanical evaluation of intervention concepts and strategies (e.g., bike helmets, energy absorbing playground
surfaces, hip pads, motor vehicle side impact and rollover countermeasures, etc.), development of models to elucidate
injury physiology and pharmacologic, surgical and other interventions; defining human tolerance limits for injury
among children, women, the chronically ill and older persons; improvements in injury assessment technology; and
understanding impact injury mechanisms and quantifying injury-related biomechanical responses for critical
areas of the human body (e.g., brain and vertebral injury with spinal cord involvement). Consideration will also
be given to the biomechanics of thoracic and abdominal viscera, musculature and joints including the articular cartilage,
tendons and ligaments. 

In epidemiology, there is programmatic interest in analytic research that identifies mechanisms, causes, or risks
of injury which might lead to new or more effective interventions. Also of interest is epidemiologic research having
as its focus the development of improved methods and the evaluation and improvement of injury surveillance systems.


Research is needed that more accurately defines the cost of unintentional injury and the cost effectiveness or prevention
effectiveness of interventions. Cost analysis should be included in the plans, where appropriate, to evaluate an
intervention(s) pertinent to one of the topics previously outlined under prevention, acute care, rehabilitation,
biomechanics, etc. A more complete discussion of methodologies for assessing cost analysis is presented in, A Framework
for Assessing the Effectiveness of Disease and Injury Prevention, (CDC, Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report,
March 27, 1992, Volume 41, Number RR-3, pages 5-11). (To receive information on these reports see the section
Where to Obtain Additional Information.) 



Evaluation Criteria 



Upon receipt, applications will be reviewed by CDC staff for completeness and responsiveness as outlined under the
previous heading, Program Requirements (A-F). Incomplete applications and applications that are not responsive
will be returned to the applicant without further consideration. Applications which are complete and responsive
may be subjected to a preliminary evaluation by a peer review group to determine if the application is of sufficient
technical and scientific merit to warrant further review (triage); the CDC will withdraw from further consideration
applications judged to be noncompetitive and promptly notify the principal investigator/program director and
the official signing for the applicant organization. Those applications judged to be competitive will be further
evaluated by a dual review process. Awards will be made based on priority score ranking by the Injury Research Grants
Review Committee (IRGRC), programmatic priorities and needs by the Advisory Committee for Injury Prevention and
Control, and the availability of funds. 

A. The first review will be a peer review conducted by the IRGRC on all applications. Factors to be considered will include:


1. The specific aims of the research project, i.e., the broad longterm objectives, the intended accomplishment of
the specific research proposal, and the hypothesis to be tested;

2. The background of the proposal, i.e., the basis for the present proposal, the critical evaluation of existing knowledge,
and specific identification of the injury control knowledge gaps which the proposal is intended to fill; 

3. The significance and originality from a scientific or technical standpoint of the specific aims of the proposed
research, including the adequacy of the theoretical and conceptual framework for the research; 

4. For competitive renewal and supplemental applications, the progress made during the prior project period. For
new applications, (optional) the progress of preliminary studies pertinent to the application. 

5. The adequacy of the proposed research design, approaches, and methodology to carry out the research, including
quality assurance procedures, plan for data management, and statistical analysis plan. 

6. The extent to which the evaluation plan will allow for the measurement of progress toward the achievement of the
stated objectives. 

7. Qualifications, adequacy, and appropriateness of personnel to accomplish the proposed activities. 

8. The degree of commitment and cooperation of other interested parties (as evidenced by letters detailing the nature
and extent of the involvement). 

9. The reasonableness of the proposed budget to the proposed research and demonstration program. 

10. Adequacy of existing and proposed facilities and resources. 

B. The second review will be conducted by the Advisory Committee for Injury Prevention and Control. The factors to
be considered will include: 

1. The results of the peer review. 

2. The significance of the proposed activities in relation to the priorities and objectives stated in Injury Control
in the 1990s: A National Plan for Action and Healthy People 2000. 

3. National needs. 

4. Overall distribution among: 

 The three phases of injury control: prevention, acute care, and rehabilitation; 
 The major disciplines of injury control: biomechanics and epidemiology; 
 Populations addressed (e.g., adolescents, children, racial and ethnic minorities, rural residents, farm
families, and people with low incomes); and 

5. Budgetary considerations (e.g., preference may be given to applicants who submit proposals requesting funding
for research projects of one to two year's duration).

6. Additional consideration may be given to those applicants who provide evidence of an active training program for
inexperienced minority injury researchers.

C. Continued Funding:

Continuation awards made after FY 1995, but within the project period, will be made on the basis of the availability
of funds and the following criteria: 

1. The accomplishments reflected in the progress report of the continuation application indicate that the applicant
is meeting previously stated objectives or milestones contained in the project's annual workplan and satisfactory
progress has been demonstrated through monitoring presentations or work-in-progress workshops; 

2. The objectives for the new budget period are realistic, specific, and measurable; 

3. The methods described will clearly lead to achievement of these objectives; 

4. The evaluation plan will allow management to monitor whether the methods are effective; and 

5. The budget request is clearly explained, adequately justified, reasonable, and consistent with the intended
use of grant funds. 

D. Supplementary Funding:

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Intent to Prepare EIS/EIR for Mainstem Trinity River Fishery Restoration</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent to prepare a draft environmental impact statement/environmental impact report and notice of scoping
meetings.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Pursuant to section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, and the California Environmental
Quality Act of 1970, as amended, the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) and the Hoopa Valley Tribe propose to prepare
a draft environmental impact statement/environmental impact report (EIS/EIR) to evaluate mainstem Trinity River
fishery restoration projects and to assist the Secretary of the Interior in developing recommendations for permanent
instream fishery flow requirements and Trinity River Division operating criteria and procedures for the restoration
and maintenance of the Trinity River Fishery, Trinity River Division, Central Valley Project (CVP), California.
Such recommendations are required by the Flow Evaluation Program, authorized by a January 14, 1981, Secretarial
Directive, and for Section 3406(b)23(A) of the Central Valley Project Improvement Act (CVPIA) dated October 30,
1992.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Construction of the Trinity River Division of the CVP was completed in 1963. The keystones of the division are Lewiston
Dam and Trinity Dam located just upstream of the town of Lewiston, California. The primary function of the Trinity
River Division is to store Trinity River water for regulated diversion to the Central Valley of California for agricultural,
municipal, and industrial uses. A substantial amount of electric power is generated as water diverted out of the Trinity
River Basin passes through four hydroelectric power generation plants.


Construction of the Trinity River Division resulted in the diversion of up to 90 percent of the average annual discharge
in the Trinity River at Lewiston, and blocked access to 109 miles of spawning and rearing habitat to migrating salmon
and steelhead. The Trinity River Hatchery was constructed at the base of Lewiston Dam to mitigate for those fish production
losses that occurred upstream of Trinity Dam, and annual fishery flows of 120,000 acre-feet were released from Lewiston
Dam to maintain existing salmon and steelhead habitat downstream. These measures were insufficient to maintain
the fishery, however, and populations of salmon and steelhead declined at a rapid rate following completion of the
Trinity River Division.
Reduced river flows, combined with excessive watershed erosion and encroachment of the river channel by riparian
vegetation, caused major changes in the morphology of the Trinity River downstream of Lewiston Dam. Reduced flows
were no longer capable of transporting large amounts of sediment downstream. As a result, sand began to fill holding
pools, spawning riffles, and over-wintering and rearing areas with devastating effects on existing anadromous
salmonid habitat.
In 1974, six State and Federal agencies formed the Trinity River Basin Fish and Wildlife Task force (Task Force) to
develop an action plan and seek funding for restoration of the fish and wildlife resources of the basin. In May 1982,
the Task Force completed a Trinity River Basin Fish and Wildlife Management Program Report, which identified an action
plan consisting of 11 activities aimed at restoring fish and wildlife habitat. These activities included sediment
control and watershed stabilization, improvement of the Trinity River Hatchery, and habitat improvements in the
river and its tributaries.
In response to declining fisheries and degraded habitat conditions, the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) decided
in 1981 to increase flows in the Trinity River from 120,000 acre-feet to 340,000 acre-feet annually, with reductions
in dry and critically dry years. In addition, the Fish and Wildlife Service was directed to undertake a 12-year Flow
Evaluation Study to assess fish habitat at various flows, develop a recommended flow regimen, and evaluate mainstem
channel restoration measures. The Flow Evaluation Study began in October 1984 and will conclude in September 1996.
In October 1984, the Trinity River Basin Fish and Wildlife Restoration Act (Public Law 98-541) was enacted by
Congress with the goal of restoring fish and wildlife populations to pre-CVP levels. The Act provided funding for
construction, operation, and maintenance of the 11-item action plan developed by the Task Force in 1982. The program
is administered by a field office staffed jointly by the Bureau of Reclamation and the Fish and Wildlife Service and
will end in 1995. The Act also identified a Task Force consisting of representatives from 14 Federal, State, and county
entities and the Hoopa Valley Tribe to assist and advise the Secretary. A 14-member Technical Coordinating Committee
has been established to assist and advise the Task Force and the field office. Modification of the mainstem channel
is a key element of the restoration program.
Section 3406(b)(23) of the CVPIA provides, through the Trinity River Division, an instream release of not less than
340,000 acre-feet of water to meet Federal trust responsibilities to protect fishery resources of the Hoopa Valley
Tribe and to meet the fishery restoration goals of Public Law 98-541.
In accordance with Section 3406(b)(23)(A) of the CVPIA, of Public Law 102-575, recommendations for mainstem
Trinity River fishery restoration will be developed after appropriate consultations with Federal, State and local
agencies and after completion of an on-going Flow Evaluation Study. The Secretary of the Interior is directed to complete
the flow study and recommendations by September 30, 1996. The draft EIS/EIR is expected to be completed and available
for review and comment by the end of 1995.
The Fish and Wildlife Service and the Hoopa Valley Tribe will seek public input on alternatives, concerns, and issues
to be addressed in the EIS through a series of scoping meetings. The schedule and locations of the scoping meetings
are as follows:



October 27, 1994, 6:30 pm to 9:00 pm, Elks Lodge

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>






Northeast Nuclear Energy Company; Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License and Opportunity
for a Hearing



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. NPF-49, issued to Northeast Nuclear Energy Company (the licensee), for operation of the Millstone
Nuclear Power Station, Unit No. 3 located in New London County, Connecticut.

The proposed amendment would revise the Technical Specifications to allow a relaxation in setpoint tolerance of
the pressurizer safety valves (PSVs) and main steam safety valves (MSSVs) from plus or minus 1% to plus or minus 3%.

Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.

By November 14, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the Learning Resource Center, Three Rivers Community-Technical
College, Thames Valley Campus, 574 New London Turnpike, Norwich, CT 06360. If a request for a hearing or petition for
leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by
the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition;
and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate
order.

As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.

Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party.

Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.

<DOCTITLE>Commonwealth Edison Company; Consideration of Issuance of Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses Proposed
no Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing</DOCTITLE>


The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License Nos. NPF-37, NPF-66, NPF-72, and NPF-77, issued to Commonwealth Edison Company (ComEd,
the licensee), for operation of the Byron Station, Units 1 and 2, located in Ogle County, Illinois and Braidwood Station,
Units 1 and 2, located in Will County, Illinois.
In a letter of August 13, 1993, and as supplemented on September 15, 1993, September 16, 1993, December 17, 1993, January
19, 1994, February 11, 1994, and February 24, 1994, ComEd submitted requests for amendments for steam generator (SG)
tube sleeving in accordance with (1) Westinghouse and (2) Babcock & Wilcox processes. By letter dated March 4,
1994, the NRC granted the proposed sleeving methods contingent upon four conditions which the licensee accepted
in their letter of February 24, 1994.
Three of the four changes will be reflected in the plants' Technical Specifications (TS). By letter dated June 3, 1994,
the licensee requested changes to TS 3.4.5 and 3.4.6.2 to include the three conditions, which are:
1. Amend the Byron and Braidwood licenses to reflect a primary-to-secondary leakage rate limit of 150 gallons per
day (gpd) through any one SG.
2. Amend the Byron and Braidwood licenses to reflect an inservice inspection of a minimum of 20 percent of a random sample
of the sleeves for axial and circumferential indication at the end-of-cycle. In the event that an imperfection of
40 percent or greater depth is detected, an additional 20 percent (minimum) of the unsampled sleeves should be inspected,
and if an imperfection of 40 percent or greater depth is detected in the second sample, all remaining sleeves should
be inspected.
3. Add a condition to the Byron and Braidwood licenses to conduct additional corrosion testing to establish the design
life for the kinetically or laser welded sleeved tubes in the presence of a crevice.
Collectively, these conditions will enable the licensee to have:
1. Further assurance that the integrity of the SGs will be maintained in the event of a main steam line break or under
loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) conditions;
2. Increased monitoring of the SG tube sleeves for any degradation; and 
3. Increased confidence that SG sleeve integrity will be maintained for extended operations.
Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.
The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the
proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee
has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:



1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.
The original amendment requested [approval] of tubesheet sleeves and tube support plate sleeves as an alternate
tube repair method for Byron and Braidwood Units 1 and 2. The steam generator sleeves approved for installation use
the Westinghouse process (laser welded joints) and the Babcock and Wilcox (B&W) process of kinetically welded
joints. The sleeve configuration was designed and analyzed in accordance with the criteria of Regulatory Guide (RG)
1.121 and the design requirements of Section III of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Code. Fatigue
and stress analyses of the sleeved tube assemblies for both processes produced acceptable results as documented
in the Westinghouse and the B&W topical reports submitted in the original sleeving package. Mechanical testing
has shown that the structural strength of the sleeves under normal, faulted, and upset conditions is within acceptable
limits. Leakage rate testing for the tube sleeves has demonstrated that primary-to-secondary leakage is not expected
during all plant conditions.
Any leakage through the sleeved region of the tube is fully bounded by the leak-before-break considerations and,
ultimately, the existing steam generator tube rupture analysis included in the Byron and Braidwood Updated Final
Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR). The reduction in TS leakage rate requirements from 500 gpd allowable per SG to 150
gpd further ensures that SG tube integrity is maintained in the event of a main steam line break (MSLB) or under Loss
Of Coolant Accident (LOCA) conditions. The RG 1.121 criteria for establishing operational leakage rate limits require
a plant shutdown based upon a leak-before-break consideration to detect a free span crack before a potential tube
rupture. The 150 gpd limit will continue to allow for early leakage detection and require a plant shutdown in the event
of the occurrence of an unexpected crack resulting in leakage that exceeds the revised Technical Specification limit.

<TEXT>
 

The sleeve sample size has been increased to a minimum of twenty (20) percent of the inservice sleeves. Increasing
the sample size of the sleeves to be inspected will increase the monitoring of tubes using sleeves for any further degradation
while they remain inservice. If the sample identifies a sleeve with an imperfection of greater [than] 40 percent depth,
an additional 20 percent of the sleeves shall be inspected. The sleeves that have identified imperfections of greater
than 40 percent shall be evaluated and removed from service. The inservice inspections and additional corrosion
testing for the sleeves and welded joints will continue until the corrosion resistance is demonstrated acceptable
to the NRC. If conformance with the acceptance criteria of section 4.4.5.4 for tube structural integrity is not confirmed,
the tubes containing the sleeves in question shall be removed from service. Increasing the monitoring of the sleeved
tubes will decrease the probability of occurrence of an accident previously evaluated in the UFSAR.

Implementation of a corrosion testing program should determine the effects that material microstructure, chemistry,
and joint crevices will have on primary water stress corrosion cracking initiation and growth. This program will
not cause an increase in the probability or consequence of an accident previously evaluated because the testing program
is conducted in laboratory conditions. If the results of the testing program do not confirm the structural integrity
of the tubes, the tubes containing the sleeves in question shall be removed from service. These changes do not involve
a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.

The implementation of the proposed amendment will not introduce significant or adverse changes to the plant design
basis. The proposed changes do not involve plant modification or changes to equipment, and consist of: reduction
in allowable steam generator leakage limits, increase in the sample size of the steam generator tube sleeved and the
addition of a commitment to perform a corrosion testing program on the sleeved tubes.

The reduction in TS leakage rate requirements from 500 gpd allowable per SG to 150 gpd further ensures that SG tube integrity
is maintained in the event of a MSLB or under LOCA conditions. The 150 gpd limit is designed to provide for leakage detection
and a plant shutdown in the event of the occurrence of an unexpected single crack resulting in excessive tube leakage.
The limit provides for early detection and a plant shutdown prior to a postulated crack reaching critical crack lengths
for Main Steam Line Break conditions.

Increasing the sample size of tubes sleeved during each scheduled inservice inspection will increase the monitoring
of these tubes for any further degradation. The improved monitoring and evaluation of the tube and the sleeves assures
tube structural integrity is maintained or the tube is removed for service.

Additionally, corrosion testing to establish sleeve design life and corrosion resistance to confirm tube structural
integrity will be performed. If the tube structural integrity is not confirmed, the tubes containing the sleeves
in question shall be removed from service.

With these actions the possibility of a new or different type of accident from any accident previously evaluated is
not created.

3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Implementation of the proposed changes will not reduce the margin of safety. This amendment involves the reduction
of steam generator leakage limit, and increase in the amount of sleeved tubes inspected and the incorporation of a
corrosion testing program for sleeved tubes. All of these actions will help ensure steam generator tube integrity.

Reduction of the leakage rate requirement from 500 to 150 gallons per day (gpd) per steam generator will continue to
ensure steam generator tube integrity is maintained in the event of main steam line break or under LOCA conditions.
The reduction to 150 gpd also limits the allowable primary-to-secondary leakage from 1 gallon per minute to 600 gpd
for all steam generators not isolated from the Reactor Coolant System (RCS). This previous leakage limit, used in
UFSAR accident analysis, ensured the dosage contribution from tube leakage would be limited to a small fraction of
the 10 CFR Part 100 dose guideline values in the event of either a steam generator tube rupture or steam line break. Reducing
these limits will not result [in] a reduction in the margin of safety.

The portions of the installed sleeve assembly which represent the reactor coolant pressure boundary can be monitored
for the initiation and progression of sleeve/tube wall degradation, thus satisfying the requirement of Regulatory
Guide 1.83. The portion of the tube bridged by the sleeve joints is effectively removed from the pressure boundary,
and the sleeve then forms the new pressure boundary. The sleeve enhances the safety of the plant by increasing the protective
boundaries of the steam generator. Keeping the tube in service with the use of a sleeve instead of plugging the tube
and removing it from service increases the heat transfer efficiency of the steam generator. Monitoring for any increased
degradation of a repaired steam generator tube shall be implemented at Byron and Braidwood by increasing the sampling
size of inservice sleeves to include an additional twenty (20) percent of the sleeves inservice. During each scheduled
in service inspection, each sampled sleeve evaluated and found to have unacceptable degradation shall be removed
from service.

Implementation of a corrosion testing program should determine the effects that material microstructure, chemistry,
and joint crevices will have on primary water stress corrosion cracking initiation and growth. This program is conducted
in laboratory setting; therefore, [it] will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. In addition,
the corrosion testing program will be performed to establish sleeve design life and corrosion resistance to confirm
tube structural integrity. If the tube structural integrity is not confirmed, the tubes containing the sleeves in
question shall be removed from service. These actions [do] not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.




Based on the preceding analysis it is concluded that operation of Byron and Braidwood Units 1 and 2, in accordance with
the proposed amendment does not increase the probability of an accident previously evaluated, does not create the
possibility of a new or different kind of accident previously evaluated, nor reduce any margins to plant safety. Therefore,
the license amendment does not involve a Significant Hazards Consideration as defined in 10 CFR 50.92.

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.

Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission
take this action, it will publish in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently.

Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville
Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the
NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555.

The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.

By November 14, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice

<DOCTITLE>Biweekly Notice</DOCTITLE>



Applications and Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses Involving No Significant Hazards Considerations

I. Background


Pursuant to Public Law 97-415, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission or NRC staff) is publishing
this regular biweekly notice. Public Law 97-415 revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the
Act), to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, or proposed to be issued, under a new provision
of section 189 of the Act. This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediately effective
any amendment to an operating license upon a determination by the Commission that such amendment involves no significant
hazards consideration, notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearing from any person.

This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposed to be issued from September 19, 1994,
through September 29, 1994. The last biweekly notice was published on September 28, 1994 (59 FR 49425).



Notice Of Consideration Of Issuance Of Amendments To Facility Operating Licenses, Proposed No Significant Hazards
Consideration Determination, And Opportunity For A Hearing



The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendment requests involve no significant hazards
consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance
with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an
accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination
for each amendment request is shown below. 
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. 
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received before action is taken.
Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the 

Federal Register 

a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently. 
Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register 

notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville,
Maryland from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC
Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555. The filing of requests for a hearing
and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.
By November 14, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition
for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated
by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or
petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or
an appropriate order. 
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.

Carolina Power & Light Company, et al., Docket No. 50-400, Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1, Wake and
Chatham Counties, North Carolina




Date of amendment request: 

August 19, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment will move the current procedural details of the radiological effluent Technical Specifications
(TS) programmatic controls for radioactive effluents, radiological environmental monitoring and solid radioactive
wastes from the Administrative Controls Section of the TS to the Offsite Dose Calculation Manual (ODCM) or the Process
Control Program (PCP), as appropriate, in accordance with the guidance of Generic Letter 89-01. This amendment will
also incorporate changes to the reporting requirements for the Effluent Release Reports, in accordance with 10 CFR
50.36; incorporate references to the new 10 CFR Part 20; and revise the terminology for the gaseous effluent release
rate limits.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.

Transferring the procedural details from the TS to the ODCM and PCP and their replacement with programmatic controls
have no impact on plant operation or safety. No safety-related equipment, safety function, or plant operation will
be altered as a result of this proposed change. The changes are unrelated to the initiation and mitigation of accidents
and equipment malfunctions addressed in the Final Safety Analysis Report.

The proposed revisions to the reporting requirements for Effluent Release Reports, the gaseous effluent release
rate limit and the relocation of the old 10 CFR 20.106 requirements to the new 10 CFR 20.1302 have no impact on plant systems,
plant operations or accident precursors. The changes to the Effluent Report requirements and the updated reference
to 10 CFR 20.1302 are administrative in nature. The change to the gaseous effluent release limit is also administrative
in nature in that it will allow the continued operation of the facility with the same release rate limits as are currently
implemented by the Technical Specifications.

Therefore, there would be no increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

2. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.

Transferring the procedural details from the TS to the ODCM and PCP and their replacement with programmatic controls
have no impact on plant operation or safety. No safety-related equipment, safety function, or plant operation will
be altered as a result of this proposed change. No changes to plant components or structures are introduced which could
create new accidents or malfunctions not previously evaluated.

The proposed revisions to the reporting requirements for effluent Release Reports, the gaseous effluent release
rate limit and the relocation of the old 10 CFR 20.106 requirements to the new 10 CFR 20.1302 have no impact on plant systems,
plant operations or accident precursors. The changes to the Effluent Report requirements and the updated reference
to 10 CFR 20.1302 are administrative in nature. The change to the gaseous effluent release limits is also administrative
in nature in that it will allow the continued operation of the facility with the same release rate limits as are currently
implemented by the Technical Specifications.

Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.

3. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

The procedural details of the current RETS will be transferred to the ODCM and PCP and replaced with programmatic controls
consistent with regulatory requirements, including controls on revisions to the ODCM and PCP. Thus, no requirements
or controls will be reduced.

The changes to the Effluent Report requirements and the updated reference to 10 CFR 20.1302 are administrative in
nature and therefore have no effect on the margin of safety. The proposed revisions to the gaseous effluent release
limits will maintain the release rate limits at the same level as currently implemented by the Technical Specifications.
Therefore, there will be no change in the types and amounts of effluents that will be released, nor will there be an increase
in individual or cumulative radiation exposures to any member of the public.

Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Illinois




Date of amendment request: 

September 19, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise the Technical Specifications by reducing the frequency for testing the containment
spray system spray nozzles.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability of occurrence or consequences of
any accident previously evaluated.

The relaxation of surveillance frequency will not affect any of the initiators or precursors of any accident previously
evaluated. Performance of CS spray nozzle testing on a ten year basis rather than on a five year basis will not increase
the likelihood that a transient initiating event will occur because transients are initiated by external events,
equipment malfunction, and/or catastrophic system failure. There are no failure mechanisms or modes for the CS system
or spray nozzles that could initiate a transient since the CS system is passive except during a Loss of Coolant Accident
(LOCA). Upon receipt of a Containment Spray signal (Containment High-High Pressure coincident with a Safety Injection
Signal), the CS pumps automatically start and valves align to provide spray flow through the CS risers, ring headers,
and out the spray nozzles. Periodic testing requirements for the CS pumps and valves (the active components of the
system) are unaffected by the proposed changes. Industry experience and previous test experience at Zion Station
supports the conclusion that functional checks of the spray nozzles on a ten year basis is adequate to detect degradation
or blockage of the spray nozzles. 
The proposed typographical and administrative changes do not affect the operability or surveillance requirements
given in Technical Specifications. They will only improve consistency of existing terminology and format of Technical
Specifications and will remove temporarily imposed Bases that are no longer applicable.

Based on the fact that reliability of the system will not be affected and transient precursors and initiators are not
affected by operation in accordance with the proposed changes, the probability of occurrence of accidents previously
evaluated will not significantly increase.

The proposed change in surveillance frequency will not affect the ability of the CS system to function as designed
during the accidents considered in the Safety Analyses. Periodic testing requirements for the CS pumps and valves
(the active components of the system) are unaffected by the proposed changes. Industry experience and previous test
experience at Zion Station supports the conclusion that functional checks of the spray nozzles on a ten year basis
is adequate to detect degradation or blockage of the spray nozzles. Given the proposed changes, the CS system will
maintain the ability to reduce containment pressure, remove heat from containment, and remove iodine from the containment
atmosphere during the design basis LOCA. As a result, peak containment pressure will be maintained below design pressure
and the off-site release due to the postulated accident will remain as described in the Safety Analyses. Therefore,
based on the previous discussion, the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in consequences of any
accident previously evaluated.

2. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed.

The proposed changes to the Technical Specifications do not involve the addition of any new or different types of safety
related equipment, nor does it involve the operation of equipment required for safety operation of the facility in
a manner different from those addressed in the safety analyses. No safety related equipment or function will be altered
as a result of the proposed changes. Also, changes to the procedures governing normal plant operation and recovery
from an accident are not necessitated by the proposed Technical Specification changes.

The proposed typographical and administrative changes do not affect the operability or surveillance requirements
given in Technical Specifications. They will only improve consistency of existing terminology and format of Technical
Specifications and will remove Bases that are no longer applicable.

Since no new failure modes or mechanisms are added by the proposed changes, the possibility or a new or different kind
of accident is not created. 
3. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Plant safety margins are established through LCOs, limiting safety system settings, and safety limits specified
in the Technical Specifications. There will be no changes to either the physical design of the plant or to any of these
settings and limits as a result of relaxing the surveillance frequency of CS nozzle checks from five years to ten years.
Testing on a ten year basis is adequate to detect spray nozzle degradation or blockage since the system piping and spray
nozzles are constructed of corrosion resistant Type 304 stainless steel and since the system is normally passive
(i.e. spray risers and spray rings are empty with no flow except during an accident). This conclusion was also provided
in NUREG-1366 and Generic Letter 93-05 which recommended revising the surveillance frequency as proposed.

The proposed typographical and administrative changes do not affect the operability or surveillance requirements
given in Technical Specifications. They will only improve consistency of existing terminology and format of Technical
Specifications and will remove Bases that are no longer applicable.

Based on the above discussion, the ability to safely shut down the operating unit and mitigate the consequences of
all accidents previously evaluated will be maintained. Therefore, the margin of safety is not significantly affected.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Carolina




Date of amendment request: 

August 25, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The requested amendments modify the trip setpoint and allowable value for the 4 kilo-volt (KV) electrical bus degraded
grid undervoltage relay and the allowable value for the loss of offsite power relay in response to an issue identified
in the licensee's Self-Initiated Technical Audit.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:





Criterion 1

The requested amendments will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. The amendments will not affect either the probability or the consequences of an accident,
since no physical changes to the plant are being proposed. The amendments merely change the existing technical specification
settings for the above relays to more conservative values. Current field settings for these relays are already at
these more conservative values. No changes to the manner in which the plant is operated are being proposed.

Criterion 2

The requested amendments will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. As stated above, no actual changes to the physical plant are being proposed. No effect on plant operation
will occur, therefore the possibility of new accident types is not created.

 Criterion 3

The requested amendments will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Plant safety margins will
be unaffected, since no changes to the plant are being made. The proposed technical specification values are more
conservative and are intended to make the technical specifications correspond with the actual plant relay settings.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Carolina




Date of amendment request: 

August 25, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The amendments would change the frequency for conducting the surveillance test required by TS 4.7.1.2.1 for the auxiliary
feedwater pumps from once per 31 days to at least once per 92 days and would add a footnote which clarifies that testing
is not required to be performed until system heatup has progressed to a pressure (600 psig) that will support conduct
of the test. The change in the surveillance frequency has been evaluated and approved by the NRC staff as discussed
in Section 9.1 of NUREG-1366, ``Improvements to Technical Specifications Surveillance Requirements.'' The change
is based on the finding in 
NUREG-1366 that an analysis of AFW pump failures indicates that a monthly surveillance test interval may be contributing
to AFW pump unavailability through failures and equipment degradation and, therefore, AFW pump availability is
increased by quarterly testing on a staggered basis. Generic Letter 93-05, ``Line-Item Technical Specification
Improvements to Reduce Surveillance Requirements for Testing During Power Operation,'' provided the sample TS
for this change. The change is accomplished by dividing TS 4.7.1.2.1a into two parts. The new 4.7.1.2.1a maintains
the previous 31-day testing frequency for the AFW valves while the new 4.7.1.2.1b inserts a new frequency of once per
92 days for the AFW pump tests. Also, an obsolete footnote is deleted. The new footnote discussed above is consistent
with NUREG-1431, ``Standard Technical Specifications for Westinghouse Plants.'' Appropriate changes to the Bases
for the TS have also been proposed.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 



The requested amendments decrease from monthly to quarterly the frequency at which the motor-driven and turbine-driven
AFW pumps must be demonstrated operable as specified in TS 4.7.1.2.1. They also incorporate a note of clarification
from the new Westinghouse STS into the existing Catawba specifications concerning when the pump head or discharge
pressure versus flow verification for the turbine-driven pump is required to be performed.



Criterion 1

The requested amendments will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. Decreasing the frequency of AFW pump testing as specified in TS from monthly to quarterly will
have no impact upon the probability of any accident, since the AFW pumps are not accident initiating equipment. Also,
since Catawba's AFW pump performance history supports making the proposed change, system response following an
accident will not be adversely affected. Therefore, the requested amendments will not result in increased accident
consequences. Deletion of the obsolete footnotes as indicated in the Catawba technical specification markups is
purely an administrative change, and therefore will have no impact upon either the probability or consequences of
any accident. Incorporating the new STS note will only serve to clarify when the turbine-driven pump is required to
be tested and will not have any impact upon either the probability or consequences of any accident. The pump will still
be tested as before and its acceptance criteria will be unaffected.

Criterion 2

The requested amendments will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. As stated above, the AFW pumps are not accident initiating equipment. No new failure modes can be created
from an accident standpoint. The plant will not be operated in a different manner. Deletion of the Catawba obsolete
footnotes has no bearing on any accident initiating mechanisms. Incorporating the clarifying note from the new STS
will not result in any new acident sequences, since plant operation will be unaffected.

Criterion 3

The requested amendments will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Plant safety margins will
be unaffected by the proposed changes. The AFW pumps will still be capable of fulfilling their required safety function,
since plant operating experience supports the proposed change. The availability of the AFW pumps will be increased
as a result of the proposed amendments because they will not have to be made unavailable for testing as frequently.
Finally, the proposed amendments are consistent with the NRC position and guidance set forth in NUREG-1366 and Generic
Letter 93-05. Deletion of the Catawba obsolete footnotes will not result in any impact to plant safety margins. Incorporating
the note from the new STS will not impact any safety margins.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation, Docket No. 50-220, Nine Mile Point Nuclear Station Unit No. 1, Oswego County, New
York




Date of amendment request: 

September 1, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise Technical Specification (TS) 3.2.2, ``Minimum Reactor Vessel Temperature
for Pressurization,'' and the associated Bases. Specifically, the proposed amendment replaces existing TS Figures
3.2.2.a,b,c,d, and e and associated TS Tables 3.2.2.a,b,c,d, and e, that define the limits for minimum reactor vessel
temperature for pressurization and account for neutron damage at exposures up to 18 effective full power years (EFPY),
with new figures and tables that are applicable for up to 18 EFPY. The licensee stated that the new pressure-temperature
(P-T) limits were developed based on a 
plant-specific Charpy shift model for Nine Mile Point Nuclear Station Unit No. 1 which is consistent with and meets
the requirements of Regulatory Guide 1.99, Revision 2, ``Radiation Embrittlement of Reactor Vessel Materials.''
The new P-T limits were calculated in accordance with 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix G, and with the requirements specified
in Appendix G to Section III of the American Society of Mechnical Engineers Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (ASME Code).


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1 [NMP1], in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not involve a significant
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

Components of the reactor primary coolant system are operated so that no substantial mechanical or thermal loading
is applied unless the reactor pressure vessel (RPV) materials are at a temperature well above the reference nil-ductility
temperature (RT

NDT

) of the limiting RPV material. Protection against brittle fracture is further ensured by postulating a defect with
a depth 1/4 of the RPV wall thickness and a length 1-1/2 times the wall thickness, and calculating the allowable pressure
loading as a function of temperature using linear elastic fracture mechanics. Safety factors are applied to the allowable
loading determination and lower bound fracture toughness properties are used to represent the material behavior.
The net effect of the 10 CFR [Part] 50, Appendix G and the ASME Section III, Appendix G P-T curve calculative procedures
is to produce very conservative P-T curves. These procedures have been applied in the calculation of the proposed
P-T limits.

Neutron damage during plant operation is accounted for in the allowable pressure loading by calculating an adjusted
reference nil-ductility temperature (ART

NDT

). Regulatory Guide 1.99, Revision 2, defines the ART

NDT

 as the sum of the reference nil-ductility temperature (RT

NDT

) plus the shift in the reference nil-ductility temperature caused by irradiation ([delta]RT

NDT

), plus a margin. The proposed amendment replaces Equation (2) in Regulatory Position 2.1 with an accurate plant-specific
model. The ART

NDT

 margin is the same as for earlier P-T curve calculations. Operation of NMP1 in accordance with the proposed P-T operating
limits will preclude brittle failure of the RPV materials. Safety margins for brittle fracture are in accordance
with those specified in 10 CFR [Part] 50, Appendix G and Appendix G to Section III of the ASME Code. Therefore, the proposed
amendment will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

The proposed amendment incorporates P-T operating limits based on previously established calculative procedures
described in 10 CFR [Part] 50, Appendix G, Appendix G to Section III of the ASME Code, and Regulatory Guide 1.99, Revision
2. The proposed changes to the P-T operating limits are based on analyses of the irradiated limiting plate material
for Nine Mile Point Unit 1. The proposed changes do not modify any plant equipment nor do they create any potential initiating
events that would create any new or different kind of accident. Operation in accordance with the proposed P-T operating
limits will preclude brittle failure of the reactor vessel material, since safety margins specified in 10 CFR [Part]
50, Appendix G and Appendix G to Section III of the ASME Code will be maintained. Therefore, the proposed P-T limits
will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1, in accordance with the amendment, will not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety.

Operation in accordance with the proposed P-T operating limits will preclude brittle failure of the reactor pressure
vessel since safety margins in 10 CFR [Part] 50, Appendix G and Appendix G to Section III of the ASME Code will be maintained.
The plant-specific limiting material [delta]RT

NDT

 has been reduced as compared with the overly conservative [delta]RT

NDT

 used in previous P-T curve calculations as a result of the more accurate representation of the Nine Mile Point Unit
1 RPV plate behavior as a function of neutron exposure. However, the [delta]RT

NDT

 is intended to be an accurate representation of the Charpy shift (indexed at 30 ft-lbs of absorbed energy) as a function
of fluence. Since the ASME Section III, Appendix G safety factors have been maintained and the Regulatory Guide 1.99,
Revision 2, margin term specified in Regulatory Position 2.1 has been applied in the same manner as in earlier P-T curve
calculations, no significant reduction in the margin of safety has resulted from the use of a plant-specific [delta]RT

NDT

 model. Therefore, the proposed amendment will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Docket Nos. 50-275 and 50-323,
Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, San Luis Obispo County, California




Date of amendment request: 

August 17, 1994 (Reference LAR 94-06)


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendments would revise the combined Technical Specifications (TS) for the Diablo Canyon Power Plant
(DCPP) Unit Nos. 1 and 2 to change TS 3/4.1.2.5, ``Borated Water Sources - Shutdown,'' TS 3/4.1.2.6, ``Borated Water
Sources - Operating,'' and TS 3/4.5.5, ``Emergency Core Cooling Systems - Refueling Water Storage Tank.'' The changes
delete the minimum refueling water storage tank (RWST) solution temperature and increase the allowed outage time
(AOT) of the RWST for adjustment of boron concentration from 1 hour to 8 hours. Specifically, the minimum RWST temperature
requirement of TS 3.1.2.5b(3), TS 4.1.2.5b, and TS 4.5.5b would be deleted. TS 3/4.1.2.6 would be revised as follows:
(1) TS 3.1.2.6b, Action Statement b., and TS 4.1.2.6b, pertaining to the RWST, would be deleted. (2) Editorial changes
would be made to reflect the deletion of the RWST requirements. TS 3/4.5.5 would be revised as follows: the minimum
RWST temperature requirement of TS 3.5.5c would be deleted, and the action statement would be deleted and replaced
with two action statements. Action Statement a. would specify the requirements when the RWST is inoperable due to
boron concentration. The action statement would also provide 8 hours to restore the boron concentration to within
the required limits. If boron concentration is not restored within 8 hours, the action statement requires that the
unit be in hot standby within 6 hours and in cold shutdown within the following 30 hours. Action Statement b. would specify
the requirements when the RWST is inoperable due to reasons other than boron concentration. The associated Bases
would also be appropriately revised. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



a. Does the change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?

The increase in the RWST AOT does not alter the plant configuration or operation. The potential for the RWST boron concentration
to be outside the TS limits is small because the RWST and its contents are not involved with normal plant operation and
are not subject to process variations associated with plant operation. 
 
The potential causes of boron concentration deviation have been evaluated with the conclusion that any deviation
in RWST boron concentration would not be expected to increase significantly during the proposed 7 hour AOT increase.


The increase in the RWST AOT from 1 hour to 8 hours for reasons directly related to boron concentration does not have
a significant effect on the accident analyses.

The removal of the redundant statement of RWST requirements from TS 3.1.2.6 is an administrative change with no impact
on plant operation.

The removal of the minimum temperature limit for the RWST has no effect on the plant configuration or operation. The
removal of the temperature limits does not affect any accident analyses since evaluations have demonstrated that,
due to the moderate climate at DCPP, the RWST will not exceed the limits assumed in DCPP accident analyses.

Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.
 
b. Does the change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?

Increasing the RWST AOT from 1 hour to 8 hours for reasons directly related to boron concentration does not require
physical alteration to any plant system and does not change the method by which any safety-related system performs
its function.

The removal of the redundant statement of RWST requirements from TS 3.1.2.6 is an administrative change that does
not affect the design and operation of the plant.

Deletion of the RWST temperature has no impact on any accident analysis due to the moderate climate at DCPP. Additionally,
the deletion of the temperature does not require any physical alteration to the plant or change the method by which
any safety-related system performs its function.

Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.

c. Does the change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?

Increasing the RWST AOT for reasons directly related to boron concentration does not affect any accident analysis
assumptions, initial conditions, or results. The margins of safety reflected in the DCPP TS are not compromised by
the 7 hour AOT increase. Consequently, the proposed change does not have an effect on margin of safety.

The removal of the redundant statement of RWST requirements from TS 3.1.2.6 is an administrative change that does
not affect the requirements for the RWST nor alter its function.

The removal of the RWST temperature limits will not affect the assumptions of any accident analysis because the moderate
climate at DCPP will prevent the temperature assumptions in the analyses from being exceeded.

Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment requests involve no significant
hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

August 17, 1994 (Reference LAR 94-07) 


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendments would revise the combined Technical Specifications (TS) for the Diablo Canyon Power Plant
Unit Nos. 1 and 2 to relocate TS 3/4.4.2.1, ``Safety Valves - Shutdown,'' 3/4.4.7, ``Chemistry,'' 3/4.4.9.2, ``Pressurizer
(Temperature Limits),'' 3/4.4.10, ``Structural Integrity,'' and 3/4.4.11, ``Reactor Vessel Head Vents,'' in
accordance with the Commission's Final Policy Statement for relocation of current TS that do not satisfy any of the
screening criteria for retention. As part of the relocation of TS 3/4.4.2.1, TS 3/4.4.2.2, ``Safety Valves - Operating,''
would be revised to require that the pressurizer safety valves be operable in Mode 4 with the reactor coolant system
cold-leg temperature greater than the low-temperature overpressure protection system enable temperature, and
TS 6.8, ``Procedures and Programs,'' would be revised to include the reactor coolant pump flywheel inspection program.
The specific TS changes proposed are as follows:
(1)Technical Specifications (TS) 3/4.4.2.1 ``Safety Valves - Shutdown,'' 3/4.4.7, ``Chemistry,'' 3/4.4.9.2,
``Pressurizer (Temperature Limits),'' 3/4.4.10, ``Structural Integrity,'' 3/4.4.11, ``Reactor Vessel Head
Vents,'' and TS 6.8, ``Procedures and Programs,'' would be revised in accordance with the Commission's Final Policy
Statement on TS Improvements for Nuclear Power Reactors. 
(2)TS 3/4.4.2.2, ``Safety Valves - Operating,'' would be revised to require that the pressurizer safety valves be
operable in Mode 4 with the reactor coolant system cold-leg temperature greater than the low- temperature overpressure
protection system enable temperature. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



a. Do the changes involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?

The proposed changes simplify the TS, meet regulatory requirements for relocated TS, and implement the recommendations
of the Commission's Final Policy Statement on TS Improvements. Future changes to these requirements will be controlled
by 10 CFR 50.59. The proposed changes are administrative in nature and do not involve any modifications to any plant
equipment or affect plant operation.

Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.

b. Do the changes create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?

The proposed changes are administrative in nature, do not involve any physical alterations to any plant equipment,
and cause no change in the method by which any safety-related system performs its function.

Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.

c. Do the changes involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?



The proposed changes do not alter the basic regulatory requirements and do not affect any safety analyses. Therefore,
the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment requests involve no significant
hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

August 17, 1994 (Reference LAR 94-09)


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendments would revise the combined Technical Specifications (TS) for the Diablo Canyon Power Plant
(DCPP) Unit Nos. 1 and 2 to change TS 3/4.4.9.1, ``Reactor Coolant System - Pressure/Temperature Limits,'' Figures
3.4-2, ``Reactor Coolant System Heatup Limitations - Applicable Up to 8 EFPY,'' and 3.4-3, ``Reactor Coolant System
Cooldown Limitations - Applicable Up to 8 EFPY,'' to extend the applicability up to 12 effective full-power years
(EFPYs). TS 3/4.4.9.3, ``Overpressure Protection Systems,'' would be revised to specify a new low-temperature
overprotection (LTOP) system actuation pressure setpoint. The associated Bases would also be appropriately revised.
Additionally, TS 3/4.1.2.2, ``Flow Paths - Operating,'' TS 3/4.1.2.4, ``Charging Pumps - Operating,'' TS 3/4.4.1.3,
``Hot Shutdown,'' TS 3/4.4.1.4.1, ``Cold Shutdown - Loops Filled,'' TS 3/4.4.9.3, and TS 3/4.5.3, ``Tavg Less than
350 Degrees F,'' would be revised to specify a new LTOP system enable temperature. 
(1) In TS 3/4.4.9.1, Figure 3.4-2, ``Reactor Coolant System Heatup Limitations - Applicable Up to 8 EFPY,'' and Figure
3.4-3, ``Reactor Coolant System Cooldown Limitations - Applicable Up to 8 EFPY,'' are revised as follows:
(a) The ``Controlling Materials'' for the pressure/temperature curves are revised to reflect the current reactor
vessel beltline region limiting weld and plate materials. 
(b)The title for the figures is changed to reflect the applicability of the pressure/temperature curves for up to
12 EFPYs of service life.
(2) The proposed changes to TS 3/4.4.9.3 are as follows:
(a) The LTOP enable temperature would be changed from 323
 F to 270
 F to be consistent with Branch Technical Position (BTP) RSB 5-2, Revision 1, Branch Position B.2.
(b) LTOP system actuation pressure setpoint would be revised from less than or equal to 450 psig to less than or equal
to 435 psig.
(3) TS 3/4.1.2.2, TS 3/4.1.2.4, TS 3/4.4.1.3, TS 3/4.4.1.4.1, TS 3/4.4.9.3, and TS 3/4.5.3 would be revised to change
the LTOP enable temperature from 323
 F to 270
 F to be consistent with BTP RSB 5-2, Revision 1, Branch Position B.2. TS Bases 3/4.4.9.1 would be revised to delete
a reference to Table 4.4-5, ``Reactor Vessel Material Surveillance Program - Withdrawal Schedule.'' The table was
deleted from the TS in Amendments 54 and 53 issued in July 1990. Reference to the table in Bases 3/4.4.9 was inadvertently
not deleted. The information in this table is currently contained in the Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR) Update.

(4) TS Bases 3/4.4.9.3 would be revised to discuss limitations on reactor coolant pump (RCP) and emergency core cooling
system/chemical and volume control system pump operation during low reactor coolant system (RCS) temperature conditions.
(5) The other affected TS Bases would also be revised.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



a. Does the change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?

The proposed changes to Figures 3.4-2 and 3.4-3 of TS 3.4.9.1 and the associated Bases will extend the applicability
of the RCS heatup and cooldown pressure/temperature limits from 8 to 12 EFPY. Since the level of reactor vessel embrittlement
projected for 12 EFPY is bounded by that previously projected for 8 EFPY, the proposed changes will not impact the probability
of brittle fracture of the vessel, and consequently not impact the consequences of an accident. 

The present LTOP pressure setpoint was reviewed and found to be acceptable and conservative for the extension of the
pressure/temperature curves to 12 EFPY. However, as a result of issues unrelated to the change in the applicability
of the pressure/temperature curves, the LTOP actuation pressure setpoint is reduced. The change accounts for pressure
measurement error identified in NRC IN [Information Notice] 93-58, a time delay in the LTOP system actuation introduced
as part of the installation of the Eagle 21 protection system, and additional conservatism incorporated into the
DCPP LTOP analysis. The changes to the pressure setpoint are conservative and provide assurance that the maximum
cold RCS pressure will not be exceeded.

The proposed change to TS 3/4.1.2.2, 3/4.1.2.4, 3/4.4.1.3, 3/4.4.9.3, and 3/4.5.3 will revise the LTOP enable temperature
to be consistent with the methodology and definition of ``low temperature'' provided in BTP RSB 5-2 Revision 1. The
proposed changes do not involve physical alteration of the LTOP system or change the method by which the LTOP system
performs its function. The proposed changes will benefit DCPP by expanding the RCS pressure/temperature window,
thereby increasing operator flexibility during heatup and cooldown. This will decrease the probability of an accident
by decreasing the likelihood of an inadvertent PORV [power-operated relief valve] actuation.

Deletion of reference to Table 4.4-5 from TS Bases 3/4.4.9 is administrative in nature and does not affect plant operation.

Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.

b. Does the change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?

The proposed changes to TS 3.4.9.1 do not involve any physical alteration to any plant system or change the method by
which any safety-related system performs its function. The probability of catastrophic failure of the reactor vessel
will not be changed as a result of the extension of the curves to 12 EFPY. 
The present LTOP pressure setpoint was reviewed and found to be acceptable and conservative for the extension of the
pressure/temperature curves to 12 EFPY. However, as a result of issues unrelated to the change in the applicability
of the pressure/temperature curves, the LTOP actuation pressure setpoint is reduced. The change accounts for pressure
measurement error identified in IN 93-58, a time delay in the LTOP system actuation introduced as part of the installation
of the Eagle 21 protection system, and additional conservatism incorporated into the DCPP LTOP analysis. The changes
to the pressure setpoint are conservative and provide assurance that the maximum cold RCS pressure will not be exceeded.

The proposed change to TS 3/4.1.2.2, 3/4.1.2.4, 3/4.4.1.3, 3/4.4.9.3, and 3/4.5.3 will revise the LTOP enable temperature
to be consistent with the methodology and definitions provided in BTP RSB 5-2, Revision 1. Additionally, the proposed
changes will not affect the ability of the LTOP system to provide pressure relief at low temperatures, thereby maintaining
the LTOP design basis.

Deletion of reference to Table 4.4-5 from TS Bases 3/4.4.9 is administrative in nature and does not result in physical
alterations or changes to the operation of the plant.

Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.

c. Does the change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety? 
The proposed changes to TS 3.4.9.1 will extend the applicability of the RCS heatup and cooldown pressure/temperature
limits to 12 EFPY, but will not physically change these limits. The pressure/temperature limits have been determined
in accordance with 10 CFR 50, Appendix G, and include the safety margins with regard to brittle fracture required by
the ASME Code, Section III, Appendix G. The RT

ndt

s determined for the reactor vessels at 12 EFPY are lower than the values previously determined at 8 EFPY. Therefore,
there will be additional safety margin in the pressure/temperature limits with respect to Appendix G requirements.

The change in the LTOP pressure setpoint is conservative and provides assurance that the current margin of safety
is maintained. The proposed change to TS 3/4.1.2.2, 3/4.1.2.4, 3/4.4.1.3, 3/4.4.9.3, and 3/4.5.3, will revise the
LTOP enable temperature to be consistent with the methodology and definitions provided in BTP RSB 5-2, Revision 1,
which provides the requirements for reactor vessel overpressurization protection at low temperatures.

Deletion of reference to Table 4.4-5 from TS Bases 3/4.4.9 is an administrative change and does not involve any physical
alteration to the plant.

Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment requests involve no significant
hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

August 12, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The amendment would revise the Limiting Condition for Operation for the Emergency Core Cooling System specified
in Technical Specifications Section 3.5.1 and associated Bases Section 3.4.5.1 to include a new ACTION statement
in the event that the High Pressure Coolant Injection system and one Core Spray subsystem, and/or one Low Pressure
Coolant Injection subsystem, are inoperable.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. The proposed Technical Specifications (TS) change does not involve a significant increase in the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The proposed TS change does not involve any physical changes to plant systems or components, nor does it affect the
ability of the Low pressure Coolant Injection (LPCI) Core Spray (CS), and High Pressure Coolant Injection (HPCI)
systems to respond to an accident. These systems are not accident initiators, since their design function is accident
mitigation.

This proposed TS change, which only addresses equipment status, will not significantly increase the probability
of occurrence of an accident previously evaluated. The addition of the proposed ACTION statement enables the plant
not to implement TS Section 3.0.3, which requires a plant shutdown, when the HPCI system is inoperable in conjunction
with one (1) CS subsystem, and/or one (1) LPCI subsystem. The proposed TS change does not impact the operation of any
equipment important to safety. This proposed TS change does not make physical modifications to the plant or to equipment,
nor does it impact any design requirements of the HPCI, CS, and LPCI systems. The proposed TS change does not introduce
any failure mechanisms of a different type than those previously evaluated, since no physical changes are being made
to the facility. This proposed change will not create any new failure modes which would cause plant equipment to malfunction
more frequently than previously evaluated.

The basis for TS Sections 3.8.2.1 and 3.8.3.1, which specify that four (4) independent divisions of Safeguard dc electrical
power shall be operable, or shall be restored to operability with 8 hours, is to ensure that sufficient power is available
to supply safety-related equipment required to safely shut down the plant, and to provide for mitigation and control
of accident conditions at the plant. As discussed in Section 6.3.2 of the NRC Safety Evaluation Report (SER), i.e.,
NUREG-0991, ``Safety Evaluation Report Related to the Operation of Limerick Generating Station, Units 1 and 2,''
dated August 1983, the most limiting single failure for the Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS), which includes
all break sizes, is the failure of the dc power system common to the HPCI system, one (1) CS subsystem, and one (1) LPCI
subsystem. Only one (1) single failure is assumed to occur in the event of a Design Basis Accident (DBA). Therefore,
three (3) LPCI pumps, one (1) CS subsystem, and the Automatic Depressurization (ADS) system would be operable and
available, for use in the event of a DBA, to provide sufficient core cooling to safely shut down the plant. Although
the loss of Division 2 dc power specifically impacts the ``B'' LPCI and ``B'' CS, the analysis performed in the NRC SER
evaluates the number of ECCS available for use in a DBA. Since the amount of available core cooling is independent of
which loop of LPCI or CS is assumed to fail, this analysis is applicable to the loss of any division/loop of LPCI or CS.
Therefore, the loss of the HPCI system, one (1) CS subsystem, and/or one (1) LPCI subsystem is bounded by the existing
analysis. Since the loss of HPCI, one (1) CS subsystem, and/or one (1) LPCI subsystem is an analyzed condition, and
actions associated with TS Section 3.0.3 are related to unanalyzed conditions, the requirements of TS Section 3.0.3
are not applicable to this scenario. Adding an ACTION statement, as proposed, identical to the ACTION statement which
currently applies to the loss of Division 2 of Safeguard dc electrical power causes no change in the consequences of
any accidents previously evaluated. This proposed TS change does not impact systems, structures, and components
designed to mitigate the consequences of an accident. In the event of an accident, the plant configuration following
the event will be within the bounds of the existing analysis, and there will be no change in the radiological consequences
due to an accident.

Therefore, the proposed TS change does not involve an increase in the probability or consequences of an accident [previously]
evaluated.

2. The proposed TS change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.

The proposed TS change does not require any physical changes to plant systems or equipment, nor will it affect the ability
of the HPCI, CS, and LPCI systems from performing their design functions, which is to mitigate the consequences of
an accident. These systems do not contribute to the initiation of an accident, since their function is accident mitigation.
This proposed TS change will not introduce new equipment malfunction or failure modes. The proposed TS change will
not introduce any failure mechanisms of a different type than those previously evaluated. The existing design basis
for the plant, as described in Section 6.3.2.5 of the LGS Updated Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR) and Section 6.3.2
of the NRC SER, bounds the condition proposed by this TS Change Request. Section 6.3.2 of the NRC SER indicates that
the most limiting single failure for the ECCS is the loss of the dc system powering the HPCI, CS, and LPCI systems. Assuming
this failure, three (3) LPCI pumps, one (1) CS subsystem, and the ADS would still be operable and available, for use
in the event of a DBA, to ensure adequate core cooling to safely shut down the plant. Although the loss of Division 2 dc
power specifically affects ``B'' LPCI and ``B'' CS, the analysis performed in the NRC SER evaluates the number of ECCS
available for use in a DBA. Since the amount of available core cooling is independent of which loop of LPCI or CS is assumed
to fail, this analysis is applicable to the loss of any division/loop of LPCI or CS. Since the loss of HPCI, one (1) CS
subsystem, and/or one (1) LPCI subsystem, is an analyzed condition, and the actions associated with TS Section 3.0.3
pertain to unanalyzed conditions, the requirements of TS Section 3.0.3 do not apply to the condition proposed by this
TS Change Request.

Therefore, the proposed TS change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously
evaluated.

3. The proposed TS change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The proposed TS change [TS] does not involve any physical changes to the design or functional requirements of the LPCI,
CS, or HPCI systems. These systems will continue to function as designed to mitigate the consequences of an accident.


This proposed TS change involves adding an additional ACTION statement, and revising the associated supporting
Bases section, to specifically address the inoperability of the HPCI system in conjunction with the inoperability
of one (1) CS subsystem, and/or one (1) LPCI subsystem. These systems would be inoperable in the event of the loss of
Division 2 of the Safeguard dc electrical power supply. The Bases associated with Safeguard electrical power systems,
which provide power to equipment required to safely shutdown the plant and to mitigate consequences of an accident,
are unchanged. The proposed TS change involves adding an ACTION statement which is identical to the ACTION statement
which addresses the inoperability of Division 2 of Safeguard dc power, which is a condition analyzed in the LGS UFSAR
and NRC SER. Therefore, the proposed TS change to include an additional ACTION statement does not involve a reduction
in a margin of safety. 


The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Description of amendment request: 

This amendment would remove the 125/250 Vdc Class 1E Battery Load Cycle Table from Technical Specifications, which
is consistent with NUREG-1433, ``Standard Technical Specifications.''


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. The proposed TS change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.

This proposed change removes the repetitious 125/250 Vdc Class 1E Battery Load Cycle Table which is also found in the
LGS Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR). The proposed change to TS does not affect the requirement to perform
surveillance testing and the manner of performing surveillance testing is adequately described in plant procedures.
The UFSAR containing the Battery Load Cycle Table and station procedures are maintained using the provisions of 10
CFR 50.59 and are subject to the change control process in the Administrative Controls Section of the LGS TS Section
6.0. Since any future changes to these controlled documents will be evaluated per 10 CFR 50.59, no [changes] (significant
or insignificant) in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated will be allowed. Therefore,
this change will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.

2. The proposed TS change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.

This proposed change removes the repetitious 125/250 Vdc Class 1E Battery Load Cycle Table which is also found in the
LGS Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR). This change will not alter the plant configuration (no new or different
type of equipment will be installed) or make changes to methods governing normal plant operations. This change will
not impose different requirements and adequate control of information will be maintained. The manner of performing
surveillance testing can be adequately described in plant procedures. The proposed change will remove the table,
and will not alter assumptions made in the safety analysis and licensing basis. Therefore, this change will not create
the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
 
3. The proposed TS change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

This proposed change removes the repetitious 125/250 Vdc Class 1E Battery Load Cycle Table which is also found in the
LGS Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR). The change will not reduce the margin of safety since the location
of the Battery Table has no impact on any safety analysis assumptions. Since all Battery Load Table changes (i.e.,
UFSAR Changes) and procedure changes are evaluated per the requirements of 10 CFR 50.59, no reduction (significant
or insignificant) in the margin of safety will be allowed. Therefore, this change will not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety.

The existing requirements for NRC review and approval of revisions, in accordance with 10 CFR 50.90, to those details
and requirements proposed for deletion, do not have a specific margin of safety upon which to evaluate. However, since
the proposed change is consistent with the BWR Standard Technical Specifications (NUREG-1433), revising the TS
to reflect the approved level of detail and requirements ensures no reduction in the margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

August 5, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment incorporates line item Technical Specification improvements listed in Generic Letter 93-05
relevant to Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) surveillance requirements. The proposed amendment eliminates the
requirements to start EDGs with an inoperable offsite circuit(s) of AC electrical power and adds a provision that
eliminates required testing of the remaining EDGs when one EDG is inoperable due to an inoperable support system or
an independently testable component with no potential for common mode failure for the remaining EDGs. In addition,
if testing of the EDGs is required, then the surveillances will be performed within 16 hours instead of 24 hours as currently
specified.
The proposed amendment also deletes the requirement to perform a loss of offsite power (LOP) test following the 24-hour
EDG endurance run test. In its place, a hot restart test (no LOP load sequencing) will be established.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. Will not involve a significant increase in the probability or
 consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
LCR 94-10

The proposed changes in this License Change Request (LCR) have been extensively reviewed by the NRC during the preparation
of NUREG-1366 and Generic Letter 93-05, and by [Public Service Electric and Gas Company] PSE&G during the development
and approval of this LCR. The LCR revises the current ACTION statement of Technical Specification 3.8.1.1 to eliminate
testing of the unaffected Emergency Diesel Generators (EDGs) upon loss of an offsite power circuit(s) and/or an EDG.
The basis for this testing was originally to verify the reliability of the EDGs, however, as stated in NUREG-1366,
industry experience has shown that excessive testing of the EDGs has in fact reduced reliability.

The EDG design and function remain as previously analyzed and the EDG response during accident conditions is not affected.
This change will improve EDG performance by reducing the number of unnecessary starts and by requiring more appropriate
testing (within 16 hours instead of 24 hours) when there is a potential common mode failure.

These changes will not result in a significant increase in the probability or consequences of a previously evaluated
accident, nor will it result in a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

LCR 94-13

The proposed changes in this License Change Request (LCR) have been extensively reviewed by the NRC during the preparation
of NUREG-1366 and Generic Letter 93-05, and by PSE&G during the development and approval of this LCR. Regulatory
Guide 1.108, Rev. 1, states that the performance of a loss of Off-site Power (LOP) test (Surveillance Requirement
4.8.1.1.2.h.4.b) immediately following the 24 hour endurance run demonstrates that the Emergency Diesel Generator
(EDG) can start in the prescribed time when the EDG is at its normal operating temperature. The purpose of performing
the LOP test immediately following the 24 hour endurance run is to demonstrate the hot restart capability of the EDG
at full load conditions. However, demonstrating diesel generator hot restart capability without loading the engine
does not invalidate or reduce the effectiveness of the hot restart test. Performance of this test can be conducted
in any plant condition since its performance at power will have no adverse effect on plant operations.

The LOP test will continue to be performed at standby conditions to provide assurance that the EDG is capable of responding
to a LOP as assumed in the accident analyses.

EDG design and function remain as previously analyzed. Their response during accident conditions [is] not affected
by these changes. Therefore, no significant increase in the probability of an accident previously evaluated results
from these changes.

2. Will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

LCR 94-10
 
The elimination of the unnecessary EDG starts will not result in any change in plant configuration or operation. Therefore,
the proposed changes will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated or analyzed.

LCR 94-13

The proposed revisions to the Technical Specifications do not involve a physical change in any system configuration
and do not introduce new operating configurations. These changes will not result in any net reduction in testing and
will not affect EDG reliability. This test may be performed in any plant condition since its performance at power will
have no adverse effect on plant operations. Therefore, these changes do not create the possibility of a new or different
kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

3. Will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

LCR 94-10

The changes proposed in this LCR do not reduce the ability of any system or component to perform its safety related function.
The basis of NUREG-1366, Generic Letter 93-05 and the analysis performed in support of this LCR is that the reduction
in unnecessary EDG starts can improve safety by diminishing challenges to plant systems and reducing equipment wear
or degradation. These proposed changes involve only surveillance frequencies and do not change the method of performing
any surveillance. The operation of systems and equipment remains unchanged. Therefore, eliminating unnecessary
EDG starts does not involve a reduction in the margin of safety.

LCR 94-13

Surveillance testing per the proposed Technical Specifications would continue to demonstrate the ability of the
EDGs to perform their intended function of providing electrical power to the emergency safety systems needed to mitigate
design basis transients consistent with the plant safety analyses. The margin of safety demonstrated by the plant
safety analyses is therefore not affected by the proposed changes.
 


The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Description of amendment request: 

The proposed changes add a new statement (b) to Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.1.3.2.1, Rod Position Indication
Systems, and reletters the existing action statement (b) to (c). The new action (b) will read:



With two or more analog rod position indicators per bank inoperable, within one hour restore the inoperable rod position
indicator(s) to OPERABLE status or be in Hot Standby within the next 6 hours. A maximum of one rod position indicator
per bank may remain inoperable following the one hour, with Action (a) above being applicable from the original entry
time into the LCO. 





Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. Does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The request (both proposed changes) does not change any assumption or parameter assumed to function in any of the design/licensing
basis analysis, and therefore the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated are not increased.
The change, as described in section IB, [the addition of the new action statement] incorporates into the applicable
LCO the action statement which is already taken under technical specification 3.0.3, and does not alter the operator
response or response time.

2. Does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

The proposed change does not introduce any design or physical configuration changes to the facility which could create
new accident scenarios.

3. Does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

As stated in response to question number 1 above, the change does not change any assumption or parameter assumed to
function in any of the design/licensing basis analysis. No changes to the operator response or operator response
time is proposed, only that the response is now taken under the confines of the LCO.

Therefore, there is no reduction in any margin of safety from the proposed changes. 


The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

July 20, 1994, as supplemented September 20, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed change would modify the Virgil C. Summer Nuclear Station, Unit 1, (VCSNS) Technical Specifications
(TS) to allow alternative, equivalent testing of diesel fuel used in the emergency diesel generators (EDG). These
alternative methods are necessary due to recent changes in Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Regulations that
are designed to limit the use of high sulfur fuels. The licensee also proposes to modify the VCSNS TS by changing the
revision level of WCAP-10216-P-A, ``Relaxation of Constant Axial Offset Control - FQ Surveillance Technical Specification,''
referenced in TS 6.9.1.11. This pertains to the FQ(z) TS (TS 3.2.1 and 3.2.2) and is necessary since Westinghouse revised
their methodology in determining FQ(z).


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. The probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated is not significantly increased.

The change in testing methods for the EDG fuel oil has no impact on the probability or consequences of any design basis
accident. These tests have been determined to be equivalent to the previously approved testing methods and are needed
due to changes in the EPA's regulations regarding sulfur in motor vehicle fuels. The dye used to identify high sulfur
fuels will have no adverse affect on the performance of the EDG's. The proposed testing assures a continued high level
of quality of the diesel fuel received and stored on site. 

The change in revision level of a reference in TS section 6.9.1.11 has no impact on the probability of occurrence or
consequences of any design basis accident. All design and performance criteria will continue to be met and no new single
failure mechanisms will be created. The change in revision level for WCAP-10216-P-A does not involve any alterations
to plant equipment or procedures which could affect any operational modes or accident precursors. This change only
incorporates by reference, the methodology for determining the penalty to be used in calculating Core Operating
Limits. This methodology allows the penalty to be cycle specific and is primarily affected by the core configuration.
This penalty is used for normal operation and provides more conservatism to the core operation for the cycle.

2. [The proposed license amendment does not] create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any
accident previously evaluated.

The change in testing methods for the EDG fuel oil will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident
from any accident previously evaluated. These tests have been determined by the EPA and other organizations to be
equivalent to the previously approved testing methods. The effect of the blue dye, used to identify high sulfur fuels,
on the performance of the EDGs has been evaluated and determined to be insignificant. The testing proposed assures
a continued high level of quality for the diesel fuel received and stored on site. 
The change of revision level of a reference in TS section 6.9.1.11 has no impact on the probability of occurrence or
consequences of any design basis accident. All design and performance criteria will continue to be met and no new single
failure mechanisms will be created. The change in revision level for WCAP-10216-P-A does not involve any alterations
to plant equipment or procedures which could affect any operational modes or accident precursors. This change only
incorporates, by reference, the methodology for determining the penalty to be used in calculating Core Operating
Limits. This methodology allows the penalty to be cycle specific and is primarily affected by the core configuration.
This penalty is used for normal operation and provides more conservatism to the core operation for the cycle.

3. [The proposed license amendment does not] involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The change in testing methods for the EDG fuel oil will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The
proposed testing methods have been determined to be equivalent to the previously approved testing methods. The test
for sulfur assures that the sulfur content is within the allowable range for weight-percent. The test for color and
clarity assures that the fuel is relatively free of water and particulate contaminants. The proposed tests provide
at least an equivalent level of quality and repeatability for the fuel oil analysis, thus assuring that the margin
of safety is not reduced.

The change in revision level of a reference in TS section 6.9.1.11 does not change the proposed reload design or safety
analysis limits for each cycle reload core. The associated change to WCAP-10216-P-A due to the revision will be specifically
evaluated using approved reload design methods. The larger penalty actually provides for an increase in margin during
certain burnup ranges. Since the safety analysis limits are unaffected, and the cycle specific analysis will show
that the analysis limits are met, the change proposed will have no adverse impact on a margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment requests: 

July 28, 1994


Description of amendment requests: 

The licensee proposes revisions to Technical Specification (TS) 3.9.8.1, ``Shutdown Cooling and Coolant Circulation
-- High Water Level,'' TS 3.9.8.2, ``Shutdown Cooling and Coolant Circulation -- Low Water Level,'' and their Bases
to facilitate testing of low-pressure safety injection system components and permit additional flexibility in
scheduling maintenance on the shutdown cooling system. 

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. Will operation of the facility in accordance with this proposed change involve a significant increase in the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?



Response: No

Limiting Conditions for Operation (LCO) in Technical Specifications (TSs) 3.9.8.1 and 3.9.8.2 define the operability
requirements for the Shutdown Cooling (SDC) system during refueling operations (Mode 6) while the water level above
the top of the reactor vessel flange is at least 23 feet and less than 23 feet, respectively. The objective of these TSs
is to ensure that (1) sufficient cooling is available to remove decay heat, (2) the water in the reactor vessel is maintained
below 140 degrees Fahrenheit, and (3) sufficient coolant circulation is maintained in the reactor core to minimize
boron stratification leading to a boron dilution incident.

The proposed TS changes affect the current limits imposed while ensuring adherence to the basis of the TS. No plant
modifications are being made. The reactor cavity water level limitations and SDC system required operating times
are being changed based on plant specific calculations and the objectives of the TSs are being maintained.

(1) reduce the water level where two trains of SDC are required from 23 feet to 20 feet above the reactor pressure vessel
flange, 

In the Bases Section 3/4.9.8, it is stated that ``With the reactor vessel head removed and 23 feet of water above the
reactor pressure vessel flange, a large heat sink is available for core cooling, thus in the event of a failure of the
operating shutdown cooling train, adequate time is provided to initiate emergency procedures to cool the core.''

In the Bases for the New Standard Technical Specifications, ``NUREG 1432, Revision 0, dated September 30, 1992, Section
B 3.9.4 it is stated that; ``The 23 ft level was selected because it corresponds to the 23 ft requirement established
for fuel movement in LCO 3.9.6, ``Refueling Water Level.''

Southern California Edison (Edison) calculations show that there is a minimal difference in the time to boil due to
the 3-foot change in required water level. Therefore, adequate water is still available to mitigate the consequences
of losing SDC. 
 
(2) increase the time a required train of the SDC system may be removed from service from up to 1 hour per 8-hour period
to up to 2 hours per 8-hour period,

(3) allow the SDC system to be removed from service to allow testing of Low Pressure Safety Injection system components,

The proposed TS changes the time the SDC train may be removed from operation from up to 1 hour per 8-hour period to up to
2 hours per 8-hour period, and allows removal of the SDC train from operation for testing of the Low Pressure Safety
Injection (LPSI) system components as well as for core alterations in the vicinity of the hot legs. The proposed TS
change also imposes certain restrictions to ensure operating the SDC system in accordance with this proposed TS change
is of no safety significance. These restrictions are discussed separately below.

When securing the only operating train of the SDC system, the maximum Reactor Coolant System (RCS) temperature is
maintained less than or equal to 140 degrees Fahrenheit. The initial conditions and heatup rate are selected such
that the RCS temperature remains less than or equal to 140 degrees Fahrenheit during the test. Therefore, there is
ample margin to boiling. Typical initial temperatures are less than 100 degrees Fahrenheit. 

The water being injected by the LPSI system test is cool water from the Refueling Water Storage Tank (RWST) and will
increase the available inventory providing the heat sink by several inches. The two hours is sufficient time to align
the system to test, perform the test, and restore the train of SDC to operation prior to exceeding 140 degrees Fahrenheit.

No operations are permitted that would cause a reduction of the RCS boron concentration. This minimizes the probability
of an inadvertent boron dilution event. The use of adequately borated water for injection into the RCS during the test
provides assurance that the test itself cannot lead to a boron dilution event. When the SDC system is operating, the
minimum SDC flow rate of 2200 gpm imposed by TS 4.9.8.1 and TS 4.9.8.2 is sufficient to ensure complete mixing of the
boron within the RCS.

The LPSI component testing is only allowed when the reactor cavity water level is maintained greater than or equal
to 20 feet above the reactor pressure vessel flange. This level ensures an adequate heat sink to perform the LPSI pump
suction header check valve test.

(4) allow for running 1 train of shutdown cooling with additional requirements when the water level is less than 20
feet but greater than 12 feet above the reactor pressure vessel flange,

(5) add an action to be taken when operating 1 train of SDC with less than 20 feet above the reactor pressure vessel flange
when the specified requirements are not met,

In the event of a loss of SDC, the time to boil is reduced from approximately 3.7 hours when the water level is 23 feet above
the reactor vessel flange to approximately 2.3 hours at 12 feet, assuming the reactor has only been shutdown for 6 days.
However, this is ample time to close containment (less than 1 hour) and to restore SDC or initiate alternative cooling
(e.g., add water to the cavity (approximately 1 hour)). Twelve feet of water above the reactor vessel flange corresponds
to 24 feet 8-7/8 inches above the active fuel.

Requiring the reactor to be shutdown for at least 6 days to have only one train of SDC operable when the reactor cavity
level is between 20 feet and 12 feet above the reactor pressure vessel flange ensures that the time to boil is greater
than twice the time it would take us to establish containment closure and to commence reactor cavity fill with the required
standby equipment.

One train of SDC operating with a containment spray pump allows for the high capacity LPSI pump to be the main standby
pump capable of filling the reactor cavity to at least 20 feet above the reactor pressure vessel flange upon loss of
SDC. The high pressure safety injection pump will also be maintained ready to increase the water level if needed. In
support of this contingency the RWST will be required to contain the volume of water required to raise the level to 20
feet above the reactor vessel flange.... The reactor cavity can be filled at a rate of approximately 4.0 inches per
minute with the LPSI pump.

If operating one train of the SDC system with less than 20 feet of water above the reactor pressure vessel flange and
any of the required conditions are not met, requiring immediate action to establish greater than or equal to 20 feet
of water above the reactor pressure vessel flange ensures no time is wasted trying to restore conditions that should
be used to increase the volume of water of the heat sink. By taking action to restore the level to 20 feet above the reactor
pressure vessel flange the plant will be placed in TS 3.9.8.1, which only requires one train of SDC to be operable. Additionally,
the core will not heat up while the water level in the reactor cavity is being raised with cool water from the RWST. This
will provide additional time to either restore the one train of SDC or take other actions to provide core cooling.

A Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA), with (a) one train of the SDC system operable with the reactor cavity water
level greater than or equal to 12 feet above the reactor pressure vessel flange, and (b) one train of the SDC system operable
with the reactor cavity water level greater than or equal to 20 feet above the reactor pressure vessel flange, showed
that the operations in accordance with the proposed TS would not significantly increase the probabilities of inventory
boiling and core damage.

(6) delete the obsolete reference to the implementation of DCP 2-6863 and MMP 3-6863,

This is an editorial change.

(7) delete an obsolete footnote allowing removal of both trains of SDC with the water less than 23 feet above the reactor
vessel flange from the Unit 3 TSs.

This is an editorial change.

Therefore, proposed changes 1 through 7 do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences
of an accident.

2. Will operation of the facility in accordance with this proposed change create the possibility of a new or different
kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?

Response: No

(1) reduce the water level where two trains of SDC are required from 23 feet to 20 feet above the reactor pressure vessel
flange, 

(2) increase the time a required train of the SDC system may be removed from service from up to 1 hour per 8-hour period
to up to 2 hours per 8-hour period,

(3) allow the SDC system to be removed from service to allow testing of Low Pressure Safety Injection system components,

(4) allow for running 1 train of shutdown cooling with additional requirements when the water level is less than 20
feet but greater than 12 feet above the reactor pressure vessel flange,

(5) add an action to be taken when operating 1 train of SDC with less than 20 feet above the reactor pressure vessel flange
when the specified requirements are not met,

The Limiting Conditions for Operation (LCO) in Technical Specifications (TSs) 3.9.8.1 and 3.9.8.2 define the operability
requirements for the SDC system during refueling operations (Mode 6) while the water level above the top of the reactor
vessel flange is at least 23 feet and less than 23 feet, respectively. The objective of the proposed TS changes is to
ensure that the intent of the Bases is maintained. [i.e., (1) sufficient cooling is available to remove decay heat,
(2) water in the reactor vessel is maintained below 140 degrees Fahrenheit, and (3) sufficient coolant circulation
is maintained in the reactor core to minimize boron stratification leading to a boron dilution incident.]

The proposed TS changes affect the current limits imposed while ensuring adherence to the basis of the TS. No plant
modifications are being made. The reactor cavity water level limitations and SDC system required operating times
are being changed based on plant specific calculations and the objective of the TSs are being maintained. The added
requirements and action statement facilitate safe operation.

(6) delete the obsolete reference to the implementation of DCP 2-6863 and MMP 3-6863, and

This is an editorial change.

(7) delete an obsolete footnote allowing removal of both trains of SDC with the water less than 23 feet above the reactor
vessel flange from the Unit 3 TSs.

This is an editorial change.

Therefore, the operation of the facility in accordance with proposed changes 1 through 7 does not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 
3. Will operation of the facility in accordance with this proposed change involve a significant reduction in a margin
of safety?

Response: No 
Limiting Conditions for Operation (LCO) in TSs 3.9.8.1 and 3.9.8.2 define the operability requirements for the SDC
system during refueling operations (Mode 6) while the water level above the top of the reactor vessel flange is at least
23 feet and less than 23 feet, respectively. The objective of these TSs is to ensure that (1) sufficient cooling is available
to remove decay heat, (2) the water in the reactor vessel is maintained below 140 degrees Fahrenheit, and (3) sufficient
coolant circulation is maintained in the reactor core to minimize boron stratification leading to a boron dilution
incident.

(1) reduce the water level where two trains of SDC are required from 23 feet to 20 feet above the reactor pressure vessel
flange, 

In the Bases Section 3/4.9.8, it is stated that ``With the reactor vessel head removed and 23 feet of water above the
reactor pressure vessel flange, a large heat sink is available for core cooling, thus in the event of a failure of the
operating shutdown cooling train, adequate time is provided to initiate emergency procedures to cool the core.''

In the Bases for the New Standard Technical Specifications, ``NUREG 1432, Revision 0, dated September 30, 1992, Section
B 3.9.4 it is stated that: ``The 23 ft level was selected because it corresponds to the 23 ft requirement established
for fuel movement in LCO 3.9.6, ``Refueling Water Level.''

Edison calculations show that there is a minimal difference in the time to boil due to the 3-foot change in required
water level. Therefore, the margin of safety has not been significantly reduced. 

(2) increase the time a required train of the SDC system may be removed from service from up to 1 hour per 8-hour period
to up to 2 hours per 8-hour period,

(3) allow the SDC system to be removed from service to allow testing of Low Pressure Safety Injection system components,

The proposed TS changes the time the SDC train may be removed from operation from up to 1 hour per 8-hour period to up to
2 hours per 8-hour period, and allows removal of the SDC train from operation for testing of the LPSI system components
as well as for core alterations in the vicinity of the hot legs. The proposed TS change also imposes certain restrictions
to ensure operating the SDC system in accordance with this proposed TS change is of no safety significance. These restrictions
are discussed separately below.

When securing the only operating train of the SDC system, the maximum RCS temperature is maintained less than or equal
to 140 degrees Fahrenheit. The initial conditions and heatup rate are selected such that RCS temperature remains
less than or equal to 140 degrees Fahrenheit during the test. Therefore, there is ample margin to boiling. Typical
initial temperatures are less than 100 degrees Fahrenheit. 

The water being injected by the LPSI system test is cool water from the RWST and will increase the available inventory
providing the heat sink by several inches. The two hours is sufficient time to align the system to test, perform the
test, and restore the train of SDC to operation prior to exceeding 140 degrees Fahrenheit.

No operations are permitted that would cause a reduction of the RCS boron concentration. This minimizes the probability
of an inadvertent boron dilution event. The use of adequately borated water for injection into the RCS during the test
provides assurance that the test itself cannot lead to a boron dilution event. When the SDC system is operating, the
minimum SDC flow rate of 2200 gpm is sufficient to ensure complete mixing of the boron within the RCS.

The LPSI component testing is only allowed when the reactor cavity water level is maintained greater than or equal
to 20 feet above the reactor pressure vessel flange. This level ensures an adequate heat sink to perform the LPSI pump
suction header check valve test.

The added requirements and the nature of the test provide assurances that the water temperature will be maintained
less than 140 degrees Fahrenheit and that boron stratification is prevented.

(4) allow for running 1 train of shutdown cooling with additional requirements when the water level is less than 20
feet but greater than 12 feet above the reactor pressure vessel flange,

(5) add an action to be taken when operating 1 train of SDC with less than 20 feet above the reactor pressure vessel flange
when the specified requirements are not met,

In the event of a loss of SDC, the time to boil is reduced from approximately 3.7 hours at 23 feet to approximately 2.3
hours at 12 feet, when the reactor has only been shutdown for 6 days. However, this is ample time to close containment
(less than 1 hour), and to restore SDC or initiate alternative cooling (e.g., add water to the cavity (approximately
1 hour)).

Requiring the reactor to be shutdown for at least 6 days to have only one train of SDC operable when the reactor cavity
level is between 20 feet and 12 feet above the reactor pressure vessel flange ensures that the time to boil is greater
than twice the time it would take us to establish containment closure and to commence reactor cavity fill with the required
standby equipment.

One train of SDC operating with a containment spray pump allows for the high capacity LPSI pump to be the main standby
pump capable of filling the reactor cavity to at least 20 feet above the reactor pressure vessel flange upon loss of
SDC. The high pressure safety injection pump will also be maintained ready to increase the water level if needed. In
support of this contingency the RWST will be required to contain the volume of water required to raise the level to 20
feet above the reactor vessel flange. The reactor cavity can be filled at a rate of approximately 4.0 inches per minute
with the LPSI pump.

If operating one train of the SDC system with less than 20 feet of water above the reactor pressure vessel flange and
any of the required conditions are not met, requiring immediate action to establish greater than or equal to 20 feet
of water above the reactor pressure vessel flange ensures no time is wasted trying to restore conditions that should
be used to increase the volume of water of the heat sink. By taking action to restore the level to 20 feet above the reactor
pressure vessel flange the plant will be placed in TS 3.9.8.1, which only requires one train of SDC to be operable. Additionally,
the core will not heat up while the reactor cavity water level is being raised with cool water from the RWST. This will
provide additional time to either restore the one train of SDC or take other actions to provide core cooling.

A PRA showed that the operations in accordance with the proposed TS did not significantly increase the probabilities
of inventory boiling and core damage. 

(6) delete the obsolete reference to the implementation of DCP 2-6863 and MMP 3-6863,

This is an editorial change.

(7) delete an obsolete footnote allowing removal of both trains of SDC with the water less than 23 feet above the reactor
vessel flange from the Unit 3 TSs.

This is an editorial change.

Therefore, operation of the facility in accordance with proposed changes 1 through 7 do not involve a significant
reduction in a margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment requests involve no significant
hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

September 9, 1994 (TS 94-04)


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed change would revise specifications associated with the cold leg accumulators (CLAs). Specifically,
the proposed amendment would: (1) remove a footnote from Specification 3.5.1.1.c that applied to Unit 2 Cycle 6 operation
only; (2) add a requirement to Specification 3.5.1.1 that power be removed from the CLA isolation valve when the reactor
coolant system pressure is above 2000 psig; (3) modify Specification 3.5.1.1 Action Statement a. to indicate that
with a CLA inoperable for reasons other than the boron concentration not being within limits, the CLA must be returned
to operable status within 1 hour or the plant placed in the hot standby condition, and the pressurizer pressure reduced
to 1000 psig or less within the next 6 hours; (4) modify Specification 3.5.1.1 Action Statement b. to indicate that
with a CLA inoperable because the boron concentration is not within limits, the boron concentration must be restored
to within limits within 72 hours or the plant placed in the hot standby condition within the next 6 hours and 
the pressurizer pressure reduced to 1000 psig or less within the next 6 hours; (5) remove the wording from Specification
4.5.1.1.1.a.1 for using the absence of alarms or level measurement as the technique used to verify CLA volume and pressure;
(6) add the requirement to Specification 4.5.1.1.1.a.2 to verify that the CLA isolation valve is ``fully open'' rather
than ``open;'' (7) modify Specification 4.5.1.1.1.b to show that verification of boron concentration is not required
for additions from the refueling water storage tank, and add a footnote to indicate that the verification is required
only if the affected accumulator experienced a volume increase; (8) modify Specification 4.5.1.1.1.c to show that
the test is satisfied by verifying that power is removed from the isolation valve, not that the valve operator is disconnected
by removal of the breaker from the circuit; (9) delete Specification 4.5.1.1.1.d to verify that each CLA isolation
valve opens automatically when reactor coolant pressure exceeds the P-11 setpoint, and upon receipt of a safety injection
signal; (10) delete Specification 4.5.1.1.2 to verify the accumulator water level and pressure channels operable
by performing Channel Functional and Calibration tests, and delete the related footnote; (11) change ``tanks''
to ``each cold leg injection accumulator;'' and (12) revise the associated Bases where necessary to reflect these
changes.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



TVA has evaluated the proposed technical specification (TS) change and has determined that it does not represent
a significant hazards consideration based on criteria established in 10 CFR 50.92(c). Operation of Sequoyah Nuclear
Plant (SQN) in accordance with the proposed amendment will not:

1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The proposed changes to TS 3.5.1.1 implement revised action times for cold leg injection accumulator (CLA) inoperability.
Several other clarifications and enhancements have been incorporated to provide consistency with the latest version
of standard TSs (NUREG-1431). The new action times provide a prompt one-hour action to initiate unit shutdown for
conditions that could prevent the injection of a CLA into the core. For boron concentration outside limits, a 72-hour
action to restore CLA concentration is allowed because the CLA can still perform the core injection safety function.
The removal of surveillance requirements (SRs) for verifying automatic opening features for the CLA isolation valves
does not impact the required TS alignment that is assumed in the safety analysis. The instrumentation calibration
and functional test SRs have also been removed based on the instrumentation only providing CLA level and pressure
indications for TS compliance and not performing an accident mitigation function. The above changes do not alter
the required limits for CLA operability or system configurations. These changes are consistent with NUREG-1431
and provide acceptable flexability[sic] for CLA operability verification and surveillance testing and reasonable
actions for CLA inoperability. Since no changes have been proposed that would change the conditions assumed for the
CLAs in the accident analysis, the consequences of an accident will not be increased. The CLAs perform accident mitigation
functions and are not considered to be the source of an accident. Therefore, since the plant configurations and functions
are unchanged by the proposed changes, the probability of an accident will not be increased. 
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed.
 
The proposed changes clarify existing CLA operability requirements, modify action times for CLA inoperability,
enhance and simplify SRs, and remove surveillances that are not required to verify the CLA's ability to perform safety
functions. None of these changes affect the operation of the plant or the CLA configuration and accident mitigation
capabilities. Therefore, since the CLAs will continue to support the plant as before, these proposed changes will
not create a new or different kind of accident.

3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The CLA requirements for volume, pressure, boron, and isolation valve position are not changed by the proposed request.
The CLAs will continue to provide the same safety function capabilities as assumed in the safety analysis. Therefore,
no reduction in the margin of safety will result from these chanes because CLA functions are unchanged.



The NRC has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant

Date of amendment request: 

September 9, 1994 (TS 94-08) 


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed change would add ``main steam vaults'' to the footnote of Surveillance Requirement 4.6.1.1. This would
allow inspection of the valves, blind flanges, and deactivated automatic valves located in the vaults that are required
to be in the closed position during accident conditions and that are locked, sealed, or otherwise secured in the closed
position, on a cold shutdown frequency rather than every 31 days.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



TVA has evaluated the proposed technical specification (TS) change and has determine that it does not represent a
significant hazards consideration based on criteria established in 10 CFR 50.93(c). Operation of Sequoyah Nuclear
Plant (SQN) in accordance with the proposed amendment will not:

1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The proposed change will exempt containment isolation valves in the east and west main steam valve vaults from examination
every thirty one days if those valves are locked, sealed or otherwise secured. The valves and flanges that are located
inside the main steam valve vaults and are required to be closed during accident conditions, will be verified in their
required position during cold shutdown and will be secured in this position. The environmental conditions in these
areas ensure they will be low traffic areas where the probability of misalignment or manipulation is remote. Loss
of containment integrity is not considered to be an initiator of any accident. This change does not affect any accident
analysis assumptions or results for SQN. Therefore, there is no increase in the probability or consequences of an
accident previously evaluated, as a result of this change.

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed.

This revision will not change any plant equipment, system configurations, or accident assumptions. The appropriate
components in the valve vaults will continue to be verified in the closed position and locked, sealed, or otherwise
secured. The physical congestion and high temperatures in the area will be effective in maintaining this as a low traffic
area that will contribute to the low probability of misalignment or manipulation of these components between inspections.
Therefore, this change will not affect the safety function of these components and will not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident.

3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The proposed change is consistent with current SQN accident analysis assumptions since only the time interval between
performances of the surveillance is being extended. This change will not impact any margin of safety.



The NRC has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

Virginia Electric and Power Company, Docket Nos. 50-280 and 50-281, Surry Power Station, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, Surry County,
Virginia




Date of amendment request: 

July 14, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed changes to the Technical Specifications would remove the remaining references to cycle-specific parameters
in Technical Specification 3.12.A.2 and associated Technical Specification Figures 3.12-1A and 1B. These figures
and the control bank insertion limits are presently specified in the Core Operating Limits Report (COLR). The NRC-approved
methodologies presently listed in the Technical Specifications are used to calculate and evaluate the parameter
limits presented in the COLR for each reload core.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



Specifically, operation of Surry Power Station in accordance with the Technical Specification changes will not:

1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The removal
of the remaining reference to cycle-specific core operating limits and Technical Specification Figures 3.12-1A
and 1B, from the Surry Technical Specifications has no influence or impact on the probability or consequences of any
accident previously evaluated. The proposed amendment is administrative in nature in that it corrects omissions
from a previously approved amendment. This change has no impact on actions to be taken when or if limits are exceeded
as is required by the current Technical Specifications. Each accident analysis addressed in the Surry UFSAR [Updated
Final Safety Analysis Report] will be examined with respect to changes in cycle-dependent parameters, which are
determined by application of NRC-approved reload design methodologies. The impact of these parameter changes on
transient results is then evaluated to ensure that the results remain bounded by respective transient analysis acceptance
criteria. This examination, which is performed per the requirements of 10 CFR 50.59, ensures that future reloads
will not involve an increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The removal
of the remaining reference to cycle-specific core operating limits and Technical Specification Figures 3.12-1A
and 1B has no influence or impact, nor does it contribute in any way to the probability or consequences of any accident
previously evaluated. No safety-related equipment, safety function, or plant operating characteristic will be
altered as a result of the proposed changes. This cycle-specific variable (control bank insertion limits) is calculated
using NRC approved methods, and the results are submitted to the NRC for information in accordance with Technical
Specification 6.2. The Technical Specifications will continue to require operation within the required core operating
limits, and appropriate actions will be taken when or if any of these limits are exceeded. Therefore, the proposed
amendment does not in any way create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.

3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The margin of safety is not affected by this administrative
change which removes the remaining reference to cycle-specific core operating limits and Technical Specification
Figures 3.12-1A and 1B from the Technical Specifications. The margin of safety presently provided by current Technical
Specifications remains unchanged. Appropriate measures exist to control the values of these cycle-specific limits.
The proposed amendment continues to require operation within the core limits which were developed from the NRC-approved
reload design methodologies. Further, the actions to be taken when or if limits are violated remain unchanged. Development
of limits for future reloads will continue to conform to those methods described in NRC-approved documentation.
In addition, each reload requires a 10 CFR 50.59 safety review to assure that operation of the unit within the cycle-specific
limits will not involve a reduction in any margin of safety. Therefore, the proposed changes are administrative in
nature and do not impact the operation of Surry in a manner that involves a reduction in a margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

September 6, 1994 


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed changes would revise the Technical Specifications (TS) for Surry 1&2 and North Anna 1&2. Specifically,
the proposed changes would revise the: (1) Management Safety Review Committee (MSRC) review responsibilities regarding
safety evaluations and Station Nuclear Safety and Operating Committee (SNSOC) meeting minutes and reports, and
(2) SNSOC review responsibilities for procedure changes. However, the changes now also state that the MSRC will review
safety evaluations, and the SNSOC will review procedure changes, as programmatically discussed in the Updated Final
Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR).
The licensee's proposed changes revise and supersede the licensee's original proposed changes dated December 27,
1993 and noticed in the 

Federal Register 

on February 16, 1994, (59 FR 7700) for NA-1&2, and 
March 16, 1994 (59 FR 12371) for Surry 1 & 2.
The North Anna and Surry Power Station Technical Specifications presently address the organization and responsibilities
of both the onsite and offsite review groups, the SNSOC and the MSRC, respectively. The responsibilities of the SNSOC
include the review of new procedures and changes to procedures that affect nuclear safety. The MSRC review responsibilities
include the review of safety evaluations and SNSOC meeting minutes and reports. It is proposed that the extent of these
review activities be revised in the Technical Specifications to ensure the two review groups are focusing on nuclear
safety issues and not spending an unnecessary amount of time on administrative activities of minimal safety significance.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



[Specifically, operation in accordance with the proposed Technical Specifications changes] will not:

1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. As administrative
changes, the proposed Technical Specifications changes have no direct or indirect effect on accident precursors.
No plant modifications are being implemented and operation of the plant is unchanged. SNSOC review of new procedures
and procedure changes that require a safety evaluation ensures that activities that could affect nuclear safety
are being properly reviewed. The MSRC's overview of representative samples of safety evaluations and SNSOC meeting
minutes and reports based on performance ensures these programs are being properly implemented and nuclear safety
is not being compromised; or 

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated since physical
modifications are not involved and systems and components will be operated as before the change. The proposed changes
are wholly administrative in nature and have no impact on plant operations or accident considerations. These changes
modify the scope of SNSOC review of procedure changes and MSRC's review functions concerning safety evaluations
and SNSOC meeting minutes and reports. Procedure changes will continue to receive management review in accordance
with administrative procedures, however, only changes that require a safety evaluation will require SNSOC approval.
MSRC review of representatives samples of safety evaluations and SNSOC meeting minutes and reports based on performance
will continue to provide adequate assurance that nuclear safety is being properly considered; or 

3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety as defined in the basis of any Technical Specification since
the responsibilities of the SNSOC and MSRC are not addressed by the existing Technical Specification Bases, nor are
review requirements for procedures. The proposed changes are administrative in nature and have no impact on, nor
were they considered in, existing UFSAR accident analyses. Safety significant procedure changes, i.e., changes
that require a safety evaluation to be prepared, will continue to be reviewed by SNSOC, as will new procedures. Procedure
changes still require cognizant management approval and preparation of an activity screening to determine whether
or not the change impacts nuclear safety. This ensures activities important to nuclear safety are being appropriately
reviewed. The effectiveness of the safety evaluation program, and the thoroughness of SNSOC meetings and reports
will be assured through the MSRC's plant overview function which is based on observed performance.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

Wisconsin Public Service Corporation, Docket No. 50-305, Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant, Kewaunee County, Wisconsin




Date of amendment request: 

August 24, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant (KNPP) Technical Specification (TS) 3.1.b.1 and
Figure TS 3.1-4 regarding Low Temperature Overpressure (LTOP) protection for the reactor coolant pressure boundary.
Currently, the TS specify the LTOP requirements through the end of operating cycle 20 or 17.14 effective full power
years. The proposed change extends the LTOP requirements through the end of operating cycle 21 or 18.40 effective
full power years. The Basis Section would also be modified to reflect these changes.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration
which is presented below:



The proposed change was reviewed in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR 50.92 to show no significant hazards exist.
The proposed change will not: 
1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 

The use of RG 1.99, Revision 2, Regulatory Position C.2 does not modify the reactor coolant system pressure boundary,
nor make any physical changes to the facility design, material, construction standards, or setpoints. The probability
of a LTOP event occurring is independent of the pressure temperature limits for the RCS pressure boundary. Therefore,
the probability of a LTOP event occurring remains unchanged.

The use of predicted fluence values through the end of operating cycle 21 is appropriately considered within the calculations
in accordance with standard industry methodology previously docketed under WCAP 13227. Revised flux values were
used for Cycles 16, 17, 18 and 19 based on actual core reload designs. Previous cycles flux values are the same as reported
in WCAP 12333.

The calculation of pressure temperature limits in accordance with approved regulatory methods provides assurance
that reactor pressure vessel fracture toughness requirements are met and the integrity of the RCS pressure boundary
is maintained. Similar methodology was used in calculations to support approved amendment 108 to the Kewaunee Technical
Specifications dated April 7, 1994.

The use of Regulatory Position C.2 and fluence values through EOC 21 meet previously established criteria for protection
of the health and safety of the public. The consequences of a LTOP transient therefore, remain unchanged.

2) create the possibility of a new or different type of accident from an accident previously evaluated.

The use of Regulatory Position C.2 and fluence through EOC 21 does not modify the reactor coolant system pressure boundary,
nor make any physical changes to the LTOP setpoint or system design.

Therefore, no new failure mechanisms are created that could create the possibility of an accident of a new or different
type.

3) involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

The Appendix G pressure temperature limitations are calculated in accordance with regulatory requirements and
calculational limitations specified in RG 1.99, Revision 2. RG 1.99, Revision 2, is an acceptable method for implementing
the requirements of 10 CFR 50 Appendices G and H. Similar methodology was used in calculations to support approved
amendment 108 dated April 7, 1994. The reactor coolant pump starting restrictions of TS 3.1.a.1.c remain in place.

The revised calculations meet the NRC acceptance criteria for the LTOP setpoint and system design as described in
NRC Safety Evaluation Report (SER) dated September 6, 1985 which concluded that ``the spectrum of postulated pressure
transients would be mitigated...such that the temperature pressure limits of Appendix G to 10 CFR 50 are maintained.''

The use of Regulatory Position C.2, meets previously established criteria for the pressure temperature limits for
the LTOP system and setpoint. Thus, the margin of safety as described in the NRC SER is not reduced. 


The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

September 7, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant (KNPP) Technical Specifications (TS) by adding
two new sections, TS Section 3.0 and TS Section 4.0, with associated bases. TS Section 3.0 would establish the general
requirements applicable to each of the Limiting Conditions for Operation (LCOs) within Section 3 of the KNPP TS. TS
Section 4.0 would establish the general requirements applicable to Surveillance Requirements. The new requirements
of TS 4.0.b would also affect TS Sections 4.5, 4.6, 4.7, and Tables TS 4.1-2 and 4.1-3. The proposed TS amendment incorporates
guidance statements similar to Section 3.0/4.0 of NUREG-0452, ``Standard Technical Specifications for Westinghouse
Pressurized Water Reactors.''


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration
which is presented below:



The proposed changes were reviewed in accordance with the provision of 10 CFR 50.92 to show no significant hazards
exist. The proposed changes will not:

1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 

The likelihood that an accident will occur is neither increased or decreased by these TS changes. These TS changes
will not impact the function or method of operation of plant equipment. Thus, there is not a significant increase in
the probability of a previously analyzed accident due to these changes. No systems, equipment, or components are
affected by the proposed changes. Thus, the consequences of the malfunction of equipment important to safety previously
evaluated in the Updated Safety Analysis Report (USAR) are not increased by these changes.

The proposed changes have no impact on accident initiators or plant equipment, and thus, do not affect the probabilities
or consequences of an accident.

These changes are consistent with the requirements established in the Westinghouse STS. Therefore, the proposed
changes will not significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
 
The proposed TS changes would not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. The proposed changes do not involve changes to the physical plant or operations. Since these changes do
not contribute to accident initiation, they do not produce a new accident scenario or produce a new type of equipment
malfunction. Also, these changes do not alter any existing accident scenarios; they do not affect equipment or its
operation, and thus, do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident.

3) involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed TS would not involve a significant reduction in a margin
of safety. The proposed changes do not affect plant equipment or operation. Safety limits and limiting safety system
settings are not affected by these proposed changes. These changes are consistent with the Westinghouse STS.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Notice Of Issuance Of Amendments To Facility Operating Licenses And Final Determination Of No Significant Hazards
Consideration And Opportunity For A Hearing (Exigent Public Announcement Or Emergency Circumstances)



During the period since publication of the last biweekly notice, the Commission has issued the following amendments.
The Commission has determined for each of these amendments that the application for the amendment complies with the
standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations.
The Commission has made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the Commission's rules and regulations in
10 CFR Chapter I, which are set forth in the license amendment. 
Because of exigent or emergency circumstances associated with the date the amendment was needed, there was not time
for the Commission to publish, for public comment before issuance, its usual 30-day Notice of Consideration of Issuance
of Amendment, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing. 
For exigent circumstances, the Commission has either issued a 

Federal Register 

notice providing opportunity for public comment or has used local media to provide notice to the public in the area
surrounding a licensee's facility of the licensee's application and of the Commission's proposed determination
of no significant hazards consideration. The Commission has provided a reasonable opportunity for the public to
comment, using its best efforts to make available to the public means of communication for the public to respond quickly,
and in the case of telephone comments, the comments have been recorded or transcribed as appropriate and the licensee
has been informed of the public comments.
In circumstances where failure to act in a timely way would have resulted, for example, in derating or shutdown of a
nuclear power plant or in prevention of either resumption of operation or of increase in power output up to the plant's
licensed power level, the Commission may not have had an opportunity to provide for public comment on its no significant
hazards consideration determination. In such case, the license amendment has been issued without opportunity for
comment. If there has been some time for public comment but less than 30 days, the Commission may provide an opportunity
for public comment. If comments have been requested, it is so stated. In either event, the State has been consulted
by telephone whenever possible.
Under its regulations, the Commission may issue and make an amendment immediately effective, notwithstanding the
pendency before it of a request for a hearing from any person, in advance of the holding and completion of any required
hearing, where it has determined that no significant hazards consideration is involved. 
The Commission has applied the standards of 10 CFR 50.92 and has made a final determination that the amendment involves
no significant hazards consideration. The basis for this determination is contained in the documents related to
this action. Accordingly, the amendments have been issued and made effective as indicated. 
Unless otherwise indicated, the Commission has determined that these amendments satisfy the criteria for categorical
exclusion in accordance with 10 CFR 51.22. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(b), no environmental impact statement
or environmental assessment need be prepared for these amendments. If the Commission has prepared an environmental
assessment under the special circumstances provision in 10 CFR 51.12(b) and has made a determination based on that
assessment, it is so indicated.
For further details with respect to the action see (1) the application for amendment, (2) the amendment to Facility
Operating License, and (3) the Commission's related letter, Safety Evaluation and/or Environmental Assessment,
as indicated. All of these items are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the
Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room for the particular
facility involved. 
The Commission is also offering an opportunity for a hearing with respect to the issuance of the amendment. By November
14, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility
operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as
a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests for
a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition
for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated
by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or
petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or
an appropriate order. 
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above. 
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party. 
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. Since the Commission has made a final determination that the amendment
involves no significant hazards consideration, if a hearing is requested, it will not stay the effectiveness of the
amendment. Any hearing held would take place while the amendment is in effect. 
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).
The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023 and the following message addressed
to 

(Project Director)

: petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number
of this 

Federal Register 

notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. 
Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for a hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the factors
specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d).

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR WASTE TECHNICAL REVIEW BOARD</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>NWTRB/DOE Meeting on Thermal Management for a High-Level Waste Repository</DOCTITLE>


Pursuant to its authority under section 5051 of Public Law 100-203, the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act
of 1987, the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board's Hydrogeology & Geochemistry Panel and Structural Geology
& Geoengineering Panel will hold a joint meeting with the Department of Energy (DOE) on Thursday, November 17,
and Friday, November 18, 1994, in Washington D.C. The meeting will be held at the Dupont Plaza Hotel, 1500 New Hampshire
Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20036; Tel (800) 841-0003 or (202) 483-6000; Fax (202) 328-3265. The
meeting, which is open to the public, will run from 8:00 A.M. to 5:00 P.M. on Thursday, November 17, then continue on
Friday, November 18, from 8:00 A.M. to noon.
The purpose of the meeting is to review thermal management issues related to the high-level radioactive waste repository
proposed for Yucca Mountain, Nevada. Primary issues to be discussed at the meeting are the DOE's emerging waste isolation
strategy, the key thermal decisions to be made and the decision-making process involved, and potential programmatic
risks related to the DOE's thermal management strategy. Representatives from the DOE, its contractors, and other
organizations have been invited to participate.
Issues to be discussed on the first day include alternative thermal management strategies and the Yucca Mountain
site thermal response. A round-table discussion will close the first day's activities. On the second day, participants
will define and discuss the in-situ thermal testing needs and techniques for analyzing the performance of the proposed
repository and the process for making a thermal management decision. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has been
invited to present its perspective on various safety issues. A wrap-up session with summary presentations from participants
will end the meeting at noon.
The Nuclear Waste Technical Review Broad was created in the 1987 Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act to evaluate the
technical and scientific activities of the DOE's civilian radioactive waste management program, including site
characterization, storage, and transport. A site at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, currently is being characterized by
the DOE for its suitability as the possible location of a permanent repository for civilian spent fuel and defense
high-level waste.
Transcripts of the meeting will be available on computer disk or on a library-loan basis in paper format from Victoria
Reich, Board librarian, beginning December 30, 1994. For further information, contact Frank Randall, External
Affairs, Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, 1100 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 910, Arlington, Virginia 22209; (703)

Applicants' Representations



1. First ING Life is a stock life insurance company organized under the laws of New York, and is the depositor and sponsor
of the Account. First ING Life may establish one or more Other Accounts in the future, for which it will serve as sponsor
and depositor.

2. First ING Life established the Account on March 15, 1994 under the laws of New York pursuant to a resolution of its
Board of Directors. The Account is a segregated asset account of First ING Life, and is registered under the 1940 Act
as a unit investment trust. The underlying investment media for the Account will be Neuberger & Berman Advisers
Management Trust, Van Eck Investment Trust, Fidelity Variable Insurance Products Fund, Fidelity Variable Insurance
Products Fund II, Alger American Fund and INVESCO Variable Investment Funds (each, a ``Fund''). Each Fund is registered
under the 1940 Act as an open-end management investment company.

4. The Contracts provide retirement payments or other long-term benefits for persons covered under plans qualified
for federal income tax advantages available under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and for persons desiring such
benefits who do not qualify for such tax advantages. Holders of the Contracts will direct purchase payments to one
of several Divisions of the Separate Account or to the Guaranteed Interest Division (which is part of First ING Life's
general account). Payments directed to the Separate Account then will be invested by the Divisions in shares of corresponding
portfolios of the Funds.
5. The minimum initial purchase payment for a Contract is $5,000 for a non-qualified Contract and $1,000 for a qualified
Contract. The minimum additional purchase payment is $500 for a non-qualified Contract, $250 for a qualified Contract,
and $90 for a qualified Contract on a monthly program of purchase payments.
6. No front-end sales charge will be imposed when purchase payments are applied under the Contracts. However, a surrender
charge will be assessed if the Contract is surrendered or partial withdrawals exceeding certain amounts are taken
during the six year period from the date First ING Life receives and accepts each purchase payment. The surrender charge
is determined by the number of Contract anniversaries that have passed since the purchase payment that is being withdrawn
was made. The charge is 7% if no Contract anniversary has passed with respect to the payment. 6% if one Contract Anniversary
has passed, and declines by 1% per year thereafter. No surrender charge applies to a purchase payment that has been
held for 6 Contract anniversaries or more. In no event is the surrender charge greater than the amount withdrawn. Proceeds
from the surrender charge may not cover the expected costs of distributing the Contracts. Any shortfall will be recovered
from First ING Life's general assets, which may include revenue from the proposed mortality and expense risk charge.
7. The administrative charges to be assessed will be (a) an annual administrative charge of $30 per Contract year,
during the accumulation period only, if total purchase payments paid in the first Contract year are less than $100,000,
and (b) a daily asset charge, at an annual effective rate of 0.15% assessed against each Division of the Separate Account,
during both the accumulation and annuity periods. First ING Life guarantees that it will not raise these administrative
charges for the duration of the Contracts. First ING Life also represents that it does not expect that the total revenues
from the administrative charges will be greater than the total expected cost of administering the Contracts, on average,
excluding costs that are properly categorized as distribution expenses, over the period that the Contracts are in
force.
8. If more than one demand partial withdrawal occurs during a Contract year, there will be a charge of the lesser of $25
or 2% of the amount withdrawn for each additional demand partial withdrawal. In addition, each transfer in excess
of 12 in a Contract year will be subject to a charge of $25. Applicants indicate that the partial withdrawal transaction
charge and excess transfer charge will meet the ``at cost'' requirement of Rule 26a-1 under the 1940 Act.

9. First ING Life will assume certain risks, described below, in connection with its sale of the Contracts. Accordingly,
First ING Life proposes to receive compensation for assuming these risks by deducting, from the assets of the Separate
Account, a daily asset charge for mortality and expense risks.

10. First ING Life will assume several mortality risks under the Contracts. First, First ING Life will assume a mortality
risk by its contractual obligation to pay a death benefit to the beneficiary if the Owner dies prior to the annuity date.
The Contracts provide a death benefit that is the greater of: (a) the accumulation value at the time of death and (b)
the step-up benefit plus purchase payments made, less partial withdrawals and any surrender and partial withdrawal
transaction charges taken since the last step-up anniversary. Second, First ING Life assumes a mortality risk arising
from the fact that the Contract does not impose any surrender charge on the death benefit. Third, First ING Life assumes
an additional mortality risk by its contractual obligation to continue to make annuity payments for the entire life
of the Annuitant under annuity options involving life contingencies. This assures each Annuitant that neither the
Annuitant's own longevity nor an improvement in life expectancy generally will have an adverse effect on the annuity
payments received under a Contract. This relieves the Annuitant from the risk of outliving the amounts accumulated
for retirement. At the same time, First ING Life assumes the risk that Annuitants as a group would live a longer time
than First ING Life's annuity tables predict, which would require First ING Life to pay out more in annuity income than
planned. The Contracts contain annuity tables that are based on the 1983a Individual Annuity Mortality Table and,
for variable annuity options, alternative net investment factors of 3% or 5% and, for fixed annuity options, and interest
rate of 3%. First ING Life guarantees these annuity tables for the life of a Contract.

11. In addition to mortality risks, First ING life will assume an expense risk under the Contracts. This is because
the administrative charges under outstanding Contracts, which cannot be raised, may be insufficient to cover actual
administrative expenses.

12. In order to receive compensation for assuming these mortality and expense risks, First ING Life will assess the
Separate Account with a daily charge for mortality and expense risks at an annual aggregate rate of 1.25% Approximately
0.90% of this annual charge is allocated to the mortality risks that First ING Life will assume, and 0.35% is allocated
to the expense risks that First ING Life will assume.

13. If the administrative charges and the mortality and expense risk charges are insufficient to cover the expenses
and costs assumed, the loss will be borne by First ING Life. Conversely, if the amounts deducted prove more than sufficient,
the excess will be profit to First ING Life. First ING Life will likely earn a profit from the mortality and expense risk
charge.

Applicants' Legal Analysis



1. Applicants request exemptions from Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act to the extent necessary to
permit the deduction of the mortality and expense risk charge from the assets of the Separate Account under the Contracts.
Applicants state that the terms of the relief requested with respect to any Other Contracts funded by the Account or
any Other Account, in the future, are consistent with the standards set forth in Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act. Applicants
state that, without the requested relief, Applicants would have to request and obtain exemptive relief in connection
with Other Contracts under certain circumstances. Any such additional request for exemption would present no issues
under the 1940 Act that have not already been addressed in this application. Applicants submit that the requested
relief is appropriate in the public interest, because it would promote competitiveness in the variable annuity contract
market by eliminating the need for First ING Life to file redundant exemptive applications, thereby reducing its
administrative expenses and maximizing the efficient use of its resources. The delay and expense involved in having
to repeatedly seek exemptive relief would impair First ING Life's ability to effectively take advantage of business
opportunities as they arise. Applicants further submit that the requested relief is consistent with the purposes
of the 1940 Act and the protection of investors for the same reasons. If First ING Life were required to repeatedly seek
exemptive relief with respect to the same issues addressed in this application, investors would not receive any benefit
or additional protection thereby. Indeed, they might be disadvantaged as a result of First ING Life's increased overhead
expenses. Thus, Applicants believe that the requested exemption id appropriate in the public interest and consistent
with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act.

2. Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) prohibit a registered unit investment trust and any depositor or underwriter
thereof from selling periodic payment plan certificates unless the proceeds of all payments are deposited with a
trustee or custodian having the qualifications prescribed by Section 26(a)(1) of the 1940 Act and are held under an
agreement that provides that no payment to the depositor or principal underwriter shall be allowed except as a fee,
not exceeding such reasonable amount as the Commission may prescribe, for bookkeeping and other administrative
services.

3. Applicants have concluded that the mortality and expense risk charge of 1.25% is reasonable in relation to the risks
assumed by First ING Life under the Contracts and reasonable in amount as determined by industry practice with respect
to comparable annuity products. Applicants state that these determinations are based on their analysis of publicly
available information about similar industry practices, and by taking into consideration such factors as current
charge levels and benefits provided, the existence of expense charge guarantees, and guaranteed annuity rates.
First ING Life undertakes to maintain at its home office, and make available to the Commission and its staff upon request,
a memorandum setting forth in detail the methodology used in making the foregoing determinations.

4. The surrender charge may be insufficient to cover all costs relating to the distribution of the Contracts. In that
event, if a profit is realized from the mortality and expense risk charge, all or a portion of such profit may be offset
by distribution expenses not reimbursed by the surrender charge. Notwithstanding the foregoing, First ING Life
has concluded that there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed distribution financing arrangements will
benefit the Separate Account and Owners. First ING Life also represents that it will maintain at its home office, and
make available on request to the Commission and its staff, a memorandum setting out the basis for such conclusion.



5. First ING Life also represents that the Separate Account will invest only in an underlying mutual fund which undertakes,
in the event it should adopt any plan under Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act to finance distribution expenses, to
have such plan formulated and approved by a board of directors, a majority of the members of which are not ``interested
persons'' of such fund within the meaning of Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act.



Applicants' Conclusion



Applicants submit that, for all of the reasons stated herein,the requested exemptions from Sections 26(a)(2)(C)
and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act meet the standards set out in Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act. Applicants assert that the exemptions
requested are necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and
the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Application for Exemption under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``Act'').







APPLICANT: 

The Standard Bank of South Africa, Ltd. (``SBSA'').




RELEVANT ACT SECTIONS: 

Order requested under section 6(c) of the Act granting an exemption from section 17(f) of the Act.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: 

SBSA requests an order that would permit certain of its subsidiaries to act as custodian or subcustodian for investment
company assets in certain African countries.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application is available for a fee from the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.



Applicant's Representations



1. SBSA is a company organized and existing under the laws of South Africa. SBSA is authorized and regulated in South
Africa by the Office of Banks, Registrar of Banks of South Africa. As of December 31, 1993, SBSA had shareholders' equity
of 3.3 billion South African Rand (U.S.$945 million).

2. SBSA requests an order to permit it, as the custodian or subcustodian of foreign securities, cash, and cash equivalents
(collectively the ``Assets'') of investment companies (other than investment companies registered under section
7(d) of the Act), to maintain such assets in the custody of Stanbic Merchant Bank of Nigeria, Ltd. and Merchant Bank
(Ghana), Ltd. (collectively, the ``Foreign Affiliates'').

3. SBSA is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Standard Bank Investment Corporation, Ltd. (``SBIC''). SBIC owns 40 percent
of the voting stock of Stanbic Merchant Bank of Nigeria, Ltd. and 30 percent of the voting stock of Merchant Bank (Ghana),
Ltd. Each Foreign Affiliate is a bank incorporated under the laws of a country other than the United States and is regulated
as such by the relevant country's government or an agency thereof.


Applicant's Legal Analysis


1. Section 17(f) of the Act provides that a registered investment company may place and maintain its securities and
similar assets in the custody of a bank, or banks meeting the requirements of section 26(a) of the Act, a member firm
of a national securities exchange, the investment company itself, or a system for the central handling of securities
established by a national securities exchange. Section 2(a)(5) of the Act defines ``bank'' to include banking institutions
organized under the laws of the United States, member banks of the Federal Reserve System, and certain other banking
institutions or trust companies doing business under the laws of any state or of the United States. Neither SBSA nor
the Foreign Affiliates falls within the definition of ``bank'' as that term is defined in the Act.
2. Rule 17f-5 specifies entities located outside the United States that are eligible to serve as custodian for
investment company assets. One such entity is a banking institution or trust company incorporated or organized under
the laws of a country other than the United States that is regulated as such by the country's government or an agency
thereof and that has shareholders' equity in excess of U.S. $200 million. SBSA qualifies as an eligible foreign custodian.
The Foreign Affiliates do not qualify as eligible foreign custodians under rule 17f-5 only because they do not
meet the minimum shareholders' equity requirement.


Applicant's Conditions


SBSA agrees that an order granting the requested relief may be conditioned upon the following:
1. The proposed foreign custody arrangements regarding the Foreign Affiliates satisfy the requirements of rule
17f-5 in all respects other than the Foreign Affiliates' level of shareholders' equity.
2. SBSA will deposit the Assets with a Foreign Affiliate only in accordance with an agreement (the ``Agreement'')
required to remain in effect at all times during which the Foreign Affiliate fails to satisfy the requirements of rule
17f-5. Each Agreement will be a three-party agreement among SBSA, the Foreign Affiliate and the U.S. investment
company (or its custodian). Under the Agreement, SBSA will undertake to provide specified custodial or subcustodial
services for a U.S. investment company or its custodian, and will delegate to the Foreign Affiliate such of the duties
and obligations of SBSA as will be necessary to permit the Foreign Affiliate to hold in custody the U.S. investment
company's Assets in the relevant country. The Agreement will further provide that SBSA will be liable for any loss,
damage, cost, expense, liability, or claim arising out of or in connection with the performance by the Foreign Affiliate
of its responsibilities under the Agreement to the same extent as if SBSA had been required to provide custody services
under such agreement.
3. SBSA currently satisfies and will continue to satisfy the minimum shareholders equity requirement set forth in
rule 17f-5(c)(2)(i) under the Act.

3. Applicants request that any order also apply to any open-end investment company advised by the Adviser or any entity
controlled by, or under common control with the Adviser, or for which the Distributor or any entity controlled by or
under common control with the Distributor serves as principal underwriter and that (a) hereafter becomes part of
the same ``group of investment companies,'' as defined in rule 11a-3, and (b) issues classes of shares that are
identical in all material respects to the classes described in this application.

4. Applicants seek an order to permit each of the Funds to offer multiple classes of shares (the ``Multiple Class System'').
The Funds initially will issue four classes of shares. The requested order also will permit each Fund to assess a CDSC
on redemptions of certain classes of shares, and waive the CDSC under certain circumstances.

5. Class A shares generally will be offered at net asset value plus a front-end sales charge. Class A shares will be sold
without a front-end sales charge, however, but rather will be subject to a CDSC if they were purchased (a) in an amount
greater than a specified amount (currently expected to be $1 million) or (b) with the proceeds from the redemption
or sale of shares of another investment company (which redemption did not result in the payment by the investor of a
CDSC). The CDSC for such Class A shares will be at an expected rate of up to 1% if they are redeemed within four years after
purchase. In addition, all Class A shares will be subject to a non-rule 12b-1 shareholder servicing fee of up
to .25% of the average daily net assets of the class annually..

6. Class B shares will be offered without a front-end sales charge, but will be subject to a CDSC at an expected rate of
up to 1% on redemptions within the first year after purchase. In addition, the shares will bear rule 12b-1 distribution
fees of up to .75% (.50% in the case of some Funds) and a non-rule 12b-1 shareholder servicing fee of up to .25% of
the average daily net assets of the class annually.

7. Class C shares will be subject to a variable rate CDSC (declining over time) for a period of several years after purchase.
Applicants currently expect that the percentage of the CDSC generally will vary from 6% for redemptions made during
the first year from initial purchase to 1% for redemptions made during the sixth year from purchase. In addition, Class
C shares will bear rule 12b-1 distribution fees of up to .75%, and a non-rule 
12b-1 shareholder servicing expense of up to .25%, of the average daily net assets of the class annually. Class
C will automatically convert into Class A shares after a specified period (currently expected to be six years) from
the date of purchase.

8. Class D shares will be offered without any sales charges or rule 12b-1 fees. Class D shares will be offered only
to certain qualified institutional investors that wish to make very large investments. Investors eligible to purchase
Class D shares will include tax-qualified employee benefit plans, endowment funds, foundations, and other tax-exempt
organizations and certain insurance company separate accounts.






9. The net asset value of all outstanding shares of all classes of a Fund will be computed by allocating gross income
and expenses to each class based on the net assets attributable to each class, except for rule 12b-1 fees, shareholder
servicing expenses, and ``Class Expenses,'' as defined in condition 1 below.

10. Class C shares will automatically convert into Class A shares or shares of classes created in the future which are
identical in all material respects to the Class A shares after a specified period (not to exceed six years) following
the purchase date. Class C shares acquired by exchange from Class C shares of another Fund will convert into Class A
shares based on the time of the initial purchase. Class C shares purchased through the reinvestment of dividends and
other distributions paid in respect of Class C shares will convert into Class A shares at the same time as the shares
with respect to which they were purchased are converted.

11. Applicants expect that shares of each Fund may be exchanged for shares of the same respective class in any other
fund, without payment of an additional sales charge. All exchange privileges applicable to each class will comply
with rule 11a-3 under the Act.

12. No CDSC will be imposed with respect to: (a) redemptions of shares that were purchased more than a specified number
of years prior to the redemptions: (b) shares derived from reinvestment of dividends or capital gain distributions;
or (c) the amount that represents an increase in the value of the shareholder's account resulting from capital appreciation.
The amount of the CDSC will be calculated as the lesser of the amount that represents a specified percentage of the net
asset value of the shares at the time of purchase, or the amount that represents such percentage of the net asset value
of the shares at the time of redemption.

13. In determining the applicability and rate of any CDSC, it will be assumed that a redemption is made first of shares
representing reinvestment of dividends and capital gain distributions and then of other shares held by the shareholder
for the longest period of time. This will result in the charge, if any, being imposed at the lowest possible rate. In
addition, redemption requests placed by shareholders who own shares of more than one class will be satisfied first
by redeeming the shareholder's shares of the class or classes not subject to a CDSC, unless the shareholder has specifically
elected to redeem shares which are subject to a CDSC.

14. The CDSC will not be imposed on shares issued prior to the effective date of the order granting exemptive relief.

15. Applicants request relief to permit each Fund to waive or reduce the CDSC in certain circumstances. Any waiver
or reduction will comply with the conditions in paragraphs (a) through (d) of rule 22d-1 under the Act.



Applicants' Legal Analysis



1. Applicants request an exemption under section 6(c) from sections 18(f)(1), 18(g), and 18(i) to issue multiple
classes of shares representing interests in the same portfolio of securities. Applicants believe that, by implementing
the multiple class distribution system, the Funds would be able to facilitate the distribution of their shares and
permit shareholders to receive the benefits of mutual fund services and distribution arrangements and the added
benefits of scale and other advantages that may result from combining investors' assets in a single portfolio. Applicants
also believe that the proposed allocation of expenses and voting rights is equitable and would not discriminate against
any group of shareholders. The proposed arrangement does not involve borrowings, affect the Funds' existing assets
or reserves, or increase the speculative character of the shares of a Fund.

2. Applicants also request an exemption under section 6(c) from sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 22(c), and 22(d), and
rule 22c-1, to assess and, under certain circumstances, waive a CDSC on redemptions of shares. Applicants believe
that the CDSC arrangement would permit shareholders to have the advantage of greater investment dollars working
for them from the time of their purchase than if a sales charge had been imposed.



Applicants' Conditions



Applicants agree that the order granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions:

1. Each class of shares will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments of a Fund and be identical in all
respects, except as set forth below. The only differences among various classes of shares of the same Fund will relate
solely to: (a) the impact of the disproportionate payments made under the rule 12b-1 distribution plan and the
shareholder services plan, and any Class Expenses which are limited to (i) transfer agency fees attributable to a
specific class of shares; (ii) printing and postage expenses related to preparing and distributing materials such
as shareholder reports, prospectuses, and proxies to current shareholders of a specific class; (iii) Blue Sky registration
fees incurred by a class of shares; (iv) SEC registration fees incurred by a class of shares; (v) administrative services
fees payable under each class' respective administrative services agreement, if any; and (vi) any other incremental
expenses subsequently identified that should be properly allocated to one class which shall be approved by the Commission
pursuant to an amended order; (b) voting rights on matters which pertain to rule 12b-1 plans except as provided
in condition 2 below; (c) the different exchange privileges of the classes of shares; (d) the designation of each class
of shares of a Fund; and (e) the fact that only certain classes will have a conversion feature.

2. If a Fund implements any amendments to its rule 12b-1 plan (or, if presented to shareholders, adopts or implements
any amendment of a non-rule 12b-1 shareholder service plan) that would increase materially the amount that
may be borne by a class of shares under the plan into which another class will convert (the ``Target Class''), shares
of the class that will convert (the ``Purchase Class'') will stop converting into the Target Class unless the Purchase
Class shareholders, voting separately as a class, approve the proposal. The Trustees shall take such action as is
necessary to ensure that existing Purchase Class shares are exchanged or converted into a new class of shares (the
``New Target Class''), identical in all material respects to the Target Class as it existed prior to implementation
of the proposal, no later than the date such shares previously were scheduled to covert into the Target Class. If deemed
advisable by the Trustees to implement the foregoing, such action may include the exchange of all existing Purchase
Class shares for a new class (the ``New Purchase Class''), identical to existing Purchase Class shares in all material
respects except that the New Purchase Class will convert into the New Target Class. The New Target Class or the New Purchase
Class may be formed without further exemptive relief. Exchanges or conversions described in this condition shall
be effected in a manner that the Trustees reasonably believe will not be subject to federal taxation. In accordance
with condition 6, any additional cost associated with the creation, exchange, or conversion of the New Target Class
or the New Purchase Class shall be borne solely by the Adviser or Distributor. The Purchase Class shares sold after
the implementation of the proposal may convert into the Target Class shares subject to the higher maximum payment,
provided that the material features of the Target Class plan and the relationship of such plan to the Purchase Class
shares are disclosed in an effective registration statement.
3. Any class of shares with a conversion feature will convert into another class of shares on the basis of the relative
net asset values of the two classes, without the imposition of any sales load, fee, or other charge. After conversion,
the converted shares will be subject to an asset-based sales charge and/or service fee (as those terms are defined
in article III, section 26 of the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice), if any, that in the aggregate are lower than the asset-based
sales charge and service fee to which they were subject prior to the conversion.
4. The Trustees of the Trust, including a majority of the independent Trustees, shall have approved the Multiple Class
System prior to the implementation of the Multiple Class System by a particular Fund. The minutes of the meetings of
the Trustees regarding their deliberations with respect to the approvals necessary to implement the Multiple Class
System will reflect in detail the reasons for determining that the Multiple Class System is in the best interests of
both the Funds and their respective shareholders.
5. The initial determination of the Class Expenses that will be allocated to a particular class of a Fund and any subsequent
charges thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the Trustees, including a majority of the independent Trustees.
Any person authorized to direct the allocation and disposition of monies paid or payable by the Fund to meet Class Expenses,
rule 12b-1 fees and shareholder servicing fees shall provide to the Trustees, and the Trustees shall review,
at least quarterly, a written report of the amounts so expended and the purposes for which such expenditures were made.
6. On an ongoing basis, the Trustees, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and otherwise, will
monitor each Fund for the existence of any material conflicts among the interests of the various classes or shares.
The Trustees, including a majority of the independent Trustees, shall take such action as is reasonably necessary
to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. The Adviser and Distributor will be responsible for reporting any
potential or existing conflicts to the Trustees. If a conflict arises, the Adviser and Distributor at their own costs
will remedy the conflict up to and including establishing a new registered management investment company.

7. The Trustees of the Trust will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning distribution and shareholder
servicing expenditures complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b-1, as it may be amended from time to
time. In the statements, only expenditures properly attributable to the sale or servicing of a class of shares will
be used to support any distribution or servicing fee charged to shareholders of such class of shares. Expenditures
not related to the sale or servicing of a particular class of shares will not be presented to the Trustees to justify
any fee attributable to that class. The statements, including the allocations upon which they are based, will be subject
to the review and approval of the independent Trustees in the exercise of their fiduciary duties.
8. Each shareholder services plan will be adopted and operated in accordance with the procedures set forth in rule
12b-1(b) through (f) as if the expenditures made thereunder were subject to rule 12b-1, except that shareholders
need not enjoy the voting rights specified in rule 12b-1.
9. Dividends paid by a Fund with respect to each class of shares, to the extent any dividends are paid, will be calculated
in the same manner, at the same time, and on the same day and will be in the same amount, except that fee payments made under
the rule 12b-1 plans relating to a particular class of shares will be borne exclusively by such class and except
that any Class Expense and shareholder servicing expenses will be borne exclusively by the applicable class of shares.
10. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the various
classes and the proper allocation of expenses among the various classes have been reviewed by an expert (the ``Expert'').
The Expert has rendered a report to applicants (and such report has been filed with the SEC as an exhibit to the application)
that such methodology and procedures are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations will be made in
an appropriate manner. On an ongoing basis, the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, will monitor the manner
in which the calculations and allocations are being made and, based upon such review, will render at least annually
a report to the Funds that the calculations and allocations are being made properly. The reports of the Expert shall
be filed as part of the periodic reports filed with the Commission pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act.
The work papers of the Expert with respect to such reports, following request by the Funds which the Funds agree to make,
will be available for inspection by the Commission staff upon the written request for these work papers by a senior
member of the Division of Investment Management or of a Regional Office of the Commission, limited to the Director,
an Associate Director, the Chief Accountant, the Chief Financial Analyst, any Assistant Director, and any Regional
Administrator or associate and Assistant Administrator. The initial report of the Expert is a ``report on policies
and procedures placed in operation'' and the ongoing reports will be ``reports on policies and procedures placed
in operation and tests of operating effectiveness'' as defined and described in SAS No. 70 of the AICPA, as it may be
amended from time to time, or in similar auditing standards as may be adopted by the AICPA from time to time.
11. Applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for
calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions among the various classes of shares and the proper
allocation of expenses among such classes of shares and this representation has been concurred with by the Expert
in the initial report referred to in condition 10 above and will be concurred with by the Expert, or an appropriate substitute
Expert, on an ongoing basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred to in condition 10 above. Applicants
agree to take immediate corrective action if the Expert, or appropriate substitute Expert, does not so concur in the
ongoing reports.
12. The prospectuses of the Funds will contain a statement to the effect that a salesperson and any other person entitled
to receive compensation for selling or servicing Fund shares may receive different compensation with respect to
one particular class of shares over another in the Fund.
13. The Distributor will adopt compliance standards as to when each class of shares may appropriately be sold to particular
investors. Applicants will require all persons selling shares of the Funds to agrees to conform to these standards.

14. The conditions pursuant to which the exemptive order is granted and the duties and responsibilities of the Trustees
of the Funds with respect to the Multiple Class System will be set forth in guidelines which will be furnished to the
Trustees.

15. Each Fund will disclose the respective expenses, performance data, distribution arrangements, services, fees,
sales loads, deferred sales loads, and exchange privileges applicable to each class of shares in every prospectus
regardless of whether all classes of shares are offered through each prospectus. Each Fund will disclose the respective
expenses and performance data applicable to all classes of shares in every shareholder report. The shareholder reports
will contain, in the statement of assets and liabilities and statement of operations, information related to the
Fund as a whole generally and not on a per class basis. Each Fund's per share data, however, will be prepared on a per class
basis with respect to all classes of shares of such Fund. To the extent any advertisement or sales literature describes
the expenses or performance data applicable to any class of shares, it will also disclose the respective expenses
and/or performance data applicable to all classes of shares. The information provided by applicants for publication
in any newspaper or similar listing of the Fund's net asset values and public offering prices will present each class
of shares separately.

16. Applicants acknowledge that the grant of the requested exemptive order will not imply Commission approval or
authorization of or acquiescence in any particular level of payments that the Funds may make pursuant to rule 12b-1
plans or shareholder services plans in reliance on the order.

17. Applicants will comply with the provisions of proposed rule 6c-10 under the Act, Investment Company Act
Release No. 16619 (November 2, 1988), as the rule is currently proposed and as it may be reproposed, adopted, or amended.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc.,
Relating to Amendment to Foreign Currency Option Trading Hours</DOCTITLE>


October 6, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on September 22, 1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PHLX'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' OR ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I,
II and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing
this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



Currently, PHLX Rule 101, ``Hours of Business,'' provides that the foreign currency option (``FCO'') trading session
will be conducted between 1:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. each business day. The PHLX proposes to amend PHLX Rule 101 to provide
that FCO trading will be conducted between 2:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. each business day. Thus, the PHLX will move the opening
of FCO trading from 1:30 a.m. to 2:30 a.m. Eastern time (``ET'') for all PHLX-listed FCOs except the Canadian dollar,
which will continue to commence trading at 7:00 a.m. ET each business day.

The text of the proposal is available at the Office of the Secretary, PHLX, and at the Commission.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



According to the PHLX, the Exchange's FCO trading hours for the last nine months have commenced at 1:30 a.m. ET each
Monday through Friday and terminated at 2:30 p.m. ET on the afternoon of each trading day. The PHLX states that over
the past nine months, less than one percent of the PHLX's FCO volume was generated during the 1:30 a.m. ET to 2:30 a.m.
ET time period. Upon the recommendation of the Exchange's FCO Committee, a standing committee of the Board of Governors
(``Board''), the Board approved the proposed adjustment in trading hours to change the commencement of FCO trading
from 1:30 a.m. ET to 2:30 a.m. ET. The proposal is designed to ease the staffing burden on current registered FCO specialist
units as well as floor brokerage units and registered option trader firms. The PHLX proposes to implement the adjusted
2:30 a.m. ET commencement of FCO trading on October 31, 1994, to coordinate with the resumption of trading during Eastern
Standard time, as October 30, 1994, will mark the end of Eastern Daylight savings time.

The PHLX believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6 of the Act, in general, and, in particular,
with Section 6(b)(5), in that it is designed to further promote the mechanism of a free and open market and to protect
investors and the public interest.



(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The PHLX does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any inappropriate burden on competition.



(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others



No written comments were either solicited or received at the time of the filing.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reason for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will: (a) by order approve such proposed rule change, or (b) institute proceedings to determine whether
the proposed rule change should be disapproved.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection
and copying at the principal office of the above-mentioned self-regulatory organization. All submissions should
refer to the file number in the caption above and should be submitted by November 2, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago
Stock Exchange, Inc. to Waive Exchange Transaction Fees on Trades in the Chicago Stock Basket</DOCTITLE>


October 5, 1994.


Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on October 3, 1994, the Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CHX'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below,
which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to
solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.


I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


 The CHX proposes to waive, through December 31, 1994, Exchange transaction fees for trades in the Chicago Stock Basket
(``CXM''). This would extend a waiver currently in effect through September 30, 1994.
 Proposed new language is italicized and deleted language is bracketed:




(c) Transaction Fee Schedule Rounds Lots/Mixed Lots: 45 cents per 100 shares, $100 maximum per trade.
Odd Lots: 35 cents per trade, $400 maximum monthly fee.
The above fees shall not apply to transactions in the Chicago Basket (``CXM'') through [September 30, 1994] 

December 31, 1994.




II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.


A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


1. Purpose


The purpose of the proposed change is to extend the waiver of certain Exchange fees for trades in CXM through December
31, 1994.


2. Statutory Basis


The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b)(4) of the Act in that it provides for the equitable allocation
of reasonable fees and other charges among members using its facilities.


B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition that is not necessary
or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.


C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others


Comments were neither solicited nor received.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


The foregoing rule change establishes or changes a due, fee, or other charge imposed by the Exchange and therefore
has become effective pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act and subparagraph (e) of Rule 19b-4 thereunder.
At any time within 60 days of the filing of such change, the Commission may summarily abrogate such rule change if it
appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection
of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.


IV. Solicitation of Comments


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of the CHX. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-CHX-94-19

Munitions Exports Involving Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Company, Suleiman A. Nassar and Allen R. Love


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of State.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Notice is hereby given that it shall be the policy of the Department of State to deny all export license applications
and other requests for approval pursuant to section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act, that request authorization
for the export or transfer by, for or to, or involve directly or indirectly, LOCKHEED AERONAUTICAL SYSTEMS COMPANY,
SULEIMAN A. NASSAR AND ALLEN R. LOVE and any of their subsidiaries, or successor entities in connection with the transfer
of defense articles of defense services. (This denial policy does not affect any other divisions of Lockheed Corporation.)
This policy also precludes the use in connection with such entities of any exemptions from license or other approval
included in the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) (22 CFR Parts 120-130) except as those exemptions
directly pertain to licenses or other written approvals granted prior to June 22, 1994.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

A nine (9) count indictment was returned on June 22, 1994, in the U.S. District Court, Northern District of Georgia,
charging Lockheed Corporation (Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Company, a division of Lockheed Corporation), Suleiman
A. Nassar (employee of Lockheed Corporation International S.A.) and Allen R. Love (employee of Lockheed Aeronautical
Systems) with conspiracy (18 U.S.C.  371) to violate and violation of section 104 of the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act (15 U.S.C.  78dd-1 and 78ff(c)(2). The indictment charges that the defendants conspired to retain
a consultant, who was a member of the Egyptian Parliament, to use influence with Egyptian government officials in
an effort to assist Lockheed in procuring a contract for the sale of three C-130 Hercules Aircraft to Government
of Egypt. (

United States 

v. 

Lockheed Corporation, et al.,

 U.S. District Court, Northern District of Georgia, Criminal Docket No. 1:94-CR-226).


On June 22, 1994, the Department of State instituted a policy of denial of all requests for licenses and other written
approvals (including all activities under manufacturing license and technical assistance agreements) concerning
exports of defense articles and provision of defense services, by, for or to, or involving directly or indirectly,
the above-named defendants and any of their subsidiaries or successor entities. Furthermore, the Department precluded
the use in connection with those defendants of any exemptions from license or other approval included in the ITAR except
as those exemptions directly pertain to licenses or other written approvals granted prior to June 22, 1994.
This action has been taken pursuant to sections 38 and 42 of the Arms Export Control Act (AECA) (22 U.S.C.   2778
& 2791) and 22 CFR 126.7(a)(2) and 126.7(a)(3) of the ITAR. It will remain in force until rescinded.
Exceptions may be made to this denial policy on a case-by-case basis at the discretion of the Office of Defense Trade
Controls. However, such an exception would be granted only after a full review of all circumstances, paying particular
attention to the following factors: whether an exception is warranted by overriding U.S. foreign policy or national
security interests; whether an exception would further law enforcement concerns; and whether other compelling
circumstances exist which are consistent with the foreign policy or national security interests of the United States,
and which do not conflict with law enforcement concerns.
As a result of a recent review of the policy involving indicted persons, a person (as defined at 22 CFR 120.14) named
in an indictment for an AECA-related violation may submit a written request for reconsideration of the denial decision
to the Office of Defense Trade Controls. Such request for reconsideration should be supported by evidence of remedial
measures taken to prevent future violations of the AECA and/or the ITAR and other pertinent documented information
showing that the person would not be a risk for future violations of the AECA and/or the ITAR. The Office of Defense Trade
Controls will evaluate the submission in consultation with the Departments of Treasury, Justice, and other necessary
agencies. After a decision on the request for reconsideration has been rendered by the Assistant Secretary for Political-Military
Affairs, the requester will be notified whether the exception has been granted.

Decisions That Nonconforming 1994 Mercedes-Benz S280 Passenger Cars Are Eligible for Importation



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of decision by NHTSA that nonconforming 1994 Mercedes-Benz S280 passenger cars are eligible for importation.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice announces the decision by NHTSA that 1994 Mercedes-Benz S280 passenger cars not originally manufactured
to comply with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards are eligible for importation into the United
States because they are substantially similar to a vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale
in the United States and certified by its manufacturer as complying with the safety standards (the 1994 Mercedes-Benz
S320), and they are capable of being readily altered to conform to the standards.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background



Under 49 U.S.C.  30141(a)(1)(A) (formerly section 108(c)(3)(A)(i) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle
Safety Act (the Act)), a motor vehicle that was not originally manufactured to conform to all applicable Federal motor
vehicle safety standards shall be refused admission into the United States unless NHTSA has decided that the motor
vehicle is substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the
United States, certified under 49 U.S.C.  30115 (formerly section 114 of the Act), and of the same model year
as the model of the motor vehicle to be compared, and is capable of being readily altered to conform to all applicable
Federal motor vehicle safety standards.
Petitions for eligibility decisions may be submitted by either manufacturers or importers who have registered with
NHTSA pursuant to 49 CFR Part 592. As specified in 49 CFR 593.7, NHTSA publishes notice in the 

Federal Register

 of each petition that it receives, and affords interested persons an opportunity to comment on the petition. At the
close of the comment period, NHTSA decides, on the basis of the petition and any comments that it has received, whether
the vehicle is eligible for importation. The agency then publishes this decision in the 

Federal Register

.
Champagne Imports, Inc. of Lansdale, Pennsylvania (Registered Importer R-90-009) petitioned NHTSA
to decide whether 1994 Mercedes-Benz S280 passenger cars are eligible for importation into the United States. NHTSA
published notice of the petition on August 10, 1994 (59 FR 40958) to afford an opportunity for public comment. The reader
is referred to that notice for a thorough description of the petition. No comments were received in response to the
notice. Based on its review of the information submitted by the petitioner, NHTSA has decided to grant the petition.


Vehicle Eligibility Number for Subject Vehicles


The importer of a vehicle admissible under any final decision must indicate on the form HS-7 accompanying entry
the appropriate vehicle eligibility number indicating that the vehicle is eligible for entry. VSP 85 is the vehicle
eligibility number assigned to vehicles admissible under this notice of final decision.


Final Decision


Accordingly, on the basis of the foregoing, NHTSA hereby decides that a 1994 Mercedes-Benz S280 (Model ID 140.028)
is substantially similar to a 1994 Mercedes-Benz S320 originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the
United States and certified under 49 U.S.C.  30115, and is capable of being readily altered to conform to all
applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards.





Authority:

 49 U.S.C. 30141 (a)(1)(A) and (b)(1); 49 CFR 593.8; delegations of authority at 49 CFR 1.50 and 501.8.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice announces receipt by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) of a petition for a decision
that a 1990 BMW 750iL that was not originally manufactured to comply with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety
standards is eligible for importation into the United States because (1) it is substantially similar to a vehicle
that was originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the United States and that was certified by its manufacturer
as complying with the safety standards, and (2) it is capable of being readily altered to conform to the standards.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background




Under 49 U.S.C. 30141(a)(1)(A) (formerly section 108(c)(3)(A)(i)(I) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle
Safety Act (the Act)), a motor vehicle that was not originally manufactured to conform to all applicable Federal motor
vehicle safety standards shall be refused admission into the United States unless NHTSA has decided that the motor
vehicle is substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the
United States, certified under 49 U.S.C. 30115 (formerly section 114 of the Act), and of the same model year as the model
of the motor vehicle to be compared, and is capable of being readily altered to conform to all applicable Federal motor
vehicle safety standards.

Petitions for eligibility decisions may be submitted by either manufacturers or importers who have registered with
NHTSA pursuant to 49 CFR part 592. As specified in 49 CFR 593.7, NHTSA publishes notice in the 

Federal Register

 of each petition that it receives, and affords interested persons an opportunity to comment on the petition. At the
close of the comment period, NHTSA decides, on the basis of the petition and any comments that it has received, whether
the vehicle is eligible for importation. The agency then publishes this decision in the 

Federal Register.

Liphardt & Associates, Inc. of Ronkonkoma, New York (``Liphardt'') (Registered Importer 90-004) has
petitioned NHTSA to decide whether 1990 BMW 750iL passenger cars are eligible for importation into the United States.
The vehicle which Liphardt believes is substantially similar is the 1990 BMW 750iL that was manufactured for importation
into and sale in, the United States and that was certified by its manufacturer, Bayerische Motoren Werke A.G., as conforming
to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards.

The petitioner claims that it carefully compared the non-U.S. certified 1990 BMW 750iL to its U.S. certified counterpart,
and found the two vehicles to be substantially similar with respect to compliance with most Federal motor vehicle
safety standards.

Liphardt submitted information with its petition intended to demonstrate that the non-U.S. certified 1990 BMW 750iL,
as originally manufactured, conforms to many Federal motor vehicle safety standards in the same manner as its U.S.
certified counterpart, or is capable of being readily altered to conform to those standards.

Specifically, the petition claims that the non-U.S. certified 1990 BMW 750iL is identical to its U.S. certified counterpart
with respect to compliance with Standards Nos. 102

Tariff Classification of Imported Glassware 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Customs Service, Treasury.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed change of practice; solicitation of comments.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice advises the public that Customs proposes a change of practice regarding the tariff classification of
three classes of imported glassware: ``containers of glass used for the conveyance or packing of goods'', ``preserving
jars of glass'' and ``glassware of a kind used for table or kitchen purposes''. The principal use of these classes or
kinds of glassware, whether it be conveying or packing solid or liquid products, home canning or household storage,
determines its classification. 


After intensive review of the three classes of imported glassware, it has been determined advisable to set forth factors
which Customs proposes to use when determining whether merchandise falls within a particular class or kind. 
Customs proposes that ``containers of glass used for the conveyance or packing of goods'' includes glass articles
that are part of the exchange or buying and selling of commodities that are principally used to convey a product to a
consumer who uses the product and then discards the container. 
Customs proposes that ``preserving jars of glass'' includes only various glass articles which are the typical size
and shape of ``Mason-type'' jars. Because the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has determined that glass jars
with wire bails and glass caps (non ``Mason-type'') are not recommended for home canning, and these type of jars are
often advertised and sold in sets of varying sizes for use in the storage of dry goods in the home, Customs proposes to
change its practice of classifying them as ``preserving jars of glass'' to the more appropriate class, glassware
of a kind used for table or kitchen purposes. 
Finally, Customs proposes that the class ``glassware of a kind used for table or kitchen purposes'' includes glass
household storage articles. 
By this action, those rulings which are inconsistent with Customs proposed change of practice would be revoked. Before
adopting this proposed change of practice, consideration will be given to any written comments regarding the scope
of all three of these classes (especially the characteristics which are indicative of each class) which are timely
submitted in response to publication of this document.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


Background 


Customs proposes a change of practice involving the tariff classification of three classes of imported glass articles
under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). This requires an examination of subheadings 7010.90.50
and 7013.39, HTSUS. 
The HTSUS subheadings read as follows:

 

7010.90.50 Carboys, bottles, flasks, jars, pots, vials, ampoules and other containers, of glass, of a kind
used for the conveyance or packing of goods; preserving jars of glass; stoppers, lids and other closures, of glass:
[o]ther: [o]ther containers (with or without their closures) 
7013.39 [g]lassware of a kind used for table, kitchen, toilet, office, indoor decoration or similar purposes
(other than that of heading 7010 or 7018): [g]lassware of a kind used for table, (other than drinking glasses) or kitchen
purposes other than that of glass-ceramics: [o]ther 




Subheadings 7010.90.50 and 7013.39, HTSUS, are considered ``use'' provisions. There are two principal types of
classification by use: 
(1) According to the use of the class or kind of goods to which the imported article belongs; and 
(2) According to the actual use of the imported article. 
Use according to the class or kind of goods to which the imported article belongs is more prevalent in the tariff schedule.
A few tariff provisions expressly state that classification is based on the use of the class or kind of goods to which
the imported article belongs. However, in most instances, this type of classification is inferred from the language
used in a particular provision.

<TEXT>
 

If an article is classifiable according to the use of the class or kind of goods to which it belongs, Additional U.S.
Rule of Interpretation 1(a), HTSUS, provides that: [i]n the absence of special language or context which otherwise
requires_ (a) a tariff classification controlled by use (other than actual use) is to be determined in accordance
with the use in the United States at, or immediately prior to, the date of importation, of goods of that class or kind
to which the imported goods belong, and the controlling use is the principal use. In other words, the article's principal
use at the time of importation determines whether it is classifiable within a particular class or kind. 
While Additional U.S. Rule of Interpretation 1(a), HTSUS, provides general criteria for discerning the principal
use of an article, it does not provide specific criteria for individual tariff provisions. 
However, the U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT) has provided factors, which are indicative but not conclusive,
to apply when determining whether merchandise falls within a particular class or kind. They include: general physical
characteristics, the expectation of the ultimate purchaser, channels of trade, environment of sale (accompanying
accessories, manner of advertisement and display), use in the same manner as merchandise which defines the class,
economic practicality of so using the import, and recognition in the trade of this use. See: 

Kraft, Inc, 

v. 

United States, 

USITR, 16 CIT 483, (June 24, 1992) (hereinafter 

Kraft

); 

G. Heilman Brewing Co. 

v. 

United States, 

USITR, 14 CIT 614 (Sept. 6, 1990); and 

United States 

v. 

Carborundum Company, 

63 CCPA 98, C.A.D. 1172, 536 F. 2d 373 (1976), 

cert. denied, 

429 U.S. 979. 
Tariff classification of goods controlled by actual use is specifically provided for in sections 10.131-10.139,
Customs Regulations [19 CFR 10.131-10.139]. According to these regulations, an actual use provision is satisfied
if: (1) such use is intended at the time of importation, (2) the article is so used, and (3) proof of such use is furnished
within three years after the date the article has been entered. 
Currently, tariff classification under both subheading 7010.90.50 and 7013.39, HTSUS, is determined by the use
of the class or kind of articles to which the imported merchandise belongs. As such, they are considered provisions
controlled by Additional U.S. Rule of Interpretation 1(a), HTSUS. 
Customs current position regarding subheading 7010.90.50, HTSUS, is in accord with the findings of the CIT in 

Group Italglass U.S.A. 

v. 

United States, 

USITR, 17 CIT 

XXX

, Slip Op. 93-46 (Mar. 29, 1993). 

Italglass 

held that the language of heading 7010, HTSUS, implicates use as a criterion of classification for that entire heading,
which includes subheading 7010.90.50, HTSUS, and that principal use was the controlling use. Additionally, the
court held that the phrase ``of the kind'' preceding the words ``used for'' did not constitute a special language or
context. See Sturm, Ruth, 

Customs Law and Administration, 

vol. 2., sec. 53.3, p. 28. 
Customs proposes no changes in this regard. Subheadings 7010.90.50 and 7013.39, HTSUS, would remain principal use
provisions. Therefore, for an imported good to be classifiable in either of these subheadings, it must be of the class
or kind of articles classifiable in these subheadings. Whether it is of the class or kind of articles classifiable
in either subheading will be determined by its principal use. Principal use will, in turn, be determined by the specific
criteria formulated to determine to what class or kind the imported goods belong. 
Based on the plain language of the provision, Customs is of the opinion that subheading 7010.90.50, HTSUS, includes
the classes ``glass containers of a kind used for the conveyance or packing of goods'' and ``preserving jars of glass''.



Containers of a Kind Used for the Conveyance or Packing of Goods 


Customs understanding of the principal use of this class and the factors which indicate acceptance of a particular
article in the class, is based on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System Explanatory Notes (ENs),
relevant Headquarters Rulings Letters (HRLs) and the Kraft case.

In understanding the language of the HTSUS, Customs consults the ENs. The ENs, although not dispositive, provide
a commentary on the scope of each heading of the Harmonized System and are thus useful in ascertaining the classification
of merchandise. Customs believes that they should be consulted for guidance in determining the proper interpretation
of the HTSUS. See T.D. 89-80, 54 FR 35127, 35128 (August 23, 1989). EN 70.10, pg. 933-934, states, in pertinent
part, that: 
This heading covers all glass containers of the kinds commonly used commercially for the conveyance or packing of
liquids or of solid products (powders, granules, etc.). They include:

 

(A) Carboys, demijohns, bottles (including syphon vases), phials and similar containers, of all shapes and sizes,
used as containers for chemical products (acids, etc.) beverages, oils, meat extracts, perfumery preparations,
pharmaceutical products, inks, glues, etc. 
These articles, formerly produced by blowing, are now almost invariably manufactured by machines which automatically
feed molten glass into moulds where the finished articles are formed by the action of compressed air. They are usually
made of ordinary glass (colourless or coloured) although some bottles (e.g., for perfumes) may be made of lead crystal,
and certain large carboys are made of fused quartz or other fused silica * * *
These containers remain in this heading even if they are ground, cut, sand-blasted, etched or engraved, or decorated
(this applies, in particular, to certain perfume or liqueur bottles), banded, wickered or otherwise trimmed with
various materials (wicker, straw, raffia, metal, etc.); they may also have tumbler-caps fitted to the neck. They
may be fitted with drop measuring devices or may be graduated, provided that they are not of a kind used as laboratory
glassware. 
(B) Jars, pots and similar containers for the conveyance or packing of certain foodstuffs * * *, pharmaceutical
products, * * * polishes, cleaning preparations, etc. 
These articles are usually made of ordinary glass (colourless or tinted) by pressure in a mould usually followed by
blowing with compressed air. They generally have a large opening, a short neck (if any) and as a rule, a lip or flange
to hold the lid or cap. Some of these containers, however may be closed by corks or screwstoppers.

 

In HRL 087359, dated August 8, 1990, Customs explained the phrase ``commercially used to convey'', as used in the ENs,
when referring to the class of glass containers commercially used to convey solid or liquid products. The ruling stated,
in pertinent part, that:

 

The key phrase in this instance is ``commonly used commercially for the conveyance'' of liquids. The root word of ``commercially''
is commerce which is described as the exchange or buying and selling of commodities. 

Webster's Third New International Dictionary,

 (1986) and 

The Random House Dictionary of the English Language,

 (1983). The root word of ``conveyance'' is convey which is described as to carry, bring or take from one place to another;
transport; bear. 

The Random House Dictionary of the English Language,

 (1983) and 

Webster's Third New International Dictionary,

 (1986).

 

Based on this ruling, Customs current position is that the principal use for the class ``containers used for the conveyance
or packing of goods'' is that glass articles of this class be part of the exchange or buying and selling of commodities,
and be used to convey or pack a product to a consumer who then uses the product and discards the container. 


After reviewing the Kraft case, the ENs and the relevant HRLs, Customs believes that together, they provide specific
identifiable characteristics which are indicative, but not conclusive of whether a particular glass article qualifies
as part of the class ``containers of glass of a kind used for the conveyance or packing of goods''. These characteristics
would include, containers, of all shapes and sizes:

 

1. generally having a large opening, a short neck (if any) and as a rule, a lip or flange to hold the lid or cap, made of ordinary
glass (colourless or coloured) and manufactured by machines which automatically feed molten glass into moulds where
the finished articles are formed by the action of compressed air; 
2. in which the ultimate purchaser's primary expectation is to discard the container after the conveyed or packed
goods are used; 
3. sold from the importer to a wholesaler/distributor who then packs them with goods; 
4. sold in an environment of sale that features the goods packed in the jar and not the jar itself; 
5. used to commercially convey foodstuffs, beverages, oils, meat extracts, etc.;
6. capable of being used in the hot packing process; and 
7. recognized in the trade as used primarily to pack and convey goods to a consumer who then discards the container after
this initial use.

 

Customs current position is that the physical characteristics of a particular glass article are the primary indicator
of whether it belongs to the class ``containers of a kind used for the packing or conveyance of goods''.

<DOCNO> FR941012-2-00149 </DOCNO>

<TEXT>
 

Kraft discussed a container's ability to be used in the ``hot packing'' process as a possible indicator that a particular
container was of a kind used for the packing or conveyance of goods. However, it is Customs understanding that most
glassware is capable of being used in the ``hot packing'' process. Therefore, whether a particular container is capable
of being used in the ``hot packing'' process, is of limited utility when determining whether it is classifiable as
a container of a kind used for the packing or conveyance of goods. 
Customs proposes to continue to apply the standards outlined above with one addition. The proposed addition involves
glass containers imported without their corresponding caps or lids. Based on observations of importations, Customs
proposed position is that ``glass containers imported without their corresponding caps or lids'' is an additional
physical characteristic that indicates that particular containers will be used for the conveyance or packing of
goods. 
We realize that subheading 7010.90.50, HTSUS, provides for containers imported with or without their lids. However,
Customs proposed position is that whether containers are, or are not, imported with lids is a distinct indication
of their use. 


Preserving Jars of Glass 


Customs present position regarding the class ``preserving jars of glass'' is that it provides for various articles
which are the typical size and shape of ``Mason-type'' jars. Whether a particular glass jar is a preserving jar is presently
determined on a case-by-case basis. Customs does, however, consider volumes of between .23 liters and 2.2 liters
and a shape and height of a typical Mason jar (e.g., not multi-sided) to be indicative, but not conclusive, physical
characteristics of a preserving jar. 
This understanding is based on relevant HRLs and the ENs. In HRL 087727, dated September 21, 1990, Customs ruled that
the class ``preserving jars of glass is limited to merchandise in the sizes and shapes of typical `Mason-type' preserving
jars which hold the volumes typical of preserve jars (i.e., one half pint to one half gallon).'' Additionally, EN 70.10
pg. 933-934, states, in pertinent part, that ``[t]he heading also includes preserving jars of glass''. 
Preserving jars are not defined in the heading or ENs. A tariff term that is not defined in the HTSUS or in the ENs is construed
in accordance with its common and commercial meaning. 

Nippon Kogasku (USA) Inc. v. United States,

 69 CCPA 89, 673 F.2d 380 (1982). Common and commercial meaning may be determined by consulting dictionaries, lexicons,
scientific authorities and other reliable sources. 

C.J. Tower & Sons v. United States,

 69 CCPA 128, 673 F.2d 1268 (1982). The term ``preserving'' is described, in pertinent part, as ``[t]o prepare food
for future use, as by canning or salting; to treat fruit or other foods so as to prevent decay''. Webster's II New Riverside
University Dictionary, (1984). 
Based upon the above definition, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Extension Service, Complete Guide to Home Canning:
Guide 1 Principles of Home Canning (Agricultural Information Bulletin No. 539-1, May 1989), and consultation
with members of the home canning trade, Customs proposed position is that the principal use for the class ``preserving
jars of glass'' is jars purchased and used for home canning only. Further, Customs understands that there are identifiable
characteristics that are indicative, but not conclusive of the principal use of glass jars classifiable as ``preserving
jars of glass''. These would include:

 

Glass articles of any shape that are between .23 and 2.2 liter sizes, and are regular and wide-mouth ``Mason-type'',
threaded, home-canning jars with self-sealing lids.

 

Generally, the standard jar mouth opening is about 23/8 inches with wide mouth jars having 3 inch openings. ``Mason-type''
jars have narrower sealing surfaces and are tempered less than most commercial pint and quart-size jars. The common
self-sealing lid consists of a flat metal lid held in place by a metal screw band during processing. The flat lid is crimped
around its bottom edge to form a trough, which is filled with a colored gasket compound. These physical criteria are
based on Customs understanding of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Extension Service, Complete Guide to Home
Canning: Guide 1 Principles of Home Canning (Agricultural Information Bulletin No. 539-1, May 1989), pgs.
14-15 and discussion with members of the trade.


Additionally, on page 11 of the above mentioned bulletin, under the subtitle ``Equipment and methods not recommended'',
this publication indicates that jars with wire bails and glass caps and one-piece zinc porcelain lined caps are not
recommended for home canning. We note that these ``non Mason-type'' jars are often advertised and sold in sets of varying
sizes for use in the storage of goods in the home. Thus, it is Customs proposed position that they are classifiable under
subheading 7013.39, HTSUS.

Under Customs proposed position, the only type of glass article classifiable as part of the class or kind ``preserving
jars of glass'', would be regular and wide-mouth ``Mason-type'', threaded, home-canning jars with self-sealing
lids. Glass articles with wire bails and glass or porcelain caps or lids would not be classifiable as ``preserving
jars of glass'' as their physical characteristics do not allow them to be recommended for home canning use. 


Glassware of a Kind Used for Table or Kitchen Purposes Glass Storage Articles 


Based on the plain language of the heading, Customs is of the opinion that subheading 7013.39, HTSUS, provides for
the class ``glassware of a kind used for table or kitchen purposes''. 
Customs position is based on exemplars from EN 70.13, which we believe demonstrate that the class ``glassware of a
kind used for table or kitchen purposes'' provides for certain glass articles principally used for household storage.
EN 70.13, pg. 936-937, states, in pertinent part, that:

 

[T]his heading covers the following types of articles, most of which are obtained by pressing or blowing in moulds:

(1) [T]able or kitchen glassware, e.g., drinking glasses, goblets, tankards, decanters, infants' feeding bottles,
pitchers, jugs, plates, salad bowls, sugar-bowls, sauce-boats, fruit-stands, cake-stands, hors-d'oeuvres dishes,
bowls, basins, egg-cups, butter dishes, oil or vinegar cruets, dishes (for serving, cooking, etc.) stew-pans, casseroles,
trays, salt cellars, sugar sifters, knife-rests, mixers, table hand bells, coffee-pots and coffee-filters, sweetmeat
boxes, graduated kitchenware, plate warmers, table mats, certain parts of domestic churns, cups for coffee-mills,
cheese dishes, lemon squeezers, ice-buckets * * *



Customs understands that the exemplars listed are articles principally used to hold or store other articles in the
home. We believe that among these articles, certain glass storage jars may also be principally used in this fashion.
Therefore, glass articles which are principally used to store articles in the home are classifiable under subheading
7013.39, HTSUS. 
After reviewing the ENs, relevant HRL's, and applying the principal use factors, which are indicative but not conclusive,
for determining whether merchandise falls within a particular class or kind, Customs has identified the following
characteristics which we believe are indicative, but not conclusive of glassware of a kind used for table or kitchen
purposes; glass household storage articles. They are glass articles:

 

1. Made of ordinary glass, lead crystal glass, glass having a low coefficient of expansion (e.g., borosilicate glass)
or of glass ceramics (the latter two in particular, for kitchen glassware). They may also be colourless, coloured
or of flashed glass, and may be cut, frosted, etched or engraved; 
2. Having a decorative motif consistent with a kitchen decor (e.g., geese, ``country theme'', etc.); 
3. Which the consumer purchases primarily to use for storage in the home; 
4. Sold from the importer to a wholesaler/distributor who then sells them to a retailer; 
5. Sold in an environment of sale that emphasizes the article's use or reuse as a storage article; 
6. Sold to the ultimate purchaser empty; 
7. Which are recognized in the trade as primarily having a household storage use; and 
8. Which are imported with their caps or lids.

<TEXT>
 

This understanding is based on the above cited EN and relevant HRLs. HRL 953282, dated February 16, 1993, classified
a 1 liter glass jar decorated with a blue ribbon and decalmania which created a country motif band in blue, pink, green
and yellow around the middle of the jar. Customs held that, while the container did convey goods, its decoration, lid,
and environment of sale all indicated that the principal use of the container was for storage, not the conveyance of
goods. See also, HRL 087727, dated September 21, 1990, which classified spice jars as household storage jars.

Customs proposes to continue to apply the standards outlined above. We note that due to the USDA report's recommendation
that glass articles with wire bale and trigger closures (non ``Mason-type'') not be used for home canning, but rather
as storage articles for dry ingredients, all glass articles with wire bale trigger closures and glass caps or lids
will be classifiable under subheading 7013.39, HTSUS.

However, we note that there are glass articles capable of both conveyance or packing of goods and household storage,
as demonstrated in the Kraft case. Instances of these types of articles will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, with
the above outlined characteristics determining the article's principal use and classification.

<DOCTITLE>Departmental Offices; Debt Management Advisory Committee; Meeting</DOCTITLE>



Notice is hereby given, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. App. Section 10(a)(2), that a meeting will be held at the U.S. Treasury
Department, 15th and Pennsylvania Avenue NW., Washington, DC, on November 1 and 2, 1994, of the following debt management
advisory committee:




Public Securities Association

RTreasury Borrowing Advisory Committee




The agenda for the meeting provides for a technical background briefing by Treasury staff on November 1, followed
by a charge by the Secretary of the Treasury or his designate that the committee discuss particular issues, and a working
session. On November 2, the committee will present a written report of its recommendations.

The background briefing by Treasury staff will be held at 11:30 a.m. Eastern time on November 1 and will be open to the
public. The remaining sessions on November 1 and the committee's reporting session on November 2 will be closed to
the public, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. App. Section 10(d).

This notice shall constitute my determination, pursuant to the authority placed in heads of departments by 5 U.S.C.
App. Section 10(d) and vested in me by Treasury Department Order No. 101-05, that the closed portions of the meeting
are concerned with information that is exempt from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. Section 552b(c)(9)(A). The public interest
requires that such meetings be closed to the public because the Treasury Department requires frank and full advice
from representatives of the financial community prior to making its final decision on major financing operations.
Historically, this advice has been offered by debt management advisory committees established by the several major
segments of the financial community. When so utilized, such a committee is recognized to be an advisory committee
under 5 U.S.C. App. Section 3.

Although the Treasury's final announcement of financing plans may not reflect the recommendations provided in reports
of the advisory committee, premature disclosure of the committee's deliberations and reports would be likely to
lead to significant financial speculation in the securities market. Thus, these meetings fall within the exemption
covered by 5 U.S.C. Section 552b(c)(9)(A).

The Office of the Under Secretary for Domestic Finance is responsible for maintaining records of debt management
advisory committee meetings and for providing annual reports setting forth a summary of committee activities and
such other matters as may be informative to the pubic consistent with the policy of 5 U.S.C. Section 552b.

<DOCTITLE>Tax on Certain Imported Substances (Phosphorous Trichloride, et al.); Notice of Determinations </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>

 Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Treasury. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice announces determinations, under Notice 89-61, that the list of taxable substances in section 4672(a)(3)
will be modified to include phosphorous trichloride and phosphorous pentasulfide. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



Background



Under section 4672(a), an importer or exporter of any substance may request that the Secretary determine whether
such substance should be listed as a taxable substance. The Secretary shall add such substance to the list of taxable
substances in section 4672(a)(3) if the Secretary determines that taxable chemicals constitute more than 50 percent
of the weight, or more than 50 percent of the value, of the materials used to produce such substance. This determination
is to be made on the basis of the predominant method of production. Notice 89-61, 1989-1 C.B. 717, sets forth
the rules relating to the determination process.



Determination 



On September 29, 1994, the Secretary determined that phosphorous trichloride and phosphorous pentasulfide should
be added to the list of taxable substances in section 4672(a)(3), effective January 1, 1995. The rate of tax prescribed
for phosphorous trichloride, under section 4671(b)(3), is $3.10 per ton. This is based upon a conversion factor for
phosphorous of 0.23 and a conversion factor for chlorine of 0.77.

The rate of tax prescribed for phosphorous pentasulfide, under section 4671(b)(3), is $1.24 per ton. This is based
upon a conversion factor for phosphorous of 0.28. The petitioner is Monsanto Company, a manufacturer and exporter
of these substances. No material comments were received on these petitions. The following information is the basis
for the determinations.



Phosphorous Trichloride





HTS number:

 2812.10.50.10 



CAS number:

 7719-12-2 




Phosphorous trichloride is derived from the taxable chemicals phosphorous and chlorine. Phosphorous trichloride
is a liquid produced predominantly by the direct union of phosphorous and chlorine.

The stoichiometric material consumption formula for phosphorous trichloride is: 




P

4

 (phosphorous) + 6 Cl

2

 (chlorine) __-

>

 4 PCl

3

 (phosphorous trichloride) 





Phosphorous trichloride has been determined to be a taxable substance because a review of its stoichiometric material
consumption formula shows that, based on the predominant method of production, taxable chemicals constitute 100
percent by weight of the materials used in its production.



Phosphorous Pentasulfide 





HTS number:

 2813.90.20.00 



CAS number:

 1314-80-3 



Phosphorous pentasulfide is derived from the taxable chemical phosphorous. Phosphorous pentasulfide is a solid
produced predominantly by mixing molten phosphorous with molten sulfur. 

The stoichiometric material consumption formula for phosphorous pentasulfide is: 





P

4

 (phosphorous) + 10 S (sulfur) __-

>

 2 P

2

S

5

 (phosphorous pentasulfide) 





Phosphorous pentasulfide has been determined to be a taxable substance because a review of its stoichiometric material
consumption formula shows that, based on the predominant method of production, taxable chemicals constitute 94.6
percent by value of the materials used in its production. The stated cost for phosphorous is $0.91 per pound and the
stated cost for sulfur is $0.02 per pound.

<USDEPT>OFFICE OF UNITED STATES TRADE REPRESENTATIVE</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Report of Trade Expansion Priorities Pursuant to Executive Order 12901</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of United States Trade Representative.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Notice is hereby given that the United States Trade Representative (USTR) has submitted the report published herein
to the Committee on Finance of the United States Senate and the Committee on Ways and Means of the United States House
of Representatives identifying trade expansion priorities pursuant to Executive Order 12901 of March 3, 1994.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The text of the USTR report is as follows:


Identification of Trade Expansion Priorities Pursuant to Executive Order 12901




This report is submitted pursuant to Executive Order 12901 of March 3, 1994. Under the Executive Order the United States
Trade Representative is required, by September 30, 1994, to ``review United States trade expansion priorities and
identify priority foreign country practices, the elimination of which is likely to have the most significant potential
to increase United States exports, either directly or through the establishment of a beneficial precedent.''

In identifying priority foreign country practices, the Trade Representative must take into account all relevant
factors, including:


(a) The major barriers and trade distorting practices described in the National Trade Estimate Report;

(b) The trade agreements to which a foreign country is a party and its compliance with those agreements;

(c) The medium-term and long-term implications of foreign government procurement plans; and

<TEXT>
 

(d) The international competitive position and export potential of United States products and services.

The Executive Order permits the Trade Representative to include, if appropriate, ``a description of the foreign
country practices that may in the future warrant identification as priority foreign country practices.'' The Trade
Representative may also include ``a statement about other foreign country practices that were not identified because
they are already being addressed by provisions of United States trade law, existing bilateral trade agreements,
or in trade negotiations with other countries and progress is being made toward their elimination.''



The Global Context



Changes in the world economy, reinforced by the end of the Cold War, have opened up new opportunities in the global marketplace.
The United States is well-positioned to take advantage of these opportunities. We are unsurpassed in innovation
and flexibility. Gains in productivity have fueled our competitiveness. Our higher education is unsurpassed. Our
workers are the most skilled and productive in the world.

This new world is extremely competitive. In order to remain successful, we must pursue a strategy consisting of two
interrelated parts: trade policies that will open markets around the world; and domestic policies that will help
American companies and workers to remain the most productive in the world. This two-part strategy reflects the Administration's
fundamental goal of higher living standards for all Americans.

The single most important component of our trade strategy is the successful implementation of the Uruguay Round of
multilateral trade negotiations. The Uruguay Round agreements amount to a global tax cut of some $744 billion. They
will stimulate the creation of hundreds of thousands of jobs and, when fully implemented, add an estimated $100-200
billion to the U.S. GDP annually.

The Uruguay Round agreements contain improvements in market access worldwide for goods and services, improved rules
for trade, a new agreement protecting intellectual property worldwide, and dramatically improved procedures to
enforce our rights. The improvements in dispute settlement under the new World Trade Organization (WTO) can provide
real assurance to our exports that our gains at the bargaining table will be translated into real market opportunities,
and that any impairment of our rights to market access will have an expeditious remedy. But these benefits, scheduled
to go into effect on January 1, 1995, will materialize only if Congress has adopted legislation approving and implementing
the Uruguay Round agreements. For this reason, the Administration urges expeditious approval of the Uruguay Round
Agreements Act, which the President submitted to Congress on September 27.



Enforcement


The Administration remains committed to vigorous enforcement of our rights under trade agreements_both our rights
at present, and the expanded rights we will have when the Uruguay Round results enter into effect. Section 301 will
remain an essential element of our strategy in enforcing our rights in the new WTO system. Under WTO dispute settlement
procedures, we will be authorized to retaliate against the trade of any government found to be violating our rights,
if that government does not either eliminate the violation or provide compensation acceptable to us. Such realization
would be carried out under the authority of section 301 as a matter of U.S. trade law.

Section 301 will also remain an important tool in addressing unfair practices not covered under the Uruguay Round
agreements. And it will be available to us when we encounter trade-restricting practices by either non-members of
the WTO or governments to which we do not apply the Uruguay Round agreements.

Priority Foreign Country Practices



As a result of the review under Executive Order 12901 and the results to date of intensive negotiations, the Trade Representative
has decided not to identify any priority foreign country practices at this time.

We have had serious, long-standing concerns regarding access to the Japanese market for flat glass. We have reached
agreement with Japan in principle concerning access to the distribution system and access to the public and private
construction markets for flat glass in Japan, and have also agreed to work to finalize that agreement within the next
thirty days.



Other Practices



A. The following practices may in the future warrant identification as priority foreign country practices:




_Japan market access for wood and paper:




In the 1990 U.S.-Japan Wood Products Agreement, Japan agreed to substantially reduce tariffs, to reduce subsidies,
to speed up product certification, and to adopt performance-based standards and building codes. Progress has been
made, but new or existing barriers continue to impede market access. Tariffs, although reduced in the Uruguay Round,
remain a significant impediment. Adoption of performance-based standards and building codes has been slow and Japan
maintains a parallel unliberalized set of building standards for housing loans. Subsidies to the wood products industry
appear to have risen. We seek further market opening through the elimination of these remaining barriers.

In April 1992, Japan agreed to take GATT-consistent measures to increase substantially market access in Japan for
foreign paper and paperboard products, to realize the objective in the January 1992 Bush-Miyazawa action plan of
January 1992 ``to substantially increase market access for foreign firms exporting paper products to Japan.'' Four
consultations have been held under the agreement. In the Uruguay Round, Japan agreed to join a Quad country consensus
to cut tariffs on paper to zero over 10 years. However, Japan has failed to provide detailed information on the degree
to which Japanese government agencies are implementing provisions which obligate them to actively encourage use
of foreign products by end-users in key market segments. We seek a full accounting by all appropriate entities within
the Japanese government on their implementation of the agreement, as well as other measures to augment the agreement
and make it more effective.

B. The following foreign country practices were determined not to be appropriate for identification because they
are already being addressed by other provisions of United States trade law, existing bilateral agreements, or in
trade negotiations with other countries and progress is being made toward their elimination. They do, however, remain
significant trade negotiating objectives for the United States.




_European Union Utilities Directive: Under the European Union's Utilities Directive, which took effect on January
1, 1993, telecommunications utilities in 8 EU member countries now penalize bids by U.S. suppliers containing over
50% non-EU content and May reject such bids completely. In May 1993, the U.S. implemented sanctions against the EU
under Title VII of the 1988 Trade Act. These sanctions ban the purchase by the U.S. government of certain goods and services
from these 8 countries. We will continue to seek removal of the discriminatory aspects of the Directive through negotiation
with the EU.

_Canada dairy and poultry measures: In implementing the Uruguay Round, Canada intends to convert its existing import
quotas on dairy products, chicken, turkey and eggs to tariff-rate quotas, and raise its bound tariffs on these products.
Canada has also stated its intention to apply these tariffs on imports from the United States. We believe such an action
would reduce our access to the Canadian market. If it becomes appropriate, this matter could be addressed through
the NAFTA process.

_India market access for textiles: India severely restricts imports of textiles and apparel, and maintains high
tariffs. In implementing the Uruguay Round, the Administration has agreed to take all appropriate measures to obtain
market access commitments from any signatory to the WTO Agreement that is a significant exporter of textiles and apparel
to the United Sates and that we consider has failed to provide adequate access to its market for U.S. textile and apparel
products. We are currently engaged in negotiations with the Indian government and will continue to seek improvements
in market access for textiles and apparel.

_Korea market access for automobiles: Actions by the Korean government have built and reinforced perceptions among
Korean consumers that the purchase of a foreign car will lead to government harassment. Other barriers to imports
include excise taxes, high tariffs, standards barriers, distribution restrictions and a ban on 
 private sector retail financing. The Korean government has taken some steps to address these barriers and
has pledged to take others. Our continuing consultations are aimed at ensuring that the remaining barriers are addressed
and that the Korean government's actions result in improved access for imported motor vehicles.

_Intellectual property rights protection ion China: On June 30, through the ``Special 301'' process under Section
182 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2242), the Trade Representative designated China as a priority foreign
country, and initiated a section 301 investigation of China's failure to provide adequate and effective protection
of intellectual property rights and fair and equitable market access to persons relying on intellectual property
protection. Negotiations with the Chinese government to address these concerns are ongoing. By December 31, 1994,
the Trade Representative will be required to determine whether China's failure to address our concerns represents
an unreasonable or discriminatory burden or restriction on U.S. commerce and whether trade action is appropriate.

_Financial services market access negotiations: The WTO Agreement provides for continuing market access negotiations
in the financial services sector, to conclude six months after its entry into force. The United States is seeking commitments
from a wide range of commercially important developed and developing countries to reduce or eliminate barriers to
the supply by U.S. financial services firms of financial services including banking, securities, insurance and
other financial services. If we do not achieve our objectives, we would maintain an exemption from the most-favored-nation
obligation of the General Agreement on Trade in Services.

_Telecommunications market access: The WTO Agreement provides for continuing market access negotiations in the
basic telecommunications services sector. These negotiations cover local, long-distance, and international
basic telecommunications services. In these negotiations, we will seek to ensure that U.S. firms may provide basic
telecommunications services in foreign markets both through facilities-based competition_including the right
to build, own, and operate domestic and international network facilities_and through the resale of services on existing
networks. We will also seek to ensure that U.S. companies can compete in foreign markets on reasonable and non-discriminatory
rates, terms, and conditions.

_Negotiations on accession to the World Trade Organization: The United States will also continue to seek market opening
for our goods and services, and to achieve protection of intellectual property rights abroad, in negotiating with
countries that are seeking admission as members to the World Trade Organization. The Agreement Establishing the
WTO requires that all members must provide market access, and the Administration is committed to gaining appropriate
market access from every applicant for membership.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Missing and Exploited Children's Program is administered by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention
(OJJDP). Pursuant to the provisions of Section 406 (a)(2) the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of
1974, as amended (42 U.S.C. 5576), OJJDP is publishing for public comment both a proposed long range plan and its Fiscal
Year 1995 program priorities for activities authorized under Title IV, the Missing Children's Act (42 U.S.C. 5651-5665a),
of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974, as amended (42 U.S.C. 5601 

et seq.

). Taking into consideration comments received on the proposed long range plan and program priorities, OJJDP will
develop and publish a Final long range plan and its Fiscal Year 1995 Program Priorities. The long range plan will describe
the Office's goals and strategies for Title IV activities over the next three years and specify particular program
activities OJJDP anticipates funding during Fiscal Year 1995 using Title IV funds.

 

ELIGIBILITY: 

The applicants must be public agencies or nonprofit private organizations, or combinations thereof to be eligible
for funding under Title IV the Missing Children's Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5651-5665a), of Juvenile Justice
and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974, as amended (42 U.S.C. 5601 

et seq.

). 


The actual solicitation of grant applications to implement program priorities for Fiscal Year 1995 will be published
at a later date in the 

Federal Register

. No proposals, concept papers, or other application materials should be submitted at this time. 


Introduction 


This Long Range Plan is designed to orchestrate the use of funds allocated by Congress under Title IV for services to
be provided to missing and exploited children and their families. OJJDP will use the Long Range Plan to establish a
series of goals, strategies, and programs. In total, the Plan will help OJJDP set annual priorities, develop program
goals and objectives, select applicants for award, and deliver technical assistance and training to the field. 
The Proposed Long Range Plan was developed by evaluating documents such as research reports, program publications,
and working papers available from Title IV fund recipients that address issues related to Title IV. The National Center
for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) provided the results of two focus groups involving parents and law enforcement
personnel who have been involved in family abduction cases reported to NCMEC. 
Two work sessions were held involving a multi-disciplinary group of attendees who were asked to identify critical
issues that should be addressed by a Title IV Long Range Plan. Those sessions included Title IV grantees as well as representatives
from other Federal agencies who deal with programs and services related to missing and exploited children. Input
gathered through these work sessions was given great weight in developing the plan. 


Nature of the Problem 


Much has been written by practitioners and researchers regarding the three major problem areas addressed by Title
IV: family abductions; non-family abductions; and child exploitation. The Long Range Plan takes into account current
knowledge about these three major categories of child victimization and the impact these events have on children
and families. The statistics and analysis on the following pages were obtained from the 1990 National Incidence Study
of Missing, Abducted, Runaway and Thrownaway Children in America (NISMART). 


Family Abduction 


There are an estimated 354,100 family abductions a year. Forty-six percent of these (an estimated 163,200 abductions)
involve concealment of the child, transporting the child out of state, or an intent by the abductor to keep the child
indefinitely or to permanently alter custody. Of this more serious category of abductions, a little over half are
perpetrated by men, noncustodial fathers and father figures. Most victims are children from ages 2 to 11. Half involve
unauthorized takings while half involve failures to return the child after an authorized visit or stay. Fifteen percent
of these abductions involve the use of force or violence and 75 to 85 percent involve interstate transportation of
the child. About half of family abductions occur before the marital relationship ends. Another 41 percent did not
occur until two or more years after a divorce or separation, usually after parents develop new households, move away,
develop new relationships, or become disenchanted with the legal system. Over half occur in the context of relationships
with a history of domestic violence. An estimated 49 percent of abductors have criminal records. A significant number
have a history of violent behavior, substance abuse, or emotional disturbance.

Abducted children suffer significant harm. It is not uncommon for child victims of family abduction to have their
names and appearance altered, to experience medical or physical neglect, unstable schooling, homelessness, or
frequent moves. They are often told lies about the abduction and the left-behind parent, even that the left-behind
parent is dead. Many child victims of family abduction experience substantial psychological consequences and emotional
distress. Trauma symptoms may be evident for up to four or five years after recovery. 


Non-Family Abduction 


An estimated 3,200 to 4,600 short-term non-family abductions are known to law enforcement each year. Of these, an
estimated 200 to 300 are stereotypical kidnappings where a child is gone overnight, is killed, is transported a distance
of 50 miles or more, or where the perpetrator intends to keep the child permanently. Young teenagers and girls are the
most common victims. Two-thirds of short-term abductions involve a sexual assault. A majority of the victims are
abducted from the street. Over 85 percent involve force, and over 75 percent involve use of a weapon. Most episodes
last less than a day. The number of short-term abductions is considered by most researchers and practitioners to be
underestimated due to police reporting methods and lack of reporting on the part of victims. Based on FBI data, there
were an estimated 43 to 147 stranger abduction homicides of children annually between 1976 and 1987. There are an estimated
114,600 attempted non-family (stranger) abductions each year, usually involving an attempt to lure a child into
a car. In a majority of these cases, the police were not contacted. 


Child Exploitation 


Children are at risk of being victimized as the result of a wide range of circumstances that fall into essentially three
categories; running away, being thrownaway by parents or guardians, or being otherwise lost or missing. 
There are an estimated 446,700 runaways from households each year. In addition, an estimated 12,800 children run
from juvenile facilities. Many children who run from households also run from facilities. About one third of these
runaways left home or a juvenile facility more than once. Of all runaways, 133,500 are without a secure and familiar
place to stay during their episode. More than a third of runaways run away more than once during the year. One in 10 go
a distance of more than 100 miles. Of runaways from juvenile facilities, almost one-half leave the state. Runaways
are mostly teenagers but almost 10 percent were aged 11 and younger. They tend to come disproportionately from step-parent
households. Family conflict seems to be the heart of most runaway episodes. Between 60 and 70 percent report being
seriously abused physically. Sexual abuse estimates range from 25 to 80 percent. Runaways, particularly chronic
runaways, are at higher risk for physical and sexual victimization, substance abuse, sexually transmitted diseases,
unintended pregnancies, violence, and suicide. 
There are an estimated 127,100 thrownaway children who are directly told to leave the household, have been away from
home and are not allowed back by a caretaker, whose caretaker makes no effort to recover a child who has run away, or who
has been abandoned or deserted. By comparison, there is 1 child who is a thrownaway for every 4 that are runaways. An
estimated 59,200 thrownaway children are without a secure and familiar place to stay during the episode. Most thrownaways
are older teenagers, but abandoned children tend to be young (half under the age of 4). Thrownaways are concentrated
in low income families and families without both natural parents. Compared to runaways, thrownaways experience
more violence and conflict within their families and are less likely to return home.

There are an estimated 438,200 children who are lost, injured, or otherwise missing each year. Of these, 139,100 cases
are serious enough that the police are called. Almost half involve children under 4. Most of these episodes last less
than a day. A fifth of the children experienced physical harm. Fourteen percent of the children were abused or assaulted
during the episode. 


 

Impact on Children and Families:

 The majority of families of missing children experience substantial psychological consequences and emotional
distress. The level of emotional distress equals or exceeds the emotional distress for other groups of individuals
exposed to trauma, such as combat veterans and victims of rape/assault/other violent crime. Families where the missing
child is subsequently recovered deceased exhibit the highest level of emotional distress. Once home, a third of the
missing children live in constant fear of a reabduction. Almost four-fifths of victims and families of missing children
do not receive mental health or counseling services. 



System Needs 



 

The Missing Children's Assistance Act of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974, as amended
describes services that the Administrator shall consider for funding. They are: establish and operate a national
24 hour toll-free telephone line and operate a national resource center and clearinghouse; coordinate public and
private programs which locate, recover, or reunite missing children with their legal custodians; to disseminate
nationally, information about innovative and model missing children's programs, services, and legislation; provide
technical assistance and training to law enforcement agencies, State and local governments, elements of the criminal
justice system, public and private nonprofit agencies, and individuals in the prevention, investigation, prosecution,
and treatment of the missing and exploited child case and in locating and recovering missing children; periodically
conduct national incidence studies; provide information to lawful use of school records and birth certificates
to identify and locate missing children; and to educate parents, children, and community agencies and organizations
in ways to prevent the abduction and sexual exploitation of children. The following critical issues describe needs
that should be addressed through a Long Range Plan for Title IV. They were the result of two work sessions held for the
purpose of developing this plan. 


 * Training at the community level for agency staffs. Not enough training is available to inform professionals
in a wide range of agencies about the relationship between missing and exploited children's issues and other community
problems. This training should promote the implementation of multi-disciplinary approaches and formal inter-agency
cooperation. 


 * Identifying the missing and exploited children problem in communities. Too many communities do not recognize
in measurable terms the nature and scope of problems of missing children and various forms of child exploitation.
Many communities do not recognize that they have a missing children problem. As a result, system-wide planning for
the allocation of resources does not address issues related to missing and exploited children and their families.



 * Developing executive level commitment. Executives of criminal and juvenile justice agencies who have
responsibility for missing and exploited children cases have not been adequately targeted to receive information
and training related to missing and exploited children. As a result, missing and exploited childrens' issues have
not been given the level of priority necessary to effect change. Insufficient emphasis has been placed on distilling
research and evaluation findings into information that is relevant to policy makers. 


 * Availability of Missing and Exploited Children programs on community and child safety. Community services
for missing children should be integrated into a larger community effort to promote child protection and overall
safety of neighborhoods. Community services should do more to promote child safety through linkages among the wide
range of community agencies that come in contact with missing and exploited children and their families. 


 * Training that provides communities with useful tools. Training should be practical, be targeted to specific
audiences, and provide communities with tools that can be used immediately to assess needs and reduce duplication
in the utilization of resources. 


 * Developing a Missing and Exploited Children Training Plan. A training plan using Title IV funds should be
developed that aligns training products and services to meet specific goals. Training should be used as a tool to market
services funded through Title IV. 


 * Developing methods for dealing with problems of chronic runaway and thrownaway children. This is an extremely
high risk population with which many agencies have little success. Chronic runaway and thrownaway children are very
likely to become missing or exploited.

<TEXT>
 

* Improving the enforcement and legal response to family abduction cases. The enforcement and legal systems
lack the knowledge and skill to deal with these cases effectively. Legal reform is needed to further define when a child
is considered missing in a family abduction case. 
 

 * Creating stronger linkages between human service agencies, the criminal justice system, and the juvenile
justice system. Currently there is a chasm between the justice system and human service agencies in providing services
to missing and exploited children and their families. Too many cases are passed back and forth among these two systems
rather than being handled through a comprehensive case management system. 
 

 * Developing a plan for marketing services available to communities through Title IV. A coherent plan of action
needs to be developed and implemented to expand the understanding of the services that are available to missing children
and their families from Missing Children grantees. Teleconferencing and other new technologies should be used to
promote more awareness of the dimensions of problems addressed by Title IV. State Clearinghouses could play a more
active role in disseminating information regarding missing and exploited children. 
 

 * Disseminating useful information from research and evaluation work funded by Title IV. Findings from research
and evaluation projects need to be translated into useful information that can be used in communities by practitioners.

 

 * Applying new information technologies in addressing the goals of Title IV. With discussion of an ``information
highway'' being built in the United States, Title IV activities should be more directly tuned to take advantage of
the potential benefits of information system technology. 
 

 * Further defining the role of non-profit organizations. The wide range of services provided by non-profit
organizations continues to evolve. As a result, there is a need to continue to define the role of these organizations
in relationship to other community agencies. A set of standards is needed for services provided by non-profit organizations
participating in Title IV related activities. 
 

 * Continuing the evolution of the role of State Clearinghouses. The number of state clearinghouses has grown
slowly but steadily. The roles of these organizations vary from state to state. Title IV has funded technical assistance
and training for state clearinghouses. The nature and scope of services to be provided to state clearinghouses should
be re-evaluated. 

 

Long Range Plan for Future Title IV Funding 


 

OJJDP funds need to be allocated to reach each of the three goals. Strategies can be implemented through multiple program
initiatives to include the National Resource Center and Clearinghouse mandated in Title IV. Overall, these goals
and strategies are designed to help communities to use 

existing community resources

 to improve the quality of services provided to missing and exploited children and their families through multi-disciplinary
approaches. 

 

Goal 1: Increase Awareness 


 

Title IV programs should focus on 

increasing awareness

 of problems related to missing and exploited children on the part of professionals and the general public. Linkages
between child victimization and future costs to society are not generally understood.

<PARENT> FR941012-2-00116 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Develop a series of clearly stated educational messages about missing and exploited children. 



These messages, delivered through media, teleconference, publications and other sources should be designed to
communicate the human, economic and social costs of the victimization of missing and exploited children and their
families. These materials should explain the need to prosecute offenders who commit crimes against children, point
to sources of human services, and promote prevention measures. These messages should translate the latest available
information about the nature of the problem into themes that can be clearly communicated in communities. 



Develop information vehicles for dissemination to targeted audiences. 




These vehicles could be public service announcements and other public education materials that are tailored to parents
and different professionals who see the evidence of the problem in communities. These materials should be of a type
that can be economically reproduced and widely distributed. 




Develop an approach for evaluating the effectiveness of these materials. 




Survey information or focus groups could be vehicles used to evaluate the ability of public education materials to
impart key facts about prevention, intervention services, and the need to prosecute crimes against children committed
by adults. 


Goal 2: Develop Effective Community Approaches 


OJJDP will identify, design, and make available 

effective community approaches 

for addressing the problems of missing and exploited children and their families. These approaches will deal with
specific aspects of family abduction, non-family abduction, thrownaway children, and otherwise missing children.



Strategies 


Evaluate relevant information from Title IV funded activities to identify gaps in existing knowledge and identify
ways to fill those needs. 



Information needs to be developed to establish risk factors that can be used to identify potential abductors in family
and non-family cases so that prevention and intervention tactics can be more sharply focused. More also needs to be
learned about relatively new categories of missing children such as thrownaways and otherwise lost children. 



Design multi-agency methods for dealing with specific types of missing and exploited children to include chronic
runaways, thrownaways, and victims of family abductions. 




Issues related to confidentiality and information sharing among the range of agencies involved in missing and exploited
children cases should be addressed in order to promote inter-agency collaboration. Comprehensive case management
methods should be adapted to address the needs of missing and exploited children and their families for each of the
categories of missing children cases. 



Develop training and technical assistance materials and prepare a Title IV Technical Assistance Catalogue.

A comprehensive Title IV training needs assessment for professionals and non-profit organizations who deal with
missing and exploited children and their families is needed. The training needs assessment should be updated regularly
to assure that OJJDP is apprised of emerging training needs in the field. OJJDP grantees should be asked to develop
training and technical assistance materials on effective practices that are developed during the course of their
projects. OJJDP should hold periodic meetings of Title IV grantees to promote information sharing and to assist OJJDP
in developing new methods that can be shared with other communities. 


Goal 3: Provide Assistance to Communities 


OJJDP should provide 

assistance to communities 

committed to implementing effective approaches to address the problem of missing and exploited children and their
families. This assistance would take the form of site visits, training, assessment reports, publications, teleconferences,
and other means of delivering technical assistance. 


Strategies 


Develop and implement a 

marketing plan 

for providing technical assistance and training to specific audiences. 



This marketing plan should first identify a pool of communities interested in making use of services supported by
Title IV. The marketing plan would be based on an analysis of the location of various types of child victimization related
to Title IV as well as past community interest in Title IV issues. OJJDP would then develop materials and methods for
marketing technical assistance and training to these communities. 





Fix responsibility 

within OJJDP for coordinating the delivery of technical assistance under Title IV. 



The Director of the Missing Children's Program should be responsible for directly managing the delivery of technical
assistance and training funded through Title IV. This work will include keeping central records of all requests for
information, training, and technical assistance as well as taking primary responsibility for assuring that those
services are of the highest possible quality.

Develop an ongoing process for 

evaluating 

technical assistance and training provided through Title IV. 



To complement training planning efforts and the assessment of technical assistance needs, OJJDP will expand efforts
to evaluate technical assistance and training funded through Title IV. Grantees who deliver these services will
be required to provide OJJDP with names and addresses of all individuals who request and received services through
Title IV. This information will be used by OJJDP to distribute evaluation surveys designed to assess the quality and
effectiveness of services delivered. 


Fiscal Year 1995 Programs 


The following are brief summaries of each of the proposed competitive and continuation programs for Fiscal Year 1995.
The estimated amounts, sites for implementation, and other descriptive information presented here are subject
to change based on the public comment process, grantee performance, application quality, fund availability, and
other factors. OJJDP has a limited amount of funds for competitive programs in FY 1995. Competitive programs are therefore
being proposed with funding levels subject to change based upon public comment. Competitive programs may be added
to the plan based on the review and comment process. 





Fiscal Year 1995 Programs 




Competitive Programs 




National Missing Children's Resource Center and Clearinghouse, $3,050,000 


This three year cooperative agreement will fund the operation of a national resource center and clearinghouse as
mandated in Section 404(b) (42 U.S.C. 5773). The clearinghouse is responsible for establishing and operating a 24
hour toll-free telephone line by which individuals may report information regarding the location of any missing
child, or other child 13 years of age or younger, whose whereabouts are unknown to such child's legal custodian, and
request information pertaining to procedures necessary to reunite the child and legal custodian. In addition, the
clearinghouse will be responsible for providing a wide range of assistance to State and local governments, public
and private non-profit agencies, and individuals. Specific assistance includes coordinating public and private
programs which locate, recover, or reunite missing children with their legal guardians, provide training and technical
assistance, disseminate information about innovative and 
model missing childrens' programs, and facilitate the lawful use of school records to identify and locate missing
children. 
Title IV Training and Technical Assistance $750,000 
OJJDP, through its Missing Children's Program, is committed to support the agencies and organizations that deliver
services related to the prevention of missing and exploited children cases, the location of missing children, the
recovery of those children, and the successful reunification of missing children to their legal guardian(s). Through
funding of relevant research and program demonstration projects, OJJDP produces information and work products
of use to agencies, organizations, victims, and families. OJJDP seeks to disseminate such information and work products
through the delivery of training and technical assistance to law enforcement, judges, prosecutors, schools, human
service agencies, medical service providers, non-profit organizations, and any other appropriate entity that
provides services to missing and exploited children and their families. 
To coordinate the delivery of information, work products, training, and technical assistance, OJJDP will issue
a Request for Proposals (RFP) for the development and management of an efficient and effective technical assistance
and training program for Title IV funded activities. The RFP will include services related to the design, development
and delivery of all new Title IV training and technical assistance based on work products and other results generated
by the experience of other Title IV grantees. The successful contractor will be responsible for incorporating existing
Title IV funded training into new programs where appropriate. 
OJJDP believes that this approach will standardize the training being delivered through Title IV, more efficiently
make use of Title IV funding, and strengthen quality control for the delivery of training and technical assistance.

Effective Community-Based Approaches for Dealing With Missing and Exploited Children $250,000

Private non-profit organizations (NPOs) in communities provide a vital service to the families of missing and exploited
children. These organizations were formed to play a role that is best fulfilled by community members who provide support
to each other during the ordeal many parents and children experience in missing and exploited children cases. Over
the last two years, private non-profit organizations have taken steps to further develop the quality and level services
to include forming a national organization. 
This three year program, to be awarded in two 18 month budget periods, is designed to provide training and technical
assistance that will support the continuing development of NPOs as a resource for providing services in communities
that other agencies may not be best suited to provide. This training and technical assistance would focus on assisting
NPOs in developing protocols that can be used to tailor their mission, goals, and services to the needs of communities.

The project will support up to five demonstration sites that have active missing and exploited children programs
in place and seek to strengthen the role of NPOs in providing services. Technical assistance will also be provided
on a request basis to individual NPO's. The applicant should consider missing and exploited children programs in
local community organizations as possible sites as well. 
Products that would be generated as a result of this project would include, but not be limited to, standardized intake
forms, procedures for communication with other agencies, guidelines for establishing a multi-disciplinary board
of directors, and an overall handbook for the operation of an NPO that is tailored to the delivery of services to missing
and exploited children and their families. 


Continuation Programs 


National Alzheimer's Patient Alert Program 
$750,000 
This project supports a national program to facilitate the identification and safe return of missing persons afflicted
with Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. During its third year of operation, this project will expand its
central registry of computerized information on memory impaired persons and a national toll-free telephone line
to access the registry; produce new informational materials including a promotional poster for use in the training
of law enforcement personnel and public education; and coordinate and enhance the case management efforts of existing
community based organizations including local chapters. No additional applications will be solicited in Fiscal
Year 1995. 
Missing and Exploited Children Comprehensive Action Program (M/CAP) 
$700,000 
The Missing and Exploited Children Comprehensive Action Program (M/CAP) is a national demonstration project designed
to promote the implementation of multi-agency community approaches for dealing with missing and exploited children
cases. The grantee for the final year of this project is Public Administration Services of McLean, Virginia.

During this final year of funding, assistance will be provided to project sites that are in the process of developing
their long range implementation plan. Training and technical assistance will also be provided to sites that have
adopted long range implementation plans. In addition, training and technical assistance materials will be developed
that can be incorporated into the Title IV Training and Technical Assistance Program. Existing M/CAP sites will be
encouraged to serve as regional technical assistance sites which will provide OJJDP with a mechanism to support the
delivery of services through the Title IV Training and Technical Assistance Program. No additional applications
will be solicited in Fiscal Year 1995. 

Child Abuse Training and Technical Assistance Program for Law Enforcement $500,000 

These funds are committed to a contract between OJJDP's Training and Technical Assistance Division and Fox Valley
Technical College of Appleton, Wisconsin. The funds will be used to support the delivery of child abuse investigation
courses, including information on the investigation of missing and exploited children cases. No additional applications
will be solicited in Fiscal Year 1995. 

Investigation and Prosecution of Parental Abduction Cases $250,000 

Through this project, Title IV funds are used to provide assistance to local prosecutors that will allow them to more
effectively prosecute non-custodial parents who abduct their children. The project will identify legal and social
issues in these cases that should be addressed, summarize and analyze current research in this area, identify experts
who have successfully prosecuted these cases, and produce legal analyses and guidelines that can be disseminated
to prosecutors and law enforcement agencies. 

The grantee for this program is the American Prosecutors Research Institute (APRI). No additional applications
will be solicited in Fiscal Year 1995. 

Model Treatment & Services Approaches for Mental Health Professions Working With Families of Missing Children
$195,000 

This project is designed to provide mental health professionals with effective treatment approaches for the rehabilitation
of families traumatized by child abduction so that a state of normalcy can be established in the aftermath of such events.
During Fiscal Year 1995, training manuals and support materials will be developed that can be used during the implementation
of treatment models defined during the project.

The grantee for the final year of this multi-year project is the Western Center for Child Protection. No additional
applications will be solicited in Fiscal Year 1995. 

Investigative Case Management for Missing Children Homicides $150,000 

This project is designed to improve investigative procedures for investigating murders of missing, abducted, or
runaway children as well as to improve the rate of apprehension and prosecution of serial murderers of children. The
project addresses evidence gathering, forensic evidence techniques, methods for determining linkages among child
murder cases, and enhancing coordination of child homicide cases among law enforcement agencies nationwide. 

The project will develop a resource management guide which will contain methods, procedures, and a checklist for
investigation of a missing child homicide. The project also calls for the delivery of technical assistance and training
for state and local law enforcement agencies. 

The grantee for this project is the Criminal Investigation Division of the State of Washington Attorney General's
Office. The program is supported by America's Law Enforcement Retiree Team (ALERT) volunteers from the National
Center for Missing and Exploited Children. No additional applications will be solicited in Fiscal Year 1995. 

Multi-jurisdictional, Interagency Model for Investigating and Prosecuting Cases of Child Sexual Abuse $100,000


This is a program that is jointly funded with $50,000 of Title IV funds and $50,000 from the Office for Victims of Crime
(OVC). In Fiscal Year 1995 this program will develop and implement prototype multi-jurisdictional task forces for
the investigation and prosecution of cases involving sexual exploitation of children. These tasks forces are to
be formed in up to five communities throughout the United States that include Federal, state, and local authorities.


Funds for this project cannot be used for law enforcement efforts, but must be targeted to assist child and youth victims
in crisis, to provide staff training, and promote public awareness. 

This is the second year of a cooperative agreement between OJJDP, OVC and the Education Development Center, Inc. No
additional applications will be solicited in Fiscal Year 1995. 

Missing Children Data Archive $25,000 

Through this program, OJJDP makes available all data sets produced as the result of funded research addressing missing
and exploited children and their families in a readily understandable, documented data archive. OJJDP provides
this service through a cooperative agreement with the University of Michigan whose staff prepare missing and exploited
children data and documentation to conform to generally accepted standards. No additional applications will be
solicited in Fiscal Year 1995.

I. Codification of Federal Transit Laws 



On July 5, 1995, President Clinton signed Public Law 103-272, which codifies Federal transit laws under title
49, chapter 53 of the United States Code. The enactment of Public Law 103-272 repeals the FT Act without substantive
change, which means that the original meaning of the FT Act provisions are unchanged by this codification, even though
the new language in some instances differs from that of the FT Act. The codification includes laws enacted through
June 30, 1993. Provisions enacted after that date, and revisions to title 49, chapter 53, will be reflected in subsequent
legislation now being drafted in Congress. This Notice accordingly uses the new form of citation followed by the relevant
FT Act citation in parentheses. Listed below are the most commonly used citations: 






II. Background 



Urbanized Area Formula Program funds are apportioned by statutory formula to urbanized areas and to the Governors
to provide capital, operating and planning assistance in urbanized areas. Nonurbanized Area Formula Program funds
are apportioned by statutory formula to the States for capital and operating assistance in nonurbanized areas. Elderly
and Persons with Disabilities Program funds are apportioned by statutory formula to the States to provide capital
assistance to organizations providing transportation service for elderly persons and persons with disabilities.
Interstate Substitute Transit funds are apportioned by formula to areas that have withdrawn planned interstate
routes. Fixed Guideway Modernization Formula funds are apportioned by statutory formula to specified urbanized
areas for capital improvements in rail and other fixed guideways. Funds appropriated under the Metropolitan Planning
Program are apportioned by a statutory formula to the States for allocation by them to Metropolitan Planning Organizations
(MPOs) in urbanized areas or portions thereof. Appropriated funds under the State Planning and Research Program
also are apportioned to States by a statutory formula. New Start earmarks in the 1995 DOT Appropriations Act and all
Bus fund allocations in its accompanying Conference Report are also included in this Notice. 



III. Overview of Appropriations for Grant Programs 



A. General 



In fiscal year 1995, the appropriation for the Urbanized Area Formula and Nonurbanized Area Formula Programs is $2,416,847,844.
Of this amount, 94.50 percent ($2,283,921,213) is made available to the Urbanized Area Formula Program; and 5.50
percent ($132,926,631) is made available to the Nonurbanized Area Formula Program. The other program appropriations
contained in this Notice are as follows: $4,612,500 for the Rural Transit Assistance Program (RTAP); $59,152,156
for the Elderly and Persons with Disabilities Program; $41,512,500 for the Metropolitan Planning Program; $8,475,000
for the State Planning and Research Program; $48,030,000 for the Interstate Substitute Transit Program; and $1,725,000,000
for the Capital Program. Of the Capital Program amount, $725,000,000 is for Fixed Guideway Modernization, $646,670,000
is for New Starts and $353,330,000 is for Bus. 

Table 1 displays the amounts appropriated for these programs, including adjustments and final apportionment/allocation
amounts. The text following this table provides a narrative explanation for the funding levels and other factors
affecting these apportionments/allocations.

FTA urges that grantees incorporate to the extent possible the concepts of ``livable communities'' into the transit
and planning projects funded with Federal assistance being made available by this Notice and funds transferred from
highway programs. The Livable Communities Initiative recognizes that transit programs can be instrumental in shaping
the nature of community development and represent an important tool for enhancing the vitality of individual communities
and neighborhoods served by our regional transit systems. Transit facilities and stations can become energetic
local activity centers providing convenient shopping, business, and educational opportunities as well as other
needed social services like health and day care. They can serve as focal points for attractive mixed used development.
Transit services, appropriately sized to community needs, can bind the community together and provide an environmentally
attractive alternative to automobile travel and a safe and affordable means of transport for those who might otherwise
find it difficult to have full access to community activities. 
Livable communities concepts include: (1) Careful coordination of transit planning with community development
planning leading to neighborhoods where housing, schools, and parks are within easy walking distance of user-friendly
transit that links residents with local social and economic services and jobs; (2) alternatives to the automobile
such as transit, pedestrian, and bicycle access and operational improvements such as guaranteed ride home services,
neighborhood shuttles, and user-friendly fare collection systems that encourage transit use; (3) mixed-use neighborhoods
with residential areas complemented by office and commercial development, green or open spaces, and public services
(also transit facilities such as major bus stops or train stations are designed to include , other enterprises that
are useful to transit passengers, e.g., day care centers); (4) safe, secure, and customer-friendly streets, transit
facilities, and pedestrian walkways; and (5) full community participation in the decision-making process by neighborhood
organizations, small and minority businesses, and interested individuals. 
FTA will soon be issuing guidance on the Livable Communities Initiative. This initiative will highlight and demonstrate
the benefits of livable communities by providing technical assistance along with a limited amount of funding for
planning and capital grants. 


C. 1996 Summer Olympic Games 


The 1995 DOT Appropriations Act has made available $16,000,000 for costs associated with unique transportation
requirements of the Centennial Olympic Games and Paralympic Games, which will take place in Atlanta, Georgia, in
summer 1996. These funds will be used for the round-trip delivery costs and preparation of roughly 2,000 buses being
made available by transit authorities around the country to support the unique transportation requirements of the
Olympic and Paralympic Games. 


D. Project Management Set-Aside 


49 U.S.C. 5327 (formerly Section 23 of the FT Act), allows the Secretary of Transportation to use not more than one-half
of one percent of the funds made available under the Capital Program, the Urbanized Area Formula and Nonurbanized
Area Formula Programs, the National Capital Transportation Act, as amended, and the Interstate Substitute Transit
Program, and an additional one-quarter of one percent of Capital Program funds, to contract with any person to oversee
the construction of any major project under these statutory programs and to conduct safety, procurement, management
and financial reviews and audits. Therefore, one-half of one percent of the funds appropriated for fiscal year 1995
for the programs noted above, and three-quarters of one percent of Capital Program funds have been reserved for this
purpose before apportionment of the funds. 


IV. Urbanized Area Formula Program (Formerly Section 9) 


A. Total Urbanized Area Formula Apportionments 


In addition to the appropriated fiscal year 1995 Urbanized Area Formula funds of $2,283,921,213, the apportionment
also includes $24,351,386 in deobligated Urbanized Area Formula funds (including formerly Section 5 formula funds)
which have become available for reapportionment under the Urbanized Area Formula Program as provided for under 49
U.S.C. 5336(i) (formerly section 9(o)). 
Table 2 displays the amount apportioned for the Urbanized Area Formula Program. After the one-half percent set-aside
($11,419,606), the amount appropriated under this program is 
$2,272,501,607. The funds to be reapportioned, described in the previous paragraph, were then added. Thus, the total
amount apportioned for this program is $2,296,852,993. 


B. Data Used for Urbanized Area Formula Apportionments

<TEXT>
 

Data from the 1993 National Transit Database (Section 15) Report Year submitted in late 1993 and early 1994 have been
used to calculate the fiscal year 1995 Urbanized Area Formula apportionments for urbanized areas over 200,000 in
population. The population and population density figures used in calculating the Urbanized Area Formula are from
the 1990 Census. 


C. Adjustments for Energy and Operating Efficiencies 


49 U.S.C. 5336(b)(2) (formerly section 9(b)(4) of the FT Act) provides that, if a recipient under this section demonstrates
to the satisfaction of the Secretary that energy or operating efficiencies would be achieved by actions that reduce
revenue vehicle miles but provide the same frequency of revenue service to the same number of riders, the recipient's
apportionment under 49 U.S.C. 5336 (formerly Section 9(b)(2)(A)) shall not be reduced as a result of such actions.
One recipient has submitted data acceptable to FTA in accordance with this provision. Accordingly, the revenue vehicle
miles used in the Urbanized Area Formula database to calculate the fiscal year 1995 Urbanized Area Formula apportionment
reflect the amount the recipient would have received without the reductions in mileage. 


D. Repayment of Temporary Matching Fund Waivers 


Under the Temporary Matching Fund Waiver provision authorized at 49 U.S.C. 5307(i)(3) (formerly Section 9(g)(3)),
grantees have been able to request a Federal share of 100 percent up to the area's total apportionment. Four grants
or amendments have been awarded which employ the temporary waiver of local matching funds for Urbanized Area Formula
grants approved in fiscal years 1992 and 1993. The local share amounts for these grants had to 
be repaid by March 30, 1994. If not repaid, the amount owed will be deducted from the area's fiscal years 1995 and 1996
Urbanized Area Formula apportionments. 
All affected grantees have opted to have their future apportionments reduced rather than pay back funds. Accordingly,
the FTA is reducing the areas' future apportionments to reflect the amount owed. The local share payment amount for
each project was determined by dividing the project's total disbursement amount through September 30, 1994, by the
project's total Federal capital obligations. The calculated percentage was then applied to the project's original
local share waived amount. Of the calculated amount determined for repayment, 50 percent has been deducted from the
fiscal year 1995 Urbanized Area Formula apportionment. The remaining 50 percent will be deducted in fiscal year 1996.
The dollar amounts published in this Notice reflect these fiscal year 1995 adjustments, and the affected areas have
been so advised. 


E. Urbanized Area Formula Fiscal Year 1995 Apportionments to Governors 


The total Urbanized Area Formula apportionment to the Governor for use in areas under 200,000 in population for each
State is shown on Table 2. Table 2 also contains the total apportionment amount attributable to each of the urbanized
areas within the State. The Governor may determine the allocation of funds among the urbanized areas under 200,000
in population with one exception. As further discussed below, funds attributed to an urbanized area under 200,000,
which is within the planning boundaries of a transportation management area, must be obligated in that area. 


F. Urbanized Area Formula Operating Assistance 


Limitations 


The fiscal year 1995 limitations on the amount of Urbanized Area Formula funds that may be used for operating assistance
are included in Table 2 with the fiscal year 1995 apportionment. 
The operating assistance limitations for all urbanized areas 
have been increased under 49 U.S.C. 5336(d)(2) (formerly section 9(k)(2)(B) of the FT Act) to reflect the increase
in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all urban consumers during the most recent calendar years. The CPI Detailed Report,
December 1993, published by the Department of Labor (DOL), indicates the calendar year 1993 CPI increase for all urban
consumers is 2.7 percent. This increase was applied against the base operating assistance limitation calculated
under 49 U.S.C. 5336(d)(2) (formerly section 9(k)(2)(A) of the FT Act). 
This increase results in an overall national fiscal year 1995 
authorized operating assistance limitation level of $1,083,663,529. 
However, the 1995 DOT Appropriations Act limits the nationwide 
availability for operating assistance to a maximum of $710,000,000. Accordingly, the operating assistance limitation
published in this 
Notice takes into account both the 1995 DOT Appropriations Act and 
Federal transit laws. Therefore, the higher operating assistance limitation under Federal transit laws ($1,083,663,529)
has been reduced to the $710,000,000 required by the 1995 DOT Appropriations Act by taking a pro rata reduction across
all categories of grantees.

G. Statewide Operating Assistance Limitations 



49 U.S.C. 5307(a)(2) (formerly section 9(m)(1) of the FT Act) specifies that in any case in which a statewide agency
or instrumentality is responsible under State laws for the financing, construction and operation, directly, by
lease, contract or otherwise, of public transportation services, and when such statewide agency or instrumentality
is the designated recipient of FTA funds, and when the statewide agency or instrumentality provides service among
two or more urbanized areas, the statewide agency or instrumentality shall be allowed to apply for operating assistance
up to the combined total permissible amount of all urbanized areas in which it provides service, regardless of whether
the amount for any particular urbanized area is exceeded. 



H. Designated Transportation Management Areas 



All urbanized areas over 200,000 in population have been 
designated as transportation management areas (TMAs), in accordance 
with 49 U.S.C. 5305 (formerly section 8(i)(1) of the FT Act). These designations were formally made in a 

Federal Register

 Notice dated May 18, 1992 (57 FR 21160), signed by the Federal Highway Administrator and the Federal Transit Administrator.
Additional areas may be designated as TMAs upon the request of the Governor and the MPO designated for such area or the
affected local officials. As of October 1, 1994, two additional TMAs have been formally designated: Petersburg,
Virginia, comprised solely of the Petersburg, Virginia, urbanized area; and Santa Barbara, Santa Maria, and Lompoc,
California, which were designated as one TMA. 

Guidance for setting the boundaries of TMAs is contained in the joint transportation planning regulations published
in the 

Federal Register

 on October 28, 1993 (58 FR 58040). In some cases, the TMA boundaries which have been established by the MPO for the designated
TMA also include one or more urbanized areas under 200,000 in population. Where this situation exists, the discretion
of the Governor to allocate urbanized area formula program ``Governor's Apportionment'' funds for urbanized areas
under 200,000 in population is restricted. 

49 U.S.C. 5307(a)(2) was modified by the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) to require
that a recipient(s) be designated to dispense the Urbanized Area Formula funds attributable to TMAs. Those areas
that do not already have a designated recipient must name one and notify the appropriate FTA regional office of the
designation. This would include those urbanized areas under 200,000 in population that may receive TMA designation
independently, or those under 200,000 in population which are currently included within the boundaries of a larger
designated TMA. In both cases, the Governor would only have discretion to allocate Governor's Apportionment funds
attributable to areas which are outside of designated TMA boundaries. In order for the FTA and Governors to know which
urbanized areas under 200,000 in population are included within the boundaries of an existing TMA, and so that they
can be identified in future 

Federal Register

 notices, each MPO whose TMA planning boundaries include these smaller urbanized areas is asked to identify such areas
to the FTA. This notification should be made in writing to the Associate Administrator for Grants Management, Federal
Transit Administration, 400 7th Street, SW, Washington, DC 20590, no later than July 1 of each fiscal year. In fiscal
year 1994, MPOs notified FTA that the following urbanized areas under 200,000 in population are included within the
planning boundary of a designated TMA: 






I. Urbanized Area Formula Funds Used for Highway Purposes 



Urbanized Area Formula funds apportioned to a TMA which cannot be used for the payment of operating expenses (i.e.,
capital funds) are also available for highway projects if the following three conditions are met: (1) Such use must
be approved by the MPO after appropriate notice and opportunity for comment and appeal are provided to affected transit
providers; (2) in the determination of the Secretary, such funds are not needed for investments required by the Americans
with Disabilities Act of 1990; and (3) funds may be available for highway projects under title 23, U.S.C., only if funds
used for the State or local share of such highway projects are eligible to fund either highway or transit projects.


Urbanized Area Formula funds which are designated for highway projects will be transferred to and administered by
the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). The MPO should notify FTA of their intent to program FTA funds for highway
purposes. 



V. Nonurbanized Area Formula Program (Formerly Section 18) and Rural Transit Assistance (RTAP) Program



A. Nonurbanized Area Formula Program 



The fiscal year 1995 Nonurbanized Area Formula apportionments total $132,752,946. The State apportionments are
displayed on Table 3. A total of $132,926,631 is appropriated for the Nonurbanized Area Formula Program. After the
one-half percent set-aside ($664,633), the fiscal year 1995 apportionment also includes $490,948 in prior year
deobligated funds which have become available for reapportionment under this program. These funds provide capital,
operating and administrative assistance for areas less than 50,000 in population. 

Each State must spend no less than 15 percent of its fiscal year 1995 Nonurbanized Area Formula apportionment for the
development and support of intercity bus transportation, unless the Governor certifies to the Secretary that the
intercity bus service needs of the State are being adequately met. Fiscal year 1995 Nonurbanized Area Formula grant
applications must reflect this level of programming for intercity bus or include a certification from the Governor.
The population figures used in calculating these apportionments are from the 1990 Census.

B. RTAP Program 



The fiscal year 1995 RTAP allocations to the States totaling $4,612,500 are also displayed on Table 3. The funds are
allocated to the States to undertake research, training, technical assistance, and other support services to meet
the needs of transit operators in nonurbanized areas. These funds are to be used in conjunction with the States' administration
of the Nonurbanized Area Formula Program. 



VI. Elderly and Persons With Disabilities Program (Formerly Section 16)



A total of $59,152,156 is apportioned to the States for fiscal year 1995 under the Elderly and Persons with Disabilities
Program. Table 4 shows each State's apportionment. 

The formula for apportioning these funds uses 1990 Census 
population data for persons aged sixty-five and over and for persons 
with disabilities. 

The funds provide capital assistance for transportation for 
elderly persons and persons with disabilities. Eligible capital 
expenses may include, at the option of the recipient, the acquisition of transportation services under a contract,
lease, or other arrangement. 

While the assistance is intended primarily for private non-profit organizations, public bodies that coordinate
services for the elderly and persons with disabilities, or any public body that certifies to the State that non-profit
organizations in the area are not readily available to carry out the service, may receive these funds. 

These program funds may be transferred by the Governor to supplement the Urbanized Area Formula or Nonurbanized Area
Formula capital funds during the last 90 days of the fiscal year. 



VII. Title 23 Interstate Substitute Transit Program
 


A total of $48,030,000 is appropriated for the Interstate Substitute Transit Program. Of that amount, $9,500,000
is earmarked for a substitute transit project in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The balance of $38,530,000 is appropriated
for other transit projects which have been substituted for withdrawn interstate highway segments. The funds are
apportioned by formula which reflects the remaining costs to complete each withdrawal area's substitute transit
projects. After the one-half percent set-aside ($192,585), $38,337,415 of the $38,530,000 remains for projects.
This completes the funding for the Interstate Substitute Transit Program for these withdrawal areas. Table 5 displays
the apportionment of these funds. 

In addition to the funds directly appropriated for Interstate Substitute Transit projects, Substitute Highway
funds apportioned to a withdrawal area may be transferred from FHWA to FTA to be used for transit projects. 



VIII. Surface Transportation Program ``Flexible'' Funds Used for Transit Purposes
 


A. Transfer Process 



``Flexible'' DOT funds, such as Surface Transportation Program (STP) funds, Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality
(CMAQ) funds, or others, which are designated for use on transit projects, are transferred from the FHWA to FTA for
project approval. Flexible funds programmed for transit projects must result from the local and state planning and
programming process, and must be contained in an approved State Transportation Improvement Program (STIP) before
the funds can be transferred. In order to initiate the transfer process, the grantee must submit a completed application
to the FTA Regional Office, and must notify the state highway/transportation agency that it has submitted an application
which requires a transfer of funds. Once the state highway/transportation agency determines that the state has sufficient
obligation authority, it must notify FHWA that the funds are to be used for transit purposes and request that they be
obligated by FHWA as a transfer project to FTA. The flexible funds transferred to FTA will be placed in an urbanized
area or state account under one of the three existing formula programs_Urbanized Area, Elderly and Persons with Disabilities,
or Nonurbanized Area. 

They are then treated as FTA formula funds, although they will retain a special identifying code. The flexible funds
may be used for any non-operating purpose eligible under these FTA programs. All FTA requirements are applicable
to transferred funds. Flexible funds should be combined with regular FTA formula funds in a single annual grant application.




B. Matching Share for Flexible Funds 



The provisions of Title 23, U.S.C. regarding the non-Federal share apply to Title 23 funds used for transit projects.
Thus, flexible funds transferred to FTA retain the same matching share that such funds would have if used for highway
purposes and administered by the FHWA. 



</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941012-2-00189 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941012-2-00117 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

There are three instances in which a higher than 80 percent Federal share would be maintained. First, in States with
large areas of Indian and certain public domain lands, and National Forests, parks and monuments, the local share
for highway projects is determined by a sliding scale rate, calculated based on the percentage of public lands within
that state. This sliding scale, which permits a greater Federal share, but not to exceed 95 percent, is applicable
to transit projects funded with flexible funds in these public land states. FHWA develops the sliding scale matching
ratios for the increased Federal share. 
Additionally, commuter carpooling and vanpooling projects and transit safety projects using flexible funds administered
by FTA may retain the same 100 percent Federal share that would be allowed for ride-sharing or safety projects administered
by the FHWA. The 100 percent safety projects are subject to a nationwide ten percent program limitation. 


C. Other Funds Transferred to FTA 


Certain demonstration projects authorized under Title 23 are specified to be used for transit projects and are more
appropriately administered by FTA. In such cases, FHWA has transferred the funds to FTA for administration. Since
these funds are not STP flexible funds, they are transferred into the appropriate Capital Program category (Bus,
New Starts, or Fixed Guideway Modernization) for obligation and are administered as Capital projects. 



IX. Capital Program (Formerly Section 3)



A. Fixed Guideway Modernization Formula 



Fixed Guideway Modernization funds are allocated by formula. Statutory percentages were established to allocate
the first $497,700,000 to 11 fixed guideway areas. The next $70,000,000 is allocated one-half to these 11 urbanized
areas and one-half to other urbanized areas with fixed guideways which are at least seven years old on the basis of the
Urbanized Area Formula Program fixed guideway tier formula factors. The remaining funds are allocated to all of these
urbanized areas as one universe. For fiscal year 1995, $725,000,000 was appropriated for fixed guideway modernization.
After the three-quarter percent set-aside ($5,437,500), $719,562,500 is available for apportionment to the specified
urbanized areas for Fixed Guideway Modernization funding. 

Table 6 displays these apportionments. Fixed Guideway Modernization funds apportioned under this section must
be used for capital projects to modernize or improve fixed guideway systems. 

All urbanized areas with fixed guideway systems which are at least seven years old are eligible to receive Fixed Guideway
Modernization funds. A request for the start-up service dates for fixed guideways has been incorporated into the
Section 15 data reporting system to ensure that all eligible fixed guideway data is included in the calculation of
these apportionments. A threshold level of more than one mile of fixed guideway is required to receive Fixed Guideway
Modernization funds. Therefore, urbanized areas reporting less than one mile of fixed guideway mileage under Section
15 are not included. 



B. New Starts 



The fiscal year 1995 appropriation for New Starts is $646,670,000. These funds are entirely earmarked for projects
specified within the 1995 DOT Appropriations Act. After the three-quarter percent set-aside ($4,850,025), $641,819,975
remains available for allocation to areas. Table 7 displays the allocations by area and also shows prior year unobligated
earmarks for New Starts. 



C. Bus 



The fiscal year 1995 appropriation for Bus is $353,330,000 for the purchase of buses, bus-related equipment and paratransit
vehicles, and for the construction of bus-related facilities. After the three-quarter percent set-aside ($2,649,975)
for project management oversight, $350,680,025 remains available for projects. The ISTEA earmarked $12,000,000
in Bus funding for two bus projects in fiscal year 1995. The Conference Report accompanying the 1995 DOT Appropriations
Act earmarked an additional $316,330,000 to specified states or localities for bus and bus-related capital projects.
FTA administrative commitment of fiscal year 1995 funds to one full funding grant agreement totals $1,700,000. Thus,
$20,650,025 remains available for discretionary allocation by the Federal Transit Administrator. Table 8 displays
the allocations of earmarked fiscal year 1995 Bus funds by area and also shows prior year unobligated earmarks for
the Bus Program. 



X. Unit Values of Data for the Urbanized Area Formula and Nonurbanized Area Formula Programs, and Fixed Guideway Modernization
Formula

<TEXT>
 

For technical assistance purposes, the dollar unit values of data derived from the computations of the Urbanized
Area Formula and Nonurbanized Area Formula Programs, and the Fixed Guideway Modernization Formula apportionments
are included in this Notice on Table 10. To determine how a particular apportionment amount was developed, areas may
multiply their population, population density, and Section 15 data by these unit values. 



XI. Metropolitan Planning and State Planning and Research Programs (Formerly Sections 8 and 26(a)(2))



A. Metropolitan Planning Urbanized Area Program 



The fiscal year 1995 Metropolitan Planning apportionments to States for MPOs to be used in urbanized areas total $41,512,500.
A basic allocation of 80 percent of this amount ($33,210,000) is distributed to the States based on urbanized area
population for State distribution to each urbanized area, or parts thereof, within each State. A supplemental allocation
of the remaining 20 percent ($8,302,500) is also provided to the States based on an FTA administrative formula to address
planning needs in the larger, more complex urbanized areas. Table 9 contains the final State apportionments for the
combined basic and supplemental allocations. Each State, in cooperation with the MPOs, must develop an allocation
formula for the combined apportionment which distributes these funds to MPOs representing urbanized areas, or parts
thereof, within the State. This formula, which must be approved by the FTA, must ensure to the maximum extent practicable
that no MPO is allocated less than the amount it received by administrative formula under the Metropolitan Planning
Program in fiscal year 1991 (minimum MPO allocation). Each State formula must include a provision for the minimum
MPO allocation. Where the State and MPOs desire to use a new formula not previously approved by FTA, it must be submitted
to FTA for prior approval. 



B. State Planning and Research Program 



The fiscal year 1995 apportionments for the State Planning and Research Program total $8,475,000. Final State apportionments
for this program are also contained on Table 9. This is the fourth year of a consolidated program which is apportioned
to the States for the purpose of such activities as planning, technical studies and assistance, demonstrations,
management training, and cooperative research. In addition, a State may authorize a portion of these funds to be used
to supplement planning funds allocated by the State to its urbanized areas, as the respective State deems appropriate.




C. Data Used for Metropolitan Planning and State Planning and Research Apportionments 



Population data from the 1990 Census is used in calculating these apportionments. The Metropolitan Planning funding
provided to urbanized areas in each State by administrative formula in fiscal year 1991 was used as a ``hold harmless''
base in calculating funding to each State. 

Please note that while the fiscal year 1995 apportionment amount remains unchanged from the fiscal year 1994 apportionment,
an adjustment has been made to more accurately reflect the distribution of population within a particular bi-state
urbanized area. This adjustment may result in a slight change to each State's individual apportionment from the fiscal
year 1994 amount. 



XI. Period of Availability of Funds




The funds apportioned under the Urbanized Area Formula Program, Fixed Guideway Modernization Formula, Metropolitan
Planning and State Planning and Research Programs in this Notice will remain available to be obligated by FTA to recipients
for three (3) fiscal years following fiscal year 1995. Any of these apportioned funds unobligated at the close of business
on September 30, 1998, will revert to FTA for reapportionment under these respective programs. 
Funds apportioned to nonurbanized areas under the Nonurbanized Area Formula Program, including RTAP funds, will
remain available for two (2) fiscal years following fiscal year 1995. Any such funds remaining unobligated at the
close of business on September 30, 1997, will revert to FTA for reapportionment among the States. Funds allocated
to States under the Elderly and Persons with Disabilities Program in this Notice must be obligated by September 30,
1995. Any such funds remaining unobligated as of this date will revert to FTA for reapportionment among the States.
Fiscal year 1995 Title 23 Interstate Substitute Transit funds are available until expended. The 1995 DOT Appropriations
Act includes a provision requiring that fiscal year 1995 New Starts and Bus funds not obligated for their original
purpose as of September 30, 1997, shall be made available for other discretionary projects. A similar provision in
the 1994 DOT Appropriations Act required that fiscal year 1994 and prior year Bus and New Start funds that are not obligated
by September 30, 1996, shall also be made available for other discretionary projects.

A. Background 


FTA is engaged in an ongoing effort to streamline and simplify the administration of its programs. To this end, the
agency has expanded the authority extended to grantees to incur costs for operating assistance projects prior to
grant award to cover planning and capital costs as well. In fiscal year 1994 FTA extended this authority to non-operating
projects funded with current year apportioned formula funds. This automatic pre-award spending authority permitted
a grantee to incur costs on an eligible transit capital or planning project without prejudice to possible future Federal
participation in the cost of the project or projects. 


B. Expanded Coverage 


Because this provision has worked so well to reduce the paperwork burden on both the grantee and FTA regional offices,
effective as of October 1, 1994, the FTA is further broadening this authority. Authority to incur costs for Fixed Guideway
Modernization Formula, Metropolitan Planning, Urbanized Area Formula, Elderly and Persons with Disabilities,
Nonurbanized Area Formula, State Planning and Research, and Title 23 Interstate Substitute Transit projects in
advance of possible future Federal participation is extended to apply to fiscal year 1995 FTA funds apportioned in
this Notice for the programs listed above, as well as funds to be apportioned in fiscal years 1996 and 1997. Carryover
amounts for these programs are also included in this authority. This pre-award authority is also extended to projects
intended to be funded with STP or CMAQ funds transferred to FTA in fiscal years 1995 and 1996, provided that the projects
are contained in an approved STIP. The flexible funds would no longer have to be transferred to FTA before the authority
could be used. The two-year limit for these flexible funds corresponds to the more rigorous financial constraint
contained in the metropolitan planning regulation for non-attainment and maintenance areas. The authority does
not apply to New Starts or Bus. 


C. Conditions 


Similar to FTA's Letter of No Prejudice (LONP) authority, the conditions under which this authority may be utilized
are specified below: 
(1) This pre-award authority is not a legal or moral commitment that the project(s) will be approved for FTA assistance
or that the FTA will obligate Federal funds. Furthermore, it is not a legal or moral commitment that all items undertaken
by the applicant will be eligible for inclusion in the project(s). 
(2) All FTA statutory, procedural, and contractual requirements must be met. 
(3) No action will be taken by the grantee which prejudices the legal and administrative findings which the Federal
Transit Administrator must make in order to approve a project. 
(4) Local funds expended by the grantee pursuant to and after the date of this authority will be eligible for credit
toward local match or reimbursement if the FTA later makes a grant for the project(s) or project amendment(s). 
(5) The Federal amount of any future FTA assistance to the grantee for the project will be determined on the basis of
the overall scope of activities and the prevailing statutory provisions with respect to the Federal-local match
ratio at the time the funds are obligated. 
(6) For regular FTA formula funds to which this authority applies, the authority expires with the lapsing of fiscal
year 1997 funds. For flexible funds transferred from FHWA, the authority expires with the lapsing of fiscal year 1996
funds. 


D. Environmental and Other Requirements 


FTA emphasizes that all of the Federal grant requirements must be met for the project to remain eligible for Federal
funding. Some of these requirements must be met before pre-award costs are incurred, notably the requirements of
the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Compliance with NEPA and other environmental laws or executive orders
(e.g., protection of parklands, wetlands, historic properties) must be completed before state or local funds are
advanced for a project expected to be subsequently funded with FTA funds. Depending on which class the project is included
under in FTA's environmental regulations (23 CFR 771) the grantee may not advance the project beyond planning and
preliminary engineering before FTA has approved either a categorical exclusion (refer to 23 CFR 771.117(d)), a finding
of no significant impact, or a final environmental impact statement. The conformity requirements of the Clean Air
Act (40 CFR 51) also must be fully met before the project may be advanced with non-Federal funds.

<TEXT>
 

Similarly, Federal procurement procedures, as well as the whole range of Federal requirements, must be followed
for projects in which Federal funding will be sought in the future. Failure to follow any such requirements could make
the project ineligible for Federal funding. In short, this increased administrative flexibility requires a grantee
to make certain that no Federal requirements are circumvented thereby. If a grantee has questions or concerns regarding
the environmental requirements, or any other Federal requirements that must be met before incurring costs, it should
contact the appropriate regional office. 
Before an applicant may incur costs either for activities expected to be funded by Bus or New Start funds, or for activities
requiring funding beyond fiscal year 1997, it must first obtain a written LONP from the FTA. To obtain an LONP, a grantee
must submit a written request accompanied by adequate information and justification to the appropriate FTA regional
office. FTA will consider the request in light of its ``Letter of No Prejudice Policy'' (47 FR 46956, October 21, 1982).



XIV. Electronic Grant Making and Management (EGMM) Initiative_Fiscal Year 1995 and Beyond


As a result of the National Performance Review and the FTA strategic planning process, the FTA has two initiatives
designed to improve customer service and efficiency of program delivery: (1) On-Line Grantee Program_available
to all grantee agencies which can access the FTA Grants Management Information System (GMIS) mainframe computer
system via a toll free phone connection. This program was initially designed for ``inquiry only'' purposes. However,
this program will be expanded on a case-by-case basis to allow grantees to make annual certifications and assurances
through GMIS and conduct required quarterly financial status and narrative grant progress reporting. (2) Electronic
Grant Making and Management Pilot Program_participation in the fiscal year 1995 pilot program is limited to the 21
grantee agencies (including Greater Hartford Transit District, Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority,
Central New York Regional Transportation Authority, New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Baltimore
Mass Transit Administration, Lehigh and North Hampton Transit Authority, City of Montgomery Area Transit System,
Hillsborough Area Regional Transit Authority, Chicago Transit Authority, Central Ohio Transit Authority, Metropolitan
Transportation Authority of Harris County, New Mexico State Highway and Transportation Department, Bi-State Development
Agency_St. Louis, Missouri Highway and Transportation Department, Montana Department of Transportation, Denver
Regional Transportation District, City and County of San Francisco_Public Utilities Commission, Los Angeles County
Metropolitan Transportation Authority, King County Department of Metropolitan Services, Washington State Department
of Transportation, and National Easter Seal Society). During the pilot program (October 1, 1994 through September
30, 1995) these grantees will apply for and manage grants at their computer stations connected to the FTA GMIS computer
using a modem and toll free phone connection. The purpose of this initiative is to streamline the FTA grant making and
management process through a paperless electronic grant application, review, approval, acceptance and management
process. DOL has agreed to participate in the program and receive requests for Labor Protection Certification under
49 U.S.C. 5333(b) of projects as well as issue Labor Protection Certifications electronically for the EGMM Pilot
Program participants.

Quarterly evaluation will be conducted of both the On-Line Grantee Program and the EGMM Pilot Program. Also during
fiscal year 1995 FTA will implement the annual certifications and assurances for all grantees in which one signature
will replace the continued validity statement and separate certifications and assurances. All EGMM grantee participants
and On-Line Grantee participants on a case-by-case basis will be able to provide these certifications electronically.
In preparation of the EGMM initiative, FTA has already issued a Master Agreement that replaces Part I and portions
of Part II of the current FTA grant agreement. 
Upon the completion of the EGMM Pilot Program of fiscal year 1995, FTA intends to expand the EGMM Program to include
additional grantee agencies during fiscal year 1996. FTA also has several activities under consideration to expand
the functional content of EGMM. The kinds of activities under consideration include a mechanism to facilitate electronic
statewide transportation improvement programs, electronic unified planning work programs, and an electronic
library. The FTA would like your comments and suggestions on additional areas FTA could facilitate electronic interface
to better serve our customers. Please write your regional office with your suggestions on the FTA EGMM Pilot Program
and On-Line Grantee Program. 


XV. Quartley Approval of Grants


The FTA has established a quarterly approval and release cycle for processing grants. All Urbanized Area Formula,
Nonurbanized Area Formula, Elderly and Persons with Disabilities, Capital, Metropolitan Planning, State Planning
and Research, and Title 23 Interstate Substitute Transit grants are processed on a quarterly basis. This includes
Urbanized Area Formula, Nonurbanized Area Formula, or Elderly and Persons with Disabilities grants using STP or
CMAQ funds. 
If completed applications are submitted to the appropriate FTA Regional Office no later than the first business day
of the quarter, FTA will award grants by the last business day of the quarter. 
In order to expedite the grant approval process within the quarterly approval structure, grants which are complete
and have received the required Labor Protection Certification may be approved before the end of the quarter. Applications
for the first quarter should be submitted to the FTA Regional Office within five business days of this Notice. The first-quarter
grants will be released on or before December 30, 1994. There are only two factors which would delay FTA's approval
of the project beyond the end of a quarter. First is a failure by DOL to issue a Labor Protection Certification where
such certification is a prerequisite to a grant approval, and second is the failure of FHWA to actually transfer flexible
funds. 
For an application to be considered complete, all required activities such as inclusion of the project in a locally
approved Transportation Improvement Program (TIP), a Federally approved State Transportation Improvement Program
(STIP), intergovernmental reviews, environmental reviews, all applicable civil rights, anti-drug, and clean
air requirements, and submission of all requisite certifications and documentation must be completed. The application
must be in approvable form with all required documentation and submissions on hand, except for the Labor Protection
Certification which is issued by DOL. Incomplete applications will not be processed, but if the missing components
are supplied, will be considered in the next quarter. 
It is the policy of FTA to expedite grant application reviews and speed program delivery by reducing the number of grant
applications. To this end, FTA strongly encourages grant applicants to submit only one application per fiscal year
for each formula program. The single application should contain the fiscal year's capital (including flexible funds),
planning and operating elements. 


XV. Grant Application Procedures


All applications for FTA funds should be submitted to the appropriate FTA Regional Office. Formula grant applications
should be prepared in conformance with the following FTA Circulars: Urbanized Area Formula_C9030.1A, September
18, 1987; Nonurbanized Area Formula_C9040.1C, November 3, 1992; and Elderly and Persons with Disabilities_C9070.1C,
December 23, 1992. Applications for STP ``flexible'' fund grants should be prepared in the same manner as the apportioned
funds under the Urbanized Area Formula, Nonurbanized Area Formula, or Elderly and Persons with Disabilities Programs.
Guidance on preparation of applications for Capital, Metropolitan Planning, State Planning and Research, and Title
23 funds may be obtained from each FTA Regional Office. Copies of circulars are also available from Regional Offices.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 To receive a Federal grant for mass transportation purposes from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), an applicant
must provide certain certifications and assurances required by Federal laws and regulations. 


This Notice provides the applicant the text of certifications and assurances required for FTA grant programs which
include Discretionary Grants; Research, Development and Demonstration Grants; Metropolitan Planning Grants;
Formula Assistance Grants for Urbanized Areas; Grants for Training Programs; Formula Assistance Grants for Elderly
Individuals and Individuals With Disabilities; Formula Assistance Grants for Nonurbanized Areas; Human Resource
Grants; and Planning and Research Grants (formerly referenced as Sections 3, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11(a), 16, 18, 20, or 26 of
the Federal Transit Act, as amended, now codified at 49 U.S.C. chapter 53.) 
The certifications and assurances are set forth as Appendix A in this Notice, which thus serves as a comprehensive
compilation of Federal certification and assurance requirements to date. This document will be re-published annually
with any changes or additions specifically highlighted. 
This Notice also provides the grant applicant with a single Signature Page, allowing the grant applicant and its attorney
to certify compliance with all of the certifications and assurances pertinent to any and all grants for which the grant
applicant wishes to apply in fiscal year 1995, (see Appendix B.) 
In addition, FTA has introduced two new electronic programs for applicants. The On-Line Grantee Program is offered
to applicants through the Grant Management Information System (GMIS). This is a computerized system designed to
assist the grantee with the management of grant projects and budgets. All grant applicants are encouraged to participate
in the On-Line Grantee Program, which includes the opportunity to electronically certify compliance for all certifications
and assurances as shown in Appendix A. The Electronic Grant Making and Management Initiative (EGMM) is a new pilot
program currently offered to selected grantees who will be able to actually apply for a grant electronically. Both
programs are designed to aid FTA grant applicants by reducing time and paper. Applicants are asked to contact their
Regional Office shown above for more information. 


Background


In the past, applicants for FTA grants have submitted a variety of certifications and assurances with each application.
Subsequently, an applicant was required to reaffirm compliance with the earlier certifications and assurances
with a Statement of Continued Validity submitted with each application. 
With the publication of this Notice, certifications and assurances for Federal mass transportation assistance
grants will for the first time be contained in one document. This marks the beginning of an effort to assist grant applicants
in reducing time and paper work in certifying compliance with various Federal laws and regulations. It coincides
with the pilot program for the Electronic Grant Making and Management Initiative and the On-Line Grantee Program
described above, which will further reduce the time required to process a grant application. 
In order to keep an applicant well informed of its responsibility to meet the requirements of Federal transit laws,
and aware of changes, deletions or additions to those requirements, this compilation will be published annually
in conjunction with the publication of the agency's annual apportionment Notice, which allocates funds in accordance
with the latest annual appropriations act. 
This publication of certifications and assurances therefore supersedes the requirements of FTA Circular 9100.1B,
dated July 1, 1988, ``Standard Assurances for Urban Mass Transportation Administration Applications,'' which
is being rescinded. Other affected Circulars will be revised accordingly. This publication also supersedes the
requirement to submit the Statement of Continued Validity.

Procedures


Following this introductory material is a detailed compilation of Certifications and Assurances (Appendix A),
which is followed by a Signature Page (Appendix B.) The Signature Page is to be signed by the grant applicant and its
attorney and sent to the appropriate FTA Regional office by: (1) The first-quarter application submission date published
in the fiscal year apportionment announcement; or (2) with the first grant application of the 1995 fiscal year. 

The Signature Page, when properly signed and submitted to the FTA, assures FTA the applicant intends to comply with
the requirements for the specific program involved. Both sides of the Signature Page must be completed, first by marking
where appropriate with an `X' on the category selection side, and then signifying compliance by signing the reverse
side (see Appendix B.) 

In the event the grant applicant is a participant in the Electronic Grant Making and Management Initiative or the On-Line
Grantee Program described above, submission of the Signature Page may be done electronically. The applicant is advised
to consult with the appropriate Regional Office prior to submission.

Supplemental notice of proposed policy, extension of comment period.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This document announces modifications to a recent Notice of Proposed Policy Regarding Airport Rates and Charges.
The modifications are intended to reflect statutory provisions governing airport rates and charges included in
the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994, Public Law 103-305 (August 23, 1994). The DOT/FAA
previously extended the comment period on the notice until October 15, 1994. The comment period is being extended
until 14 days after publication of this supplemental notice in the 

Federal Register.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On June 9, 1994, the Office of the Secretary of Transportation (OST) and the FAA issued two related notices on the subject
of Federal policy on airport rates and charges. A notice of proposed policy entitled ``Proposed Policy Regarding
Airport Rates and Charges,'' listed and explained the principles that the OST and the FAA believes define Federal
policy on the rates and fees that an airport proprietor can charge to aeronautical users of the airport. Docket No.
27782 (59 FR 29874, June 9, 1994). Notice 94-18, a notice of proposed rulemaking entitled ``Rules of Practice
for Federally Assisted Airports,'' proposed detailed procedures for the filing, investigation, and adjudication
of complaints against airports for alleged violation of Federal requirements involving rates and charges and other
airport-related requirements (59 FR 29880, June 9, 1994).



The FAA Authorization Act of 1994, Public Law 103-305 (1994 Authorization Act) was signed into law on August
23, 1994. The 1994 Authorization Act includes provisions that specifically address airport rates and charges. This
supplemental notice is intended to assure that the proposed policy statement reflects relevant provisions of the
1994 Authorization Act.



Summary of Proposed Policy Statement



The proposed policy statement includes five principles with supporting guidance for each. In brief, the first principle
would establish the continued reliance on direct local negotiation between airports and aeronautical users. DOT/FAA
would be available to resolve the issues raised in a dispute when the airport and aeronautical users are unable to resolve
disputes directly.

<PARENT> FR941012-2-00119 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The second principle would restate the legal requirement that rates, fees and charges to aeronautical users must
be fair and reasonable, with more detailed guidance on the practices and restrictions that define ``fair and reasonable.''
Among other things, the DOT/FAA proposed to provide airport proprietors with some flexibility to deviate from the
proposed policy guidance based on agreement with aeronautical users. In addition, the proposed policy statement
would recognize the legitimacy of either the compensatory or residual pricing approach and of combinations of both.
DOT/FAA did not propose to establish standards for rates and charges for nonaeronautical users (nonaeronautical
rates and charges) nor to limit the amount of revenues generated by nonaeronautical rates and charges.
The third principle would restate the legal prohibition on unjustly discriminatory rates and charges.
The fourth principle would restate the legal obligation of the airport sponsor to maintain a fee and rental structure
that makes the airport as self-sustaining as possible. Supplemental guidance encouraged the sponsor of an airport
that is not currently self-sustaining to establish long-term goal and targets to make the airport financially self-sustaining.
The fifth principle would restate legal requirements for the application and use of airport revenues. Supplemental
guidance would advise that airport revenue generated by nonaeronautical sources is subject to the same statutory
requirements governing use as aeronautical revenue. In addition, supplemental guidance would provide that progressive
accumulation of substantial amounts of airport revenues may warrant an FAA inquiry into the airport proprietor's
application of revenues to the local airport system.


Summary of Applicable 1994 Authorization Act Provisions


Section 110 of the 1994 Authorization Act amends the statement of policy for airport improvement, 49 U.S.C. 47101,
by adding statements ``that airport fees, rates, and charges must be reasonable'' and that ``in establishing new
fees, rates, and charges, and generating revenues from all sources, airport owners and operators should not seek
to create revenue surpluses that exceed the amounts to be used for airport system purposes and for other purposes for
which airport revenues may be spent under section 47107(b)(1) of this title, including reasonable reserves and other
funds to facilitate financing and cover contingencies.''
Section 113 of the 1994 Authorization Act adds a new section 47129 titled ``Resolution of airport-air carrier disputes
concerning airport fees.'' Section 47129 authorizes the Secretary of Transportation (Secretary) to issue a determination
on the reasonableness of an airport rate or fee imposed on an air ca
