Mexican Fruit Fly Regulations, Removal of Regulated Area 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim rule.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are amending the regulations to remove the quarantined portion of Los Angeles County, CA, from the list of areas
regulated because of the Mexican fruit fly, and by removing California from the list of States quarantined because
of the Mexican fruit fly. We have determined that the Mexican fruit fly has been eradicated from California, and that
restrictions on the interstate movement of regulated articles from California are no longer necessary to prevent
the spread of the Mexican fruit fly into noninfested areas of the United States. This action relieves unnecessary
restrictions on the interstate movement of regulated articles from the previously regulated area.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


The Mexican fruit fly, 

Anastrepha ludens 

(Loew), is a destructive pest of citrus and other types of fruit. The short life cycle of the Mexican fruit fly allows
rapid development of serious outbreaks that can cause severe economic losses in commercial citrus-producing areas.
The Mexican fruit fly regulations, contained in 7 CFR 301.64 through 301.64-10 (referred to below as the regulations),
quarantine infested States, designate regulated areas, and restrict the interstate movement of regulated articles
from regulated areas in order to prevent the spread of the Mexican fruit fly to noninfested areas of the United States.
Quarantined States are listed in  301.64(a), and regulated areas are listed in  301.64-3(c). 
In an interim rule effective November 30, 1993, and published in the 

Federal Register

 on December 6, 1993 (58 FR 64102-64103, Docket No. 93-157-1), we quarantined the State of California
and designated a portion of Los Angeles County as a regulated area because that area had been found to be infested with
the Mexican fruit fly. 
Based on insect trapping surveys by inspectors of California State and county agencies and by inspectors of the Animal
and Plant Health Inspection Service, we have determined that the Mexican fruit fly has been eradicated from Los Angeles
County, CA. The last finding of Mexican fruit fly thought to be associated with the infestation in this area was made
on November 17, 1993. 
Since then no evidence of Mexican fruit fly infestations has been found in this area. We have determined that the Mexican
fruit fly no longer exists in Los Angeles County, and we are therefore removing it from the list of areas in  301.64-3(c)
regulated because of the Mexican fruit fly. As a result of this action there is no longer an area in California regulated
because of the Mexican fruit fly. Because we have determined that the Mexican fruit fly no longer exists in California,
we are removing California from the list in  301.64(a) of States quarantined because of the Mexican fruit fly.



Immediate Action 


The Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that there is good cause for publishing
this interim rule without prior opportunity for public comment. Immediate action is warranted to remove unnecessary
restrictions on the public. The area in California affected by this document was regulated due to the possibility
that the Mexican fruit fly could be spread to noninfested areas of the United States. Since this situation no longer
exists, the continued regulated status of this area would impose unnecessary restrictions. 
Because prior notice and other public procedures with respect to this action are impracticable and contrary to the
public interest under these conditions, we find good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553 to make it effective upon signature.
We will consider comments that are received within 60 days of publication of this rule in the 

Federal Register

. After the comment period closes, we will publish another document in the 

Federal Register

. It will include a discussion of any comments we receive and any amendments we are making to the rule as a result of the
comments. 


Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 


This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived
its review process required by Executive Order 12866. 
This rule removes restrictions on the interstate movement of regulated articles from a portion of Los Angeles County,
CA. Within this regulated area, there are 1,125 small entities that may be affected by this rule. These include 350
distributors/wholesalers, 750 fruit and produce stands, 12 nurseries, 5 growers on a total of 2 acres, 3 swap meets,
2 processors, 2 community gardens, and 1 packer. These 1,125 entities comprise less than 1 percent of the total number
of similar enterprises operating in the State of California. 
These small entities sell regulated articles primarily for local intrastate, not interstate, movement, and the
distribution of these articles was not affected by the regulatory provisions we are removing. Many of these entities
also handle other items in addition to the previously regulated articles. The effect on those few entities that move
regulated articles interstate was minimized by the availability of various treatments, that, in most cases, allowed
these small entities to move regulated articles interstate with very little additional cost. Therefore, the effect,
if any, of this rule on these entities appears to be minimal. 
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 


Executive Order 12372 


This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive
Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. (See 7 CFR part 3015,
subpart V.) 


Executive Order 12778 


This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule: (1) Preempts all State and
local laws and regulations that are inconsistent with this rule; (2) has no retroactive effect; and (3) does not require
administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule.

Airworthiness Directives; de Havilland Model DHC-8-100 Series Airplanes 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain de Havilland Model DHC-8-100
series airplanes, that requires modification of the potentiometer lever stops on the nose wheel steering. This amendment
is prompted by a report that the potentiometer stops installed currently on these airplanes are too short to limit
excessive uncontrolled potentiometer movement in the event of a mechanical link 
failure. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent the airplane from departing the runway during takeoff
or landing in the event of the failure of the mechanical link between the rudder pedals and the potentiometer.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive
(AD) that is applicable to certain de Havilland Model DHC-8-100 series airplanes was published in the


Federal Register

 on April 7, 1994 (59 FR 16574). That action proposed to require modification of the potentiometer lever stops on the
nose wheel steering. 


Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the single comment received. 
The commenter supports the rule. 
After careful review of the available data, including the comment noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. 
The FAA estimates that 48 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 3 work
hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. The cost
for required parts will be minimal. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated
to be $7,920, or $165 per airplane. 
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted. 
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has 
been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket
at the location provided under the caption

Airworthiness Directives; Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI) Model 1125 Westwind Astra Airplanes 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain IAI Model 1125 Westwind Astra airplanes,
that requires relocation of the ground cable in the slat power drive unit. This amendment is prompted by a report that
the drive system for the leading edge slat stopped in transit during flight on a Model 1125 Westwind Astra airplane.
This incident was caused by an improper ground connection for the electric motor of the slat drive system, which resulted
in arcing and an open electrical circuit. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent possible fuel vapor
fire due to electrical arcing in an area where fuel vapors might be present and the inability to move the slats during
flight due to an open electrical circuit.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive
(AD) that is applicable to certain Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI) Model 1125 Westwind Astra airplanes was published
in the 

Federal Register

 on May 5, 1994 (59 FR 23174). That action proposed to require relocation of the ground cable in the slat power drive unit.



Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments
were submitted in response to the proposal or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public. The FAA has determined
that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. 
The FAA estimates that 52 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 3 work
hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required
parts will cost approximately $53 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators
is estimated to be $11,336, or $218 per airplane. 
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted. 
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

Airworthiness Directives; Pratt & Whitney JT8D Series Turbofan Engines 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment supersedes an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Pratt & Whitney
(PW) JT8D series turbofan engines, that currently requires initial and repetitive inspections of installed third
and fourth stage low pressure turbine (LPT) blade sets for blade shroud crossnotch wear, and removal of blade sets
found with excessively worn blade shroud crossnotches. This amendment continues to require inspections, and removal,
if necessary, of blade sets, but also requires, as a terminating action to the inspections: installation of improved
LPT containment hardware, and installation of an improved No. 6 bearing scavenge pump bracket bushing. This amendment
is prompted by reports of additional uncontained engine failures since publication of the current AD, and the availability
of improved LPT containment hardware. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent damage to the aircraft
resulting from engine debris following an LPT blade or shaft failure.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On May 24, 1993, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued airworthiness directive (AD) 93-06-05,
Amendment 39-8530 (58 FR 31902, June 1, 1993), applicable to Pratt & Whitney (PW) JT8D-1, -1A,
-1B, -7, -7A, -7B, -9, -9A, -11, -15, -17, and -17R engines,
to require initial and repetitive inspections of the third and fourth stage low pressure turbine (LPT) blade sets
for excessively worn blade shroud crossnotches, and the removal of blade sets found with excessively worn blade crossnotches.
That AD is not applicable, however, to PW JT8D-1, -1A, -1B, -7, -7A, -7B, -9,
-9A, -11, -15, -17, and -17R engines that contain fan exhaust inner front duct segment
assemblies that are installed in accordance with PW Alert Service Bulletin (ASB) No. 6039, Revision 2, dated May 4,
1992, or earlier revisions of PW ASB No. 6039, and either (a) PW honeycomb third stage outer airseal Part Number (P/N)
801931, 802097, 797594, or 798279; or (b) Pyromet Industries, Inc., honeycomb third stage outer airseal P/N PI9336;
or (c) McClain International, Inc., honeycomb third stage outer airseal P/N M2433; or (d) a turbine case shield assembly
installed in accordance with PW ASB No. 6039, Revision 2, dated May 4, 1992, or earlier revisions of PW ASB No. 6039;
or (e) a third stage blade set that has third stage turbine blades that were installed in accordance with PW SB No. 5331,
dated October 27, 1982. 



A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) by superseding AD 93-06-05
was published in the 

Federal Register

 on December 28, 1993 (58 FR 68572). That action proposed to continue to require repetitive inspections of installed
third and fourth stage LPT blade sets for blade shroud crossnotch wear, and removal of blade sets found with excessively
worn blade shroud crossnotches. These inspections are not required, however, for PW JT8D-1, -1A, -1B,
-7, -7A, -7B, -9, -9A, -11, -15, -17, and -17R engines that contain
fan exhaust inner front duct segment assemblies that are installed in accordance with PW ASB No. 6039, Revision 3,
dated October 15, 1993, or earlier revisions of PW ASB No. 6039, and either (a) PW honeycomb third stage outer airseal
P/N 801931, 802097, 797594, or 798279; or (b) Pyromet Industries, Inc., honeycomb third stage outer airseal P/N PI9336;
or (c) McClain International, Inc., honeycomb third stage outer airseal P/N M2433; or (d) a turbine case shield assembly
installed in accordance with PW ASB No. 6039, Revision 3, dated October 15, 1993, or earlier revisions of PW ASB No.
6039; or (e) a third stage blade set that has third stage turbine blades that were installed in accordance with PW SB
No. 5331, dated October 27, 1982. 

That notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) also proposed to require, however, for all engines, installation of improved
third stage LPT containment hardware at the next access to the third stage LPT air sealing ring, but not later than December
31, 1998; installation of the improved fourth stage LPT containment hardware at the next shop visit, but not later
than December 31, 1998; installation of the improved No. 6 bearing scavenge pump bracket bushing at the next shop visit,
but not later than December 31, 1998; and modification and remarking with a new identification number third and fourth
stage LPT vanes with a reduced platform leading edge dimension at the next shop visit, but not later than December 31,
1998. The installation of improved containment hardware would serve as terminating action for the repetitive inspections.


The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the following service documents: PW ASB No. A5913,
Revision 6, dated October 15, 1993, that describes the third and fourth stage LPT blade set inspection procedures
and replacement requirements; PW ASB No. A6110, Revision 1, dated October 15, 1993, that describes procedures for
installation of improved LPT containment hardware; PW ASB No. A6131, dated August 24, 1993, that describes procedures
for installation of an improved No. 6 bearing scavenge pump bracket bushing; and PW SB No. 5748, Revision 5, dated August
3, 1993, that describes procedures for removing material from the inner platform leading edge on third and fourth
stage LPT vane and vane cluster assemblies, and remarking these modified vanes with new identification numbers.


Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received. 

The FAA received several comments that state that inspections and modifications are available that address the root
cause of shaft fractures and blade failures, whereas the installation of the containment hardware does not, and should
therefore not be mandated. The FAA does not concur. Currently available inspections and modifications only protect
against known failure modes, whereas the containment hardware will diminish the severity of all failure modes, both
known and unknown, by protecting the aircraft from damage due to uncontained engine debris. 

The FAA received several comments that state that the FAA should evaluate PW JT8D engine models separately to determine
if all models require the proposed actions to be accomplished, or if some models can be exempted from compliance due
to differences in design or demonstrated operational safety. The FAA does not concur. Design differences between
the various PW JT8D engine models were evaluated and no significant differences, other than low pressure rotor speed
in the higher rated engines, were revealed that could impact containment capability. The increased rotor speeds
are protected for in the design of the higher rated engines with the addition of a turbine shield, and the historical
event data does not indicate that these higher low pressure rotor speeds result in a greater number of uncontained
failures. 

One commenter states that the FAA's economic analysis does not reflect the true cost of the containment hardware.
The FAA does not concur. The intent of the economic analysis is to quantify the total direct cost to operators of the
proposed rule. The analysis does, however, account for engines currently equipped with the required parts, and the
price for the required parts quoted in the proposed rule is actually an average value that reflects costs for these
engines. 

One commenter states that the FAA's economic analysis does not account for the increased fuel costs resulting from
the added weight of the containment hardware. The economic analysis reflects the direct costs of performing the requirements
of the AD. Since the FAA has determined that the AD is required to correct an unsafe condition found in engines of this
type design, and, therefore, operators must perform the requirements of the AD in order to ensure the continued airworthiness
of the engines they operate, a comparison of the costs of operating the engine with and without the required containment
hardware would not be proper. 

One commenter states that the definition of shop visit stated in the proposed rule encompasses many types of minor
or peripheral maintenance activities where installation of the containment hardware cannot be accomplished, thus
causing a forced induction into an overhaul facility. The FAA concurs. The shop visit definition has been revised
to address this commenter's concern.

One commenter states that the FAA's economic analysis should account for the costs to implement AD 93-06-05
and other safety concerns since they are directed at reducing the safety concern addressed by the proposed rule. AD
93-06-05 requires LPT blade torque check inspections. The FAA does not concur. The proposed rule maintains
the inspection requirements of AD 93-06-05, but only until the installation of the containment hardware,
which is ultimately required for all engines in accordance with the compliance schedule. Therefore, the inspections
continue only as options, and only the mandated hardware installation is used to compute the direct costs of this AD.
Further, since inspections are not mandated for engines that have containment hardware installed, only the cost
of either the inspection or containment hardware applies for any given engine. The containment hardware cost, the
higher of the two, was used on the assumption that an operator would install the hardware rather than continue with
the optional inspection program. 

One commenter states that the modifications required by PW SB No. 5748, LPT vane cluster cut-back, are not applicable
to the engine models specified in this AD. This requirement should be eliminated from the AD. The FAA concurs. The modification
of the LPT vane clusters in accordance with PW SB No. 5748, is not required for the ``non-A'' JT8D engine models and therefore
has been eliminated from this AD. 

One commenter states that PMA 3rd stage outer air seal, Part Number (P/N) M2533, manufactured by McClain International,
should be an acceptable alternative installation to the corresponding PW part, P/N 811962. The FAA concurs. Third
stage turbine outer air seal, P/N M2533, has been granted FAA PMA approval, and therefore meets all applicable Federal
Aviation Regulations and is directly interchangeable with PW P/N 811962. The AD has been revised to specify 
P/N M2533 as an acceptable installation. 

One commenter states that a one-year extension of the compliance end date to December 31, 1999, should be granted.
The FAA concurs. A one-year extension of the compliance end date has been granted to adjust for the time required to
review the comments to the NPRM and process the Final Rule. 

One commenter states that only engines removed for shop visits on or after the AD effective date will be required to
comply with the AD, and therefore AD compliance would not be required for engines already undergoing a shop visit as
of the AD effective date. The FAA concurs, but no revision of the AD is required because the wording in the proposed rule
accounts for this situation.

One commenter states that the compliance requirements should be revised to minimize economic impact due to major
engine disassembly. Specifically, modification of the LPT vane cluster assemblies and installation of the No. 6
bearing scavenge pump bracket bushing could entail major engine disassembly depending on the scope of work performed
at the next shop visit occurring after the effective date of the AD. The FAA concurs in part. The FAA has determined that
the modification of the LPT vane cluster assemblies is not applicable to the engine models specified in this AD, and
therefore has eliminated this requirement. However, the compliance requirements for the installation of the No.
6 bearing scavenge pump bracket bushing is still required at the next shop visit to achieve the desired level of safety.


One commenter states that additional costs could be incurred due to lack of availability of the parts required by this
AD. The FAA does not concur. The FAA has coordinated this AD closely with PW to ensure the availability of the required
parts. In addition, PMA parts are specified in this AD as an acceptable alternative for PW parts. 

One commenter states that the -15A/-17A models were the only engine group to have the initial steel duct
modification incorporated during manufacture in accordance with PW SB No. 5697. These engines, together with a limited
number of retrofitted engines, will be the only ones able to take advantage of the associated industry support program.

The FAA has no comment on the extent or application of any support program which may offset some of the costs of the hardware
required by this airworthiness directive. While some operators may receive discounts on the cost of the containment
hardware, the economic analysis is computed on the assumption that no discount or warranty program is available.
Therefore, this comment is beyond the scope of the AD or its economic analysis. 

One commenter states that an alternative to the compliance end date of December 31, 1998, should be expressed in hours
and cycles, with performance required as whichever occur later, to accommodate low utilization operators. The FAA
concurs. The FAA performed a risk analysis to determine the inspection interval requirements and that risk analysis
accounted for both high and low utilization operations. However, determining the hourly and cyclic equivalent to
the compliance end date specified in the AD, the FAA has determined that the fleet average utilization rate can be applied
to low utilization operators. The FAA has added the hourly and cyclic equivalents to the AD. 

One commenter states the PW JT8D-17R engines should be exempted from the requirement to install the thicker
third stage turbine outer air seal because these engines are already configured with a turbine shield for containment
protection. The FAA does not concur. The PW JT8D-17R engines require additional containment protection due
to higher rated low pressure rotor speeds on these engine models. Therefore, both the thicker third stage turbine
outer air seal and the turbine shield are required for these engine models. 

One commenter concurs with the rule as proposed. 

In addition, the FAA has determined that inspections of the third and fourth stage LPT blade sets in accordance with
the procedures and intervals described in PW ASB No. 5913, Revision 5, dated August 10, 1992; or PW ASB No. 5913, Revision
4, dated February 20, 1992, constitute acceptable alternative methods of compliance for the inspections required
by paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(1)(iii) of this AD. 

After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes described previously. The FAA has determined
that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 

The FAA estimates that 6,000 engines installed on aircraft of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will
take an average of 4 work hours, based on fleet configuration mix, per engine to accomplish the required actions, and
that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts will cost approximately $7,235 per engine. Based on
these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $44,730,000. 

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

Airworthiness Directives; Pratt & Whitney JT8D Series Turbofan Engines 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment supersedes an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Pratt & Whitney
(PW) JT8D series turbofan engines, that currently requires initial and repetitive inspections of installed third
and fourth stage low pressure turbine (LPT) blade sets for blade shroud crossnotch wear, and removal of blade sets
found with excessively worn blade shroud crossnotches. This amendment continues to require inspections, and removal,
if necessary, of blade sets, but also requires, as a terminating action to the inspections: installation of improved
LPT containment hardware, installation of an improved No. 6 bearing scavenge pump bracket bushing, and modification
and remarking with a new identification number third and fourth stage LPT vanes with a reduced platform leading edge
dimension. This amendment is prompted by reports of additional uncontained engine failures since publication of
the current AD, and the availability of improved LPT containment hardware. The actions specified by this AD are intended
to prevent damage to the aircraft resulting from engine debris following an LPT blade or shaft failure.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On May 4, 1992, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued AD 92-10-05, Amendment 39-8239
(57 FR 23050, June 1, 1992), applicable to Pratt & Whitney (PW) JT8D-15A, -17A, and -17AR engines,
to require initial and repetitive inspections of the third and fourth stage low pressure turbine (LPT) blade sets
for excessively worn blade shroud crossnotches, and the removal of blade sets found with excessively worn blade crossnotches.
That AD is not applicable, however, to PW JT8D-15A, -17A, and 
-17AR engines that contain the third and fourth stage LPT containment hardware installed in accordance with
PW Alert Service Bulletin (ASB) No. 6039, Revision 1, dated February 20, 1992. 



A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) by superseding AD 92-10-05,
Amendment 39-8239 (57 FR 23050, June 1, 1992), was published in the 

Federal Register

 on December 28, 1993 (58 FR 68570). That action proposed to continue to require repetitive inspections of installed
third and fourth stage LPT blade sets for blade shroud crossnotch wear, and removal of blade sets found with excessively
worn blade shroud crossnotches. These inspections are not required, however, for PW 
JT8D-15A, -17A, and -17AR engines that contain the third and fourth stage LPT containment hardware
installed in accordance with PW ASB No. 6039, Revision 3, dated October 15, 1993, or earlier revisions.

That notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) also proposed to require, however, for all engines, installation of improved
third stage LPT containment hardware at the next access to the third stage LPT air sealing ring, but not later than December
31, 1998; installation of the improved fourth stage LPT containment hardware at the next shop visit, but not later
than December 31, 1998; installation of the improved No. 6 bearing scavenge pump bracket bushing at the next shop visit,
but not later than December 31, 1998; and modification and remarking with a new identification number third and fourth
stage LPT vanes with a reduced platform leading edge dimension at the next shop visit, but not later than December 31,
1998. The installation of improved containment hardware would serve as terminating action for the repetitive inspections.

The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the following service documents: PW ASB No. A5913,
Revision 6, dated October 15, 1993, that describes the third and fourth stage LPT blade set inspection procedures
and replacement requirements; PW ASB No. A6110, Revision 1, dated October 15, 1993, that describes procedures for
installation of improved LPT containment hardware; PW ASB No. A6131, dated August 24, 1993, that describes procedures
for installation of an improved No. 6 bearing scavenge pump bracket bushing; and PW SB No. 5748, Revision 5, dated August
3, 1993, that describes modification and remarking with a new identification number third and fourth stage LPT vanes
with a reduced platform leading edge dimension.
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received. 
The FAA received several comments that state that inspections and modifications are available that address the root
cause of shaft fractures and blade failures, whereas the installation of the containment hardware does not, and should
therefore not be mandated. The FAA does not concur. Currently available inspections and modifications only protect
against known failure modes, whereas the containment hardware will diminish the severity of all failure modes, both
known and unknown, by protecting the aircraft from damage due to uncontained engine debris. 
One commenter states that the FAA's economic analysis does not reflect the true cost of the containment hardware.
The FAA does not concur. The intent of the economic analysis is to quantify the total direct cost to operators of the
proposed rule. The analysis does, however, account for engines currently equipped with the required parts, and the
price for the required parts quoted in the proposed rule is actually an average value that reflects costs for these
engines. 
One commenter states that the FAA's economic analysis does not account for the increased fuel costs resulting from
the added weight of the containment hardware. The economic analysis reflects the direct costs of performing the requirements
of the AD. Since the FAA has determined that the AD is required to correct an unsafe condition found in engines of this
type design, and, therefore, operators must perform the requirements of the AD in order to ensure the continued airworthiness
of the engines they operate, a comparison of the costs of operating the engine with and without the required containment
hardware would not be proper. 
One commenter states that the definition of shop visit stated in the proposed rule encompasses many types of minor
or peripheral maintenance activities where installation of the containment hardware cannot be accomplished, thus
causing a forced induction into an overhaul facility. The FAA concurs. The shop visit definition has been revised
to address this commenter's concern.

One commenter states that adopting separate rules for separate groupings of PW JT8D engine models in Docket Nos. 93-ANE-72
and 93-ANE-83 is not justified since both address the same safety concern. In addition, separating into
two separate rules also avoids a major rule classification and thereby reduces the economic impact of each separate
action. The FAA does not concur. The FAA issues airworthiness directives based on product type design, not based on
a failure mode, the result of a failure mode, or the description of a safety concern. Therefore, it is quite possible,
as in this case, that more than one AD will address the same or very similar issues as they apply to more than one type design
or more than one variant of a type design. In addition, in this case, each AD docket number cited by the commenter proposed
to supersede an existing AD. Therefore, the AD's need to remain separate to maintain consistency with the superseded
AD's in order to simplify the tracking of compliance by PW JT8D operators. Further, the economic impact of both rules
combined would amount to approximately $51,000,000, which is far below the threshold for declaring a combined AD
a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12886 or a significant rule under existing DOT regulatory
policy. 
The FAA received several comments that state that the FAA should evaluate PW JT8D engine models separately to determine
if all models require the proposed actions to be accomplished, or if some models can be exempted from compliance due
to differences in design or demonstrated operational safety. The FAA does not concur. Design differences between
the various PW JT8D engine models were evaluated and no significant differences, other than low pressure rotor speed
in the higher rated engines, were revealed that could impact containment capability. The increased low pressure
rotor speeds are protected for in the design of the higher rated engines with the addition of a turbine shield, and the
historical event data does not indicate that these higher low pressure rotor speeds result in a greater number of uncontained
failures. 
One commenter states that an alternative to the compliance end date of December 31, 1998, should be expressed in hours
and cycles, with performance required as whichever occur later, to accommodate low utilization operators. The FAA
concurs. The FAA performed a risk analysis to determine the inspection interval requirements and hourly and cyclic
equivalents to the compliance end date were derived from that risk analysis. The FAA has added the hourly and cyclic
equivalents to the AD. 
The FAA received several comments that state that the compliance requirements should be revised to minimize economic
impact due to major engine disassembly. Specifically, modification of the LPT vane cluster assemblies and installation
of the No. 6 bearing scavenge pump bracket bushing could entail major engine disassembly depending on the scope of
work performed at the next shop visit occurring after the effective date of the AD. The FAA concurs in part. The FAA has
determined that the modification of the LPT vane cluster assemblies can be accomplished at the next part access and
still meet safety objectives. However, the compliance requirements for the installation of the No. 6 bearing scavenge
pump bracket bushing is still required at the next shop visit to achieve the desired level of safety.

The FAA received several comments that state that PMA 3rd stage outer air seal, Part Number (P/N) M2533, manufactured
by McClain International, should be an acceptable alternative installation to the corresponding PW part, P/N 811962.
The FAA concurs. Third stage turbine outer air seal, P/N M2533, has been granted FAA PMA approval, and therefore meets
all applicable Federal Aviation Regulations and is directly interchangeable with PW P/N 811962. The AD has been revised
to specify P/N M2533 as an acceptable installation. 
One commenter states the PW JT8D-17R and -17AR engines should be exempted from the requirement to install
the thicker third stage turbine outer air seal because these engines are already configured with a turbine shield
for containment protection. The FAA does not concur. The PW JT8D-17AR engines require additional containment
protection due to higher rated low pressure rotor speeds on these engine models. Therefore, both the thicker third
stage turbine outer air seal and the turbine shield are required for these engine models. 
The FAA received two comments that state that additional costs could be incurred due to lack of availability of the
parts required by this AD. The FAA does not concur. The FAA has coordinated this AD closely with PW to ensure the availability
of the required parts. In addition, PMA parts are specified in this AD as an acceptable alternative for PW parts. 
One commenter concurs with the rule as proposed. 
The FAA has extended the compliance end date to December 31, 1999, in order to maintain consistency with AD 94-20-08,
Docket No. 93-ANE-83. In addition, the compliance requirement for modification of the LPT vane cluster
assemblies has been revised to exempt engines that incorporate PW SB No. 5859, Revision 3, dated January 22, 1991,
or earlier revisions. 
In addition, the FAA has determined that inspections of the third and fourth stage LPT blade sets in accordance with
the procedures and intervals described in PW ASB No. 5913, Revision 5, dated August 10, 1992; or PW ASB No. 5913, Revision
4, dated February 20, 1992, constitute acceptable alternative methods of compliance for the inspections required
by paragraph (a)(1) of this AD. 
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes described previously. The FAA has determined
that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD.

The FAA estimates that 944 engines installed on aircraft of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take
approximately an average of 4 work hours, based on fleet configuration mix, per engine to accomplish the required
actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts will cost approximately $7,235 per engine.
Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $7,037,520. 
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

Modification of Class D Airspace; NAS Glenview, IL, and Establishment of Class D and Class E Airspace; Wheeling, IL



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule; request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This action modifies the Class D airspace area at Glenview Naval Air Station (NAS), IL, by amending the area's effective
hours to coincide with the associated air traffic control tower's hours of operation. This action also establishes
Class D and E airspace at Palwaukee Municipal Airport, Wheeling, IL. Wheeling, IL, previously had airspace coverage
from the full-time Class D airspace area at NAS Glenview, IL. The part-time Class D airspace area at NAS Glenview, IL,
however, is not adequate for Wheeling, IL. The Wheeling, IL, Class D airspace effective hours will coincide with the
associated air traffic control tower's hours of operation and the Class E airspace will be effective when the associated
air traffic control tower is closed. The intent of this action is to establish Class D airspace areas when two-way radio
communications with the associated air traffic control tower is required, and to provide adequate Class E airspace
at Wheeling, IL, for instrument approach procedures when the control tower is closed. In addition, the airspace description
for Glenview, IL, has been editorially modified to describe the airspace in relation to the Airport Reference Point
(ARP).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



Request for Comments on the Rule




Although this action is a final rule, and was not preceded by notice and public procedure, comments are invited on the
rule. This rule will become effective on the date specified in the 

DATES

 section. However, after the review of any comments and, if the FAA finds that further changes are appropriate, it will
initiate rulemaking proceedings to extend the effective date of the rule or to amend the regulation.

Comments that provide the factual basis supporting the views and suggestions presented are particularly helpful
in evaluating the effects of the rule, and in determining whether additional rulemaking is required.

Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, aeronautical, economic, environmental, and energy-related
aspects of the rule which might suggest the need to modify the rule.



The Rule



This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) modifies the Class D airspace area at
NAS Glenview, IL, by amending the area's effective hours to coincide with the associated air traffic control tower's
hours of operation. Prior to Airspace Reclassification, an airport traffic area (ATA) and a control zone (CZ) existed
at NAS Glenview, IL. However, Airspace Reclassification, effective September 16, 1993, discontinued the use of
the term ``airport traffic area'' and ``control zone,'' replacing them with the designation ``Class D airspace.''
The former CZ was continuous, while the former ATA was contingent upon the operation of the air traffic control tower.
The consolidation of the ATA and CZ into a single Class D airspace designation makes it necessary to modify the effective
hours of the Class D airspace to coincide with the control tower's hours of operation. This action also establishes
Class D and E airspace at Palwaukee Municipal Airport, Wheeling, IL. Wheeling, IL, previously had airspace coverage
from the full-time Class D airspace area at NAS Glenview, IL. The part-time Class D airspace area at NAS Glenview, IL,
however, is not adequate for Wheeling, IL. The Wheeling, IL, Class D airspace effective hours will coincide with the
associated air traffic control tower's hours of operation and the Class E airspace will be effective when the associated
air traffic control tower is closed. The intent of this action is to establish Class D airspace areas when two-way radio
communications is required with the associated air traffic control towers during the control towers hours of operation,
and to provide adequate Class E airspace at Wheeling, IL, for instrument approach procedures when the control tower
is closed.

The legal description for Glenview, IL, has been editorially modified to describe the airspace in relation to the
ARP rather than the current description that uses the Northbrook, IL, VORTAC. The SIAP for Palwaukee, IL, which was
previously included in the Glenview, IL, Class D airspace designation, used the Northbrook VORTAC. With the establishment
of separate Class D airspace areas for Wheeling, IL, and Glenview, IL, it is necessary to editorially modify the Glenview,
IL, Class D airspace designation. This modification does not change the airspace.

The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D and E airspace designations
are published in Paragraphs 5000 and 6002, respectively, of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective September
16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class D and E airspace designations listed in this document
will be published subsequently in the Order. Under the circumstances presented, the FAA concludes that there is an
immediate need to modify the NAS Glenview, IL, Class D airspace area and establish the Wheeling, IL, Class D and E airspace
areas in order to promote the safe and efficient handling of air traffic in the area. Therefore, I find that notice and
public procedures under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are impracticable and contrary to the public interest.

The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only effect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This action establishes Class E airspace at Springdale, AR. This controlled airspace, upward from the surface, is

the control tower is closed.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 




History



On July 6, 1994, a proposal to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class E
airspace at Springdale, AR, was published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 34585). That action proposed to establish Class E airspace at Springdale, AR, during the hours that the control
tower is closed to contain IFR operations at the airport.

Interested persons were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on
the proposal to the FAA. No comments objecting to the proposal were received. Coordinates reported for Springdale,
AR, were incorrectly identified in the notice, and are corrected in this amendment. Except for editorial changes,
this amendment is the same as that proposed in the notice.

The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace areas designated as
surface areas for airports are published in paragraph 6002 of FAA Order 7400.9B, dated June 18, 1994, and effective
September 16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class E airspace designation listed in this
document will be published subsequently in the Order.



The Rule



This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) establishes Class E airspace at Springdale,
AR, to provide controlled airspace for IFR operations during the hours that the control tower is closed.


The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations that need
frequent and routine amendments to keep them orperationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory
action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated
impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation,
it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Low-Income Public Housing; Performance Funding System: Elimination of Heating Degree Day Adjustment 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, HUD.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This rule will eliminate the application of the heating degree day adjustment factor in determining the component
of operating subsidy eligibility relating to utility consumption under the Performance Funding System (PFS). The
rule implements section 508 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Paperwork Reduction Statement 


This rule eliminates a previously required adjustment and therefore reduces the public reporting burden. The information
collection requirements contained in this rule have been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under the
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520), and assigned OMB control number 2577-0029. 


II. Background 


Section 508 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act of 1990 (104 Stat. 4187) directs the Department
to incorporate into the PFS a methodology to adjust utility consumption to account for Cooling Degree Days that is
the same as the methodology used to account for Heating Degree Days. The impetus for this legislation was that housing
agencies in the sunbelt who had to pay higher utility bills for air conditioning during hot summers (e.g., in projects
that were ``master-metered'' in which the cost of running air conditioning could not be assigned to the tenant) wanted
an adjustment in their PFS payments to account for the increased utility consumption. 
Consistent with the explicit policy stated in the statute, the proposed rule contained a literal implementation
of the statutory language. However, the Department was concerned that its implementation of this provision raised
some basic questions and could create some major distortions in the funding system. Because of this, it was determined
appropriate to open a discussion of policy alternatives in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 1, 1993 (58 FR 51261) and to invite public comment on the issues surrounding implementation of this statutory
provision. 
Because of the potential importance of this change, and because the Department was aware that there are additional
factors to consider in calculating cooling load and cost other than ambient temperatures, the Preamble to the proposed
rule described three alternate scenarios for addressing the issue of heating and cooling degree day adjustments
in the PFS formula: 
1. Implement cooling degree day adjustment exactly like the heating degree day adjustment. 
2. Isolate the consumption of the meter estimated to be used for heating or cooling by tracking the monthly consumption,
and perform a cooling and heating degree days adjustment to the portion of utilities estimated to be used for heating
or cooling. 
3. Drop all degree day adjustments in the PFS. 
We invited public comment on these alternate approaches or suggestions of additional alternatives. 


III. Response to Public Comments 


There were fifteen public comments on the proposed rule. The fifteen commenters included 13 Housing Agencies (HAs),
one taxpayer, and the Council of Large Public Housing Authorities. Fourteen of the fifteen commenters recommended
that the Department adopt the third option. 
Only one commenter did not recommend the third option. Instead this commenter presented options that combined elements
of options 2 and 3: 
(A) Establish areas to receive cooling allowances by geographical zones rather than cooling degree days. A twenty
year temperature history could be the basis for the allowance. This would include seasonal starting and stopping
dates as well as intensity of energy requirements.

<DOCNO> FR941013-0-00025 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941013-0-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(B) Develop formulae that allow less energies for well insulated housing as well as additional energies for housing
with high solar gain. This could be done on a plus or minus percentage basis. An energy audit would be helpful in establishing
the anticipated energy use of each unit. 
(C) Collect energy use data from a variety of unit types, family types, and samples of several existing housing units
in the specified zone. This data could be used as the basis for a fixed allowance for cooling purposes during the zone
area's cooling season. 
The other fourteen commenters recommended Option 3 because they found the benefit in reduced paperwork and administrative
burden outweighs the benefit of an adjustment for temperature variations. As one stated, ``Although theoretically,
it appears prudent to adjust the utility consumption figures for weather conditions, practically, it is very difficult
to do so with any degree of reliability.'' Another commenter summed up the benefits of Option 3 in one sentence, ``It
would simplify the system, allow timely post year adjustments and would average out over time.'' 
In response to this level of agreement, the Department is adopting the third option and dropping all heating and cooling
degree day adjustments. This approach will greatly simplify the PFS. The rolling base used to estimate utility consumption
in the PFS will reflect the HA's recent history of utility consumption including the impact of local heating and cooling
requirements. This rule will eliminate the need to separately track the consumption of each meter used to supply heating
or air conditioning. This will reduce paperwork and the administrative burden on the Department and the Housing Agencies.
It will eliminate the need to wait for publication of the degree day factors before adjustments can be made. This three
month delay also affects the ability to develop ratings under the Public Housing Management Assessment Program (PHMAP).
On the negative side, HAs will get only a 50 percent adjustment for consumption, without further adjustment to reflect
weather conditions. Assuming that weather averages out over time, there will be no long term penalty or bonus. 


IV. Timing of Implementation 


By law, the PFS regulation remains in effect for the duration of a HA's fiscal year without change. The revisions of
this rule will affect a particular HA's year end adjustments to its fiscal year beginning in Calendar Year 1995. HAs
will apply heating degree day adjustments to their fiscal years which began during FFY 1994 and end in 12/94, 3/95,
6/95, and 9/95. The first years that will not be adjusted will be fiscal years ending 12/95, 3/96, 6/96, and 9/96. 


V. Findings and Certifications 


A. Environmental Review 


A Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) with respect to the environment was made on the proposed rule in accordance
with HUD regulations in 24 CFR Part 50 which implements Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act
of 1969, 42 U.S.C. 4332. That Finding is available for public inspection during regular business hours in the Office
of the General Counsel, Rules Docket Clerk, at the above address. Since the provisions of this final rule were anticipated
as an option stated in the proposed rule, that FONSI remains valid. 


B. Regulatory Review 


This rule was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and
Review. Any changes made to the rule as a result of that review are clearly identified in the docket file, which is available
for public inspection in the office of the Department's Rules Docket Clerk, room 10276, 451 Seventh Street, SW, Washington,
DC. 


C. Impact on Small Entities 


The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this rule before
publication and by approving it certifies that this rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. The rule may result in changes in the level of operating subsidy eligibility for certain
public housing agencies, but we have no reason to believe that it would have disproportionate effect on small HAs.



D. Federalism Impact 


The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that the policies contained in this rule would not have federalism implications and, thus, are not subject to review
under the Order. The rule refines an established formula under which HUD calculates operating subsidies for low-income
housing developments, but contains no requirement for explicit action by local officials and will not interfere
with State or local governmental functions. 


E. Impact on the Family 


The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, 

The Family

, has determined that this rule would not have potential significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and
general well-being, and, thus, is not subject to review under the Order.

Rules and Procedures for Funds Transfers



<AGENCY>

Treasury, Fiscal, Financial Management Service.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This rule amends the regulations implementing the Cash Management Improvement Act of 1990 (CMIA), as amended, which
governs the transfer of funds between the Federal Government and the States under Federal assistance programs. It
finalizes without change a previously published interim rule which delayed the date on which the State of New York
had to begin the second phase of CMIA implementation. This rulemaking makes no other changes to the CMIA regulations.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



Background



The regulations at 31 CFR part 205 established a two-stage implementation of the Cash Management Improvement Act
of 1990 (CMIA), as amended, which governs the transfer of funds between the Federal Government and the States under
Federal assistance programs.

During the first phase of implementation, only the 20 largest Federal assistance programs were covered by CMIA. From
the second year onward, the scope of CMIA expands to cover all ``major Federal assistance programs,'' as defined by
the Single Audit Act. This second phase of implementation takes effect at the start of each State's 1995 fiscal year,
so that States can introduce the new cash management requirements with a new fiscal year.

The State of New York, however, has a unique fiscal year that begins on April 1, which is 3 months prior to the start of
the typical State fiscal year on July 1. Hence, New York would be subject to expanded CMIA requirements 3 months before
the other States; it would have only 9 months for the first phase of implementation, whereas all other States and territories
would have a full year.

On March 30, 1994, therefore, the Financial Management Service (FMS) issued an interim rule to amend 31 CFR part 205
and allow New York a full year for the first stage of implementation (59 FR 14753). This interim rule modified the implementation
schedule so that no State had to begin the second phase prior to July 1, 1994. It made no other changes to 31 CFR part 205
and affected only New York. It was effective upon publication, but public comment was solicited from all interested
parties.

The FMS received one comment on the interim rule. The Executive Department of the State of New York wrote to express
support for it. Accordingly, the FMS considers it appropriate to adopt the interim rule as a final rule. The purpose
of this rulemaking, therefore, is to finalize, without change, the provision contained in the interim rule.



Executive Order 12866



It has been determined that this regulation is not a significant regulatory action as defined in E.O. 12866. Therefore,
a Regulatory Assessment is not required.



Regulatory Flexibility Act



Because no notice of proposed rulemaking was required for this rule, the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility
Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

) do not apply.



List of Subjects in 31 CFR Part 205



Electronic funds transfer, Grant administration, Grant programs, Intergovernmental relations.



Issuance



For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 31 CFR part 205 is amended by this final rule as follows:



PART 205_[AMENDED]



1. The authority citation for 31 CFR Part 205 continues to read as follows:






Authority:

 5 U.S.C. 301; 31 U.S.C. 321, 3335, 6501, 6503.




2. Paragraph (b) of  205.4 is revised to read as follows:

Scope of subpart.



* * * * *



(b) 

Threshold of materiality.

 From the later of July 1, 1994, or the beginning of a State's 1995 fiscal year, and thereafter, this subpart applies,
at a minimum, to all programs that meet the threshold for major Federal assistance programs in a State.

Subsistence Management Regulations for Public Lands in Alaska, Subpart D; Subsistence Taking of Fish and Wildlife
Regulations; Correcting Amendments



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Forest Service, USDA, Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Correcting amendments.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 These corrections amend the Subsistence Management Regulations for Public Lands in Alaska (50 CFR part 100 and 36
CFR part 242, published in the 

Federal Register

 on June 3, 1994) implementing the subsistence priority for rural residents of Alaska under Title VIII of the Alaska
National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) of 1980.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Background_Title VIII of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) (16 U.S.C. 3111-3126)
requires that the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture (Secretaries) implement a joint program
to grant a preference for subsistence uses of fish and wildlife resources on public lands, unless the State of Alaska
enacts and implements laws of general applicability which are consistent with ANILCA, and which provide for the subsistence
definition, preference, and participation specified in Sections 803, 804, and 805 of ANILCA. The State implemented
a program that the Department of the Interior previously found to be consistent with ANILCA. However, in December
1989, the Alaska Supreme Court ruled in 

McDowell

 v. 

State of Alaska

 that the rural preference in the State subsistence statute violated the Alaska Constitution. The court's ruling
in 

McDowell

 required the State to delete the rural preference from the subsistence statute, and therefore, negated State compliance
with ANILCA. The Court stayed the effect of the decision until July 1, 1990.



As a result of the 

McDowell

 decision, the Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture (Departments) assumed, on July 1, 1990,
responsibility for implementation of Title VIII of ANILCA on public lands. On June 29, 1990, the Temporary Subsistence
Management Regulations for Public Lands in Alaska were published in the 

Federal Register

 (55 FR 27114-27170). Consistent with subparts A, B, and C of these regulations, a Federal Subsistence Board
(Board) was established to administer the Federal Subsistence Management Program. The Board's composition includes
a Chair appointed by the Secretary of the Interior with concurrence of the Secretary of Agriculture; the Alaska Regional
Director, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; the Alaska Regional Director, U.S. National Park Service; the Alaska State
Director, U.S. Bureau of Land Management; the Alaska Area Director, U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs; and the Alaska
Regional Forester, USDA Forest Service. Through the Board, these agencies have participated in development of regulations
for Subparts A, B, and C, and the annual Subpart D regulations. All Board members have reviewed these corrections and
agree with their substance. Because Subpart D relates to public lands managed by an agency or agencies in both the Departments
of Agriculture and the Interior, identical correcting text will be incorporated into 36 CFR part 242 and 50 CFR part
100.

Proposed Subpart D regulations for the 1994-1995 seasons and bag limits, and methods and means were published
on September 2, 1993, in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 46678-46706). A 60-day comment period providing for public review of the proposed rule was advertised
by mail, radio, and newspaper. Subsequent to that 60-day review period, the Board prepared a booklet describing all
proposals for change to Subpart D. The public then had an additional 60 days in which to comment on the proposals for
changes to the regulations. The Federal Subsistence Regional Advisory Councils (Regional Councils) met in regional
centers, received public comments, and formulated recommendations to the Board on proposals for their respective
regions. The final regulations, published on June 3, 1994 (59 FR 29032-29063) reflect Board review and consideration
of Regional Council recommendations and public comments submitted to the Board during their April meeting.

These correcting amendments are a result of Requests for Reconsideration of some of the Board's decisions in April
and some requests for Special Action as a result of resource concerns. Below are summaries of each action.



Unit 1(B)_Goat



The Board reopened the Frosty Bay Ridge area of Unit 1(B) to goat hunting. This area had been closed due to timber harvest
activities in the area which could have subjected the small herd to excessive hunting pressure. Timber harvest activities
were completed during the summer of 1994. The Board, having analyzed the available data, found that the harvest of
goats in the area was consistent with the conservation of healthy populations and the justification for the closure
no longer applied. The change will provide an August 1-December 31 season with a harvest limit of two goats by
State registration permit only.



Unit 18_Moose



The Board acted on a Request for Reconsideration from the Lower Yukon Moose Management Committee to revise the action
the Board took in April opening the lower Yukon area to moose hunting. Unit 18 is a large area encompassing over 26 million
acres primarily in the Yukon and Kuskokwim River deltas. The traditional hunting periods for moose are slightly different
in different areas of the Unit. The Request to the Board sought to revise the season in the Unit based on those differences.
The Board reviewed the data and determined that providing different seasons in different areas of the unit would best
accommodate traditional hunting periods and still be consistent with the conservation of healthy populations.
The change will also correct a misprint in the June 3, 

Federal Register

 printing: The Kanektok and Goodnews drainages will remain closed to moose hunting, as they have been in the past. The
Unit will also be divided into three other areas with different seasons (September 5-25, September 1-30,
and August 25-September 25). Two of the areas will continue to have a 10-day winter hunt that will be announced
later.

Unit 20(C)_Moose



The Board acted on a request from the Denali Subsistence Resource Commission to the Secretary of the Interior to establish
an additional moose season on National Park Service lands in Unit 20(C). A review of the data indicated that there is
a customary and traditional basis for a late fall or early winter hunt. The moose population in the area is stable and
can withstand the additional harvest. The Board determined that the additional season would accommodate customary
and traditional hunting periods and still be consistent with the conservation of healthy populations. The change
establishes an additional November 15-December 15 hunt with a harvest limit of one antlered bull, except white-phased
or partial albino, for Denali National Park and Preserve lands west of the Toklat River, excluding lands within Mount
McKinley National Park as it existed prior to December 2, 1980. 



Units 23 and 26(A)_Dall Sheep



The Board received a request for a Special Action closing the Dall sheep season in northwest Alaska. This request follows
an Alaska Department of Fish and Game Emergency Order closing the same area. The sheep population in northwest Alaska
has experienced a dramatic decline since 1989 with a series of severe winters, high predation, and poor lamb production.
Therefore, the Board closed the season to ensure the continued viability of the sheep populations in Northwest Alaska.
The change closed the sheep season in Unit 23 west of Howard Pass and the Aniuk, Cutler, and Redstone Rivers and in Unit
26(A) west of Howard Pass and the Etivluk River.

Only the items described above are being changed; but for clarity, the entire table section for the pertinent species
in each Unit is reproduced.

All of the above actions were supported by the Regional Councils in the affected areas. Notice of the Board meeting
and the subjects to be considered were widely circulated and the public had an opportunity to comment and participate.


The Board finds that additional public notice and comment requirements under the Administrative Procedures Act
(APA) for this extension are impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest. Therefore, the Board
finds good cause pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) to waive the public notice and comment procedures prior to publication
of this rule correction. The Board also finds good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3) to make this rule correction effective
July 1, 1994, the effective date of the Subsistence Management Regulations for Public Lands in Alaska. 



Conformance With Statutory and Regulatory Authorities



National Environmental Policy Act Compliance_A Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) that described four
alternatives for developing a Federal Subsistence Management Program was distributed for public comment on October
7, 1991. That document described the major issues associated with Federal subsistence management as identified
through public meetings, written comments and staff analysis and examined the environmental consequences of the
four alternatives. Proposed regulations (subparts A, B, and C) that would implement the preferred alternative were
included in the DEIS as an appendix. The DEIS and the proposed administrative regulations presented a framework for
an annual regulatory cycle regarding subsistence hunting and fishing regulations (subpart D). The Final Environmental
Impact Statement (FEIS) was published on February 28, 1992. 

Based on the public comment received, the analysis contained in the FEIS, and the recommendations of the Federal Subsistence
Board and the Department of the Interior's Subsistence Policy Group, it was the decision of the Secretary of the Interior,
with the concurrence of the Secretary of Agriculture, through the U.S. Department of Agriculture_Forest Service,
to implement Alternative IV as identified in the DEIS and FEIS (Record of Decision on Subsistence Management for Federal
Public Lands in Alaska (ROD), signed April 6, 1992). The DEIS and the selected alternative in the FEIS defined the administrative
framework of an annual regulatory cycle for subsistence hunting and fishing regulations. The final rule for Subsistence
Management Regulations for Public Lands in Alaska, subparts A, B, and C (57 FR 22940-22964) implements the Federal
Subsistence Management Program and includes a framework for an annual cycle for subsistence hunting and fishing
regulations.



Compliance with Section 810 of ANILCA



The intent of all Federal subsistence regulations is to accord subsistence uses of fish and wildlife on public lands
a priority over the taking of fish and wildlife on such lands for other purposes, unless restriction is necessary to
conserve healthy fish and wildlife populations. A section 810 analysis was completed as part of the FEIS process.
The final section 810 analysis determination appears in the April 6, 1992, ROD which concluded that the Federal Subsistence
Management Program, under Alternative IV with an annual process for setting hunting and fishing regulations, may
have some local impacts on subsistence uses, but it does not appear that the program may significantly restrict subsistence
uses. 



Paperwork Reduction Act 



These rules contain information collection requirements subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval
under 44 U.S.C. 3501-3520. They apply to the use of public lands in Alaska. The information collection requirements
described above are approved by the OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501 and have been assigned clearance number 1018-0075.

(1018-0075), Washington DC 20503. Additional information collection requirements may be imposed if Local
Advisory Committees subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act are established under Subpart B. Such requirements
will be submitted to OMB for approval prior to their implementation.



Economic Effects



This rule was not subject to QMB review under Executive Order 12866.

The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

) requires preparation of flexibility analyses for rules that will have a significant effect on a substantial number
of small entities, which include small businesses, organizations or governmental jurisdictions. The Departments
have determined that this rulemaking will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small
entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

This rulemaking will impose no significant costs on small entities; the exact number of businesses and the amount
of trade that will result from this Federal land-related activity is unknown. The aggregate effect is an insignificant
positive economic effect on a number of small entities. The number of small entities affected is unknown; but, the
fact that the positive effects will be seasonal in nature and will, in most cases, merely continue preexisting uses
of public lands indicates that they will not be significant.

These regulations do not meet the threshold criteria of ``Federalism Effects'' as set forth in Executive Order 12612.
Title VIII of ANILCA requires the Secretaries to administer a subsistence preference on public lands. The scope of
this program is limited by definition to certain public lands. Likewise, these regulations have no significant takings
implication relating to any property rights as outlined by Executive Order 12630.



Drafting Information



These regulations were drafted under the guidance of Richard S. Pospahala, of the Office of Subsistence Management,
Alaska Regional Office, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Anchorage, Alaska. Additional guidance was provided by
Thomas H. Boyd, Alaska State Office, Bureau of Land Management; Lou Waller, Alaska Regional Office, National Park
Service; John Borbridge, Alaska Area Office, Bureau of Indian affairs; and Norman Howse, USDA-Forest Service.

Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; Minnesota




<AGENCY>

 Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On November 10, 1992, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) submitted a SIP revision which included two elements:
A commitment from the Governor or his designee to the timely adoption and implementation of an I/M program meeting
all requirements of the I/M regulation; and a schedule of implementation. On November 12, 1993, and December 15, 1993,
the MPCA fulfilled its commitment by submitting proposed revisions to its State Implementation Plan (SIP) for carbon
monoxide to USEPA for approval. The submittal requests approval of its basic inspection and maintenance (I/M) program
which applies to the Twin Cities seven-county metropolitan area. The Twin Cities seven-county metropolitan area,
which includes Anoka, Carver, Dakota, Hennepin, Ramsey, Scott and Washington Counties, has been classified as moderate
nonattainment for carbon monoxide. Therefore, section 187 of the Clean Air Act (CAA) requires the State to submit
a basic I/M SIP. On August 5, 1994, USEPA proposed conditional approval of Minnesota's basic I/M SIP based on MPCA's
commitment to adopt specific enforceable measures as outlined in the July 5, 1994, letter from Charles Williams,
Commissioner MPCA, to Valdas Adamkus, Regional Administrator, USEPA. The notice of proposed rulemaking also outlined
several USEPA comments and required MPCA to adequately respond to the comments before USEPA would proceed with conditional
approval. In this action, the USEPA is taking final action to conditionally approve the State's basic I/M program
submittal based upon the commitment from the State and responses to USEPA's comments.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:




I. Background


Section 187(a)(4) of the CAA, as amended in 1990, requires States with areas designated moderate nonattainment for
carbon monoxide (CO) to make changes to improve existing I/M programs or implement new ones. Section 182(a)(2)(B)
requires USEPA to review, revise, update, and republish in the 

Federal Register

 guidance for State motor vehicle I/M programs. On November 5, 1992 (57 FR 52950), USEPA published a final rule establishing
performance standards and other requirements for basic and enhanced I/M programs.
The November 5, 1992, I/M Regulation required each State that must implement an I/M program to submit by November 15,
1992, a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision including two elements: (1) A commitment from the Governor or his
designee to the timely adoption and implementation of an I/M program meeting all requirements of the I/M regulation;
and (2) a schedule of implementation. A memorandum dated December 11, 1992, from Phil Lorang, Director, Emission
Planning and Strategies Division, outlines the elements that a State's schedule of implementation must include
for acceptability. These elements include:



1. Passage of enabling statutory or other legal authority; 
2. Proposal of draft regulations and promulgation of final regulations; 
 
3. Issuance of final specifications and procedures; 

4. Issuance of final request for Proposals (if applicable); 

5. Licensing or certification of stations and inspectors; 

6. The date mandatory testing will begin for each model year to be covered by the program; 

7. The date full-stringency cut-points will take effect; and 
 
8. All other relevant dates. 




Following publication of the I/M program final rule (57 FR 52950), the USEPA also made available to States a document
entitled, 

Checklist for Completing the Inspection/Maintenance SIP (Checklist

). The Checklist was developed to assist States in the development of I/M SIPs and outlines in detail the program elements
the I/M SIP submittals must satisfy in order to be approved for incorporation into a State's federally approved SIP.



II. Summary of State Submittal


In 1988 the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) was authorized and directed by the State legislature to adopt
rules establishing an I/M program in the Twin Cities seven county metropolitan area. As required by Minnesota Statute
section 116.62, the MPCA adopted Minnesota Rules parts 7023.1010 to 7023.1105, which established standards and
criteria governing the testing and inspection of motor vehicles for CO and hydrocarbon emissions in the Twin Cities
seven county metropolitan area. Vehicle testing began on July 1, 1991. Upon publication of the USEPA's final rule
for I/M Programs (57 FR 52950), the MPCA recognized the need to amend the rules for operation of the State's I/M program.
The State submitted a committal I/M SIP on November 10, 1992. The submittal includes a commitment for the adoption
and implementation of an I/M program meeting all requirements of the I/M regulation and the CAA, a schedule of implementation
which contained the elements described in Phil Lorang's December 11, 1992 memorandum, to meet the submittal date
to USEPA of November 15, 1993.
On November 12, 1993, the MPCA submitted the first of two parts of its SIP revision request for the Twin Cities seven
country metropolitan area I/M program. The second part of the revision request, consisting of the public hearing
notice, was submitted by MPCA on December 15, 1993. The submittal requests approval of the Minnesota I/M program,
which has been operating in the Twin Cities metropolitan area since July 1, 1991. The seven county metropolitan area
includes Anoka, Carver, Dakota, Hennepin, Ramsey, Scott and Washington Counties, and has been designated moderate
nonattainment for CO. This document was reviewed in detail in the August 5, 1994 (59 FR 39994), proposed rule.


III. USEPA Comments/MPCA Responses


In a May 11, 1994, letter to MPCA, USEPA identified several deficiencies in the I/M SIP submittal and provided the State
the opportunity to respond to the deficiencies. The USEPA notified the State that several of the deficiencies could
only be remedied through amendments to the State's statute and/or administrative rules. 
In response to USEPA's comments on the deficiencies in the State's I/M submittal, the MPCA provided a July 5, 1994,
letter from Charles Williams, Commissioner, MPCA, to Valdas V. Adamkus, Regional Administrator USEPA, which responds
to USEPA comments and makes a commitment from the State to correct the deficiencies requiring amendments to the State's
statute and/or administrative rules. The deficiencies requiring amendments to the State's I/M statute and/or administrative
rules and MPCA's response to the deficiencies are outlined in the August 5, 1994, (50 FR 39994) notice of proposed rulemaking.
This conditional approval is based in part on the State's July 5, 1994, commitment letter.
The USEPA's August 5, 1994, notice of proposed rulemaking (59 FR 3994) identified certain deficiencies in the I/M
submittal and required MPCA to adequately address the USEPA comments before the end of the 30-day comment period.
The USEPA's comments on the State's basic I/M program deficiencies and MPCA's responses to the comments are presented
below. The notice of proposed rulemaking stated that USEPA would proceed with final conditional approval if the MPCA
adequately addressed the comments during the 30-day comment period. The notice also stated that USEPA would take
final action to disapprove the basic I/M SIP submittal if MPCA failed to adequately address the deficiencies.


Comment:

 Minnesota Rule 7023.1020 has been amended such that visual inspection of fuel inlet restrictors is no longer required.
Therefore, the emission reductions obtained in the proposed program must be less than or equal to those obtained by
the existing program. Since visual inspection for fuel inlet restrictors was previously required, there must be
comparable improvement to the program if this element is to be removed. There is no evidence that the program has been
strengthened. The State should either reinstate the fuel inlet restrictor requirement or make other improvements
to the testing program so that the reductions are as good or better than under the existing program. 


MPCA Response:

 The existing I/M program being proposed as part of the SIP submittal does not contain a provision for a visual inspection
of the fuel inlet restrictor. The MPCA has not taken credit in the Mobile 5a modeling demonstration for the visual inspection
of the fuel inlet restrictor. Therefore, there is no weakening of the submitted program and the Mobile 5a
modeling has demonstrated compliance with the performance standard without the visual inspection of the fuel inlet
restrictor. 


Decision:

 Since the State has not taken credit for visual inspection of the fuel inlet restrictor and is able to demonstrate compliance
with the performance standard, USEPA accepts the State's response to the Agency's comment.


Comment:

 USEPA has identified two issues regarding the compliance rate claimed by the State in the submittal. First, the submittal
provides conflicting estimates of the number of unregistered vehicles in the Twin Cities metropolitan area. The
contractor estimates that 22,000 vehicles in the area are registered without undergoing testing, while MPCA estimates
that only 12,000 vehicles are registered without undergoing testing. The conflicting estimates undermine the reliability
of the 97 percent compliance rate arrived at by the State. Secondly, the State uses a 96 percent compliance rate in the
Mobile 5a modeling inputs, yet claims a 97 percent compliance rate in the submittal. USEPA can accept the 96 percent
compliance rate without any further information or action on the State's part. If the State chooses to continue to
claim the 97 percent compliance rate, it must supply USEPA with an estimate of the number of unregistered vehicles
and a description of mechanisms the state will employ to identify and encourage registration of unregistered vehicles.



MPCA Response:

 Minnesota accepts USEPA's recommendation that the State use the 96 percent compliance rate without providing any
further information or action.


Decision:

 USEPA will not require the State to provide any further data or action by the State.


Comment:

 The USEPA is concerned that the $35.00 citation imposed on vehicle owners who fail to undergo testing and properly
register their vehicles is not sufficiently high to deter non-compliance. The USEPA requests that MPCA provide further
information on the maximum fine imposed on vehicle owners who fail to undergo testing.


MPCA Response:

 Vehicle owners who do not comply with the requirements of the Program are not allowed to renew their vehicle registration.
Vehicle owners who drive on expired tabs or improperly store a vehicle with expired tabs, are cited for an expired registration
and assessed a fine. The average fine for an expired registration is $35.00 The actual amount of the fine will vary depending
on the county jurisdiction. Vehicles with an expired registration are also subject to towing and impound fees, with
initial fees averaging $75.00, plus additional daily storage fees ranging from $8.00 to $15.00. In addition, these
fees are based on each occurrence of citation for registration expiration. Vehicles with an expired registration
are subject to receive multiple citations and subsequent fines until the vehicle registration has been renewed.



Decision:

 The USEPA accepts MPCA's response to the Agency's comment on citation penalties and will not require any further action
from the State.


Comment:

 The USEPA believes that Minnesota's lack of a defined penalty schedule for cases of serious violations of the State's
contractual agreement significantly lessens the stringency of the State's enforcement efforts. In addition, the
State has not provided any description of its mechanisms for permanent fee retainage from the contractor. The MPCA
must provide USEPA with a schedule of typical retainage for serious violations of the contractual agreement. 


Response:

 In lieu of a specific penalty schedule, Minnesota uses a fee retainage to resolve all violations of our contractual
agreement. Each month the contractor submits an invoice for accuracy, the State retains 10 percent of the invoice
and pays the contractor the remaining 90 percent. The 10 percent retainage is accumulated monthly and released to
the contractor at the end of each quarter, provided the MPCA is satisfied with the contractor's performance and that
no violation of the contract has occurred. If a violation of the contract has occurred, the specific dollar amount
not returned to the contractor would be determined by the MPCA based on the seriousness of the violation. 
Minnesota believes that using retainage instead of a specific penalty schedule is a stronger contractual enforcement
tool for several reasons. First, by using retainage, the MPCA has maximum flexibility to address contractual violations
and is not limited only to those issues and penalty amounts which may be included in a penalty schedule. Second, the
monthly retainage averages over $100,000 and meets the penalty requirement of $100 or 5 times the inspection fee as
specified in Section 51.364. Lastly, the use of a retainage provides for a more suitable working relationship with
the contractor. Because a portion of the contractor's profit is withheld monthly through retainage, the contractor
is allowed to focus on contract compliance (not enforcement) to ensure that the full retainage is released quarterly.
MPCA recommends that the existing retainage process be accepted as originally proposed in the SIP submittal. 


Decision:

 The USEPA accepts MPCA's response to the Agency's comment on citation penalties and will not require any further action
from the State.


Comment:

 The submittal indicates that quality assurance officers do not have direct authority to impose disciplinary action
against inspectors employed by the contractor. MPCA quality assurance officers may only recommend disciplinary
action or discharge of an employee. MPCA must commit to requiring the contractor to act upon the State's recommendation
for disciplinary action.


Response:

 The MPCA quality assurance auditors perform quality assurance audits, identify any improper performance by a lane
inspector, and initiate enforcement action against the lane inspector. The procedure to initiate enforcement action
and impose discipline on a lane inspector begins with an immediate reporting to the station manager. The station manager
acts accordingly. The quality assurance auditor then recommends disciplinary action to the MPCA Program Manager.
The Program Manager and the contractor's Director of Operations then meet to discuss the violation, agree on the severity
of the violation and mutually impose discipline. Types of discipline imposed to date include re-training, verbal
reprimand, and dismissal of the lane inspector. 


Decision:

 The USEPA accepts MPCA's response to the Agency's comment on citation penalties and will not require any further action
from the State.


V. Rulemaking Action


Based upon the August 5, 1994 proposed rule and MPCA's responses to USEPA's comments, the USEPA is conditionally approving
the Minnesota basic I/M SIP revision request for CO. The USEPA's conditional approval of Minnesota's basic I/M program
is also based upon MPCA's commitment to adopt specific enforceable measures as outlined in the July 5, 1994, letter
from Charles
Williams, Commissioner MPCA, to Valdas Adamkus, Regional Administrator, USEPA. These commitments include a request
to the State legilature to consider changes to the vehicle inspection program during the 1995 session, and to initiate
a public hearing process to make changes in the administrative rule for the program to comply with the requirements
of the Federal rules. The specific areas needing statutory and/or administrative rule changes include: the requirement
that only certified automotive repair technicians perform repairs in order for a vehicle to obtain a waiver; the requirement
that the State's minimum repair cost limit be actually spent befor a vehicle is eligible to receive a waiver; the requirement
that vehicles with switched engines be tested using emission standards based on the model year of the chassis, unless
the engine is newer in age than the chassis; and the requirement to change the re-inspection procedure to include a
determination that an emission control device is the correct type for the certified configuration of the vehicle
inspected. If Minnesota fails to implement the necessary changes within the one-year period following the date of
this conditional approval, the conditional approval will convert to a disapproval of the SIP. Disapproval of the
SIP will trigger the 18-month sanctions period of section 179 of the CAA. In addition, USEPA can elect to exercise its
discretionary authority to impose sanctions prior to the end of the 18-month period. Finally, disapproval will trigger
a 24-month Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) clock under section 110(c) of the CAA. 

Miscellaneous


Applicability to Future SIP Decisions


Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting, allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. USEPA shall consider each request for revision to the SIP in light of specific technical, economic,
and environmental factors in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.


Executive Order 12866


This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The OMB has exempted this regulatory action from Executive Order
12866 review. 

Regulatory Flexibility


Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small
entities. (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604.)
Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small
entities. Small entities include
small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations
of less than 50,000.
This approval does not create any new requirements. Therefore, I certify that this action does not have a significant
impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAA,
preparation of the regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness
of the State action. The CAA forbids USEPA to base its Final Conditional Approval of Minnesota's I/M program on such
grounds.

Petitions for Judicial Review


Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by December 12, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by
the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor
does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section

statement program for stationary sources within the State's marginal and above ozone nonattainment areas. Section
182(a)(3)(B) of title I of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA), requires States with areas designated nonattainment
for the ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) to establish regulations for annual reporting of actual
emissions by sources that emit VOC or NO

X

 in the nonattainment area. These emissions reports are referred to as ``emissions statements.'' Sources in the following
counties are subject to the emissions statement program requirements: Ashtabula, Butler, Clark, Clermont, Cuyahoga,
Delaware, Franklin, Geauga, Greene, Hamilton, Lake, Licking, Lorain, Lucas, Mahoning, Medina, Miami, Montgomery,
Portage, Stark, Summit, Trumbull, Warren, and Wood.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


I. Background


The air quality planning and SIP requirements for ozone nonattainment and transport areas are set out in subparts
1 and 2 of title I of the (CAA). The USEPA has issued a ``General Preamble'' describing USEPA's review procedures for
SIPs and SIP revisions submitted under title I of the CAA, including those State submittals for ozone nonattainment
areas (see 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) and 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992)). USEPA has also issued a draft guidance document
describing the requirements for the emissions statement programs, entitled ``Guidance on the Implementation of
an Emissions Statement Program'' (July, 1992).

1

 It should be noted that this guideline has not been finalized, but does provide the best available guidance on the expected
contents of the emissions statements and on the States' use of emissions statements. Further revisions to this draft
guidance were not available prior to final rulemaking on the Ohio SIP revisions request. Therefore, it is appropriate
to use the July 1992 draft guidance in considering current emissions statement SIP revision submittals.





A. Summary of the Federal Requirements


Section 182(a)(3)(B) of title I of the CAA requires States with areas designated nonattainment for the ozone NAAQS
to establish regulations for annual reporting of actual emissions by sources that emit VOC or NO

X

 in the nonattainment areas. These annual emissions reports are called ``emissions statements.'' Section 182(a)(3)(B)
also requires the States to submit a revision to their SIP to incorporate the emissions statement requirement into
its SIP no later than 2 years after enactment of the CAA.
A State, with USEPA approval, may waive the requirement for an emissions statement for classes or categories of sources
with less than 25 tons per year of NO

X

 or VOC emissions in nonattainment areas if the State includes the classes or categories in the base year and periodic
inventories and calculates emissions using emission factors established by USEPA (such as those found in USEPA publication
AP-42) or other methods acceptable to USEPA. Whatever minimum reporting level the State establishes in its
emissions statement program, if a source emits either VOC or NO

X

 at or above the designated reporting level, the other pollutant must be included in the emissions statement, even
if it is emitted at levels below the specified cutoffs.
The CAA requires a facility to submit the first emissions statement to the State within three years after the date of
enactment of the CAA, and annually thereafter. USEPA has requested the States to submit the emissions data to USEPA
through the Aerometric Information Retrieval System (AIRS). The minimum emissions statement data must include:
certification of data accuracy, source identification information, operating schedule, emissions information
(to include annual and typical ozone season day emissions), control equipment information, and process rate data.
The emissions reported in a source's statement should include upset emissions, the effect of downtime on emissions,
and fugitive emissions. Finally, the State's rule should clearly place the burden for reporting on the source. The
Technical Support Document, dated June 28, 1994, provides a more detailed description of the requirements of the
August 4, 1993, memorandum. USEPA developed emissions statement data elements to be consistent with other State
reporting requirements. This consistency is essential to assist States with quality assurance for emissions estimates
and to facilitate consolidation of all USEPA reporting requirements.
In addition to the submission of the emissions statement data to AIRS, States should provide USEPA with a status report
that outlines the degree of
compliance with the emissions statement program. Beginning July 1, 1993, States should report quarterly to USEPA
the total number of sources affected by the emissions statement provisions, the number of sources that have complied
with the provisions and the number that have not. The status report should also include the total annual and typical
ozone season day emissions from all reporting sources, both corrected and non-corrected for rule effectiveness.
States should include in their status report a list of sources that: (1) Are delinquent in submitting their emissions
statement; (2) emit 500 tons per year (tpy) or more of VOC; or (3) emit 2500 tpy or more of NO

X

. The State should submit this status report quarterly until all the regulated sources have complied for the reporting
year. Suggested submittal dates for the quarterly status reports are July 1, October 1, January 1, and April 1.


B. Summary of State Submittal


The CAA required States subject to the requirements of section 182(a)(3)(B) to submit the emissions statement program
to USEPA by November 15, 1992. On January 15, 1993, the USEPA made a finding that Ohio failed to submit the required SIP
revision. The USEPA's finding triggered the sanctions period of section 179 of the CAA. The Ohio Environmental Protection
Agency (OEPA) submitted a SIP revision request to USEPA on March 22, 1994. In a letter dated May 16, 1994, the USEPA informed
OEPA that the SIP submittal was complete. The May 16, 1994, letter stopped the sanctions period that was begun with
the finding of failure to submit.
The information provided by the State included: Adopted rules (3745-24-01, -02, -03, and
-04) effective on April 1, 1994; emissions statement form and synopsis of rules; summary of comments and responses;
public notice of the hearing and comment period; Joint Committee on Agency Rule Review (JCARR)
agenda and approval; technical support for the research and development (R&D) exemption; statutory authority
for the State's rules; and copies of actual 
comments submitted. OEPA submitted four adopted rules. The first, Rule 3745-24-01, is entitled 

Definitions

. Unless otherwise provided in this rule the definitions in rule 3745-24-01 apply.
The second rule, Rule 3745-24-02, which is entitled 

Applicability

, states that the requirements of this chapter apply to facilities located in Ashtabula, Butler, Clark, Clermont,
Cuyahoga, Delaware, Franklin, Geauga, Greene, Hamilton, Lake, Licking, Lorain, Lucas, Mahoning, Medina, Miami,
Montgomery, Portage, Stark, Summit, Trumbull, Warren, or Wood County. Facilities emitting 25 tons or more of NO

X

 or 25 tons or more of VOC during any calendar year are required to submit an emissions statement. This requirement starts
with calendar year 1992. Sources in counties redesignated to attainment for ozone are exempt from reporting. The
rule also provides an exemption under paragraph (G) of Rule 3745-24-04 for certain sources at the facility.
Rule 3745-24-03, which is entitled 

Deadlines for the Submission of the Emissions Statements

, requires that the 1992 emissions statements be submitted by July 1, 1994. For 1993 and beyond, emissions statements
are due by November 15th of the following calendar year (e.g. November 15, 1994, for the 1993 emissions statement).
Ohio Rule 3745-24-04 is entitled 

Emissions Statement Requirements

 and involves paragraphs (A) through (G). Paragraphs (A) and (B) require effected owners to submit emissions statements
in the OEPA format by the required deadline. Paragraph (C) contains general information about the facility, calendar
year covered, and certification of accuracy of the statement. The certification of accuracy must be submitted by
an appropriate facility official. Paragraph (D) lists required information for non-R&D sources. Paragraph
(E) lists required information for R&D sources. Paragraph (F) allows emissions reporting on a group basis if
it cannot be determined on an individual basis. Paragraph (G) provides exemptions for small sources and some R&D
sources.
The emissions statement exemption provision, at Ohio Rule 3745-24-04(G), exempts emissions units that
emit less than 10 pounds per day VOC or NO

X

 from being included in an emissions estimate for a facility. This exemption effects the applicability of the emissions
statement requirement and the reported emissions for affected facilities. The exemption uses exemption 3704.011(A)
from the State's title V Operating Permits program, but not 3704.011(A)(1) to (A)(5). Title V exemption 3704.011(A)
exempts emissions units less than 10 pounds per day. Title V exemption 3704.011(A)(1) provides that section 3704.011(A)
does not apply if the CAA or regulations issued pursuant to it limit an emission unit to less than 10 pounds per day. Title
V exemption 3704.011(A)(2) provides that section 3704.011(A) does not apply if OEPA regulations needed for attainment
limit the unit to less than 10 pounds per day. Title V exemption 3704.011(A)(3) provides that section 3704.011(A)
does not apply if radionuclides are emitted. Title V exemption 3704.011(A)(4) provides that section 3704.011(A)
does not apply if a unit in combination with other units would result in potential emissions greater than 25 tpy. Title
V exemption 3704.011(A)(5) provides that section 3704.011(A) does not apply if a unit emits more than one ton per year
of hazardous pollutants.
Ohio Rule 3745-24-04(G) also provides that Rule 3745-24-04(E) exempts from being included
in an emissions statement any laboratory or bench scale R&D sources; and does not apply to R&D sources at a
facility where the combined potential to emit is less than five tons VOC and five tons NO

X

 and where the owner or operator maintains records to demonstrate this. Since Rule 3745-24-04(G) only
adopts the exemption outlined in 3704.011(A) of the title V program, the emissions from sources that total less than
or equal to 10 pounds per day are not required to be reported in an emissions statement.


C. Analysis of State Submittal


The August 4, 1993, Mobley memorandum requires that sources submit their first statements for 1992 by July 1, 1993
and that subsequent statements be issued by April 15 of each year. However, the CAA allows statements to be submitted
by November of each year. Ohio did not promulgate administrative rules for the emissions statement program until
March 17, 1994. The rules became effective on April 1, 1994. Sources subject to the program are required to submit their
initial emissions statement, summarizing 1992 emissions, by July 1, 1994. The 1993 emissions statement should be
submitted by November 1994, and each subsequent statement should be submitted by November of each year. The States
emissions statement reporting frequency satisfies USEPA's requirements.
USEPA requires the following operating information to be included in the State's rules: percent annual throughput
by season; days per week on the normal operating schedule; hours per day during the operating schedule; and hours per
year during the normal operating schedule. Ohio's rule requires sources to provide the weeks per year it operates
as opposed to the hours per year. In addition, Ohio requires sources to report the hours per day, days per week, and weeks
per year of operation. This is acceptable since USEPA can determine the hours per year a source operates from this information.
Ohio's rules do not require sources to report peak ozone season, annual throughput, and percent annual throughput
by season. USEPA can determine the peak ozone season process rate from the information required by Ohio's rule.
As discussed in the Technical Support Document, Ohio's rules satisfy USEPA's guidance to require appropriate information
on source location, operating rules, and process rates. Emissions statements submitted by sources must be certified
by an appropriate official as accurate.
Ohio's rules do not require that the Airs Facility Subsystem (AFS) control equipment codes and the AFS estimated emissions
method codes be provided. The rules do, however, require that a description of the existing control equipment, its
efficiency, and the emissions estimation method be provided. The AFS codes can be determined from this information.
Therefore, Federal requirements for control equipment information are satisfied.
Ohio Rules 3745-24-04(G) exempt sources that emit less than 10 pounds per day of VOC or NO

X

. Initially, USEPA objected to this provision since it is not specifically provided for under the CAA. USEPA has recently
reviewed the Columbus ozone emissions inventory provided by Ohio and concluded that the inventory demonstrates
that the exemption would not exclude a significant portion of the area's emissions. The point source VOC and NO

X

 emissions total 4030 tpy and 4543 tpy, respectively. Exempted emissions amount to only 4.6 tpy (0.11%) and 0 tpy for
VOC and NO

X

, respectively. Exempted emissions for the other nonattainment areas are expected to be of a similar magnitude. Since
exempted emissions do not represent a significant amount of the State's nonattainment area emissions, the USEPA
believes that the provisions of 3745-24-04(G) are approvable.


II. Final Action


USEPA is approving Ohio's emissions statement program SIP submittal through the Agency's direct final rulemaking
provisions. This rule will be effective December 12, 1994 unless notice is received that someone wishes to submit
adverse or critical comments. If the effective date is delayed, timely notice will be published in the 

Federal Register

. The Ohio Emissions Statement Program (Ohio Administrative Rules 3745-21-01, 3745-21-02,
3745-21-03, and 3745-21-04) are being incorporated by reference into the Ohio SIP for ozone.
The rules are available for inspection at: Air Docket 6102, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington,
DC 20460.


III. Procedural Background


This action is being taken without prior proposal because the changes are believed to be noncontroversial and USEPA
anticipates no significant comments on them. The public is advised that this action will be effective December 12,
1994, unless notice is received by November 14, 1994, that someone wishes to submit adverse or critical comments.
If the effective date is delayed, timely notice will be published in the 

Federal Register

. 
 Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting, allowing, or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. USEPA shall consider each request for revision to the SIP in light
of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors, and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory
requirements.
This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225). A revision to the SIP processing review tables was approved by the Acting
Administrator for the Office of Air and Radiation on October 4, 1993 (Michael Shapiro's memorandum to Regional Administrators).
A future document will inform the general public of these tables. Under the revised tables, this action remains classified
as 
Table 3.
On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the
requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of 2 years. The USEPA has submitted a
request for permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the temporary waiver until
such time as it rules on USEPA's request. This request remains in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded
Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. The OMB has exempted this regulatory action from Executive Order 12866
review.
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, USEPA should prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small
entities. (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact
on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include
small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations
of less than 50,000.
Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States
Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by December 12, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator
of this rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time
within which a petition for judicial review must be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such a rule.
This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. Section 307(b)(2).
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does not impose any new requirements,
it does not have a significant impact on any small
entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAA, preparation of a
regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of the State
action. The CAA forbids USEPA to base it actions concerning SIPS on such grounds.

ACTION: 

Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Commission has adopted a Fifth Order on Reconsideration to revise certain cable regulations affecting small
cable operators. Small operators now will be permitted a total of 90 days after their initial date of regulation to
complete and submit required rate justification forms and provide to subscribers advance notification of service
and equipment changes. Furthermore, small operators may make their initial basic tier rates, established in accordance
with the Commission's revised rate regulations, effective on 30-days notice without prior approval from their local
franchising authority. If, upon subsequent examination of a rate justification, a local franchising authority
or the Commission finds that a small operator has implemented rates in excess of the maximum permitted rate, refunds
may be ordered in accordance with the Commission's regulations. These actions will provide small cable operators
with the administrative flexibility needed to comply properly with the Commission's rate regulations.



The Commission also has adopted a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, which may be found elsewhere in this 

Federal Register

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This is a synopsis of the Fifth Order on Reconsideration in MM Docket No. 92-266 and MM Docket No. 93-215,
FCC 94-234, adopted September 12, 1994 and released September 26, 1994.



The complete text of this Fifth Order on Reconsideration is available for inspection and copying during normal business
hours in the FCC Reference Center (room 239), 1919 M Street, NW., Washington, DC, and also may be purchased from the

Synopsis of the Fifth Order on Reconsideration



Pursuant to the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 (``1992 Cable Act''), the Commission
has established a comprehensive regulatory framework governing rates for regulated cable services and equipment.
Under that framework, all regulated cable systems generally must set rates based on a 17 percent competitive rate
reduction from September 30, 1992 levels unless the system is (1) eligible for temporary transition relief, (2) is
eligible for temporary streamlined rate relief, or (3) justifies rates based on a cost-of-service showing.

The 1992 Cable Act requires the Commission to reduce regulatory burdens on small systems. Small systems are defined
in the statute as systems serving 1,000 or fewer subscribers. Pursuant to that mandate, the Commission's regulatory
framework governing regulated cable services incorporates several features designed to reduce administrative
burdens on small systems. These small systems may elect to make streamlined rate reductions, unbundle charges for
regulated equipment based on their average equipment costs, make use of a streamlined cost-of-service showing,
or opt for transitional rate relief. Small cable operators also may elect transitional rate relief. Small operators
are defined as operators serving 15,000 or fewer subscribers who are not affiliated with a larger operator.

Under the Commission's rules, cable operators must file a rate justification or cost-of-service showing for regulated
service and equipment, within 30 days of the initial date of regulation. All cable operators are required to have rates
and service offerings that comply with our rules on the initial date of regulation. Operators with equipment or service
charges that exceed permitted levels are subject to refund liability. As indicated, the 1992 Cable Act requires the
Commission to reduce administrative burdens for small systems. We believe this statutory purpose would be furthered
by permitting small operators a brief period of time to restructure and establish rates and service offerings that
comply with our rules after a tier becomes regulated, rather than require them to be in compliance with rate rules on
the initial date of regulation.

We take these actions on reconsideration on our own motion. Petitions for reconsideration in Dockets MM 92-266
and 93-215 addressing other aspects of our rate rules remain pending and will be addressed in subsequent Orders.
We take up these issues on our own motion in order to establish additional relief for small systems as required by the
Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992, 47 U.S.C.  543.

In the Rate Freeze Order, the Commission stated that it would consider lifting the freeze for a particular cable system
if it could demonstrate that the freeze would impose severe economic hardship or threaten the viability of continued
cable service. See Rate Freeze Order, MM Docket No. 92-266, FCC 93-176, 8 FCC Rcd 2921, 58 Fed. Reg. 17530
(April 5, 1993). The Commission later denied Fidelity Cablevision, Inc.'s request for a waiver of the rate freeze
for, among other things, failing to show that foreclosure proceedings had been, or would have been, initiated as a
result of the rate freeze. See Order in the Matter of Fidelity Cablevision, Inc. Petition for Emergency Relief, FCC
93-445, 9 FCC Rcd 2629 (1993). In a July 28, 1994 letter, Jere W. Glover, Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small
Business Administration, wrote to Chairman Reed E. Hundt that ``[p]roviding assistance at the time of bankruptcy
or other type of loan foreclosure is too little assistance too late.''

In the Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in MM Docket No. 93-215, the Commission made
available hardship rate relief for an operator that concludes that the benchmark/cost-of-service regulations
threaten its financial health or ability to provide cable service. See Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking, MM Docket No. 93-215, FCC 94-39, summarized at 59 Fed. Reg. 17975 (April 15, 1994). Such relief
does not require a showing that foreclosure or bankruptcy proceedings have been or would be imminently initiated,
and continued cable service need not be in jeopardy. An important factor in assessing any hardship showing will be
the operator's ability to meet costs, including costs associated with capital improvement and debt service. We recognize
that there are differences among cable operators based on system size, and that small operators may experience greater
difficulty in assembling documentation to make a hardship showing. Therefore, we would expect that a small operator
could rely on existing data rather than expending resources on obtaining an independent analysis of its financial
situation. Furthermore, the Commission recognizes that for those operators facing financial challenges, time
is of the essence. The Commission will work as expeditiously as possible to resolve any request for hardship rate relief
filed.

This will reduce administrative burdens on small operators by assuring that they will not need to undertake the steps
associated with establishing restructured rates and service offerings that comply with our rules, including completion
of FCC forms, until they are actually regulated. Moreover, this additional time to comply will not harm cable subscribers
because, under transition relief, small operators are not required in any event to make competitive rate reductions
pending the Commission's cost studies, but may set rates based on March 31, 1994 levels with some adjustments. Accordingly,
we conclude that establishing a period of time after regulation begins for small operators to comply will further
statutory purposes without injuring consumers.

We believe that 90 days after the initial date of regulation is an appropriate period of time for small operator to establish
rates and service offerings that comply with our rules. Accordingly, we will revise our rules to provide that small
operators are not required to establish rates and service offerings that comply with our rules for 90 days after the
initial date of regulation. In addition, in order to assure that this will reduce administrative burdens, we are changing
our rules to provide that small operators do not need to file necessary rate justification forms with the local franchising
authority, or the Commission, until 60 days after the initial date of regulation. However, we are not altering our
rules concerning provision of advance notice to subscribers. Pursuant to those rules, all operators, including
small operators, must give 30-days notice to subscribers prior to implementing rate and service changes.

Additionally, small systems and small operators may make their initial basic tier rates, established in accordance
with the Commission's revised rate regulations, effective on 30-days notice without prior approval from their local
franchising authority. If, upon subsequent examination of a rate justification, a local franchising authority
or the Commission finds that a small operator or small system has implemented rates in excess of the maximum permitted
rate, refunds may be ordered in accordance with our regulations.

Administrative Matters


Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis



Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C.   601-12, the Commission's final analysis
with respect to the Fifth Order on Reconsideration is as follows:

Need and purpose of this action. The Commission, in compliance with section 3(i) of the Cable Television Consumer
Protection and Competition Act of 1992 pertaining to rate regulation, adopts rules and procedures intended to ensure
cable subscribers of reasonable rates for cable services with minimum regulatory and administrative burden on cable
entities. 

Sumary of issues raised by the public comments in response to the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis. There
were no comments submitted in response to the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis. The Chief Counsel for Advocacy
of the United States Small Business Administration filed comments in the original rulemaking order (``SBA''). The
Commission addressed the concerns raised by the SBA in the First Report and Order, MM Docket No. 92-266, FCC 93-177.
The SBA filed reply comments in MM Docket No. 93-215 and the Small Cable Business Association filed reply comments
in MM Docket No. 92-266. Those comments will be reviewed as part of the instant Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.

Significant alternatives considered and rejected. Petitioners representing cable interests and franchising
authorities submitted several alternatives aimed at minimizing administrative burdens. The Commission responded
to these comments in previous Orders in these dockets. Although the Commission is issuing this Fifth Order on Reconsideration
on its own motion, the Commission has attempted to accommodate commenters' concerns and to reduce administrative
burdens by providing an additional period of time for small cable operators to comply with the rate regulations.

 Closure.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS announces the closure of the fishery for Atlantic bluefin tuna (ABT) conducted by vessels permitted in the Harpoon
Boat category. Closure is necessary because the annual quota for this category has been attained.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Regulations implemented under authority of the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act (16 U.S.C. 971-971h) pertaining
to harvest of Atlantic tunas by persons and vessels subject to U.S. jurisdiction appear at 50 CFR part 285.


Section 285.22(b) of the regulations provides for an annual quota of 53 metric tons of large medium and giant size class
ABT to be harvested from the Regulatory Area by vessels permitted in the Harpoon Boat category. The Assistant Administrator
for Fisheries, NOAA (AA) is authorized under  285.20(b)(1) to monitor the catch and landing statistics and,
on the basis of these statistics, to project a date when the total catch of ABT will equal any quota under  285.22.
The AA is further authorized under  285.20(b)(1) to prohibit fishing for, or retention of, ABT by the category
of gear subject to the quotas.
Based on landing reports, the AA has determined that the quota of ABT allocated for the Harpoon Boat category for 1994
will be attained by October 7, 1994. Fishing for, retention, possession, or landing of large medium or giant size class
ABT by vessels in the Harpoon Boat category must cease at 2330 hours on October 7, 1994.


Classification


This action is taken under the authority of 50 CFR 285.20, and is exempt from E.O. 12866.

Inseason Action


1994 Halibut Landing Report No. 16


Areas 2C, 3A, and 3B Closed to Halibut Fishing


Preliminary tabulation of catch figures for the September 12-14, 1994, fishing period in Areas 2C, 3A, and 3B
indicates that the season's catch in all three areas are close to their respective catch limits. While exact numbers
are not yet available, it is apparent that not enough halibut will be available in any of the areas to allow an October
fishing period. Therefore, all fishing in U.S. waters is now closed to halibut fishing for the remainder of 1994.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Fishing restrictions; request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS announces that further processing at sea of Pacific whiting (whiting) off Washington and Oregon was prohibited
at 2 p.m. local time Wednesday, October 5, 1994. This action was authorized by the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery
Management Plan (FMP) and was necessary to provide adequate amounts of whiting for shoreside processors and to achieve
the allocations adopted for 1994.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The regulations at 50 CFR 663.23(b)(4) allocate whiting in 1994-1996 between fishing vessels that deliver
at sea (catcher/processors and catcher boats delivering to motherships) and those that deliver shoreside (see the
final rule published at 59 FR 17491, April 13, 1994). When 60 percent of the annual harvest guideline is taken, further
at-sea processing is prohibited and the remaining 40 percent is reserved for use by vessels delivering shoreside.
The portion of the harvest guideline that the shoreside sector will not use by the end of the year, will be made available
for harvest by all fishing vessels, whether delivering shoreside or at sea, by August 15 or as soon as practicable thereafter.
Whiting may be released at a later date if it becomes apparent that shore-based needs have been substantially over-estimated
(50 CFR 663.23(b)(4)(ii).


In 1994, the whiting harvest guideline is 260,000 metric tons (mt). Of this, 104,000 mt was set aside initially as a
reserve for shoreside processing. At-sea processing of whiting was prohibited on May 13, 1994, when 60 percent (156,000
mt) of the harvest guideline was projected to be reached (59 FR 25832, May 18, 1994). Shore-based production was evaluated
in early August. No whiting was determined to be surplus to shore-based needs, so no release was made on August 15, 1994.
Shore-based production was reevaluated in late September. The NMFS Regional Director, Northwest Region, determined
that of the 38,000 mt of the harvest guideline remaining after September 25, 1994, 16,000 mt were surplus to shore-based
needs. This surplus was made available for at-sea processing on October 1, 1994 (59 FR 50857, October 6, 1994), with
the remaining 22,000 mt in reserve for shore-based processing. 
The best available data on October 4, 1994 indicate that approximately 8,300 mt of whiting had been processed at sea
through October 3, 1994, with a projected catch rate of 5,000 mt per day. At that rate, the 16,000-mt reserve release
would be reached by 2 p.m. (lo
