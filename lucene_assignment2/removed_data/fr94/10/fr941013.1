 Supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking 
(NPRM); Reopening of the comment period. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes to revise an earlier 
proposed airworthiness directive (AD), which would have 
superseded AD 91-08-01. That AD currently requires the 
following on Jetstream Aircraft Limited (JAL) Jetstream 
Model 3101 airplanes: revising the maximum speed for 
flaps at 50 degrees from 153/149 knots indicated 
airspeed (KIAS) to 130 KIAS; and limiting the maximum 
flap extension to 20 degrees anytime ice is present on 
the airplane. The previous notice proposed to provide 
the option of incorporating a flap system modification 
that would eliminate the requirements of AD 91-08-01. 
Since publication of that proposal, the Federal 
Aviation Administration (FAA) has re-examined all 
information related to this subject, and has determined 
that the flap system modification should be made 
mandatory rather than optional. The proposed actions 
are intended to prevent sudden pitch down of the 
airplane during icing conditions, which could lead to 
loss of control of the airplane.

Discussion 


A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal 
Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an AD 
that would apply to certain JAL Jetstream Model 3101 
airplanes was published in the 

Federal Register

 on July 
8, 1992 (57 FR 30174). That action proposed to 
supersede AD 
91-08-01 with a new AD that would (1) retain the flap 
system operating 
revision and limitation currently required by AD 91-08-01; and (2) limit the applicability to only those

airplanes that do not have the flap system modified in 
accordance with British Aerospace (BAe) Service 
Bulletin 
27-JA 910541. 
Interested persons have been afforded an 
opportunity to participate in the making of this 
amendment. One comment was received in agreement with 
the proposed AD and no comments were received 
concerning the FAA's determination of the cost upon the 
public. 
Since issuing that action, the FAA has re-examined 
all available information on this issue, and has 
determined that the limitation of maximum flap setting 
of 20 degrees in icing conditions presents an unsafe 
condition in certain circumstances. 
The Jetstream Model 3101 airplane has a feature 
known as ``lift dump'', which allows for proper 
deceleration by automatically extending flaps from the 
50 degree position to the 70 degree position when the 
nose wheel strut is compressed during landing. When 
landing with a flap setting of 20 degrees, ``lift dump'' 
is not normally available, which can make deceleration 
more dependent upon propeller reverse or manual 
selection. 
Propeller reverse is utilized in normal operation 
as an aid in reducing landing roll distance. The other 
option is manually selecting flaps from 20 degrees to 
50 degrees immediately after touchdown while the 
airplane is traveling at a higher speed. When the 
operator selects the 50-degree position with all ground 
logic constraints satisfied, the flaps will extend to 
the 70-degree position. This technique can result in 
high aerodynamic loads upon the flap, which could cause 
structural damage that, if not detected and corrected, 
could result in loss of airplane directional control 
caused by failure of the flap system. Also, there is a 
temporary increase in wing lift when manually extending 
the wings from 20 degrees to 35 degrees, which could 
result in the airplane becoming airborne or a reduction 
of directional control and braking force. 
Because ``lift dump'' is available with the flaps 
at the 35-degree position during landing, the FAA has 
determined that (1) the flap system modification that 
allows the use of flaps at 35-degrees with ice visible 
should be incorporated; and (2) AD action should be 
taken to prevent sudden pitch down of the airplane 
during icing conditions, which could lead to loss of 
control of the airplane. 
Since incorporating the 35 degrees flap 
modification into the notice of proposed rulemaking 
specifies additional procedures that go beyond the 
scope of what was originally proposed, the notice has 
been revised accordingly and the comment period has 
been reopened to provide additional time for public 
comment. The proposed AD would supersede AD 91-08-01 
with a new AD that would (1) retain the flap system 
operating revision and limitation currently required 
until the 35-degree flap system modification was 
incorporated; and (2) eventually require incorporating 
the 35-degree flap system modification in accordance 
with the instructions in Jetstream Aircraft Limited SB 
No. 27-JA 910541, which consists of the following 
pages:

The FAA estimates that 141 airplanes in the U.S. 
registry would be affected by the proposed AD, that it 
would take approximately 23 workhours per airplane to 
accomplish the proposed modification, and that the 
average labor rate is approximately $55 an hour. The 
manufacturer will provide parts at no cost to the 
owner/operator. Based on these figures, the total 
cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is 
estimated to be $194,580. This figure is based on the 
assumption that no affected owner/operator has 
incorporated the proposed modification. 
Jetstream Aircraft Limited has informed the FAA 
that 122 modification kits have been delivered to 
affected airplane owners/operators. Since each of 
these airplane operators have incorporated revised 
flight manual supplements, the FAA assumes that each of 
these kits is installed on one of the affected 
airplanes. With this in mind, the proposed cost impact 
upon U.S. operators would be reduced $168,300 from 
$194,580 to $26,220. In addition, Jetstream Aircraft 
Limited informed the FAA that the other 19 affected 
airplanes are in the storage inventory of their sister 
company JSX. The policy of JSX is to incorporate this 
modification before distributing one of the affected 
airplanes to an operator. Taking these factors into 
consideration, the proposed AD would provide no 
economic cost impact upon U.S. operators. 
The regulations proposed herein would not have 
substantial direct effects on the States, on the 
relationship between the national government and the 
States, or on the distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various levels of 
government. Therefore, in 
accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined 
that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism 
implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism 
Assessment. 
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that 
this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory 
action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a 
``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and 
Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if 
promulgated, will not have a significant economic 
impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number 
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory 
evaluation prepared for this action has been placed in 
the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes to supersede AD 81-09-03 R1, which currently requires repetitively inspecting
the rudder pedal adjusting mounting bracket for cracks on Jetstream Aircraft Limited (JAL) HP137 Mk1 and Jetstream
series 200 airplanes, and replacing any cracked bracket. The Federal Aviation Administration's policy on aging
commuter-class aircraft is to eliminate, or in certain instances, reduce the number of repetitions of certain short-interval
inspections when improved parts or modifications are available. The proposed action would require replacing the
mounting bracket with a new mounting bracket of improved design as terminating action for the repetitive inspections
that are currently required by AD 81-09-03 R1. The actions specified in the proposed AD are intended to
prevent inadvertent rudder movement caused by a cracked rudder pedal adjusting mounting bracket, which could result
in loss of rudder control.

Availability of NPRMs 



Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Central Region, Office of the Assistant
Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules 
Docket No. 94-CE-14-AD, Room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106. 



Discussion 



The FAA has determined that reliance on critical repetitive inspections on aging commuter-class airplanes carries
an unnecessary safety risk when a design change exists that could eliminate, or in certain instances, reduce the number
of repetitions of those critical inspections. In determining what inspections are critical, the FAA considers (1)
the safety consequences of the airplane if the known problem is not detected by the inspection; (2) the reliability
of the inspection such as the probability of not detecting the known problem; (3) whether the inspection area is difficult
to access; and (4) the possibility of damage to an adjacent structure as a result of the problem. 

These factors have led the FAA to establish an aging commuter-class aircraft policy that requires incorporating
a known design change when it could replace a critical repetitive inspection. With this policy in mind, the FAA recently
conducted a review of existing AD's that apply to JAL HP137 Mk1 and Jetstream series 200 airplanes. Assisting the FAA
in this review were (1) the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom;
(2) JAL; (3) the Regional Airlines Association (RAA); and (4) several U.S. and foreign operators of the affected airplanes.


From this review, the FAA has identified AD 81-09-03 R1, Amendment 39-4150, as one that should be
superseded with a new AD that would require a modification that could eliminate the need for short-interval and critical
repetitive inspections. AD 81-09-03 R1 currently requires repetitively inspecting the rudder pedal
adjusting mounting bracket for cracks on Jetstream Aircraft Limited HP137 Mk1 and Jetstream series 200 airplanes,
and replacing any cracked bracket. 

JAL has developed Modification No. 5162, which introduces a new rudder pedal adjusting mounting bracket with increased
sectional dimension, part number (P/N) 1379111E 1. Included with this modification are Instructions to Modification
No. 5162, Part 1 and Part 2, Issue 1, dated June 1981.

As a result of the previously discussed AD review, 
the CAA listed the actions specified in the referenced 
service instructions as mandatory with CAA AD 003-07-81 
in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these 
airplanes in the United Kingdom. 

This airplane model is manufactured in the United 
Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the 
United States under the provisions of section 21.29 of 
the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the 
applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant 
to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has 
kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. 

Based on its aging commuter-class aircraft policy 
and after reviewing all available information including 
that received from the CAA, the FAA has determined that 
AD action should be taken to (1) eliminate the 
repetitive short-interval inspections required by AD 81-09-03 R1, Amendment 39-4150; and (2)
continue 
preventing inadvertent rudder movement caused by a 
cracked rudder pedal adjusting mounting bracket, which 
could result in loss of rudder control. 

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that 
is likely to exist or develop in other JAL HP137 Mk1 
and Jetstream series 200 airplanes of the same type 
design, the proposed AD would supersede AD 
81-09-03 R1 with a new AD that would (1) retain the 
inspections of the rudder pedal adjusting mounting 
bracket for cracks and require replacing any cracked 
part as required by the current AD; and (2) require 
replacing this mounting bracket with an improved part 
of increased sectional dimension, P/N 1379111E 1, as 
terminating action for the repetitive inspections. The 
proposed inspection would be accomplished in accordance 
with Jetstream Service Bulletin No. 9/10, dated April 
28, 1981. The proposed replacement would be 
accomplished in accordance with the Instructions to 
Modification No. 5162, Part 1 and Part 2, Issue 1, 
dated June 1981. 

The FAA estimates that 11 airplanes in the U.S. 
registry would be affected by the proposed AD, that it 
would take approximately 160 workhours per airplane to 
accomplish the proposed modification, and that the 
average labor rate is approximately $55 an hour. Parts 
cost approximately $1,800 per airplane. Based on these 
figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on 
U.S. operators is estimated to be $116,600. 

All 11 of the affected airplanes are HP137 Mk1's; 
there are no Jetstream series 200 airplanes registered 
in the United States, but they are type certificated 
for operation in the United States. According to FAA 
records, none of these HP137 Mk1 airplanes are in 
operation or anywhere near operating condition. For 
this reason, JAL no longer stocks Modification No. 
5162, but can develop modification kits within three 
months after order. Since there are no airplanes 
currently in operation, the cost impact of the proposed 
AD would be narrowed to only those owners/operators 
returning their airplane to operation. 

The regulations proposed herein would not have 
substantial direct effects on the States, on the 
relationship between the national government and the 
States, or on the distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various levels of 
government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive 
Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would 
not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant 
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that 
this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory 
action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a 
``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and 
Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if 
promulgated, will not have a significant economic 
impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number 
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory 
evaluation prepared for this action has been placed in

ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes to adopt a new 
airworthiness directive that would apply to Jetstream 
Aircraft Limited (JAL) HP137 Mk1, Jetstream series 200, 
and Jetstream Models 3101 and 3201 airplanes. The 
proposed action would require repetitively inspecting 
the passenger/crew cabin door handle mounting platform 
structure for cracks, and, if found cracked, replacing 
with a structure of improved design as terminating 
action for the repetitive inspections. Cracks found on 
this structure on two of the affected airplanes 
prompted the proposed action. The proposed actions are 
intended to prevent the inability to open the 
passenger/crew door because of a cracked internal 
handle mounting platform structure, which could result 
in passenger injury if emergency evacuation was needed.

Discussion 


The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the 
airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, 
recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may 
exist on JAL HP137 Mk1, Jetstream series 200, and 
Jetstream Models 3101 and 3201 airplanes. The CAA 
reports two incidents of passenger/crew cabin door 
handle mounting platform structure cracking.

This condition, if not detected and corrected, could 
result in the inability to open the passenger/crew door 
and possible passenger injury if emergency evacuation 
was needed. 
Jetstream Aircraft Limited has issued Service 
Bulletin 52-A-JA 930901, Revision 1, dated February 
11, 1994, which specifies procedures for inspecting 
and replacing the passenger/crew internal door handle 
mounting platform structure on JAL HP137 Mk1, Jetstream 
series 200, and Jetstream Models 3101 and 3201 
airplanes. The CAA classified this service bulletin 
as mandatory in order to assure the continued 
airworthiness of these airplanes in the United Kingdom. 
The CAA classifying a service bulletin as mandatory in 
the United Kingdom is equivalent to the FAA issuing an 
airworthiness directive in the United States. 
This airplane model is manufactured in the United 
Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the 
United States under the provisions of  21.29 of 
the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the 
applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant 
to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has 
kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. 
The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed 
all available information, and determined that AD 
action is necessary for products of this type design 
that are certificated for operation in the United 
States. 
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that 
is likely to exist or develop in other JAL HP137 Mk1, 
Jetstream series 200, and Jetstream Models 3101 and 
3201 airplanes of the same type design, the proposed AD 
would require repetitively inspecting the 
passenger/crew cabin door handle mounting platform 
structure for cracks, and, if found cracked, replacing 
with a structure of improved design as terminating 
action for the repetitive inspections. The proposed 
actions would be accomplished in accordance with the 
service information described above. 
The FAA estimates that 165 airplanes in the U.S. 
registry would be affected by the proposed AD, that it 
would take approximately 1 workhour per airplane to 
accomplish the proposed modification, and that the 
average labor rate is approximately $55 an hour. 
Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the 
proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be 
$8,800. This figure does not take into account any 
possible passenger/crew door internal handle mounting 
platform structure replacements nor repetitive 
inspections. The FAA has no way of determining how 
many of these structures may have cracks or the number 
of repetitive inspections each owner/operator may 
incur. 
The regulations proposed herein would not have 
substantial direct effects on the States, on the 
relationship between the national government and the 
States, or on the distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various levels of 
government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive 
Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would 
not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant 
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that 
this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory 
action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a 
``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and 
Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if 
promulgated, will not have a significant economic 
impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number 
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act. A copy 
of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this 
action has been placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of 
it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at

Special Event Tours



<AGENCY>

 Office of the Secretary, DOT.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking.







</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department seeks comment on a proposal to expand its rules on Super Bowl tours to cover air tours to other types of
special events. These Super Bowl rules require that operators of Super Bowl tours that are promoted as including game
tickets must have those game tickets in hand or under contract before they advertise or sell the tours, and that they
must refund the entire tour price to any customer who does not receive a promised game ticket. This proposed rule would
also extend the charter rule's prohibition on last-minute price increases to non-charter tours to special events.
This initiative arises as a result of problems on certain tours to the 1994 Rose Bowl on which participants did not receive
game tickets that were promoted as being included in the package, or were required to make additional payments in order
to receive tickets.






</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In conjunction with the Rose Bowl football game that was played in Pasadena, California on January 1, 1994, a large
number of fans of the University of Wisconsin (one of the two teams participating in the game) purchased package tours
to California. Many of those tours were promoted as including a ticket to the Rose Bowl game. However, a significant
number of these individuals either did not receive the game tickets that they had been promised and did not gain admission
to the game, or were required to make an additional payment after they arrived in Pasadena in order to obtain their tickets.
The Department is seeking comment on a proposal to extend its rules on Super Bowl tours to include air tours to other
types of special events where admission to the event is advertised as being included in the package. 



The Department's rules on Super Bowl charters are contained in title 14, part 380 of the Code of Federal Regulations
(14 CFR part 380):

 Section 380.2 defines a Super Bowl charter as a charter flight that is represented by its charter operator as
including tickets to the National Football League's Super Bowl game as part of its ground package.
 Section 380.18a states that a Super Bowl charter may not be advertised unless the operator has submitted verification
to the Department
 that the operator (1) is in physical possession of enough Super Bowl game tickets to provide them for a substantial
number of seats on the charter, or (2) has a contract with the NFL or with an NFL team for such a number of game tickets,
or (3) has a contract with another person who has a contract with the NFL or an NFL team for such a number of game tickets.




 Section 380.18a also states that a Super Bowl charter may not be sold unless the operator has submitted verification
to the Department that the operator has possession of, or contracts for, enough game tickets to provide one to every
person who is to receive one under the terms of the operator/participant contract for the charter.

 Section 380.31(c) states that if an operator receives a booking for which he or she does not have possession
of or a contract for a game ticket, the operator must return that participant's money within 3 days, unless the participant
has authorized the operator in writing to retain the payment while the operator seeks additional tickets.

 Sections 380.32(s), 380.33(a)(5) and 380.33(e) state that if Super Bowl game tickets are not supplied when
promised, the affected participant must be sent a refund of the price of the entire charter package within 14 days after
the return flight.


These rules came about following problems with game tickets for Super Bowl tours in the late 1970's (see 45 FR 1856,
January 9, 1980). The rules were limited to the Super Bowl because that was the only event where such problems had surfaced.



In addition to the Super Bowl rules in Part 380, the Department has a policy statement at 14 CFR 399.87 which states that
it shall be an unfair or deceptive practice within the meaning of section 411 of the Federal Aviation Act (now 49 U.S.C.
41712) to advertise or sell an air tour that is promoted as including a ticket to the Super Bowl game unless the operator
has tickets or contracts for tickets in the manner described in 14 CFR 380.18a (see above). The principal purpose of
this policy statement is to reach tours operated on scheduled air service, which are not covered by the part 380 charter
rules. The part 399 policy statement mirrors  380.18a, but does not include the other part 380 provisions described
above. Most importantly, it does not include the requirement that the entire tour price be refunded if a game ticket
is not provided.


On January 27, 1994, the Department issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in this proceeding (published
February 1, 1994; 59 FR 4614). In this notice, we stated that we were tentatively proposing to issue a new rule that would
contain the procedures of the Super Bowl provisions of both part 380and part 399, and to extend this rule to other types
of events. Like current  399.87, the new rule would apply to tours on all forms of air transportation, not just
charters. Like the existing Super Bowl charter rules in part 380, the new regulation would require the tour operator
to refund the entire tour price to any participant who does not receive a promised event ticket, even if the tour were
not on a charter. The proposed rule would also pick up the procedures of  380.31(c) of the charter rule, which
requires an operator to refund any money received for a booking within 3 days if the operator has no contract for an event
ticket for that person, unless the person has authorized the operator in writing to retain the payment while the operator
seeks a ticket. 



In addition to setting out the Department's tentative rulemaking proposal, the January ANPRM asked commenters to
address a number of questions about the types of issues that such a rule should apply to. The discussion of the comments
that appears below is organized according to those questions.



Comments




The Department received comments from 11 organizations and 7 individuals. The great majority of the comments favored
adoption of a rule in this area.



Q. Should the rule apply only to major sports events which would be listed in the rule (for example, the Super Bowl, college
bowl games, the NCAA Final Four, the World Cup finals, the Olympics)? To any sports event? To religious events (for
instance, the Passion Play in Oberammergau)? To any event? 

Several of the comments discussed only sports events as the context for the rule. The National Collegiate Athletic
Association (NCAA) recommended applying the rule to the Division I Final Four men's and women's basketball championships,
the College World Series, and post-season college football bowl games. The Football Bowl Association (FBA), an organization
representing all 19 post-season college football bowl games, also felt that all post-season football bowl games
should be covered, and stated that it offered no comment on whether other events should or should not be covered. The
National Hockey League (NHL) commented that the rule should apply to all major professional and amateur sports events.
Ms. Sara Shea said that the Super Bowl rule should be expanded to include other special sporting events.


The Wisconsin Attorney General stated that the rule should not be limited to specifically named events, but perhaps
could be limited to ``competitive events'' where participants and locations are determined close to the date of the
event. He said that for non-competitive events such as the Passion Play in Oberammergau, the dates, locations and
participants are known well in advance and existing consumer protections should be adequate. 


Other commenters stated that the rule should not be limited to sports events. The American Society of Travel Agents
(ASTA) said that it should apply to all events where a separately-purchased ticket is necessary for admission to the
event. The RG Travel Companies, which were involved in sending 1,700 Wisconsin fans to the 1994 Rose Bowl, stated that
the rule should cover any special event ``where a good possibility exists that the demand for tickets will exceed the
supply * * *'' In a similar vein, the Pasadena Tournament of Roses commented that the rule should
apply to any event with limited admission. The National Tour Association (NTA, representing motor coach tour operators)
and Congressman Robert Andrews of New Jersey expressed the opinion that the rule should not be limited to sports events.
Ms. Arlene Caldwell said that the rule should cover any tour that claims to include a ticket to the event, and Mr. Donald
Hamilton stated that it should apply to any event for which tour packages are sold.


Q. Should the rule apply to both charter and scheduled transportation?


All of the commenters that expressed an opinion on this point felt that the rule should apply to both scheduled and charter
air transportation. Those commenters were the RG Travel Companies, NACA, the NHL, ASTA, the NCAA, FBA, the Pasadena
Tournament of Roses, and the Wisconsin Attorney General.


Q. Should the rule contain only the advertising and sale restrictions of   380.18a and 399.87 (of the current
Super Bowl rule), or should it also contain the ``money back guarantee'' of   380.32 and 380.33 and/or
the ``booking rejection'' and ``contingent booking'' procedures of  380.31(c)?


Sections 380.18a and 399.87 prohibit advertising or sale of a ``Super Bowl tour'' (defined as one which is held out
as including a ticket to the Super Bowl game) until the operator has physical possession of game tickets or has a contract
with the National Football League, with an NFL team, or with another person who has a contract with the league or a team.
Sections 380.32 and 380.33 state that any participant on a Super Bowl tour who does not receive promised game tickets
must be given a refund of the entire tour price, even if a portion of the services are used. Section 380.31(c) provides
that if an operator receives a booking for which he or she does not have possession of or a contract for a game ticket,
the operator must return that participant's money within 3 days, unless the participant has authorized the operator
in writing to retain the payment while the operator seeks additional tickets. 

Except for NTA, all commenters that expressed a position on this question felt that some form of regulation along these
lines was appropriate. NTA stated that the majority of its members that responded to a poll on this matter felt that
regulation of special-event tours should not be a responsibility of the government, but the association said that
in the event a rule is adopted it favors the ``booking rejection'' and''contingent booking'' procedures of  380.31(c).

ASTA and the Wisconsin Attorney General also expressed support for the ``booking rejection'' and ``contingent booking''
procedures. They favored the ``money back guarantee'' as well, as did the RG Travel Companies, the National Air Carrier
Association (NACA, an organization of charter airlines), the NHL, NCAA, FBA, and Pasadena Tournament of Roses. The
Tournament of Roses stated that this guarantee should apply ``at any time prior to departure'' if it is clear tickets
will not be forthcoming. FBA commented ``the greater the remedy available, the less likely that tour packagers will
create the problem by promoting packages that may not be legitimate.'' 

NACA said that there should be an exception to the ``money back guarantee'' for situations of force majeure and acts
of God, such as the earthquake in San Francisco that forced postponement of the World Series. Similarly, the NHL stated
that if the event is canceled or substantially altered after the tour begins, consumers should be entitled only to
a refund of the face value of the event ticket, but that if such cancellation or alteration takes place before departure,
the operator should be required to inform the consumers, who would have the right to cancel (presumably with a full
refund).


Congressman Andrews was also in favor of the ``money back guarantee,'' as well as a requirement for tour operators
to disclose whether event tickets are guaranteed or tentative. However, he stated that any rule that would totally
prohibit marketing of a special-event tour until the tour operator has event tickets in hand would not be practical.
Tickets for many such events are not available until less than two weeks before the event, he pointed out, but other
arrangements (e.g., air and hotel) must be made before that. NTA, the NCAA and the Wisconsin Attorney General stated
that the current restrictions against marketing Super Bowl tours until the operator has game tickets in hand or under
contract should be included in the new rule.

Q. If the scope of the type of event covered by the rule is broad, and the rule contains the ``money back guarantee,''
should procedures be included that would protect the operator from having to refund the entire tour price if a participant
doesn't receive promised admission to something like a welcoming cocktail party?

No commenters spoke in favor of a requirement to apply the ``money back guarantee'' to events such as a welcoming cocktail
party. Of those who commented on the issue, NTA, the NHL, ASTA, the Pasadena Tournament of Roses said that operators
should not be required to refund the entire tour price over failure to provide something like a promised welcoming
cocktail party. NACA and the Wisconsin Attorney General stated that the rule should require the value of undelivered
ancillary events to be refunded, but should not require a refund of the entire tour price. FBA and the Wisconsin Attorney
General both pointed out that certain events on a special event tour (e.g., the Tournament of Roses parade on a Rose
Bowl tour) are integral to the experience for which the tour was organized while other events on the same tour (e.g.,
a side trip to Disneyland) are not. These two commenters suggest that integral events be protected by the'' money back
guarantee'' of the total tour price, but not other events.

Q. Should the rule specifically ban last-minute or post-departure price increases for admission to the event, one
of the problems that allegedly occurred on the 1994 Rose Bowl tours?


All commenters who offered an opinion on this subject felt that last-minute price increases should be regulated in
some manner. The RG Travel Companies, NACA, the NCAA, ASTA, the Wisconsin Attorney General and Mr. Donald Hamilton
stated that last-minute price increases should be banned. FBA and the Pasadena Tournament of Roses said that price
increases at any time following purchase should be prohibited unless the consumer receives written notice that the
operator reserves this right. The Pasadena Tournament of Roses also suggested that participants who cancel within
a few days of notification of a price increase be entitled to a full refund. The Wisconsin Attorney General commented
that on tours to special events, ``last-minute or post-departure price increases are common and are tantamount to
extortion'' because other options may be sold out.


The NHL stated that, in general, price increases should be banned unless the face value of the ticket has been increased
subsequent to departure of the tour. However, for events with short lead times such as the Stanley Cup playoffs, the
NHL said that the rule should permit tours on which participants are required to agree to purchase event tickets at
the yet-unknown face price plus a service fee, as long as the consumer is given prominent notice of this fact.


Q. Some tours are promoted in conjunction with a special event, but do not include, and do not represent that they include,
admission to the event. For example, there have been tours to the Super Bowl host city during the Super Bowl weekend
that prominently feature ``Super Bowl'' in the headline of advertisements and flyers, but which do not include game
tickets. Should the new rule ban this practice, or require affirmative, prominent disclosure that admission to the
event is not included?

All of the commenters that expressed an opinion on this issue felt that it should be regulated in some manner. The RG
Travel Companies stated that they favored either banning the practice or requiring disclosure. The NCAA urged affirmative,
prominent disclosure, ``if such tours are to be allowed at all.'' All others who commented on this point (the NHL, ASTA,
FBA, the Pasadena Tournament of Roses, and the Wisconsin Attorney General) recommended prominent disclosure. The
NHL suggested a requirement that text disclosing the absence of event tickets from event-oriented tours should be
at least 75 percent of the size of the name of the event in advertising material. The Pasadena Tournament of Roses said
that such disclosures should be at least twice the size of the smallest text elsewhere in the ad or flyer, but in no case
less than 12-point type, and that disclosure during verbal contacts should also be required.

Q. What would be the economic burdens of such a rule? Would the rule be impractical for events where the participants
are known only a week in advance, e.g. the NCAA Final Four?

All of the parties that commented on this issue agreed that the rule can and should apply to events in which the participants
are not known until shortly before the event. The RG Travel Companies commented that the rule would not be impractical
because commitments centering around a particular team could be made contingent on that team qualifying for the event.
NACA said the ``money back guarantee'' should apply regardless of the timing of the event. The NHL stated that the rule
may be burdensome for organizers of short-lead-time tours, but that this is justified by the benefit to consumers.
(Note also the NHL's earlier suggestion that on events where the participants become known only shortly beforehand,
the rule should permit tours in which the participants must agree to purchase an event ticket whose face value is not
yet known.)

ASTA, like NACA, said that the degree of advance notice is not relevant, and that an operator who markets an event-oriented
tour before the participants are known should simply disclose that event tickets are not included in the advertised
price. FBA commented that participating teams in college bowl games are generally known at least a month in advance,
and also that any experience the Department has had with Super Bowl tours would be instructive, as the competing teams
in that game are sometimes determined only a week before the game.

The Pasadena Tournament of Roses, the NCAA and the Wisconsin Attorney General all pointed out that even though the
participating teams in the NCAA Final Four (the example in this question) are determined only the weekend before,
the tickets are sold out months beforehand. Thus, the fact that the participants are not known until the final week
has minimal impact on the availability of tickets and the feasibility of tours. The Pasadena Tournament of Roses asserted
that any economic burden resulting from this rule would fall on ticket brokers and tour operators who buy event tickets
from individuals in order to resell them. The Wisconsin Attorney General stated that consumer protection may be even
more important in cases where event participants are determined at the last minute, because consumers have less time
to investigate their options.



Other Comments



The Air Transport Association (ATA, an association of large scheduled airlines) filed a comment stating that it expressed
no opinion about whether, or to what extent, the current Super Bowl rules should be made applicable to tours to other
special events. However, ATA said that DOT should not make air carriers responsible for assuring that tour operators
comply with the new rule. NACA echoed this view, stating that carriers should not be made the guarantors of tour operators.



Discussion



We have decided to propose a rule very similar to that described in the ANPRM, which in turn closely tracks the existing
rules for Super Bowl tours.

The rule that we are proposing would apply to any tour that is organized for the purpose of attending a sporting, social,
religious, educational, cultural, political or other event of a special nature and limited duration, which exists
for reasons apart from the tour itself, and which is represented by the operator of the tour as including admission
to that event. The Department does not wish to engage in line-drawing ofthe type that would be required were we to publish
a list of specific events that would be covered by the rule. In addition, we see no justification for limiting the applicability
of the rule to sporting events. Few commenters specifically suggested such a limitation, although a number of them
offered sports contests as examples of the type of event that should be covered. While the Wisconsin Attorney General
is of course correct when he comments that the date and location of a non-competitive event such as the Passion Play
in Oberammergau is known well in advance, this in itself does not lessen the likelihood of ticket shortages. 

We agree with the comments that suggested that the rule should apply to any event where a separate ticket is required
for admission to the event or where there is limited admission. The rule that we are proposing will apply to any tour
to an event of the type described at the beginning of the previous paragraph in which the tour operator has represented
that the tour includes admission to the event. If the event is free, or attendance is unlimited, the operator should
have no trouble furnishing tickets and this rule will impose no burden. On the other hand, if tours are promoted to an
unusually popular event of a non-sporting nature, those tour participants would be just as disappointed at not receiving
the promised admission to the event that constituted the entire purpose of their trip as would a fan traveling to a bowl
game.

We have tentatively concluded that the rule should apply to both charter and scheduled air transportation, as well
as to any other form of air service meeting the statutory definition of ``air transportation'' that may develop in
the future. Thus, we are proposing to apply it to ``scheduled, charter, and other air transportation.''

The proposed rule would apply to all interstate (i.e., domestic)
 air transportation, and to foreign (i.e., international) air transportation originating at a point within the United
States. Applying the rule only to outbound international flights is consistent with the approach taken in the existing
Public Charter rule (see 14 CFR 380.23) and with the'' country of origin'' concept of regulation of international
air transportation. As a policy matter, the Department has no interest in applying this rule to tours originating
in foreign countries whose participants are largely or exclusively foreign citizens.





The rule that we are proposing would apply to any operator of a tour that meets the definition of a Special Event Tour,
regardless of whether that operator is a direct air carrier (i.e., an airline), an indirect air carrier (e.g., a Public
Charter operator), or a ticket agent (e.g., a scheduled-service tour operator, including a travel agent acting as
a tour operator). The proposed rule would apply to both U.S. and foreign entities that act as operators of Special Event
Tours, just as current  399.87 does.

With regard to the comments of ATA and NACA, the ANPRM did not propose, and wedo not propose here, that this rule should
include provisions that obligate direct air carriers to assure that tour operators comply with the rule. Except where
an airline might choose to directly operate a Special Event Tour (i.e., to become the tour operator), a direct air carrier
of a Special Event Tour will incur no greater or lesser obligations under this rule than it has in its capacity as a common
carrier either certificated under 49 U.S.C. 41101 or holding a foreign air carrier permit issued under 49 U.S.C. 41301
(formerly sections 401 and 402 ofthe Federal Aviation Act).

As we suggested in the ANPRM, we are proposing to carry over the provisions from the existing Super Bowl rule that prohibit
advertising or sale of such tours before game tickets are in hand or under contract. In the rule we are proposing here,
these provisions will be expanded to apply to all special events. This approach was supported by the comments, and
involves no novel processes since the existing procedures have been in place in the Super Bowl rule for 15 years.

In addition to the provision that prohibits advertising or sale of a Super Bowl tour until game tickets are in hand or
under contract, the Super Bowl charter rule requires Super Bowl charter operators to include in the prospect us that
is required to be filed with the Department for all Public Charters a certification that they have the game tickets
in hand or else a copy of the contract for the game tickets. We do not propose to carry over this additional filing requirement
to the new rule. The underlying requirement to have the tickets or ticket contracts before advertising or sales commence
will remain and is enforceable. The Super Bowl rules that apply to scheduled-service tours have never required a filing
of this type. Now that regulation of this type of tour is being consolidated in a single rule, we see no justification
for having a filing requirement for charter tours but not scheduled-service tours, nor do we see a need to impose a new
paperwork burden on scheduled-service tour operators. This action is consistent with the Paperwork Reduction Act
and with the Department's proposal in Docket 48341 (57 FR 42864) to eliminate unnecessary paperwork burdens on charters.

Congressman Andrews expressed concern that any rule that would prohibit marketing of a tour until tickets are in hand
would not be practical, since tickets for many events are not available until a couple of weeks in advance but other
arrangements (e.g., air and hotel) must be made before that. However, neither the existing nor proposed rules requires
that tickets be in hand before marketing is allowed; the operator must simply have a written contract for the tickets.

The proposed rule also incorporates the so-called ``booking rejection'' and ``contingent booking'' procedures
currently found in  380.31(c) of the Super Bowl charter rule, and expands them to apply to all events and to all
forms of air transportation. These provisions require operators to return unsolicited bookings for which they don't
have event tickets unless a tour participant authorizes the operator in writing to retain the participant's payment
while the operator attempts to obtain more event tickets. We are modifying this slightly to allow for situations in
which participants agree to take the tour without an event ticket; the operator would be required to obtain the participant's
written acknowledgment of this understanding.

One of the key provisions of the Super Bowl charter rule is the requirement for the operator to refund the total tour
price to any participant who does not receive a promised game ticket, even if the participant uses all of the other tour
features. The ANPRM tentatively proposed to incorporate this provision in the new rule, but also asked for comment
on whether the rule should contain only the ``booking rejection'' and ``contingent booking'' procedures without
the ``money back guarantee.'' However, the comments solidly supported the ``money back guarantee,'' and we have
incorporated it in the proposed rule. We agree with the Football Bowl Association that strong consumer remedies will
also have the effect of deterring the promotion of non-legitimate tour packages.

NACA commented that there should be an exception to the ``money back guarantee'' for situations of force majeure and
acts of God, such as the earthquake in San Francisco that caused postponement of the World Series. The NHL suggested
that if the event is canceled or substantially altered, participants should be entitled only to a refund of the face
value of the event, not the total tour price. It was never our intent to make the tour operator the guarantor of the event
itself. The ``money back guarantee'' in the existing Super Bowl charter rule kicks in ``if game tickets are not supplied.''
The rule we are proposing here would require refunds ``. . . if promised admission to the [event] is
not furnished by the tour operator . . .'' These provisions are directed toward potential problems
with ticket distribution, not with the event itself. If people who have

 tickets are able to attend the event and Special Event Tour participants are shut out because they don't have tickets,
the ``money back guarantee'' applies. On the other hand, if nobody with a ticket can use it during the period of the tour
because the event itself was canceled or postponed, the ``money back guarantee'' does not apply.

We wish to make it clear that we are talking only about problems with the event itself, not about any or all problems that
the tour operator might view as beyond its control. Failure of a ticket broker to deliver tickets to the tour operator
does not invalidate the ``money back guarantee.''

We agree with the NHL that if the event is canceled consumers should receive a refund for the portion of their tour price
that applied to the event that they paid for but did not receive. However, mandating such a partial refund in a situation
where the event itself did not take place and where there were no problems with ticket distribution is beyond the scope
of this proceeding. This is a matter best dealt with in the context of contract law or other applicable existing law.

The ANPRM solicited comment on whether the rule should include procedures to protect the tour operator from having
to refund the total tour price to participants who don't receive promised admission to an ``event'' like a welcoming
cocktail party. Most commenters who addressed this issue were opposed to requiring a refund of the entire tour price
in these circumstances. Some suggested that participants so affected simply be entitled to a refund of the value of
that ancillary event. Two commenters urged that a tour operator's failure to deliver admission to ancillary events
that are integral to the experience for which the tour was organized (e.g., the Tournament of Roses parade on a Rose
Bowl tour) should entitle the participant to a refund of the total tour price.

In raising this issue in the ANPRM, the Department had intended to focus on the situation of a tour that would not normally
be thought of as a Special Event Tour but which held out admission to an ``event'' as one of its features, e.g., a welcoming
cocktail party on a 5-day package to the Bahamas. If the definition of ``special event'' had been broad, we were concerned
that the rule might have the effect of requiring refunds of the entire price on such tours after failure to deliver a
relatively minor and low-value component. The comments have shed light on another issue: multiple ``events'' on
a true Special Event Tour. 
We agree with the commenters that failure to deliver a relatively minor feature should not result in a refund of the
total tour price. We also feel that this rule should be limited to tours that are organized around an event, not to events
that occur in the normal course of the typical vacation tour. Accordingly, we have limited the scope of the proposed
rule in two ways. First, there will be a definition of ``Special Event Tour'' in proposed  381.5 which is broad
yet specific; it will limit the applicability of the rule to tours to sporting, social, religious, educational, cultural,
political or other event of a special nature and limited duration, which exist for reasons apart from the tour itself.
Second, the ``money back guarantee'' in proposed  381.11 will apply only to the primary event for which a Special
Event Tour is organized.

Limiting the ``money back guarantee'' to the primary event on the tour will solve the problem of having this guarantee
cover minor events on a true Special Event Tour. However, it will also have the effect of excluding some more significant
events such as the Tournament of Roses parade. Nonetheless, we have tentatively decided to move in this direction.
Identifying the primary event on a Special Event Tour will seldom be a matter of debate. However, identifying secondary
events that are ``integral to the experience'' of the tour would be a far more subjective exercise, and in any event
is beyond the scope of this proceeding as set forth in the ANPRM. Tour participants who do not receive promised admission
to a secondary event may have a contractual right to a refund of the value of that event, and they can pursue that with
the tour operator.

In the ANPRM, the Department solicited comment on whether the rule should ban last-minute or post-departure price
increases, something which occurred on certain tours to the 1994 Rose Bowl. The great majority of the comments on this
subject favored banning such increases. Some commenters said no price increase should be permitted unless the tour
operator has reserved this right in writing and allows participants to cancel and receive a full refund in the event
of a price increase.

We have decided to incorporate into the proposed rule the price increase provisions of the Department's Public Charter
rule (14 CFR  380.33). While it is not our intent in this proceeding to address all potential sources of consumer
harm on Special Event Tours, the issue of price increases is directly related to the issue of ticket availability.
Almost any event ticket is procurable if the price is right; if we did not regulate price increases in the Special Event
Tour rule, tour operators would always be able to acquire event tickets at greatly inflated prices and then simply
increase the price to the participant to cover it. Since a ticket has been offered in this situation, the ``money back
guarantee'' would not come into play.

The proposed provisions on price increases, modeled on similar provisions in the charter rule, state that if a given
participant is assessed price increases for the tour that in the aggregate are more than 10 percent above his or her
original tour price, the participant shall have the right to cancel and receive a full refund (i.e., no cancellation
penalties would apply). No price increases in any amount would be permitted less than 5 days before departure (as opposed
to 10 days in the charter rule, recognizing the fact that Special Event Tours often have shorter lead times than the
typical charter). This would eliminate both last-minute and post-departure price hikes. Finally, proposed  381.11
specifies that the promised event ticket must be furnished at the price agreed to before departure or else the operator
is subject to the ``money back guarantee'' just as if he had not provided the ticket at all.

The NHL commented that for events with short lead times such as the Stanley Cup playoffs, the rule should permit tours
on which participants are required to agree to purchase event tickets at the yet-unknown face price plus a service
fee, as long as the consumer is given prominent notice of this fact. As an initial matter, we would point out that a tour
would not be covered under this rule at all if the event ticket were simply held out as an option rather than as a mandatory
feature. However, where the participant must agree to buy the event ticket, such tours are clearly Special Event Tours
since the tour operator is representing that admission to the event is included in the tour (even if the price of that
admission is not yet known and consequently any price that is advertised for that tour is not the full tour price). 
However, nothing in the proposed rule would explicitly prohibit a transaction of this type. The operator would still
have to have the requisite number of event tickets under contract before advertising or sales could begin; in other
words, the variable must be price, not availability. Beyond that, the proposed rule requires that tour participants
must receive promised event tickets ``at the tour price agreed to before departure'' or else the participant is entitled
to a refund of the total tour price. If a participant agrees to a price consisting of a known value 

p

 plus an unknown value 

x

, and the operator delivers the tour (including the event ticket) at that price, the operator has satisfied the requirements
of the rule.

The ANPRM noted that some tours are promoted in conjunction with a special event, but do not include, and do not represent
that they include, admission to the event. We solicited comment on whether the new rule should ban this practice, or
whether it should specify a form of required disclosure. Most of the comments favored requiring disclosure of the
fact that an event ticket is not included. However, we have tentatively decided not to include such a requirement in
the proposed rule. Consumers solicited for these tours are able to determine from the advertising material that an
event ticket is not held out as included; this is distinguishable from the situation of a tour participant who paid
for an event ticket and then did not receive it. Should any particular tour deceptively imply that event tickets are
included when in reality they are not, the Department has authority to take enforcement action against deceptive
practices.

The ANPRM sought comment on whether the rule would be impractical for events where the participants are known only
a week in advance, such as the NCAA Final Four. All of the parties that commented on this issue thought that this should
not be a problem, and that the rule should apply. As noted in the Comments section above, several commenters pointed
out that the Final Four sells out months in advance even though the participating teams are not determined until the
week before. Also, as FBA noted, the contestants in the Super Bowl have been determined only the week before on several
occasions, and that does not appear to have either harmed the marketability of Super Bowl tours or resulted in additional
consumer problems.

While the period for comment on a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is normally 60 days, the Department is requesting comment
on this notice within 30 days after it has been published in the 

Federal Register

. The rule proposed in this notice has changed little from the tentative proposal that the Department discussed in
detail in the Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in this proceeding (59 FR 4614, February 1, 1994). The Comments
on the ANPRM were largely supportive of the proposal, and we do not anticipate controversy over this NPRM. The proposed
rules are drawn from existing regulations on charters and Super Bowl tours, and the industry is familiar with the procedures
in those rules. If the volume or nature of the NPRM comments should warrant, the Department can extend the comment period.




Regulatory Analyses and Notices



This NPRM is considered to be a non-significant rulemaking under DOT regulatory policies and procedures, 44 FR 11034.
The proposal would have minimal economic impact, and accordingly no regulatory evaluation has been prepared. The
NPRM was not subject to review by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs pursuant to Executive Order 12866.

The NPRM has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and
it has been determined that it does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism
Assessment. 

I certify that the proposal, if adopted, would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. 

For the reasons set forth in the preamble, the Department proposes the following:

1. To amend title 14, chapter II, subchapter D by adding a new part 381, to read as follows: 



PART 381_SPECIAL EVENT TOURS



Sec. 



381.1 Purpose.

381.3 Applicability.
381.5 Definition.
381.7 Advertising.
381.9 Sales.
381.11 Refunds.
381.13 Price increases.






Authority:

 49 U.S.C. 40113(a) and 41712 (formerly sections 204(a) and 411 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended).



 381.1 

Purpose. 



The purpose of this part is ensure that air travelers who have purchased tours to special events will receive the promised
admission to the event. This rule expands the ``Super Bowl rule'' (formerly contained in part 380 and   399.87
of this subchapter) to other events.



 381.3 

Applicability. 



This rule applies to Special Event Tours that are (a) in interstate or overseas air transportation, or (b) in foreign
air transportation originating at a point in the United States. It applies to U.S. and foreign operators of Special
Event Tours, whether they be air carriers or ticket agents. It applies to scheduled, charter, and other air transportation.



 381.5 

Definition. 





Special Event Tour 

means a tour that is organized for the purpose of attending a sporting, social, religious, educational, cultural,
political or other event of a special nature and limited duration, which exists for reasons apart from the tour itself,
and which is represented by the operator of the tour as including admission to that event. Examples of such events include,
but are not limited to, college and professional sporting events, the Olympics, concerts, the Passion Play in Oberammergau,
etc.



 381.7 

Advertising. 



No operator of a Special Event Tour or agent of such an operator shall conduct, or cause or allow to be conducted, any
advertising, solicitation or other promotion for a Special Event Tour unless: 

(a) The operator is in physical possession of enough tickets for admission to the event to provide such tickets for
a substantial number of seats on the tour, or 

(b) The operator has entered into a written contract with an organization that is the distributor of such tickets or
an organization that receives such tickets directly from the distributor (e.g., a bowl committee; football conference,
league or team; concert promoter or arena; etc.), the terms of which provide for that organization to furnish the operator
enough admission tickets to provide such tickets for a substantial number of seats on the tour, or 
(c) The operator has entered into a written contract with another person or organization that has a written contract
or series of written contracts with the distributor of such tickets or with an organization that receives such tickets
directly from the distributor, the terms of which provide for that organization to furnish the operator enough admission
tickets to provide such tickets for a substantial number of seats on the tour.

 381.9 

Sales.



(a) Except as provided in  381.9(b):

(1) No operator of a Special Event Tour shall accept money for a seat on a Special Event Tour, or authorize an agent to
accept such money, unless the operator has physical possession of, or written contracts (in the manner described
in  381.7) for, a ticket for admission to the event for that individual. To the extent that the operator receives
an unsolicited booking for which the operator does not have physical possession of or written contracts for a ticket
for admission to the event, any payment accompanying that booking must be returned within 3 business days.

(2) Upon acceptance of the money for a sale, the operator must reserve one event ticket for that individual. An operator
may not sell more seats on the tour than it has event tickets in hand or under contract. (An operator need not continue
to reserve an event ticket for an individual who withdraws from the tour by providing notice to the operator or by being
notified by the operator that the individuals participation has been canceled due to failure to remit a required installment
payment.)


(b) An operator of a Special Event Tour may accept a booking and payment from an individual for whom the operator does
not have an event ticket in hand or under contract if that individual agrees in writing that he or she understands that
no event ticket has been reserved for him or her. This agreement shall specify whether the person has agreed to participate
in the tour without an event ticket and/or the operator has agreed to attempt to acquire an event ticket for this person.
If the two parties agree that the operator will attempt to acquire an event ticket, the agreement shall specify any
penalties that will apply if the individual later cancels because an event ticket did not become available. If the
operator notifies this person that an event ticket has become available, that person shall enjoy all the other protections
of this rule from that time.





 381.11 

Refunds. 



If promised admission to the primary event for which a Special Event Tour was organized is not furnished by the tour
operator, at the tour price agreed to before departure (including any increases that the participant has accepted
pursuant to  381.13(a)), the operator must provide each tour participant affected in this way a refund of the
total tour price. This refund is to be provided within 14 calendar days after the scheduled return date of the tour.



 381.13 

Price increases. 



(a) Should the tour operator increase a participant's tour price by more than 10 percent (aggregate of all increases
to that participant), that participant shall have the option of canceling his or her participation in the tour and
receiving a full refund within 14 days after the cancellation.

(b) The tour operator shall not increase the tour price to any participant less than 5 days before departure.

2. To amend Title 14, Chapter II, Subchapter D, Part 380 as follows: 

A. Remove the term 

Super Bowl charter 

from the definitions in  380.2.

B. Amend  380.18, ``Charters for special events,'' to add a new paragraph (f): 


* * * * *


(d) Where the charter operator represents that the charter includes admission to the special event, the charter shall
comply with part 381 of this subchapter. 

C. Remove  380.18a and its reference in the table of contents at the beginning of the part.

D. Remove  380.28(a)(4).

E. In  380.31(b), end the sentence after the phrase `` * * * on specific alternative flights they
have requested.'' Remove the remainder of the original sentence, which begins `` * * * or, in the case
of Super Bowl charters * * *.''

F. In  380.31(c), remove the phrase ``* * * or in the case of Super Bowl charters, if the operator
does not have either possession of or written contracts for any game tickets, * * * .''

G. In  380.31(c), remove the phrase ``* * * (3 days for Super Bowl charters) * * *
'' in the two locations where it appears.

H. In  380.31(c), remove the phrase ``* * * or in the case of Super Bowl charters, attempts to obtain
more game tickets, * * *.'' 

I. In  380.32(s), remove the second sentence.

J. Remove  380.33(a)(5).

3. To amend title 14, chapter II, subchapter D by removing and reserving  399.87.

Implementation of the Domestic Chemical Diversion Control Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103-200)

ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

DEA is proposing these regulations to implement the Domestic Chemical Diversion Control Act of 1993, which became
effective on April 16, 1994, in order to provide additional safeguards against the diversion of regulated chemicals.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


I. Introduction



The Chemical Diversion and Trafficking Act of 1988, (PL 100-690) (CDTA) was passed by Congress to control the
diversion of certain chemicals (hereinafter referred to as listed chemicals) that are necessary for the illicit
manufacture of drugs such as heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine and LSD. The CDTA and its implementing regulations,
as set forth in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR), parts 1310 and 1313, established a system of recordkeeping
and reporting requirements through which DEA and the chemical industry could identify persons seeking to divert
listed chemicals for the manufacture of illicit drugs. The CDTA allows for the tracking and, where necessary, control
of domestic and international transactions involving listed chemicals.

The CDTA has had strong success. The greatest impact has been in the international arena, with a significant reduction
in exports of listed chemicals from the United States to countries that are known sources of cocaine. Domestically,
the volume of chemicals available to clandestine laboratories was reduced. However, these successes also highlighted
several shortcomings in the CDTA, including:

1. The CDTA provided a mechanisms for DEA, with the cooperation of the chemical industry, to identify persons engaging
in suspicious transactions and, as needed, take action against those persons. However, lacking evidence that an
individual knowingly supplied chemicals for the illicit manufacture of drugs, DEA's options were limited.

2. Persons engaged in the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine and methcathinone were able to obtain supplies
of the listed chemicals critical to the manufacture of such drugs through the purchase of drug products that were exempted
from the provisions of the CDTA.

3. Illicit drug manufacturers in foreign countries began to purchase their supplies of listed chemicals from countries
other than the United States, on occasion utilizing the services of United States based brokers and traders to facilitate
the transactions.

To address these and other concerns, Congress passed legislation in late 1993 to amend the CDTA.



II. The Domestic Chemical Diversion Control Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103-200)



The Domestic Chemical Diversion Control Act of 1993 (DCDCA) was signed into law on December 17, 1993, and became effective
on April 16, 1994. The DCDCA is intended to close avenues used by illicit drug manufacturers to circumvent the CDTA.
The main provisions of the DCDCA are as follows:

1. Precursor and essential chemicals have been redesignated as List I and List II chemicals respectively.

2. Any person who manufactures, distributes, imports or exports a List I chemical must obtain a registration from
DEA. DEA is authorized to deny an application for registration or suspend or revoke a registration to manufacture,
distribute, import or export a List I chemical, if it is established that such registration would not be in the public
interest.

3. Transactions involving drug products marketed under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) which contain ephedrine,
either as the sole active medicinal ingredient or in combination with therapeutically insignificant quantities
of another active medicinal ingredient, are now included in the definition of regulated transaction. Subjecting
these products to the registration, recordkeeping and reporting requirements eliminates a virtually unrestricted
source of ephedrine for illicit manufacturers of methamphetamine and methcathinone. The DCDCA also grants DEA the
authority to remove the exemption for any other drug that contains a listed chemical if DEA determines that the drug
is being diverted in order to obtain the listed chemical for use in the illicit manufacture of a controlled substance.

4. Brokers and traders based in the United States who arrange international transactions involving listed chemicals
will be subject to the same reporting and recordkeeping requirements as exporters of listed chemicals, thus controlling
a previously unmonitored source of chemicals for clandestine laboratories in foreign countries.

5. Manufacturers of listed chemicals are required to provide DEA with annual reports regarding the manufacture of
such chemicals. The reports will provide DEA with information regarding the volume of listed chemicals available
in the United States.



III. Implementation of the DCDCA



To implement the DCDCA, DEA is proposing the following regulatory changes and additions:

1. A new part 1309 of Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations is to be added, setting forth the specific requirements for
registration, the application forms to be used, the application fees, exemptions from the registration requirement,
security provisions, and administrative procedures regarding approval or denial of an application, revocation
of registration, and administrative hearings. With respect to the requirement of registration in the proposed Section
1309.21, DEA has granted a temporary exemption from the registration requirement pending implementation of the
registration program, as set forth in an Interim Rule published in the 

Federal Register

 on March 24, 1994 (59 FR 13881).

Under the CDTA, regulated persons consist of those firms engaged in the distribution, importation or exportation
of chemicals. The DCDCA regulates drug products containing ephedrine which are distributed by retail distributors
such as convenience stores, liquor stores, truck stops, gas stations, nutrition centers, etc. These retail outlets
do not distribute any other listed chemicals and their activities consist solely of the sale of such products directly
to walk-in customers. DEA has determined that retail distributors should be categorized separately in light of the
limited scope and volume of their chemical activities.

Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 822(d), the Administrator may waive the requirement of registration. The Administrator is
proposing in  1309.25 of these regulations to exempt persons registered with DEA to manufacture, distribute,
dispense, import, or export a controlled substance from the chemical registration requirement for equivalent activities
involving drug products that are regulated as List I chemicals pursuant to  1310.01(f)(1)(iv). This includes
such traditional sources for these products as pharmacies, hospitals, pharmaceutical manufacturers, distributors,
etc. Further, the Administrator proposes in  1309.27 to exempt from the registration requirement those persons
who manufacture a List I chemical solely for internal use, with no subsequent distribution or exportation.

With respect to the exemptions from the registration requirement, DEA has determined that persons who manufacture
List I chemicals solely for internal use, without any subsequent distribution or exportation of such chemicals,
should not be required to obtain a registration, since there is a low risk of diversion from such persons.

It has also been determined that persons who are registered with DEA to manufacture, distribute, or dispense controlled
substances shall not be required to obtain a separate registration to distribute drug products that are regulated
as List I chemicals. Further, persons who are registered with DEA to import or export controlled substances shall
not be required to obtain a separate registration to engage in the same activities with drug products which are regulated
as List I chemicals. Persons registered to engage in activities with controlled substances are subjected to more
comprehensive investigations by Federal and state authorities relating to their controlled substance registrations
than is required for a chemical registration. The Administrator reserves the right in this proposal to cancel a person's
exemption from the registration requirement, if continuation of the exemption would not be in the public interest.

2. Section 1310.01 is amended to revise the definitions of ``regulated transaction'' and ``regulated person'',
and to add new definitions of ``broker'' and ``trader'', and ``international transaction''.

3. Chemical mixtures that met the definition of ``chemical mixture'' set forth in  1310.01(g) prior to the effective
date of the DCDCA shall remain exempted from the definition of regulated transaction until DEA has promulgated final
regulations regarding the procedures by which manufacturers may request exemption of chemical mixtures.

4. Section 1310.02 is amended to remove three chemicals from List I: d-lysergic acid, n-ethylephedrine and n-ethylpseudoephedrine;
and to add to List I: nitroethane and benzaldehyde, as established by the DCDCA. In addition, the DEA chemical codes
assigned to the listed chemicals have been added.

5. Section 1310.03 is amended to implement the requirement that manufacturers of listed chemicals report certain
data to DEA. This requirement will only apply to bulk manufacturers of listed chemicals.

6. Section 1310.04 is amended to reflect the additions and deletions of the List I chemicals and to set forth the proposed
thresholds for the new chemicals. With respect to the newly added chemicals Nitroethane and Benzaldehyde, records
and reports must be kept only for those transactions, including cumulative transactions within a calendar month,
which equal or exceed the proposed thresholds.

7. Sections 1310.05 and 1310.06 are amended to include a reporting requirement with respect to drug products containing
ephedrine that are regulated as List I chemicals and to set forth the required format for the chemical manufacturer
reports. Drug products containing ephedrine are legitimately distributed solely for human consumption. Thus,
the distribution of 375 dosage units (approximately a two-month supply at the current recommended therapeutic dose)
or more of such drug products in a calendar month to a person who is not registered with DEA to distribute or export a List
I chemical would be considered extraordinary and therefore would have to be reported.

8. Section 1310.08 is amended to add international transactions to the types of transactions regulated.

9. Sections 1310.10 through 1310.15 are added to set forth the procedures regarding removal of the exemption from
recordkeeping and reporting requirements of drugs distributed under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the exemption
from recordkeeping and reporting requirements of chemical mixtures, and the identification of drugs which contain
ephedrine in combination with therapeutically significant quantities of another medicinal ingredient.

10. Section 1313.02 is amended to revise the definitions for ``regulated person'' and ``regulated transaction'';
and definitions for ``regular importer'', ``established record as an importer'', ``broker'' and ``trader'', and
``international transaction''; and to remove the definition of ``regular supplier''.

11. Sections 1313.12, 1313.15 and 1313.21 are amended to set forth criteria regarding the waiver of the 15 day notification
requirement for certain imports and exports of listed chemicals and the removal of the waiver of the 15 day notification
requirement for exports of listed chemicals to specified countries.

12. Sections 1313.32, 1313.33 and 1313.34 are added to establish the notification requirements for brokers and traders
engaging in international transactions.

IV. Fees



Section 1309.11 proposes the application fee for registration and reregistration of manufacturers, distributors,
importers and exporters of List I chemicals, as authorized by section 3(a) of the DCDCA. The proposed fee was established
pursuant to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-25, as revised on July 15, 1993 (58 FR 38142),
which sets forth Federal policy regarding user fees.

1. Circular A-25, Section 6 provides that ``[A] user charge * * * will be assessed against each
identifiable recipient for special benefits derived from Federal activities beyond those received by the general
public.'' The section further requires that the user charge be sufficient to ``* * * recover the full
cost to the Federal Government for providing the special benefit.'' A special benefit is described as a Government
service which ``Enables the beneficiary to obtain more immediate or substantial gains or values (which may or may
not be measurable in monetary terms) than those that accrue to the general public (e.g., receiving a patent, insurance,
or guarantee provision, 

or a license to carry on a specific activity or business

 [emphasis added] or various kinds of public land use)''.

Sections 822 and 957 of Title 21, United States Code, as amended by the DCDCA, require that any person who manufactures,
distributes, imports or exports a List I chemical must obtain annually a registration in accordance with DEA rules
and regulations. A registration to manufacture, distribute, import or export List I chemicals is a benefit under
Circular A-25, in that it allows the registrant to engage in certain activities while a member of the general
public may not. Therefore, the costs associated with DEA's issuance of a registration to manufacture, distribute,
import or export a List I chemical; certain costs associated with advising registrants of their responsibilities;
and maintenance of the integrity of the registration system must be recovered through assessment of a user fee.

2. Section 6(d) of Circular A-25 describes the requirements for determining the full cost of a service or benefit.
``Full cost'' is defined as all direct and indirect costs, including, but not limited to: direct and indirect personnel
costs, including salaries, fringe benefits (such as life and health insurance and retirement) and travel; physical
overhead, including material and supply costs such as forms, postage, equipment, rent and utilities; management
and supervisory costs; and the costs of enforcement, collection, research, establishment of standards, and regulation.
Section 6(d)(1)(e) provides that the cost figures shall be established utilizing ``the best available records of
the agency and new cost accounting systems need not be established solely for this purpose.'' The cost of the services
provided by DEA were determined by use of proven and accepted budget estimating techniques as outlined in the DOJ budget
guidelines and OMB Circular A-11.



Considerations for the Establishment of the Original Fee



DEA has identified two distinct categories of chemical registrants: retail distributors, such as convenience stores,
gas stations, truck stops, liquor stores, etc., whose regulated activities consist of the direct sale to walk-in
customers of drug products that are regulated as List I chemicals; and non-retailers, such as manufacturers which
distribute, distributors, importers and exporters of List I chemicals.

Based upon contacts with the chemical industry and surveys of the industry over the past three years, DEA estimates
that approximately 1,500 applications for registration will be received from non-retailers.

Based on the information gathered from various sources, including association data, surveys of ephedrine manufacturers
and distributors, and correspondence received from ephedrine distributors, DEA estimates that there may have been
as many as 100,000 retail distributors that, prior to the April 16, 1994 effective date of the DCDCA, sold drug products
that are now subject to regulation. However, estimating the number of persons who will continue to engage in activities
with the regulated drug products is speculative, due to a variety of factors. Some retailers who engaged in this previously
unregulated activity may decide to no longer sell items for which registration is required by law. Also, the activities
of retail distributors may be affected by state laws, such as those in Wisconsin, Florida and Missouri, which require
that drug products containing ephedrine as the sole medicinal ingredient may only be dispensed pursuant to prescription.
Another consideration is the availability of alternative products that are not subject to the registration, recordkeeping
and reporting requirements. DEA has learned that certain distributors of single-entity ephedrine products have
already advised their retail customers to switch to such alternative products to avoid the registration and recordkeeping
requirements. Therefore, for purposes of establishing the initial fee, DEA estimates that 10,000 applications
will be submitted by retail distributors. The number of applications is important only when considering apportionment
of indirect costs associated with initial registration. For the first year of the registration program, this amount
will constitute $22.00 of the total fee. Thus, a larger or smaller number of applicants would not result in any significant
increase or decrease in the registration fee.

During the implementation of the DCDCA, DEA will focus on processing applications, conducting pre-registration
and follow-up investigations and the creation and dissemination of information regarding the registrant's responsibilities
under the DCDCA. DEA expects that the majority of its chemical control resources will be required to handle the applications
which will be submitted immediately following implementation of the regulations.

Once the pre-registration process for existing businesses has been handled, the primary focus of DEA's chemical
control program will be investigations of violative firms and registration denial or revocation proceedings. Such
enforcement activities protect the integrity of the registration system by ensuring that registrants continue
to meet the requirements of the DCDCA. DEA's activities will include, but not be limited to, extensive investigation
and collection of documentation regarding violative practices by registrants; attorney review and preparation
by DEA's Office of Chief Counsel; staff and attorney time to prepare for proceedings to deny or revoke a registration;
Administrative Law Judge and staff to conduct registration denial hearings; and DEA budget and controller staff
time for budget planning, accounting and auditing of fees collected. The benefits of these activities accrue to the
over-all registrant population and the costs for such activities must be averaged across the entire registrant population.
However, as described earlier, the expected registrant population and the extent of these enforcement activities
are speculative at this time. Therefore, the costs associated with these activities have not been included in this
initial fee, since they are indirect costs that would have to be averaged across a presently unknown population of
applicants.

<PARENT> FR941013-1-00005 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

After the registration process is completed and the registrant population and extent of activities necessary to
protect the integrity of the system has been determined, DEA will revise its fee schedule to recover the full costs
of its chemical control program, as required by Circular A-25. DEA will publish in the 

Federal Register

 its revised fee schedule and invite comment by interested parties.
In light of the above, the initial registration fee will be based upon the cost of processing the individual application,
the associated investigation of the qualifications and suitability for registration, and the creation and dissemination
of information regarding the responsibilities under the DCDCA. Reregistration fees under this proposal will include
enforcement and compliance costs associated with maintenance of the integrity of the registration and control system.
These fees will not include enforcement costs of reviews of records and reports of fully complaint registrants exclusively
to identify leads to possible illicit drug laboratories.


The Initial Registration Investigation


The fundamental purpose of the pre-registration investigation is to determine the fitness and suitability of the
applicant to engage in the activities for which registration is requested and to ensure that the applicant is familiar
with its responsibilities to prevent the diversion of regulated products or chemicals. This will be accomplished
through an on-site visit to the applicant (following receipt and processing of the application for registration
by clerical personnel) by DEA Diversion Investigators. During this on-site visit, the applicant's responsibilities
with respect to security, record-keeping and reporting will be discussed; the applicant's existing provisions
for security, record-keeping and reporting, if any, will be reviewed, along with previous sales and customers; and
the applicant will be provided with material, such as the Chemical Handlers Manual, regarding chemical trafficking
and controls. In addition, the investigator will perform background checks on the applicant, owner and employees,
and prepare the necessary reports summarizing the results of the registration review.
Retail distributors engage in a limited activity as regulated by the DCDCA. By contrast, non-retail chemical firms
may deal in a range of List I chemicals, in bulk lots or, pursuant to orders received by mail, telephone, facsimile or
other electronic means. Consequently, the average pre-registration investigation for a retail distributor will
entail less DEA investigative time than for a non-retail chemical firm.


Method for Collection of Fees


For the initial registration fee, DEA has established separate costs for processing the application, and for conducting
the pre-registrant investigation. Both costs will be incurred by the applicant prior to their initial registration
under the DCDCA.
As noted above, DEA anticipates receiving 1500 applications from non-retail chemical firms and approximately 10,000
applications from retail distributors. DEA will place priority on the completion of the pre-registration investigations
of non-retail chemical firms. All non-retail applications will be processed and reviewed within the first year of
the effective date of this regulation. Therefore, the full fee (application and pre-registration investigation
costs) must be submitted with the application.
Because of the demands for resources to conduct registration reviews of non-retail applications and for other chemical
control activities, DEA will be unable to process and review all of the applications submitted by retail distributors
within the first year following the effective date of the final rule. As a consequence, retail distributors will be
subject to a split fee schedule for their initial registration. Each retail distributor will include with their application
the established fee to cover the costs of processing the application.
Based on available resources, DEA will identify and notify approximately 1500-2000 of the retail applicants
that they are scheduled for pre-registration review in the first year. Each applicant so identified will be required
to pay the additional established cost for the registration investigation prior to commencement of the review. Based
upon the volume of applications received, DEA may conduct additional retail registration investigations in the
first year. In the second year, DEA will redirect resources spent conducting non-retail pre-registration investigations
to the retail level. DEA anticipates an additional 6,000 to 8,000 pre-registrant investigations to be conducted
in the second year. These retail distributors will similarly be notified of the investigation fee to be paid. They
will 

not

 be required to submit another application fee. However, if a retail distributor fails to submit the required investigation
fee within 30 days after notification by DEA, that retail distributor's application will be withdrawn.

Reregistration Fees







Following the completion of the initial registration process, DEA will dedicate ongoing resources to insuring the
controls of the DCDCA are being maintained, protecting the integrity of the system, and providing assistance, guidance,
and interpretation of the chemical control requirements to the registrants. These costs, along with application
processing costs will establish the basis for the annual reregistration fee. Since many of these costs will be averaged
across the registrant population, it is only possible to establish a reregistration fee at this time based upon estimated
populations. After the full second year of the regulations implementing the DCDCA, the fee schedule will be reviewed,
as required by Circular A-25, and a new fee structure proposed for public comment, based upon the actual registrant
population.



As stated above, DEA will complete the registration process for all non-retail applicants in the first year. Investigative
resources devoted to these pre-registration investigations (approximately 12 workyears) will be directed towards
completion of the pre-registration process of retail distributor applicants in the second year. At the non-retail
level, DEA will dedicate eight workyears of investigator time to conduct follow-up investigations of approximately
75 non-retail firms. Each investigation will require a comprehensive review of each registrant's records, reporting
systems and security provisions to ensure that the registrant is complying with the chemical control requirements,
and chemicals are not being distributed to persons seeking to divert them. Investigators will conduct a comprehensive
on-site review of the registrant's records; verification of transactions and purchasers, including record checks
of and visits to purchasers; travel; and report preparation. This cost, plus the reregistration processing fee and
the above listed indirect costs averaged over the estimated 1500 non-retail registrants will constitute the non-retail
reregistration fee.



At the retail level, due to the large volume of firms and the general lack of experience in the required record-keeping
and reporting requirements, DEA will conduct a greater number of follow-up investigations. However, in light of
the anticipated smaller volumes of regulated transactions of such firms, each follow-up is scheduled for a smaller
amount of on-site time. DEA anticipates that two Diversion Investigator workyears will be required to conduct follow-up
investigations at the retail level. This cost, plus the reregistration processing fee and above listed indirect
costs averaged over the estimated 2000 retail distributors registered in the first year will constitute the reregistration
fee.




As DEA completes the second year of the chemical registration program, the bulk of the retail distributor new applications
will have been processed, thus freeing the resources assigned to conduct the registration investigations. In the
following years, there will be a greater number of registrants submitting applications for reregistration. DEA
will dedicate proportionally greater resources to these registrants. As noted earlier, following the initial two
years of the registration program, DEA will conduct a review of the fee structure and, as needed, publish a notice in
the 

Federal Register

 regarding amendment of the fee schedule.





Registration Costs.





The costs associated with the registration process are as follows. DEA estimates that 1,500 non-retail applications
and approximately 10,000 retail applications will be received. As previously stated, the personnel costs listed
below include all direct and indirect costs, including salaries, fringe benefits (such as life and health insurance
and retirement) and travel; physical overhead, including material and supply costs such as forms, postage, equipment,
rent and utilities:

V. Regulatory Flexibility and Small Business Impact


DEA has examined the impact of the DCDCA and this proposed rule in the light of Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory
Flexibility Act (PL 96-354). DEA has identified approximately 1,500 firms or persons, other than retail distributors,
who handle List I chemicals. These non-retail chemical firms are generally known to DEA because most have been subject
to the recordkeeping and reporting requirements of the CDTA for a number of years. Independent retail distributors,
however, are primarily small business entities.
DEA has found that in addition to the traditional sources of distribution (i.e., hospitals, pharmacies, pharmaceutical
manufacturers and distributors, etc.), independently owned and operated retail outlets such as convenience stores,
liquor stores, truck stops, gas stations, and nutrition centers engage in sales to the public of the single entity
drug products that are not regulated. Based on information received from various distributors, the potential affected
population of retail outlets that handled the single entity drug products prior to the April 1994 effective date of
the DCDCA, could be as high as 100,000. How many of these will choose to continue their sales of the single entity drug
products and be subject to the registration, recordkeeping and reporting requirements is unclear, due to such factors
as: (1) The introduction of state laws making drug products containing ephedrine prescription drugs, (2) the availability
of alternative products which are not subject to the chemical regulations at this time, and (3) the intent of the DCDCA
to eliminate sales by those persons who have been supplying clandestine laboratories.
The DCDCA requires that any person wishing to distribute, import, or export a List I chemical must obtain a registration
from DEA for each location at which such activities are carried out, prior to conducting such activities. The statutory
basis for this requirement is found in Sections 822 and 957 of the CSA, as amended by the DCDCA. Therefore, a separate
registration must be issued for each location pursuant to the factors regarding the public interest set forth in Section
823(h) of the CSA. Prior to taking final action on an application, DEA will conduct an on-site investigation at each
location for which registration is requested. The guidelines set forth in the Office of management and Budget (OMB)
Circular A-25 require that the costs of the registration process must be recovered through application fees
charged to the applicants. As noted in the fee analysis, the preregistration investigation for retail distributor
applicants will be less intensive than the investigation for other chemical applicants, due to the limited scope
and volume of a retail distributor's chemical activities. As a result, the retail distributor's fees will be significantly
less than those for non-retail chemical applicants. In addition to the cost of registration and reregistration,
it is estimated that applicants would be required to expend one-half hour per year completing the appropriate application
for registration or reregistration.
In reviewing the implementation of the registration requirement, DEA gave consideration to the specific purposes
for requiring registration and the nature of the problem of diversion of List I chemicals and made the following determinations:
1. DEA will not require that persons already registered to engage in certain activities with controlled substances
obtain a separate registration for similar activities with FDA approved drug products which are regulated as List
I chemicals. A principal reason for requiring registration is to allow DEA to determine the fitness of the applicant
to conduct a specified activity and to allow DEA, if circumstances require, to prohibit the applicant from engaging
in the activity. Persons required to register with DEA to engage in activities with controlled substances are subject
to Federal and State investigations of their fitness which exceed the requirements for registration for List I chemical
activities. Further, the proposed regulation allows that DEA may remove any person's exemption from the registration
requirement and may, if appropriate, take action against the person's controlled substance registration, if the
person engages in activities in violation of the chemical laws and regulations. Accordingly, DEA is proposing in
 1309.25 to exempt persons registered with DEA to handle controlled substances from the requirement to obtain
a separate chemical registration for certain similar activities with the regulated FDA approved drug products.
The exemption could potentially exempt over 70,000 hospitals, pharmacies, distributors, manufacturers, importers,
and exporters of controlled substances who are currently registered with DEA to handle controlled substances.

2. DEA will not require persons who manufacture a List I chemical solely for internal use, with no subsequent distribution
or exportation of the chemical, to obtain a chemical registration. DEA has found that such persons have not been a source
of any significant diversion of List I chemicals; the primary sources of diversion are through the distribution channels
which deal directly with the public. If these manufacturers should later become a source of diversion, the exemption
can be removed. DEA is proposing in Section 1309.27 that such manufacturers be exempted from the chemical registration
requirement.
DEA has also determined that the requirement that manufacturers of listed chemicals report to DEA annually can be
limited without compromising the intent of the requirement. DEA's primary interest in this area is determining the
total quantity of each individual listed chemical that is available on the domestic market. Therefore, DEA proposes
that only bulk manufacturers of the chemicals need report to DEA; other manufacturers, such as repacker/relabelers,
dosage form, etc., do not need to report.
DEA has also considered the impact on small businesses of the application of the existing chemical recordkeeping
and reporting requirements to those drug products containing ephedrine which are now regulated as List I chemicals.
The recordkeeping and reporting provisions of the CDTA, as set forth in section 830 of the CSA and parts 1310 and 1313
of title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations, have been in place since 1989 and form the backbone of DEA's chemical
control program. The requirements were developed jointly with the chemical industry to provide the necessary information
to track chemical transfers while minimizing the recordkeeping and reporting burden on the chemical industry. A
retail distributor must keep records that reflect the name and address of the purchaser, the date of the transaction,
the type of chemical and amount being transferred, and the form of identification provided by the purchaser. The requirement
to make reports is limited to those transactions that are unusual or suspicious and to thefts or losses of listed chemicals.
It is estimated that creating and storing a record will require an average of one minute per record. These recordkeeping
procedures are accepted practice in the conduct of legitimate chemical commerce in the years they have been in effect.
DEA is obligated to implement the mandate of Congress as set out in the DCDCA. The DCDCA states that persons who wish
to manufacture, distribute, import or export List I chemicals must register with DEA. Further, the DCDCA makes drug
products containing ephedrine as the sole medicinal ingredient subject to such registration, as well as to the existing
chemical recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Consideration was given to exempting retail distributors
from the registration, recordkeeping and reporting requirements. However, such an action would negate the purpose
of the DCDCA by leaving a significant portion of the sales of regulated ephedrine products unregulated. Controlling
the diversion of these products requires monitoring and recordkeeping by all portions of the industry. DEA has proposed
steps to lessen the impact on retail distributors of the DCDCA's requirements, while simultaneously carrying out
the chemical control mandate of the DCDCA.
In addition to these proposed regulations to implement the DCDCA, DEA has published two other notices that should
be given consideration by parties concerned with the DCDCA. The first, published on March 17, 1994 (59 FR 12562), proposes
removal of the established threshold for ephedrine to reduce the diversion of ephedrine to clandestine laboratories
for the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine and methcathinone. The second, published on March 24, 1994 (59 FR
13881), establishes a temporary exemption from the registration requirements for persons who manufacture, distribute,
import or export List I chemicals.
This notice proposes two new information collections: The DEA 510 and 510a application forms for registration and
reregistration, and the reports required from certain manufacturers of listed chemicals. DEA is submitting a request
to the Office of Management and Budget for review and approval of these new collections pursuant to the provisions
of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. et seq.
This regulation has been drafted and reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866, section 1(b), Principals
of Regulation. The DEA has determined that this rule is a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866,
section 3(f), Regulatory Planning and Review, and accordingly this rule has been reviewed by the Office of Management
and Budget.
This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria in Executive Order 12612, and it has been
determined that the proposed rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of
a Federalism Assessment.

Persons required to register.


(a) Every person who distributes, imports, or exports any List I chemical, other than those List I chemicals contained
in a product exempted under  1310.01(f)(1)(iv) of this chapter, or who proposes to engage in the distribution,
importation, or exportation of any List I chemical, shall obtain annually a registration specific to the List I chemicals
to be handled, unless exempted by law or pursuant to   1309.24-1309.27. Only persons actually engaged
in such activities are required to obtain a registration; related or affiliated persons who are not engaged in such
activities are not required to be registered. (For example, a stockholder or parent corporation of a corporation
distributing List I chemicals is not required to obtain a registration.)
(b) Every person who distributes or exports a List I chemical they have manufactured, other than a List I chemical contained
in a product exempted under  1310.01(f)(1)(iv) of this chapter, or proposes to distribute or export a List I
chemical they have manufactured, shall obtain annually a registration specific to the List I chemicals to be handled,
unless exempted by law or pursuant to   1309.24-1309.27.


 1309.22

Separate registration for independent activities.

(1) Retail distributing of List I chemicals;
(2) Non-Retail distributing of List I chemicals;
(3) Importing List I chemicals; and
(4) Exporting List I chemicals.
(b) Every person who engages in more than one group of independent activities shall obtain a separate registration
for each group of activities, unless otherwise exempted by the Act or   1309.24-1309.26, except
that a person registered to import any List I chemical shall be authorized to distribute that List I chemical, but no
other chemical that the person is not registered to import.


 1309.23

Separate registration for separate locations.


(a) A separate registration is required for each principal place of business at one general physical location where
List I chemicals are distributed, imported, or exported by a person.
(b) The following locations shall be deemed to be places not subject to the registration requirement:
(1) A warehouse where List I chemicals are stored by or on behalf of a registered person, unless such chemicals are distributed
directly from such warehouse to locations other than the registered location from which the chemicals were originally
delivered; and
(2) An office used by agents of a registrant where sales of List I chemicals are solicited, made, or supervised but which
neither contains such chemicals (other than chemicals for display purposes) nor serves as a distribution point for
filling sales orders.


 1309.24

Exemption of agents and employees.


The requirement of registration is waived for any agent or employee of a person who is registered to engage in any group
of independent activities, if such agent or employee is acting in the usual course of his or her business or employment.


 1309.25

Exemption of certain controlled substance registrants.


(a) The requirement of registration is waived for any person who distributes a product containing a List I chemical
that is regulated pursuant to  1310.01(f)(1)(iv) of this chapter, if that person is registered with the Administration
to manufacture, distribute or dispense a controlled substance.
(b) The requirement of registration is waived for any person who imports or exports a product containing a List I chemical
that is regulated pursuant to  1310.01(f)(1)(iv) of this chapter, if that person is registered with the Administration
to engage in the same activity with a controlled substance.
(c) The Administrator may, upon finding that continuation of the waiver would not be in the public interest, suspend
or revoke a person's waiver pursuant to the procedures set forth in   1309.43-1309.46 and 1309.51-1309.57.
In considering the revocation or suspension of a person's waiver, the Administrator shall also consider whether
action to revoke or suspend the person's controlled substance registration pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 824 is warranted.
(d) Any person exempted from the registration requirement under this section shall comply with the security requirements
set forth in  1309.71-1309.73 and the recordkeeping and reporting requirements set forth under parts
1310 and 1313 of this chapter.

of official duties.


 1309.27

Exemption of certain manufacturers.


The requirement of registration is waived for any manufacturer of a List I chemical, if that chemical is produced solely
for internal consumption by the manufacturer and there is no subsequent distribution or exportation of the List I
chemical.

day of the month designated for that group. In assigning any of the above persons to a group, the Administration may
select a group the expiration date of which is less than one year from the date such business activity was registered.
If the person is assigned to a group which has an expiration date less than eleven months from the date of which the person

(g) Each application, attachment, or other document filed as part of an application, shall be signed by the applicant,
if an individual; by a partner of the applicant, if a partnership; or by an officer of the applicant, if a corporation,
corporate division, association, trust or other entity. An applicant may authorize one or more individuals, who
would not otherwise be authorized to do so, to sign applications for the applicant by filing with the application or
other document a power or attorney for each such individual. The power of attorney shall be signed by a person whose
is authorized to sign applications under this paragraph and shall contain the signature of the individual being authorized
to sign the application or other document. The power of attorney shall be valid until revoked by the applicant.



 1309.33

Filing of application; joint filings.




(a) All applications for registration shall be submitted for filing to the Registration Unit, Drug Enforcement Administration,
Chemical Registration/ODC, Post Office Box 2427, Arlington, Virginia 22202-2427. The appropriate registration
fee and any required attachments must accompany the application.

must be complete and must not refer to any accompanying application for required information.






 1309.34

Acceptance for filing; defective applications.






(a) Applications submitted for filing are dated upon receipt. If found to be complete, the application will be accepted
for filing. Applications failing to comply with the requirements of this part will not generally be accepted for filing.
In the case of minor defects as to completeness, the Administrator may accept the application for filing with a request
to the applicant for additional information. A defective application will be returned to the applicant within 10
days of receipt with a statement of the reason for not accepting the application for filing. A defective application
may be corrected and resubmitted for filing at any time.



(b) Accepting an application for filing does not preclude any subsequent request for additional information pursuant
to  1309.35 and has no bearing on whether the application will be granted.







 1309.35

Additional information.





The Administrator may require an applicant to submit such documents or written statements of fact relevant to the
application as he deems necessary to determine whether the application should be granted. The failure of the applicant
to provide such documents or statements within a reasonable time after being requested to do so shall be deemed to be
a waiver by the applicant of an opportunity to present such documents or facts for consideration by the Administrator
in granting or denying the application.






 1309.36

Amendments to and withdrawals of applications.







(a) An application may be amended or withdrawn without permission of the Administrator at any time before the date
on which the applicant receives an order to show cause pursuant to  1309.46. An application may be amended or
withdrawn with permission of the Administrator at any time where good cause is shown by the applicant or where the amendment
or withdrawal is in the public interest.





(b) After an application has been accepted for filing, the request by the applicant that it be returned or the failure
of the applicant to respond to official correspondence regarding the application, including a request that the applicant
submit the required fee, when sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, shall be deemed to be
a withdrawal of the application.






Action of Applications for Registration: Revocation or Suspension of Registration








 1309.41

Administrative review generally.





The Administrator may inspect, or cause to be inspected, the establishment of an applicant or registrant, pursuant
to subpart A of part 1316 of this chapter. The Administrator shall review the application for registration and other

of section 303 of the Act (21 U.S.C. 823) have been met by the applicant.








 1309.42

Certificate of registration; denial of registration.






(a) The Administrator shall issue a Certificate of Registration (DEA Form 511) to an applicant if the issuance of registration
or reregistration is required under the applicable provisions of section 303 of the Act (21 U.S.C. 823). In the event
that the issuance of registration or reregistration is not required, the Administrator shall deny the application.
Before denying any application, the Administrator shall issue an order to show cause pursuant to  1309.46 and,
if requested by the applicant, shall hold a hearing on the application pursuant to  1309.51.

The registrant shall maintain the certificate of registration at the registered location in a readily retrievable
manner and shall permit inspection of the certificate by any official, agent or employee of the Administration or
of any Federal, State, or local agency engaged in enforcement of laws relating to List I chemicals or controlled substances.



 1309.43 

Suspension or revocation of registration.



(a) The Administrator may suspend any registration pursuant to section 304(a) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 824(a)) for any
period of time he determines.

(b) The Administrator may revoke any registration pursuant to section 304(a) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 824(a)).

(c) Before revoking or suspending any registration, the Administrator shall issue an order to show cause pursuant
to  1309.46 and, if requested by the registrant, shall hold a hearing pursuant to  1309.51. Notwithstanding
the requirements of this Section, however, the Administrator may suspend any registration pending a final order
pursuant to  1309.44.

(d) Upon service of the order of the Administrator suspending or revoking registration, the registrant shall immediately
deliver his or her Certificate of Registration to the nearest office of the Administration.



 1309.44 

Suspension of registration pending final order.



(a) The Administrator may suspend any registration simultaneously with or at any time subsequent to the service upon
the registrant of an order to show cause why such registration should not be revoked or suspended, in any case where
he finds that there is an imminent danger to the public health or safety. If the Administrator so suspends, he shall
serve with the order to show cause pursuant to  1309.46 an order of immediate suspension that shall contain a
statement of his findings regarding the danger to public health or safety.

(b) Upon service of the order of immediate suspension, the registrant shall promptly return his Certificate of Registration
to the nearest office of the Administration.

(c) Any suspension shall continue in effect until the conclusion of all proceedings upon the revocation or suspension,
including any judicial review thereof, unless sooner withdrawn by the Administrator or dissolved by a court of competent
jurisdiction. Any registrant whose registration is suspended under this section may request a hearing on the revocation
or suspension of his registration at a time earlier than specified in the order to show cause pursuant to  1309.46,
which request shall be granted by the Administrator, who shall fix a date for such hearing as early as reasonably possible.



 1309.45 

Extension of registration pending final order.



In the event that an applicant for reregistration (who is doing business under a registration previously granted
and not revoked or suspended) has applied for reregistration at least 45 days before the date on which the existing
registration is due to expire, and the Administrator has issued no order on the application on the date on which the
existing registration is due to expire, the existing registration of the applicant shall automatically be extended
and continue in effect until the date on which the Administrator so issues his order. The Administrator may extend
any other existing registration under the circumstances contemplated in this section even though the registrant
failed to apply for reregistration at least 45 days before expiration of the existing registration, with or without
request by the registrant, if the Administrator finds that such extension is not inconsistent with the public health
and safety.



 1309.46 

Order to show cause.



(a) If, upon examination of the application for registration from any applicant and other information gathered by
the Administration regarding the applicant, the Administrator is unable to make the determinations required by
the applicable provisions of section 303 of the Act (21 U.S.C. 823) to register the applicant, the Administrator shall
serve upon the applicant an order to show cause why the application for registration should not be denied.

(b) If, upon information gathered by the Administration regarding any registrant, the Administrator determines
that the registration of such registrant is subject to suspension or revocation pursuant to section 304 of the Act
(21 U.S.C. 824), the Administrator shall serve upon the registrant an order to show cause why the registration should
not be revoked or suspended.

(c) The order to show cause shall call upon the applicant or registrant to appear before the Administrator at a time
and place stated in the order, which shall not be less than 30 days after the date of receipt of the order. The order to
show cause shall also contain a statement of the legal basis for such hearing and for the denial, revocation, or suspension
of registration and a summary of the matters of fact and law asserted.

(d) Upon receipt of an order to show cause, the applicant or registrant must, if he desires a hearing, file a request
for a hearing pursuant to  1309.54. If a hearing is requested, the Administrator shall hold a hearing at the time
and place stated in the order, pursuant to  1309.51.

(e) When authorized by the Administrator, any agent of the Administration may serve the order to show cause.



Hearings



 1309.51 

Hearings generally.



(a) In any case where the Administrator shall hold a hearing on any registration or application therefor, the procedures
for such hearing shall be governed generally by the adjudication procedures set forth in the Administrative Procedure
Act (5 U.S.C. 551-559) and specifically by sections 303 and 304 of the Act (21 U.S.C. 823-824), by   1309.51-1309.57,

(b) Any hearing under this part shall be independent of, and not in lieu of, criminal prosecutions or other proceedings
under the Act or any other law of the United States.


 1309.52

Purpose of hearing.


If requested by a person entitled to a hearing, the Administrator shall hold a hearing for the purpose of receiving
factual evidence regarding the issues involved in the denial, revocation, or suspension of any registration. Extensive
argument should not be offered into evidence but rather presented in opening or closing statements of counsel or in
memoranda or proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.


 1309.53

Waiver or modification of rules.


The Administrator or the presiding officer (with respect to matters pending before him) may modify or waive any rule
in this party by notice in advance of the hearing, if he determines that no party in the hearing will be unduly prejudiced
and the ends of justice will thereby be served. Such notice of modification or waiver shall be made a part of the record
of the hearing.


 1309.54

Request for hearing or appearance; waiver.


(a) Any person entitled to a hearing pursuant to   1309.42 and 1309.43 and desiring a hearing shall, within
30 days after the date of receipt of the order to show cause, file with the Administrator a written request for a hearing
in the form prescribed in Section 1316.47 of this chapter.
(b) Any person entitled to a hearing pursuant to   1309.42 and 1309.43, within the period permitted for
filing a request for a hearing, file with the Administrator a waiver of an opportunity for a hearing, together with
a written statement regarding his position on the matters of fact and law involved in such hearing. Such statement,
if admissible, shall be made a part of the record and shall be considered in light of the lack of opportunity for cross-examination
in determining the weight to be attached to matters of fact asserted therein.
(c) If any person entitled to a hearing pursuant to   1309.42 and 1309.43 fails to file a request for a hearing,
or if he so files and fails to appear at the hearing, he shall be deemed to have waived his opportunity for the hearing,
unless he shows good cause for such failure.
(d) If any person entitled to a hearing waives or is deemed to waive his or her opportunity for the hearing, the Administrator
may cancel the hearing, if scheduled, and issue his final order pursuant to  1309.57 without a hearing.


 1309.55

Burden of proof.


(a) At any hearing for the denial of a registration, the Administrator shall have the burden of proving that the requirements
for such registration pursuant to section 303 of the Act (21 U.S.C. 823) are not satisfied.
(b) At any hearing for the revocation or suspension of a registration, the Administrator shall have the burden of proving
that the requirements for such revocation or suspension pursuant to section 304(a) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 824(a)) are
satisfied.


 1309.56

Time and place of hearing.


The hearing will commence at the place and time designated in the order to show cause or notice of hearing published
in the 

Federal Register

 (unless expedited pursuant to  1309.44(c)) but thereafter it may be moved to a different place and may be continued
from day to day or recessed to a later day without notice other than announcement thereof by the presiding officer at
the hearing.


 1309.57

Final order.


As soon as practicable after the presiding officer has certified the record to the Administrator, the Administrator
shall cause to be published in the 

Federal Register

 his final order in the proceeding, which shall set forth the final rule and the findings of fact and conclusions of law
upon which the rule is based. This order shall specify the date on which it shall take effect, which date shall not be
less than 30 days from the date of publication in the 

Federal Register

 unless the Administrator finds that the public interest in the matter necessitates an earlier effective date, in
which case the Administrator shall specify in the order his findings as to the conditions which led him to conclude
that an earlier effective date was required.


Modification, Transfer and Termination of Registration


 1309.61

Modification in registration.


Any registrant may apply to modify his or her registration to authorize the handling of additional List I chemicals
or to change his or her name or address, by submitting a letter of request to the Drug Enforcement Administration, Chemical
Registration/ODC, Post Office Box 2427, Arlington, Virginia 22202-2427. The letter shall contain the registrant's
name, address, and registration number as printed on the certificate of registration, and the List I chemicals to
be added to his registration or the new name or address and shall be signed in accordance with  1309.32(g). No
fee shall be required to be paid for the modification. The request for modification shall be handled in the same manner
as an application for registration. If the modification in registration is approved, the Administrator shall issue
a new certificate of registration (DEA Form 511) to the registrant, who shall maintain it with the old certificate
of registration until expiration.


 1309.62

Termination of registration.


The registration of any person shall terminate if and when such person dies, ceases legal existence, or discontinues
business or professional practice. Any registrant who ceases legal existence or discontinues business or professional
practice shall notify the Administrator promptly of such fact.


 1309.63

Transfer of registration.


No registration or any authority conferred thereby shall be assigned or otherwise transferred except upon such conditions
as the Administrator may specifically designate and then only pursuant to his written consent.


Security Requirements


 1309.71

General security requirements.


(a) All applicants and registrants shall provide effective controls and procedures to guard against theft and diversion
of List I chemicals. Specific attention shall be paid to storage of and controlling access to List I chemicals as follows:
(1) Chemicals shall be stored in containers sealed in such a manner as to indicate any attempts at tampering with the
container. Where chemicals cannot be stored in sealed containers, access to the chemicals should be controlled through
physical means or through human or electronic monitoring.
(2) In retail settings open to the public where drugs containing List I chemicals that are regulated pursuant to  1310.01(f)(1)(iv)
of this chapter are distributed, such drugs will be stocked behind a counter where only employees have access.
(b) In evaluating the effectiveness of security controls and procedures, the Administrator shall consider the following
factors:
(1) The type, form, and quantity of List I chemicals handled;
(2) The location of the premises and the relationship such location bears on the security needs;
(3) The type of building construction comprising the facility and the general characteristics of the building or
buildings;
(4) The availability of electric detection and alarm systems;
(5) The extent of unsupervised public access to the facility;
(6) The adequacy of supervision over employees having access to List I chemicals;

(c) Any registrant or applicant desiring to determine whether a proposed system of security controls and procedures
is adequate may submit materials and plans regarding the proposed security controls and procedures either to the
Special Agent in Charge in the region in which the security controls and procedures will be used, or to the Chemical
Operations Section Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration, Washington, DC 20537.



 1309.72

Felony conviction; employer responsibilities.



(a) The registrant shall not employ, as an agent or employee who has access to List I chemicals, any person who has been
convicted of a felony offense relating to controlled substances or listed chemicals or who has, at any time, had an
application for registration with the DEA denied, had a DEA registration revoked or has surrendered a DEA registration
for cause. For purposes of this subsection, the term ``for cause'' means a surrender in lieu of, or as a consequence
of, any Federal or State administrative, civil or criminal action resulting from an investigation of the individual's
handling of controlled substances or listed chemicals.

(b) It is the position of DEA that employees who possess, sell, use or divert listed chemicals or controlled substances
will subject themselves not only to State or Federal prosecution for any illicit activity, but shall also immediately
become the subject of independent action regarding their continued employment. The employer will assess the seriousness
of the employee's violation, the position of responsibility held by the employee, past record of employment, etc.,
in determining whether to suspend, transfer, terminate or take other action against the employee.



 1309.73

Employee responsibility to report diversion.




Reports of listed chemical diversion by fellow employees is not only a necessary part of an overall employee security
program but also serves the public interest at large. It is, therefore, the position of DEA that an employee who has
knowledge of diversion from his employer by a fellow employee has an obligation to report such information to a responsible
security official of the employer. The employer shall treat such information as confidential and shall take all reasonable
steps to protect the confidentiality of the information and the identity of the employee furnishing information.
A failure to report information of chemical diversion will be considered in determining the feasibility of continuing
to allow an employee to work in an area with access to chemicals. The employer shall inform all employees concerning
this policy.

research documents or publicly available information which would indicate the existence of the foreign customer.
No proof of identity is required for foreign suppliers.
(b) The regulated person must verify the existence and apparent validity of a business entity ordering a listed chemical,
tableting machine or encapsulating machine. For domestic transactions, this may be accomplished by such methods
as checking the telephone directory, the local credit bureau, the local Chamber of Commerce or the local Better Business
Bureau, or, it the business entity is a registrant, by verification of the registration. For export transactions,
a good faith inquiry to verify the existence and apparent validity of a foreign business entity may be accomplished
by such methods as verifying the business telephone listing through international telephone information, the firm's
listing in international or foreign national chemical directories or other commerce directories of trade publications,
confirmation through foreign subsidiaries of the U.S. regulated person, verification through the country of destination's
embassy Commercial Attache, or official documents provided by the purchaser which confirm the existence and apparent
validity of the business entity.

Removal of the exemption of drugs distributed under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.


(a) The Administrator may remove from exemption under  1310.01(f)(1)(iv) any drug or group of drugs that the
Administrator finds is being diverted to obtain a listed chemical for use in the illicit production of a controlled
substance. In removing a drug or group of drugs from the exemption the Administrator shall consider:
(1) The scope, duration, and significance of the diversion;
(2) Whether the drug or group of drugs is formulated in such a way that it cannot be easily used in the illicit production
of a controlled substance; and
(3) Whether the listed chemical can be readily recovered from the drug or group of drugs.
(b) Upon determining that a drug or group of drugs should be removed from the exemption under paragraph (a) of this section,
the Administrator shall issue and publish in the 

Federal Register 

his proposal to remove the drug or group of drugs from exemption, which shall include a reference to the legal authority
under which the proposal is based. The Administrator shall permit any interested person to file written comments
on or objections to the proposal. After considering any comments or objections filed, the Administrator shall publish
in the 

Federal Register 

his final order.
(c) The Administrator shall limit the removal of a drug or group of drugs from exemption under paragraph (a) of this
section to the most identifiable type of the drug or group of drugs for which evidence of diversion exists unless there
is evidence, based on the pattern of diversion and other relevant factors, that the diversion will not be limited to
that particular drug or group of drugs.
(d) Any manufacturer seeking reinstatement of a particular drug product that has been removed from an exemption under
paragraph (a) of this section, may apply to the Administrator for reinstatement of the exemption for that particular
drug product on the grounds that the particular drug product is manufactured and distributed in a manner that prevents
diversion. In determining whether the exemption should be reinstated the Administrator shall consider:
(1) The package sizes manner of packaging of the drug product;
(2) The manner of distribution and advertising of the drug product;
(3) Evidence of diversion of the drug product;
(4) Any actions taken by the manufacturer to prevent diversion of the drug product; and 
(5) Such other factors as are relevant to and consistent with the public health and safety, including the factors described
in paragraph (a) of this section as applied to the drug product.

(e) Within a reasonable period of time after receipt of the application for reinstatement of the exemption, The Administrator
shall notify the applicant of his acceptance or non-acceptance of his application, and if not accepted, the reason
therefor. If the application is accepted for filing, the Administrator shall issue and publish in the 

Federal Register

 his order on the reinstatement of the exemption for the particular drug product, which shall include a reference to
the legal authority under which the order is based. This order shall specify the date on which it shall take effect.
The Administrator shall permit any interested person to file written comments on or objections to the order. If any
such comments raise significant issues regarding any finding of fact or conclusion of law upon which the order is based,
the Administrator shall immediately suspend the effectiveness of the order until he may reconsider the application
in light of the comments and objections filed. Thereafter, the Administrator shall reinstate, revoke, or amend his
original order as he determines appropriate. 

(f) Unless the Administrator has evidence that the drug product is being diverted, as determined by applying the factors
set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, and the Administrator so notifies the applicant, transactions involving
a specific drug product will not be considered regulated transactions during the following periods: 

(1) While a bonafide application for reinstatement of exemption under paragraph (d) of this section for the specific
drug product is pending resolution, provided that the application for reinstatement is filed not later than 60 days
after the publication of the final order removing the exemption; and 

(2) For a period of 60 days following the Administrator's denial of an application for reinstatement. 

(g) An order published by the Administrator in the 

Federal Register

 pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section to reinstate an exemption may be modified or revoked with respect to a particular
drug product upon a finding that: 

(1) Applying the factors set forth in paragraph (a) to the particular drug product, the drug product is being diverted;
or 

(2) There is a significant change in the data that led to the issuance of the final rule. 



 1310.11

(b) Records and reports: All regulated persons who manufacture an exempted drug product must keep complete and accurate
records and file all reports required under   1310.05 and 1310.06 on all listed chemicals used in manufacturing
the exempt drug product. Transactions involving reinstated exempt drug products contained in paragraph (e) of this
section are not regulated transactions and thus records and reports are not required to be kept for listed chemicals
once they become part of the reinstated exempt drug product. 

(c) No reinstated exemption granted pursuant to 1310.10 affects the criminal liability for illegal possession or
distribution of listed chemicals contained in the exempt drug product. 

(d) Changes in exempt drug product compositions: Any change in the quantitative or qualitative composition, trade
name or other designation of an exempt drug product listed in paragraph (e) of this section requires a new application
for reinstatement of the exemption.

ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This rule will establish regulations to implement Pub. L. 101-644, the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990. The
proposed regulations define the nature and Indian origin of products embraced by the law and specify procedures for
carrying out the law. The trademark provisions of the Act are not included in this proposed rulemaking, and will be
treated at a later time.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



Background



The Indian Arts and Crafts Board was established by the Act of August 27, 1935 (49 Stat. 891; 25 U.S.C. 305a), and is responsible
for promoting the development of American Indian and Alaska Native arts and crafts, improving the economic status
of members of Federally recognized tribes, and establishing and expanding marketing opportunities for arts and
crafts produced by American Indians and Alaska Natives.

The 1935 Act established criminal penalties for selling goods with misrepresentations that they were Indian-produced.
These original provisions, in section 1159 of title 18, United States Code, provided for fines not to exceed $500 or
imprisonment not to exceed six months or both. Although this law was in effect for many years, it provided no meaningful
deterrent to those who misrepresent imitation Indian arts and crafts. In addition, it required ``willfulness''
and ``intent'' to prove a violation, and very little enforcement took place.

In recent years, the Congress notes that the Indian arts and crafts market, with several hundred million dollars in
annual sales, was expanding and experiencing a greater frequency of fraudulent sales. The Congress requested a special
report from the Department of Commerce, which in 1985 determined that significant losses were incurred by the domestic
Indian arts and crafts market due to unmarked imported imitations. As a result, the Congress included in the 1988 Omnibus
Trade Bill, Pub. L. 100-418, a direction to the Customs Service to address the issue of misrepresentation. This
led to the promulgation of regulations to require permanent country-of-origin marking on imported Indian-style
jewelry and other arts and crafts products. Thereafter, the Congress shifted its attention to problems originating
in the domestic market and passed Pub. L. 101-644, the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990.
The Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990 is essentially a truth-in-advertising law designed to prevent products from
being marketed as ``Indian made,'' when the products are not, in fact, made by Indians as defined in the Act. Because
of the truth-in-advertising nature of the Act, the drafters of the proposed regulations have tried not to restrict
truthful statements that might be made in marketing a product.
In respect of tribal sovereignty, the drafters do not require uniform criteria or procedures or documentation forms
for tribal certification of individuals as Indian artisans, although such uniformity would be a great convenience
to businesses and consumers in the market.


Section-by-Section Analysis


Section 309.1


This section outlines the purpose of the regulations.


Section 309.2


This section defines terms used throughout the regulations.
The definition of ``Indian product'' is central to these regulations. It explicitly includes handcrafts because
the core of the market consists of such products, and the term ``handcraft'' carries substantial economic value when
attached to a product. It excludes products made before 1935 because, in passing the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990,
the Congress was concerned with fraudulent sales in the contemporary market. The Indian Arts and Crafts Board's mission
as an agency is to promote the development of the contemporary market. The 1935 cutoff date was chosen because that
was the founding year of the Indian Arts and Crafts Board, and the Act is an amendment to the Board's organic act.
Definitions of ``Indian,'' ``Indian arts and crafts organization,'' and ``Indian tribe'' are provided in the statute.
A current list of Federally-recognized Indian tribes was published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 21, 1993 (58 FR 54364), by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, U.S. Department of the Interior. The Department
of the Interior does not maintain a list of state recognized tribes that qualify under subsection (b)(2).


Section 309.3


Subsection (a) of this section is particularly important because it states how the unmodified use of the word ``Indian''
or the unmodified name of an Indian tribe will be construed by the Indian Arts and Crafts Board as a representation of
an Indian product for enforcement purposes.
The Act specifically addresses the situation of people of various degrees of Indian ancestry who are active in the
art market, but are not members of tribes for whatever reason. The Congress provided in the Act that tribes could decide
to certify such people as Indian artisans. There may be instances in which a person is not a member of a tribe and has not
been certified as an Indian artisan, but nonetheless is of Indian ancestry. A different identification issue arises
among people who make products that may appear Indian-made, or may be intentionally styled after Indian products,
but who have no intention of misrepresenting them as Indian-made.
The regulations need to identify a reasonable boundary between marketing statements that are simply truthful, and
should be permitted, and statements that are clearly misleading, and should be prohibited. Comments are especially
encouraged about what is reasonable and how best to establish a boundary. As proposed, the regulations provide that
the unmodified use of the word ``Indian'' or of the name of a tribe in connection with a product would necessarily be
misleading if the maker was not a member or certified artisan of a tribe.
Foreign products have been a major concern of the Congress, and the fundamental purpose of the Act is to protect Indians,
as defined, who are resident in the United States. Subsection (b) clarifies how certain marketing conduct related
to products of Indians of foreign tribes will be construed by the Indian Arts and Crafts Board for enforcement purposes.


Section 309.4


This section states the statutory prohibition against a tribe imposing a fee for certifying an Indian artisan.


Section 309.5


This section states where the statutory criminal and civil penalties for violations may be found.


Section 309.6


This section provides the address where complaints about alleged violations of the Act may be submitted.


Public Participation


Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by mailing a request to the Indian Arts and Crafts Board, Room 4004-MIB,
1849 C Street, NW., Washington, DC 20240, or by calling 202-208-3773 (not a toll-free call).
Interested persons are invited to participate in this proposed rulemaking by submitting such written data, views,
or arguments as they may desire. Comments relating to the effects that might result from the adoption of the proposals
contained in this notice are invited. Communications should identify the docket number and be submitted in duplicate
to the address listed above. Commenters who want the Indian Arts and Crafts Board to acknowledge receipt of their comments
on this notice must submit with those comments a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement
is made: ``Comments to Docket No. 1090-AA45.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter.
All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered by the Commissioners of
the Indian Arts and Crafts Board before taking action on the proposed rule. The proposals contained in this notice
may be changed in light of comments received. All comments submitted will be available for examination in the rule
docket both before and after the closing date for comments.


Drafting Information


These proposed regulations were prepared by Geoffrey E. Stamm (Acting General Manager, Indian Arts and Crafts Board)
and Meridith Z. Stanton (Advisory Services Specialist, Indian Arts and Crafts Board).


Compliance With Other Laws


This rule was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review under E.O. 12866.

There is no collection of information in this rule requiring approval by the Office of Management and Budget under
44 U.S.C. 3504.
The Department of the Interior certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.). An unknown number of individuals,
small businesses, and tribal governments may be affected in some way, but they do not exceed several thousand in aggregate.
These possible effects, such as increased demand on tribal governments from some of their members to document their
status, stem from the statute itself rather than the proposed regulations, as the preponderance of the proposed regulations
does not exceed the non-discretionary statutory requirements.
The Department of the Interior has determined that these proposed regulations will not have a significant effect
on the human environment under the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321-4347). In addition, the
Department of the Interior has determined that these proposed regulations are categorically excluded from the procedural
requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act by Departmental regulations in 516 DM 2. As such, neither an
Environmental Assessment nor an Environmental Impact Statement has been prepared.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Withdrawal of proposed amendment.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

OSM is announcing the withdrawal of a proposed amendment to the Kansas permanent regulatory program (hereinafter,
the ``Kansas program'') under the surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). The proposed amendment
pertains to the Kansas Revegetation Success Guidelines. Kansas is withdrawing this amendment because it needs more
time to research the issues and plans to resubmit a formal amendment at a later date.






</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

By letter dated September 4, 1992 (Administrative Record No. KS-533), Kansas submitted a proposed amendment
to its program pursuant to SMCRA. The amendment proposed to revise the Kansas Revegetation Success Guidelines. Kansas
submitted the proposed amendment at the State's own initiative to improve its program.



On October 29, 1992 
(Administrative Record No. KS-541), OSM announced receipt of and solicited public comment on the program amendment
(57 FR 49051). On March 24, 1993 
(Administrative Record No. KS-552), OSM notified Kansas of concerns it had with the proposed program amendment.
On April 15, 1993 
(Administrative Record No. KS-557), a public meeting was held between OSM and the State of Kansas in Pittsburg,
Kansas. On April 23, 1993 
(Administrative Record No. KS-553), Kansas requested an additional 30-day extension in order to respond to
the issue letter from OSM. On May 24, 1993 
(Administrative Record No. KS-556), Kansas requested an additional 30-day extension in order to respond to
the issue letter from OSM. On June 24, 1993 
(Administrative Record No. KS-559), Kansas responded to OSM's concerns. On July 12, 1993 
(Administrative Record No. KS-562), OSM reopened the public comment period on the amendment for 30 days (58
FR 37447). On April 29, 1994 
(Administrative Record No. KS-582), OSM notified Kansas of concerns it had with the revised program amendment.
On May 5, 1994 
(Administrative Record No. KS-583), Kansas requested an extension to the time required to respond to these
concerns and a public meeting to discuss the issues; and on June 20, 1994 (Administrative Record No. KS-586),
Kansas requested an extension on the time to respond until September 30, 1994. On July 20, 1994 
(Administrative Record No. KS-588), a public meeting was held between OSM and the State of Kansas in Pittsburg,
Kansas. On September 9, 1994 
(Administrative Record No. KS-590), Kansas requested a 90-day extension in order to respond to the issue letter
from OSM. On September 28, 1994 
(Administrative Record No. KS-591), Kansas requested that the proposed amendment be withdrawn. Kansas proposes
to research the remaining issues prior to resubmitting the amendment for formal approval at a later date.


Therefore, the proposed amendment announced in the October 29, 1992,

Privacy Act; Implementation


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Defense Logistics Agency, DoD.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Defense Logistics Agency proposes to exempt a system of records from certain provisions of the Privacy Act. The
system of records is identified as S100.10 GC, entitled Whistleblower Complaint and Investigation Files. 


The exemption is intended to increase the value of the system of records for law enforcement purposes; to comply with
prohibitions against the disclosure of certain kinds of information; and to protect the privacy of individuals identified
in the system of records.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Executive Order 12866. 

The Director, Administration and Management, Office of the Secretary of Defense has determined that this Privacy
Act rule for the Department of Defense does not constitute `significant regulatory action.' Analysis of the rule
indicates that it does not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; does not create a serious inconsistency
or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; does not materially alter the budgetary
impact of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the right and obligations of recipients thereof; does
not raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in Executive Order 12866 (1993). 


 



Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980. 

The Director, Administration and Management, Office of the Secretary of Defense certifies that this Privacy Act
rule for the Department of Defense does not have significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
because it is concerned only with the administration of Privacy Act systems of records within the Department of Defense.



 



Paperwork Reduction Act. 

The Director, Administration and Management, Office of the Secretary of Defense, certifies that this Privacy Act
rule for the Department of Defense imposes no information requirements beyond the Department of Defense and that
the information collected within the Department of Defense is necessary and consistent with 5 U.S.C. 552a, known
as the Privacy Act of 1974. 


 

This proposed rule would add an exempt Privacy Act system of records to the DLA inventory of systems of records. DLA
performs as one of its principal functions investigations into whistleblower complaints arising from DLA employees
and the employees of DLA contractors. The proposal to exempt the system reflects recognition that certain records
in the system may be deemed to require protection from disclosure in order to protect confidential sources mentioned
in the files and avoid compromising, impeding, or interfering with investigative and enforcement proceedings.
The authority for the exemption may be found in 5 U.S.C 552a(k)(2). The system would thus be exempt from sections 552a(c)(3),
(d)(1) through (4), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (e)(4)(H), and (e)(4)(I), and (f). The Director proposes to adopt these exemptions.

3. 

Authority:

 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2). 


 

4. 

Reasons: 

From subsection (c)(3) because granting access to the accounting for each disclosure as required by the Privacy Act,
including the date, nature, and purpose of each disclosure and the identity of the recipient, could alert the subject
to the existence of the investigation or prosecutive interest by DLA or other agencies. This could seriously compromise
case preparation by prematurely revealing its existence and nature; compromise or interfere with witnesses or make
witnesses reluctant to cooperate; and lead to suppression, alteration, or destruction of evidence. 
From subsections (d)(1) through (d)(4), and (f) because providing access to records of a civil investigation and
the right to contest the contents of those records and force changes to be made to the information contained therein
would seriously interfere with and thwart the orderly and unbiased conduct of the investigation and impede case preparation.
Providing access rights normally afforded under the Privacy Act would provide the subject with valuable information
that would allow interference with or compromise of witnesses or render witnesses reluctant to cooperate; lead to
suppression, alteration, or destruction of evidence; and result in the secreting of or other disposition of assets
that would make them difficult or impossible to reach in order to satisfy any Government claim growing out of the investigation
or proceeding. 
From subsection (e)(1), because it is not always possible to detect the relevance or necessity of each piece of information
in the early stages of an investigation. In some cases, it is only after the information is evaluated in light of other
evidence that its relevance and necessity will be clear. 
From subsections (e)(4)(G) and (e)(4)(H) because there is no necessity for such publication since the system of records
will be exempt from the underlying duties to provide notification about and access to information in the system and
to make amendments to and corrections of the information in the system. However, DLA will continue to publish such
a notice in broad generic terms as is its current practice. 

From subsection (e)(4)(I) because to the extent that this provision is construed to require more detailed disclosure
than the broad, generic information currently published in the system notice, an exemption from this provision is
necessary to protect the confidentiality of sources of information and to protect privacy and physical safety of
witnesses and informants. DLA will, nevertheless, continue to publish such a notice in broad generic terms as is its
current practice.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The USEPA is approving, through direct final procedure, an Ohio State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision request
for the purpose of implementing an emissions statement program for stationary sources within the State's marginal
and above ozone nonattainment areas. Section 182(a)(3)(B) of title I of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA),
requires States with areas designated nonattainment for the ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS)
to establish regulations for annual reporting of actual emissions by sources that emit VOC or NOx in the nonattainment
area. These emissions reports are referred to as ``emissions statements.'' Sources in the following counties are
subject to the emissions statement program requirements: Ashtabula, Butler, Clark, Clermont, Cuyahoga, Delaware,
Franklin, Geauga, Greene, Hamilton, Lake, Licking, Lorain, Lucas, Mahoning, Medina, Miami, Montgomery, Portage,
Stark, Summit, Trumbull, Warren, and Wood.


In the final rules section of this 

Federal Register

, the USEPA is approving this SIP revision request as a direct final rule without prior proposal because USEPA views
the action as noncontroversial and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval is set
forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to that direct final rule, no further
activity is contemplated in relation to this proposed rule. If USEPA receives adverse public comments, the direct
final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on
this proposed rule. USEPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting
on this action should do so at this time.

I. Summary of Proposed Rule 



A. Summary of Rule Requirements 



Today's proposed rule would amend title 40, chapter I, 
part 63 of the Code of Federal Regulations by adding a new 
subpart DD_National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air 
Pollutants for Off-site Waste and Recovery Operations. The 
following is a summary of the requirements proposed for the 
rule. 

The EPA is proposing to define ``waste'' for the off-site 
waste and recovery operations NESHAP as any material 
generated from industrial, commercial, mining, or 
agricultural operations or from community activities that is 
discarded, discharged, or is being accumulated, stored, or 
physically, chemically, thermally, or biologically treated 
prior to being discarded or discharged. This definition 
would include all materials defined to be solid wastes under 
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) rules 
including hazardous wastes. The EPA is proposing to define 
``recoverable material'' for this rulemaking as any material 
generated from industrial, commercial, mining, or 
agricultural operations or from community activities that is 
recycled, reprocessed, reused, or is being accumulated, 
stored, or physically, chemically, thermally, or 
biologically treated prior to being recycled, reprocessed, 
or reused. Under this definition, secondary materials such 
as used, surplus, and scrap materials that are recycled or 
reprocessed to recover reusable materials or to create new 
products would be considered by the EPA to be recoverable 
materials subject to this NESHAP. Waste and recoverable 
material subject to the off-site waste and recovery 
operations NESHAP are collectively referred to in the 
proposed rule as ``regulated material.''

1. Applicability 



The proposed rule would apply to owners and operators 
of facilities, with certain exceptions listed below, where 
operations are conducted to manage, convey, or handle wastes 
or recoverable materials that are received from other 
facilities and contain hazardous air pollutants. In other 
words, the waste or recoverable material has been generated 
off-site at a separate location and, then, shipped or 
transferred to the facility for subsequent management. 
Applicable operations subject to the rule would include 
storage, treatment, and disposal operations as well as 
recycling, recovery, and reprocessing operations. All of 
these operations collectively are referred to hereafter in 
this notice as ``off-site waste and recovery operations.'' 

The rule would apply to off-site waste and recovery 
operations receiving regulated materials that contain one or 
more of the specific organic chemicals listed in a table 
included as part of the proposed rule. These organic 
chemicals have been designated as hazardous air pollutants 
(HAP) under CAA section 112(b), and are referred to 
collectively hereafter in this notice as ``organic HAP.'' 
Off-site waste and recovery operations managing waste or 
recoverable material that does not contain any of the 
organic chemicals listed in the rule would not be ``regulated 
materials'' subject to the rule. 

The EPA is proposing that the off-site waste and 
recovery operations NESHAP only apply to ``major sources'' as 
defined in the Part 63 general provisions (40 CFR 63.2). 
``Area sources'' as defined under 40 CFR 63.2 would not be 
subject to the rule. 

The rule would not apply to certain types of waste or 
recovery operations located at an affected facility because 
HAP emissions from these operations are addressed by other 
EPA regulatory actions. The following operations at an 
affected facility would be exempted from the requirements of 
the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP: 
(1) Units or equipment used exclusively to manage waste or 
recoverable material generated at the affected facility site 
(i.e., waste or recoverable material generated on-site); 
(2) municipal solid waste landfill units; (3) incinerators 
used to burn waste; (4) boilers or furnaces used to burn 
regulated material to produce energy; (5) units or equipment 
located at a publicly-owned treatment works; or (6) units or 
equipment used exclusively to manage waste that has been 
received from remediation activities to cleanup wastes 
designated as hazardous wastes under Resource, Conservation, 
and Recovery Act (RCRA) rules. In addition, the off-site 
waste and recovery operations NESHAP would not apply to 
underground components of injection wells used for disposal 
of waste. 



2. General Standards 



The general standards proposed for the off-site waste 
and recovery operations NESHAP apply to major sources. The 
standards would require that the owner or operator of an 
affected facility control air emissions from certain waste 
management units and equipment in which regulated materials 
containing the organic HAP listed in the rule are placed on 
or after the effective date of the rule. These air emission 
control requirements would not apply to any affected 
facility for which the owner or operator demonstrates that 
the total annual organic HAP mass content of all regulated 
materials subject to the rule entering the facility is less 
than 1 megagram per year (Mg/yr). The procedure to be used 
by the owner or operator to calculate the total annual 
organic HAP mass content of the regulated material is 
specified in the rule. The EPA requests comment on the 
proposed 1 Mg/yr exemption, and requests supporting 
information be provided with any recommendation for an 
alternative exemption level. 

Two other provisions are proposed for the off-site 
waste and recovery operations NESHAP that would allow 
individual units at an affected facility to be exempted from 
the air emission control requirements of the rule. The 
first provision would exempt from the air emission control 
requirements those units at major sources that exclusively 
are used to manage regulated material received at the 
facility with a volatile organic hazardous air pollutant 
(VOHAP) concentration less than 100 parts per million by 
weight (ppmw) on a mass-weighted average basis. The 
regulated material VOHAP concentration would be determined 
based on the organic HAP content of the regulated material 
at the point where the facility accepts delivery or takes 
possession of the regulated material, using procedures 
specified in the rule. The EPA requests comment on the 
definitiveness of the term ``point of entry'' as defined in 
the rule.

The second individual unit exemption provision proposed 
in the rule would allow an owner or operator to selectively 
designate, on a site-specific basis, certain individual 
units to be exempt from the air emission control 
requirements regardless of the VOHAP concentration of the 
regulated material placed in the unit. Application of this 
discretionary exemption by the owner or operator would be 
limited based on regulated material organic HAP content. 
Under this provision, the total annual organic HAP mass 
content in the regulated materials placed in all of the 
units designated by the owner or operator as exempt units 
could not exceed 1 Mg/yr as determined in accordance with 
the procedures specified in the rule. The EPA requests 
comment on the structure of the proposed 1 Mg/yr exemption 
for individual units, as well as supporting information for 
any recommendation for an alternative exemption level. 

For tanks, surface impoundments, containers, conveyance 
systems, and certain treatment units required to use air 
emission controls under the off-site waste and recovery 
operations NESHAP, the owner or operator would be required 
to either: (1) Install and operate air emission controls on 
the unit in accordance with standards specified in the rule; 
or (2) treat the regulated material before the regulated 
material is placed in the unit to remove or destroy organic 
HAP in accordance with requirements specified in the rule. 
For land disposal units and other miscellaneous units 
subject to the air emission control requirements of the 
rule, the owner or operator would be required to treat the 
regulated material before the regulated material is placed 
in the unit to remove or destroy organic HAP in accordance 
with the requirements specified in the rule. In addition to 
these requirements, the rule would require that the owner or 
operator of an affected facility control organic HAP 
emissions from leaks in certain ancillary equipment 
(e.g., pumps, valves, flanges, etc.) used to handle 
regulated material streams having a total organic HAP 
concentration equal to or greater than 10 percent by weight. 

Under the proposed rule, an owner or operator would be 
allowed to use any type of treatment process to reduce the 
organic HAP content of the regulated material that can 
continuously achieve the performance requirements specified 
in the rule. Several alternative treatment process 
performance standards are specified in the proposed rule 
from which the owner or operator could choose to comply. 
These standards would allow the use of a treatment process 
that achieves any of the following conditions: (1) the 
actual VOHAP concentration of the regulated material exiting 
the treatment process is less than 100 ppmw or the VOHAP 
concentration limit established for the process, whichever 
value is lower; (2) the HAP reduction efficiency for the 
treatment process is equal to or greater than 95 percent, 
and the VOHAP concentration of the regulated material 
exiting the treatment process is less than 50 ppmw; or 
(3) the actual HAP mass removal for the treatment process is 
greater than the required mass removal established for the 
process. 



3. Tank Standards 



The tank standards proposed for the off-site waste and 
recovery operations NESHAP would establish the requirements 
for tanks using air emission controls to comply with the 
general standards of the rule. No air emission controls 
would be required under the rule for a tank in which all 
regulated material placed in the unit has been treated to 
remove or destroy organic HAP in accordance with the 
requirements specified in the general standards. Also, the 
tank standards would not apply to a tank in which biological 
treatment of a regulated material is performed under certain 
conditions specified in the rule; or to a tank designated by 
the owner or operator to be exempted from using air emission 
controls in accordance with the rule provisions. 

The proposed air emission control requirements for 
tanks would be applied based on the tank design capacity, 
the maximum HAP vapor pressure of the regulated material in 
the tank, and whether the tank is designated an ``existing 
tank'' or a ``new tank'' under the provisions of 40 CFR 
part 63. Both existing tanks and new tanks in which the 
maximum HAP vapor pressure of the regulated material in the 
tank is equal to or greater than 76.6 kPa (approximately 
11.1 psi), would be required (regardless of tank design 
capacity) to manage the regulated material in a tank using a 
cover that is connected through a closed-vent system to a 
control device. For affected tanks in which the maximum HAP 
vapor pressure of the regulated material in the tank is less 
than 76.6 kPa, different standards are proposed for existing 
tanks and for new tanks depending on the tank design 
capacity.

Under the proposed tank standards for existing tanks in which the maximum HAP vapor pressure of the regulated material
in the tank is less than 76.6 kPa, use of air emission controls would be required on tanks having a design capacity equal
to or greater than 75 m3 (approximately 20,000 gallons). No air emission controls would be required under the rule
for an existing tank having a design capacity less than 75 m3. For tanks having a design capacity equal to or greater
than 75 m3, an owner or operator would be required to install and operate air emission controls in accordance with the
rule requirements. These requirements specify that, unless the maximum HAP vapor pressure of the regulated material
in the tank is less than certain limits specified in the rule, the owner or operator install and operate on the tank one
of the following air emission control systems: (1) A cover that is connected through a closed-vent system to a control
device; (2) a fixed-roof type cover with an internal floating roof that is designed and operated in accordance with
the requirements of the new source performance standard (NSPS) for volatile organic liquid (VOL) storage under 40
CFR 60.112b(a)(1); (3) an external floating roof that is designed and operated in accordance with the requirements
of the VOL storage NSPS under 40 CFR 60.112b(a)(2); or (4) a pressure tank that is designed to operate as a closed system.
Under the proposed rule, an owner or operator would be allowed to use a fixed-roof type cover (without any additional
controls) for existing tanks having a capacity less than 151 m3 (approximately 40,000 gallons) when the maximum HAP
vapor pressure of the regulated material in the tank is less than 27.6 kPa (approximately 4.0 psi), and for larger capacity
tanks when the maximum HAP vapor pressure of the regulated material in the tank is less than 5.2 kPa (approximately
0.75 psi). 

The proposed standards for new tanks in which the maximum HAP vapor pressure of the regulated material in the tank is
less than 76.6 kPa would require the use of air emission controls on tanks having a design capacity equal to or greater
than 38 m3 (approximately 10,000 gallons). The same types of air emission control systems specified in the proposed
rule for existing tanks (e.g., vent to control device, use floating roof, pressure tank, or use of fixed-roof type
covers under certain conditions) would apply to new tanks with the exception that the maximum HAP vapor pressure limits
allowed for using fixed-roof type covers without additional controls are lower for new tanks than existing tanks.
An owner or operator would be allowed to use a fixed-roof type cover without additional controls for new tanks having
a capacity less than 151 m3 when the maximum HAP vapor pressure of the regulated material in the tank is less than 13.1
kPa (approximately 1.9 psi), and for larger capacity tanks when the maximum HAP vapor pressure of the regulated material
in the tank is less than 0.7 kPa (approximately 0.1 psi). 

The proposed maximum HAP vapor pressure limits selected for existing tanks that would be allowed to use fixed-roof
type covers without additional controls are based on the waste vapor pressure limits established for tanks at hazardous
waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities (TSDF) subject to air rules being developed by the EPA under authority
of RCRA section 3004(n) (refer to 56 FR 33490). For today's proposed rulemaking, the EPA considered using the maximum
vapor pressure limits established for tanks under the NESHAP for the synthetic organic chemical manufacturing (SOCMI)
industry (40 CFR 63 subpart G). Because the sources subject to both the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP
and the RCRA air rules are similar, the EPA believes it is appropriate to use the maximum vapor pressure limits established
for the RCRA air rules for today's proposed rulemaking also. The EPA requests comment on the selection of the maximum
HAP vapor pressure limits proposed for the air emission control requirements for tanks under the off-site waste and
recovery operations NESHAP.

4. Surface Impoundment Standards 



The proposed air emission control requirements are the same for existing surface impoundments and new surface impoundments.
These requirements would not apply to either: a surface impoundment in which all regulated material placed in the
unit has been treated to remove or destroy organic HAP in accordance with the requirements specified in the general
standards; a surface impoundment in which biological treatment of a regulated material is performed under certain
conditions specified in the rule; or a surface impoundment designated by the owner or operator to be exempted from
using air emission controls in accordance with rule provisions. For each surface impoundment required to use air
emission controls, the owner or operator would be required to use either: a cover that is connected to a closed-vent
system vented to a control device; or a floating membrane cover that is designed and operated in accordance with requirements
specified in the rule. 



5. Container Standards




The proposed air emission control requirements are the same for existing and new containers. These requirements
would not apply to either: a container having a design capacity less than or equal to 0.1 m3 (approximately 26 gallons);
a container in which all regulated material placed in the unit has been treated to remove or destroy organic HAP in accordance
with the requirements specified in the general standards; or a container designated by the owner or operator to be
exempted from using air emission controls in accordance with rule provisions. 


For containers used for storage, treatment, and handling of regulated material, the owner or operator would be required
to use either: (1) a container that is equipped with a vapor leak-tight cover; (2) a container having a design capacity
less than or equal to 0.42 m3 (approximately 110 gallons) that is equipped with a cover and complies with all applicable
U.S. Department of Transportation regulations on packaging hazardous waste for transport under 49 CFR part 178;
or (3) a container that is attached to or forms a part of any truck, trailer, or railcar and that has been demonstrated
within the preceding 12 months to be organic HAP vapor tight in accordance with the procedure specified in the rule.
For containers in which treatment of regulated material is performed, the owner or operator would be required to place
the container inside an enclosure that is connected through a closed-vent system to a control device at all times that
the container is completely or partially uncovered during the treatment operation. Transfer of regulated material
by pumping into a container having a design capacity greater than 0.42 m3 would be required to be performed using submerged
fill loading. 




6. Process Vent Standards 




The proposed off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP would regulate organic HAP emissions from process vents
on enclosed treatment units. Under the proposed rule, an ``enclosed treatment unit'' would be defined as a stationary,
enclosed unit used for the purpose of treating or processing a regulated material, and for which all materials only
enter or exit the unit through enclosed pipes or process vents while the unit is operating. Examples of an enclosed
treatment unit include a distillation pot, distillation column, thin-film evaporator, solvent extraction tower,
steam stripping tower, and air stripping tower. 


The proposed air emission control requirements are the same for existing units and new units. These requirements
would not apply to either: an enclosed treatment unit in which all regulated material placed in the unit has been treated
to remove or destroy organic HAP in accordance with the requirements specified in the general standards; or an enclosed
treatment unit designated by the owner or operator to be exempted from using air emission controls in accordance with
rule provisions. For each enclosed treatment unit required to use air emission controls, the owner or operator would
be required to connect each process vent on the unit to a closed-vent system vented to a control device.

7. Conveyance System Standards 


The proposed off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP would establish requirements for conveyance systems
to control organic HAP emissions occurring during the transfer of a regulated material containing organic HAP between
two regulated material management units using air emission controls in accordance with the rule requirements. Under
the proposed rule, a ``conveyance system'' would be defined as a device other than a container used to transfer material
to or from tanks, containers, surface impoundments, enclosed treatment units, or other regulated material management
units. Examples of a conveyance system include a pipeline, individual drain system (with all associated drains,
junction boxes, and sewer lines), channel, flume, gravity-operated conveyor (such as a chute), and mechanically-powered
conveyor (such as a belt or screw conveyor). 
The proposed air emission control requirements are the same for existing conveyance systems and new conveyance systems.
These requirements would not apply to either: a conveyance system in which all regulated material placed in the unit
has been treated to remove or destroy organic HAP in accordance with the requirements specified in the general standards;
or a conveyance system designated by the owner or operator to be exempted from using air emission controls in accordance
with rule provisions. 
For each conveyance system required to use air emission controls, the owner or operator would be required to use one
of the following systems: (1) a conveyance system which uses a cover that is connected through a closed-vent system
to a control device; (2) a conveyance system which uses an enclosure that is connected through a closed-vent system
to a control device; (3) a conveyance system which is designed and operated as an enclosed pipeline in which all joints
or seams between the pipe sections are permanently or 
semi-permanently sealed (e.g., a welded joint between two sections of metal pipe or a bolted and gasketed flange);
(4) a conveyance system which is designed and operated as an individual drain system in accordance with the requirements
of 40 CFR 61.346(a)(1) or 40 CFR 61.346 (b)(1) through (b)(3); or (5) any other conveyance system which is designed
to operate as a closed system such that the conveyance system operates with no detectable emissions (as determined
by procedures specified under the rule) at all times that 
regulated material is in the conveyance system except under certain conditions. 


8. Equipment Leak Standards 


The proposed off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP would require owners and operators of affected facilities
to control organic HAP emissions from leaks in pumps, compressors, pressure relief devices, sampling connection
systems, open-ended valves or lines, valves, flanges and other connectors, and product accumulator vessels that
either contain or contact a regulated material which is a fluid (liquid or gas) and has a total organic HAP concentration
equal to or greater than 10 percent by weight. The equipment leak standards would not apply to equipment that operates
less than 300 hours per calendar year, or equipment for which the owner or operator is already complying with the requirements
of 40 CFR 63 subpart H. For each equipment component subject to this standard at either an existing source or a new source,
the owner or operator would be required to perform the leak detection and repair program and implement the equipment
modifications required under 40 CFR 61.241 through 61.247. 


9. Air Emission Control Equipment Requirements 


Specific design, performance, and operating requirements are proposed for each cover, closed-vent system, and
control device installed by the owner or operator to comply with the tank, surface impoundment, container, conveyance
system, enclosed treatment unit standards of the rule. 
The proposed requirements for covers are determined by the type of cover used and the type of regulated material management
unit on which the cover is installed. Requirements are specified for vapor-leak tight covers (i.e covers that operate
with no detectable emissions as determined by procedures specified under the rule), external and internal floating
roofs installed on tanks, floating membrane covers installed on surface impoundments, and container enclosures
requiring continuous or frequent worker access.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941013-1-00060 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941013-1-00010 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Each closed-vent system would be required to operate with no detectable emissions (as determined by procedures specified
under the rule). For the proposed rule, any control device could be used that reduces the mass content of either total
organic compounds (less methane and ethane) or total HAP in the gases vented to the device by 95 percent by weight or
greater. An owner or operator would be allowed to comply with alternative performance requirements for enclosed
combustion devices (e.g., thermal vapor incinerators, catalytic vapor incinerators, boilers, and process heaters)
and for flares. 



10. Test Methods and Compliance Procedures 



For affected units using air emission controls in accordance with the rule requirements, no regulated material determination
would be required under the proposed rule. An owner or operator would be required to determine the VOHAP concentration
or organic HAP vapor pressure of the regulated material being managed in the unit not using air emission controls in
accordance with the requirements of the standards. Either analysis of regulated material samples using procedures
specified in the rule or the owner's or operator's knowledge of the regulated material could be used could be used for
a regulated material determination. 

The owner or operator would determine that covers and closed-vent system operates with no detectable emissions by
visual inspection and testing the equipment in accordance with the procedures specified in Method 21 under 40 CFR
60 appendix A. Test procedures for control devices would be consistent with procedures specified in existing NESHAP.




11. Monitoring and Inspection Requirements 



To ensure that the air emission control equipment is properly operated and maintained, the proposed off-site waste
and recovery operations NESHAP would require that the owner or operator periodically inspect and monitor this equipment.
Visual inspections and leak detection monitoring using Method 21 would be required for certain types of covers to
ensure gaskets and seals are in good condition, and for closed-vent systems to ensure all fittings remain leak-tight.
In general, semi-annual inspection and leak detection monitoring of covers is proposed. Annual inspection and leak
detection monitoring would be required for closed-vent systems. 

Continuous monitoring of control device operation would be required under the proposed rule. This would involve
the use of automated instrumentation to measure and record appropriate control device operating parameters that
indicate whether the control device is in compliance with the applicable performance requirements of the rule. A
more detailed explanation of these proposed monitoring requirements for control devices is presented in section
V.E.1 of this notice. 

In cases when an owner or operator complies with the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP by treating a regulated
material to remove or destroy HAP before placing the regulated material in a unit, the EPA is proposing that the owner
or operator monitor appropriate operating parameters for the treatment process as described in section V.E.2 of
this notice. 



12. Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements 



The proposed off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP would require that the owner or operator to maintain certain
records and submit to the EPA certain reports consistent with the recordkeeping and reporting requirements for all
NESHAP as specified in the Part 63 general provisions (40 CFR 63 subpart A). 



B. Summary of Rule Impacts 



Implementation of the proposed off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP would result in substantial reductions
in organic HAP emissions to the atmosphere from off-site waste and recovery operations located in the United States.
Furthermore, many of the organic HAP emitted from the off-site waste and recovery operations source category are
also volatile organic compounds (VOC). These VOC react photochemically with other chemical compounds in the atmosphere
to form ozone. Although the NESHAP proposed today would not specifically require control of VOC emissions from off-site
waste and recovery operations, the organic emission control technologies upon which today's rulemaking is based
would also significantly reduce VOC emissions from the source category. The EPA estimates that implementation of
the proposed off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP would reduce nationwide organic HAP emissions by approximately
43,000 Mg/yr and reduce nationwide VOC emissions by approximately 52,000 Mg/yr.

The EPA prepared estimates of the cost to owners and 
operators of implementing the requirements of the proposed 
off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP at facilities 
expected to be subject to the rule. The total nationwide 
capital investment cost to purchase and install the air 
emission controls that would be required by the proposed 
rule is estimated by the EPA to be approximately 
$49 million. The total nationwide annual cost of the 
off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP, as proposed, 
is estimated to be approximately $24.5 million per year. 



II. Background 



A. Section 112 Statutory Requirements 


Section 112 of the Clean Air Act (CAA) regulates 
stationary sources of hazardous air pollutants (HAP). This 
section was comprehensively amended under Title III of the 
1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. The term ``stationary source'' 
means any building, structure, facility, or installation 
that emits or may emit air pollutants. Under the amended 
CAA section 112(b), Congress listed 189 chemicals, 
compounds, or groups of chemicals as HAP. The EPA is 
directed by the CAA section 112 to regulate the emission of 
these HAP from stationary sources by establishing national 
emission standards (i.e., NESHAP). 

A 1990 amendment to section 112(c) of the CAA requires 
the EPA to develop and publish a list of source categories 
that emit HAP for which NESHAP will be developed. The EPA 
is required to list all known categories and subcategories 
of ``major sources.'' The term ``major source'' is defined by 
the CAA to mean ``any stationary source or group of 
stationary sources located within a contiguous area and 
under common control that emits or has the potential to 
emit, considering controls, in the aggregate 10 tons per 
year (ton/yr) or more of any HAP or 25 ton/yr or more of any 
combination of HAP.'' The EPA's initial list of categories 
of major sources of HAP emissions was published in the 


Federal Register

 on July 16, 1992 (57 FR 31576). 

For each NESHAP source category listed by EPA, 
standards must be developed to control HAP emissions from 
both new sources and existing sources in accordance with 
specific statutory directives set out in CAA section 112, as 
amended. The statute requires the EPA to establish 
standards under a NESHAP to reflect the maximum degree of 
reduction in HAP emissions through application of maximum 
achievable control technology (MACT). 

A statutory minimum or baseline to the level of HAP 
emission control that the EPA can select to be MACT for a 
particular source category is defined under CAA 
section 112(d)(3). This minimum HAP emission control level 
is referred as the ``MACT floor.'' For new sources, the MACT 
floor is the level of HAP emission control that is achieved 
in practice by the best controlled similar source. The 
statute allows standards under a NESHAP for existing sources 
to be less stringent than standards for new sources. The 
determination of MACT floor for existing sources is 
dependent on the nationwide number of existing sources 
within the source category. For a source category with 
30 or more existing sources, the MACT floor is the average 
emission limitation achieved by the best performing 
12 percent of the existing sources. 

Once the MACT floors are determined for new and 
existing sources in a source category, the EPA must 
establish standards under a NESHAP that are no less 
stringent than the applicable MACT floors. The 
Administrator may promulgate standards that are more 
stringent than the MACT floor when such standards are 
determined by the EPA to be achievable taking into 
consideration the cost of implementing the standards as well 
as any non-air quality health and environmental impacts and 
energy requirements listed in CAA section 112(d)(2). All 
owners and operators of sources within the source category 
must comply with the promulgated NESHAP.

B. Listing of Source Category 



On the EPA's initial list of HAP emission source 
categories published in the 

Federal Register

 on July 16, 
1992 (57 FR 31576), the EPA included one source category 
which the Agency intended to represent those off-site waste 
and recovery operations that are not specifically listed as 
a separate, distinct NESHAP source category such as 
hazardous waste incineration or municipal solid waste 
landfills. This source category was titled on the initial 
list as ``solid waste treatment, storage, and disposal 
facilities.'' Since the initial source category list was 
published, the EPA decided that it is appropriate to change 
the title of this NESHAP source category. 

Effective by this notice, the EPA is changing the title 
of the NESHAP source category subject to today's proposed 
rule to ``off-site waste and recovery operations.'' This 
change is appropriate for two reasons: (1) To avoid 
confusion with the terms ``solid waste'' and ``treatment, 
storage, and disposal facilities'' which have specific 
meanings within the context of statutory and regulatory 
requirements in existing rules established by the EPA under 
authority of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act 
(RCRA); and (2) to better distinguish the types of air 
emission sources addressed by this NESHAP source category 
from other NESHAP source categories. 



C. Summary of Public Participation in Development of 
Proposed Rule 



The EPA published an advance notice of proposed 
rulemaking (ANPR) in the 

Federal Register

 on December 20, 
1993 (58 FR 66336) announcing the EPA's intent to develop a 
NESHAP for the off-site waste and recovery operations source 
category. The purpose of the ANPR was to inform owners and 
operators of affected industries and the general public of 
the planned scope of the NESHAP rulemaking for the off-site 
waste and recovery operations source category, and to 
solicit information that would aid in the development of the 
rule. 

To supplement the Agency's information regarding the 
off-site waste and recovery operations source category, the 
EPA requested comments from the public on the ANPR. The EPA 
specifically requested more information on wastes and 
recoverable materials characteristics (types, quantities, 
organic composition), waste management practices, and waste 
and recoverable material operations emission points and air 
emission data. A 30-day comment period, from 
December 20, 1993 to January 19, 1994, was provided for 
interested parties to submit comments on the ANPR. The EPA 
received written comments from 16 commenters concerning the 
ANPR. These comments were considered by the EPA in the 
development of the proposed off-site waste and recovery 
operations NESHAP. 



D. Relationship of Proposed Rule to Other EPA Regulatory 
Actions 



1. Clean Air Act 



a. 

Other NESHAP Rulemakings. 

Many industrial sectors 
that manage wastes or recoverable materials containing HAP 
are listed as specific NESHAP source categories on the 
initial EPA source category list (57 FR 31576, July 16, 
1992). For example, plants and facilities in the NESHAP 
source categories representing the synthetic organic 
chemical manufacturing industry, the petroleum refining 
industry, the pesticide manufacturing industry, and the 
pharmaceutical manufacturing industry frequently manage 
some, if not all, of the wastes and recoverable materials 
generated by the manufacturing processes operated at the 
facilities at the same location where the materials are 
generated (i.e, on-site). For NESHAP source categories in 
which operations to manage waste or recoverable material may 
occur at the same facility where the material is generated, 
the EPA is addressing HAP emissions from the management 
operations as part of the NESHAP being developed for that 
particular source category. 

The NESHAP rule proposed today under 40 CFR 63 
subpart DD would apply only to those operations used to 
manage, convey, or handle waste or recoverable material 
containing organic HAP which have been generated at other 
facilities but are not specifically listed as a NESHAP 
source category. On EPA's initial list of HAP emission 
source categories, the following operations are listed as 
separate NESHAP source categories: municipal solid waste 
(MSW) landfills; publicly-owned treatment works (POTW); 
sewage sludge incinerators; hazardous waste incineration 
units; boilers and industrial furnaces; and hazardous waste 
remediation activities. For these source categories, 
separate NESHAP under 40 CFR part 63 are being developed by 
EPA.

b. 

Municipal Solid Waste Combustion Units.

 Municipal solid waste combustion units would not be subject to the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP.
Congress directed the EPA to address air emissions from municipal solid waste combustion units under authority of
CAA section 129, as amended by the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. 



2. Resource Conservation and Recovery Act 



The EPA establishes rules for the management of solid wastes under authority of the Resource Conservation and Recovery
Act (RCRA). Under authority of subtitle C of RCRA, the EPA has established rules regulating the management of solid
wastes determined to be hazardous waste (refer to 40 CFR Parts 260 through 271). Municipal solid wastes and other types
of nonhazardous solid wastes are regulated by rules established under authority of subtitle D of RCRA (e.g., refer
to 40 CFR Parts 257 and 258). 

a. 

Definition of Waste.

 For the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP, the EPA is proposing definitions of ``waste'' and ``recoverable
materials'' that are consistent with the definitions used by the EPA for other air rules promulgated under the CAA
(selection of this definition is explained further in section IV.A of this notice). These definitions define the
types of materials considered to be a ``waste'' or ``recoverable material'' in a broader context than the definition
of ``solid waste'' that the EPA has historically used for RCRA rulemakings. The proposed definition of ``waste''
for the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP includes all materials defined to be solid wastes under RCRA
rules including hazardous wastes. In addition, materials excluded from the RCRA definition of solid waste such as
recovered materials recycled back to a process unit and used oil reprocessed for sale as a fuel are included in the definition
of ``recoverable material'' proposed for the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP. As a result, certain
off-site waste and recovery operations exempted from RCRA rules may be subject to the requirements of the NESHAP rule
proposed today. 

b. 

Duplicative Requirements.

 At many facilities where hazardous wastes are managed and wastes are received from off-site, both the off-site waste
and recovery operations NESHAP proposed today and existing RCRA air rules under 40 CFR parts 264 and 265 would likely
be applicable to the facilities. At these facilities, some operations would be subject to either air emission standards
under the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP or the air emissions standards under the RCRA air rules. However,
in certain situations, some operations would be subject to air emission standards under both sets of rules. 

The CAA requires that the requirements of rules developed under the Act be consistent, but avoid duplication, with
requirements of rules developed under RCRA. Certain testing, monitoring, inspection, recordkeeping, and other
requirements of the proposed off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP also would be required under the RCRA
air rules. The EPA believes that each of these requirements is necessary to assure compliance with and enforce the
rules. However, it is unnecessary for owners and operators of those facilities subject to both the off-site waste
and recovery operations NESHAP and the RCRA air rules to conduct duplicative waste testing, keep duplicate sets of
records, or perform other duplicative actions for the same waste or recoverable material operation. Thus, the EPA
requests comment on how applicable requirements under the RCRA air rules should be incorporated into the off-site
waste and recovery operations NESHAP to allow owners and operators to demonstrate compliance with both rules without
having to repeat duplicative requirements. 



3. Pollution Prevention Act 



The Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 13101 

et seq.

, Pub. L. 101-508, November 5, 1990) establishes the national policy of the United States for pollution prevention.
This act declares that: (1) pollution should be prevented or reduced whenever feasible; (2) pollution that cannot
be prevented or reduced should be recycled or reused in an environmentally-safe manner wherever feasible; (3) pollution
that cannot be recycled or reused should be treated; and (4) disposal or release into the atmosphere should be chosen
only as a last resort. 

Opportunities for applying pollution prevention to the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP are basically
limited to pollution treatment prior to disposal or release into the atmosphere. By definition, the off-site waste
and recovery operations source category consists of operations used to manage materials that have already been generated
at other locations such as a manufacturing plant. Thus, there are no pollution prevention practices such as modifying
the manufacturing process to reduce the quantity of materials containing organic HAP generated or to recycle the
materials back to the process which can be implemented once the material arrives at an off-site waste and recovery
operations facility. The EPA has incorporated the pollution prevention policy into the proposed rule by requiring
wastes and recoverable materials containing organic HAP be treated to remove or destroy organic HAP prior to management
in units open to the environment. Thus, to the extent possible, pollution prevention has been considered in the development
of this rulemaking. Today's proposed NESHAP for the off-site waste and recovery operations source category is consistent
with the pollution prevention policy.

III. Source Category Description 



A. Hazardous Air Pollutant Types 



The specific chemicals, compounds, or groups of compounds designated by Congress to be HAP are listed in CAA section
112(b). Both organic and inorganic chemical compounds are included on this HAP list. The EPA noted in the ANPR for the
off-site waste and recovery operations source category its intent to regulate under this NESHAP only organic compounds
which have been listed as HAP (58 FR 66337). 

The EPA decided not to regulate under the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP proposed today emissions
of the metals and other inorganic chemical compounds listed as HAP. The primary source of inorganic HAP emissions
from off-site waste and recovery operations is combustion units such as waste incinerators and boilers and industrial
furnaces burning wastes or recoverable materials for energy. As explained in section II.D.1 of this notice, the EPA
is addressing HAP emissions from these combustion sources under separate regulatory actions. Furthermore, the
data available to the EPA do not suggest that significant quantities of inorganic HAP are emitted to the air from the
off-site waste and recovery operations that would be subject to this NESHAP. 

Many different types of organic HAP potentially can be emitted from off-site waste and recovery operations facilities
because of the wide variety of manufacturing processes and other sources which generate the materials sent to these
facilities. Selection of the specific organic HAP chemicals for regulation under the off-site waste and recovery
operations NESHAP is explained further in section IV.A of this notice. 



B. Facility Types 



Off-site waste and recovery operations are conducted at many different types of facilities. Some of these facility
types are listed as a specific NESHAP source category. The off-site waste and recovery operations source category
is intended to represent all of the other facilities where off-waste and recovery operations are conducted but are
not specifically included under another NESHAP source category. Based on this premise, the EPA identified the following
types of facilities described below to be included (but not limited to) in the off-site waste and recovery operations
source category. 



1. Hazardous Waste TSDF 



Under the RCRA rules regulating the management of wastes determined to be hazardous waste, the EPA has established
a permit system for owners and operators of facilities where operations are conducted to treat, store, or dispose
of a RCRA hazardous waste. A facility subject to RCRA permitting requirements is termed a treatment, storage, and
disposal facility (TSDF). A RCRA hazardous waste may be generated on the same site where a TSDF is located, or may be
generated at one site and then transported to a TSDF at a separate location. Wastes not designated as RCRA hazardous
waste are also managed at some TSDF. Although a waste may not specifically designated as a RCRA hazardous waste, this
waste can still contain significant quantities of organic constitutes listed as HAP under the CAA. 

The EPA has conducted nationwide surveys to collect information regarding hazardous waste management practices.
Data from the most recent surveys indicate that approximately 2,300 TSDF were operating in the United States in 1986.
At 710 of these TSDF, owners and operators reported managing RCRA hazardous wastes that are generated off-site. The
EPA survey data indicate that approximately 240 of the 710 TSDF that receive waste from off-site also manage wastes
other than RCRA hazardous waste. 



2. Industrial Waste Landfill Facilities 



Many landfill facilities throughout the Unites States are dedicated to the disposal of solid wastes other than those
defined as RCRA hazardous wastes. Landfills accepting household wastes are defined under RCRA rules to be municipal
solid waste (MSW) landfill units. No MSW landfill units are included in the off-site waste and recovery operations
source category because these units are listed as a separate NESHAP source category. However, some other landfills
are operated by waste management companies that will accept only industrial nonhazardous wastes (i.e., these landfills
do not accept any household waste or RCRA hazardous waste).

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941013-1-00065 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941013-1-00010 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The EPA estimates that there are approximately 10 industrial landfills currently operating that accept only nonhazardous
industrial process wastes. These landfills receive a wide range of wastes that may contain significant amounts of
organic HAP. Furthermore, the EPA estimates that nationwide there are approximately an additional 1,800 construction
and demolition debris landfills currently in operation that can be included in this segment of the off-site waste
and recovery operations source category. However, the EPA does not expect wastes received at construction and demolition
debris landfills to contain significant amounts of organic HAP. 



3. Industrial Wastewater Treatment Facilities 



Analogous to landfills, many waste treatment facilities are operated by municipal governments and private companies
throughout the United States for the treatment of wastewaters. Wastewater treatment facilities accepting residential
and commercial wastewaters are considered to be publicly owned-treatment works (POTW). No POTW are included in the
off-site waste and recovery operations source category because POTW are listed as a separate NESHAP source category.
In addition to POTW, some privately-owned wastewater treatment facilities process nonhazardous wastewaters received
from off-site sources. A nationwide survey was conducted by the EPA of wastewater treatment facilities operating
in 1989. Using these survey data, a data base excluding POTW was created. The results of this survey indicate that 15
wastewater treatment facilities were operating nationwide which were neither a POTW nor a hazardous waste TSDF but
did process wastewaters received from off-site sources that potentially could generate wastewaters containing
organic HAP. 



4. Recycled Used Oil Management Facilities 



Used oils from motor vehicles and other sources potentially can contain organic chemicals, such as benzene, which
have been listed as HAP under CAA section 112(b). Although the management of used oils which are recycled is regulated
by separate rules promulgated by the EPA under authority of RCRA section 3014, these rules do not address air emissions
from used oil management facilities. 

The EPA gathered information regarding recycled used oil management practices in the United States for the development
of the RCRA standards. This information indicates that approximately 2,800 million liters of used oil enters the
commercial used oil recycling market each year. Approximately three-fourths of this recycled used oil is sent to
facilities categorized by EPA as ``used oil processors.'' Used oil processors typically collect used motor oil and
industrial lubricating oils. These oils are processed to remove water and sediments from the oils. The processors
then sell the oil as a fuel for burning primarily in boilers, furnaces, and space heaters. There were 182 used oil processing
facilities operating in the United States in 1991. The remainder of the recycled used oil is sent to facilities categorized
as ``used oil re-refiners.'' At these facilities the used oil is processed into base lube oil stocks and other products.
In 1991, there were four used oil re-refining facilities operating in the United States. Several companies have expressed
interest in expanding used oil re-refining capacity in the United States. 



5. Oil and Gas E&P Waste Management Facilities 



There are a variety of wastes and recoverable materials generated during oil and gas exploration and production (E&P).
The majority of these materials are managed on-site at the production site (i.e., at the location of the well). However,
some E&P wastes and recoverable materials generated at the production site that may contain organic HAP are subsequently
sent to off-site crude oil reclamation and land treatment facilities. 

The EPA gathered information regarding E&P waste and recoverable material management practices from EPA conducted
site visits and existing industry sponsored surveys. Nationwide, approximately 100,000 Mg/yr of E&P wastes
and recoverable materials are sent to off-site crude oil reclamation facilities. These materials consist mostly
of tank bottoms from crude oil storage tanks or produced water storage tanks. In addition, approximately 135,000
Mg/yr of E&P waste sludges are managed in off-site land treatment operations.

6. Other Facilities 




In addition to facilities that are in business to manage wastes or recoverable materials received from other generators,
some facilities that provide support services may indirectly receive wastes or recoverable materials which are
potential organic HAP emission sources. Two types of such facilities have been identified by the EPA: (1) Facilities
where empty drums previously used to hold wastes or recoverable containing organics are cleaned and reconditioned
for reuse; and (2) truck terminal facilities at which tank trucks used for chemical waste or recoverable material
transport are cleaned and rinsed prior to being used to transport a new load. At both of these types of facilities, organic
HAP emissions can occur from the wastewater treatment system operated at the facility to treat the wastes and cleaning
solutions drained from drums or truck tanks as a result of the container cleaning operation. Wastewater treatment
operations are expected to be the primary source of organic HAP emissions at these types of facilities. 

The need for and frequency of cleaning a drum and tank truck depends on the type of service in which the container is used.
If drums and tank trucks are reused for the same type of product or wastes (i.e., dedicated service), the containers
do not need to be cleaned between each use. Only when a drum or tank truck is used for different types of products or wastes
(i.e, nondedicated service) is there frequent cleaning of the containers. Of the approximately 45 million drums
used annually in the United States, about 5.6 million are estimated to be in nondedicated service. Approximately
20,000 tank trucks of the nationwide total of 91,000 are estimated to be in nondedicated service. 



C. Nationwide Organic HAP Emissions 



The EPA estimated organic HAP emissions from typical or average size facilities in each of the off-site waste and recovery
operations facility segments described in the previous section of this notice using the best information available
to the Agency at the time the estimates were completed. The type, amount, and date of this information varied for each
of the different off-site waste and recovery operation facility segments. The estimate results are presented in
the BID for this proposed rulemaking. Based on these estimates, the EPA identified the following off-site waste and
recovery operations facility segments likely to include some individual facilities that are major sources of HAP
emissions as defined under CAA section 112: (1) Hazardous waste TSDF; (2) industrial waste landfills other than construction
and demolition debris landfills; (3) industrial wastewater treatment facilities; (4) crude oil reclamation facilities
and E&P waste land treatment facilities; and (5) used oil re-refining facilities. 

The EPA estimates that there are the following numbers of existing off-site waste and recovery operations facilities
in the United States: 710 hazardous waste TSDF receiving wastes from off-site; 10 industrial waste landfills receiving
nonhazardous industrial waste other than construction and demolition debris from off-site; 15 privately-owned
industrial wastewater treatment facilities; 11 crude oil reclamation facilities; 15 E&P waste land treatment
facilities; and 4 used oil re-refineries. Many but not all of these facilities would be designated as major sources
of HAP emissions as defined under CAA section 112. Insufficient information is available the EPA to project numbers
for new off-site waste and recovery operations facilities. The EPA is requesting information from affected industries
and other interested parties to improve the Agency's profile of existing and new off-site waste and recovery operations
in the United States. 

The total nationwide organic HAP emissions from the off-site waste and recovery operations source category are estimated
by the EPA to be approximately 51,500 megagrams of organic HAP per year (Mg/yr). Approximately 90 percent of these
organic HAP emissions (approximately 46,000 Mg/yr) are estimated to occur from the operations at hazardous waste
TSDF receiving waste or recoverable materials from off-site.

IV. Development of Regulatory Alternatives 



A. Selection of Source Category and Pollutants for Control 



Off-site waste and recovery operations were included as 
a source category on the EPA's initial list of HAP source 
categories (refer to section II.B of this notice). As 
previously explained, the EPA intends this source category 
to address HAP emissions only from those waste and recovery 
operations that are not included in another separate NESHAP 
source category or are being addressed by other EPA 
regulatory actions. Consequently, the following waste and 
recovery operations that receive materials from other 
facilities are specifically excluded from the off-site waste 
and recovery operations source category because these 
operations have been listed by the EPA as separate NESHAP 
source categories: hazardous waste incineration, municipal 
solid waste landfills, publicly-owned treatment works, 
sewage sludge incinerators, site remediation activities, and 
industrial boilers and process heaters. 

Wastes and recoverable materials sent to the facilities 
selected for regulation under the off-site waste and 
recovery operations NESHAP are generated by a wide variety 
of manufacturing and production processes as well as other 
recycling, reprocessing, or waste management operations. 
Consequently, many of the organic chemicals or groups of 
chemicals listed as HAP under CAA section 112(b) may be 
present in the wastes or recoverable materials sent to 
off-site waste and recovery operations facilities. 

It is not appropriate to select all organic HAP listed 
under CAA section 112(b) for regulation under the off-site 
waste and recovery operations NESHAP. Some specific organic 
chemicals that are designated as HAP have no or minimal 
potential to be emitted to the atmosphere from off-site 
waste and recovery operations. For other organic HAP 
chemicals that may be emitted from off-site waste and 
recovery operations, there are limits to the detectability 
of some of these chemicals in wastes by the test methods 
currently available to implement the off-site waste and 
recovery operations NESHAP because of properties inherent in 
the sampling and analysis protocol. Consequently, the EPA 
decided it is appropriate to develop a list of the specific 
organic HAP chemicals to be regulated by this rulemaking. 

To select which organic HAP chemicals would be 
regulated under the off-site waste and recovery operations 
NESHAP, the EPA evaluated all chemicals or groups of 
chemicals listed as HAP in CAA section 112(b). Among the 
factors included in the EPA's evaluation was an assessment 
of the aqueous and organic volatility characteristics of 
each HAP chemical, the ability of the analytical test 
methods to quantitate a HAP chemical, and the aqueous 
solubility of a HAP chemical. Based on the evaluation, the 
EPA selected the specific organic HAP chemicals listed in 
Table 1 to the proposed rule (to obtain a copy of this table 
in the regulatory text of the proposed rule refer to the 
beginning of the 

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

 section of this 
notice). The EPA requests comment on the list of HAP 
chemicals that the Agency is proposing to be regulated under 
the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP. 

The list of organic HAP selected for regulation under 
the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP contains 
many different types of organic chemicals. The EPA decided 
to develop a single set of regulatory alternatives for the 
off-site waste and recovery operations source category to 
control organic HAP emissions as a class as opposed to 
attempting to develop a series of regulatory alternatives to 
control emissions of each individual organic HAP chemicals 
on the list. Consequently, the control technologies 
considered for the regulatory alternatives are directed 
towards the control total organic HAP emissions. 

It is EPA's intent that the NESHAP address waste and 
recovery operations receiving from other facilities those 
materials that potentially can emit significant quantities 
of the organic chemicals on the HAP list for the rule. As 
explained in section II.D.2.a of this notice, the EPA has 
developed definitions for different types of wastes to 
implement the Agency's waste management rules promulgated 
under authority of RCRA. However, certain wastes and 
recoverable materials that have been specifically excluded 
from the definitions of waste adopted for these RCRA rules 
may still contain organics listed as HAP under CAA section 
112(b). Consequently, simply adopting the definitions 
already used by the EPA for wastes under the RCRA rules 
could allow certain off-site waste and recovery operations 
that emit organic HAP to remain unregulated. Therefore, the 
EPA decided that to fulfill the congressional directives of 
CAA section 112, it is necessary to define the types of 
materials to be regulated under this CAA rulemaking in a 
broader context than the EPA has historically used for the 
RCRA rules.

<TEXT>
 

For the off-site waste and recovery operations source 
category, the EPA decided to adapt the definition of ``waste'' 
adopted for the benzene waste operations NESHAP (40 CFR 60 
subpart FF). Based on this definition, the EPA created 
separate terms for ``waste'' and ``recoverable materials'' to be 
used for the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP. 
For this rulemaking, the EPA is proposing to define ``waste'' 
as any material generated from industrial, commercial, 
mining, or agricultural operations or from community 
activities that is discarded, discharged, or is being 
accumulated, stored, or physically, chemically, thermally, 
or biologically treated prior to being discarded or 
discharged. The EPA is proposing to define ``recoverable 
material'' for this rulemaking as any material generated from 
industrial, commercial, mining, or agricultural operations 
or from community activities that is recycled, reprocessed, 
reused, or is being accumulated, stored, or physically, 
chemically, thermally, or biologically treated prior to 
being recycled, reprocessed, or reused. Based on these 
definitions, materials affected by this rulemaking include 
those materials determined to be hazardous wastes under the 
RCRA rules, solid wastes that are not hazardous wastes under 
RCRA rules, and secondary materials such as used, surplus, 
and scrap materials that are either recycled for recovery of 
reusable materials or reprocessed for sale as new products. 



B. Subcategorization 



Subcategorization of a source category is sometimes 
appropriate for a rulemaking when industrial segments within 
a source category require application of different types of 
control techniques. In developing today's proposed rule, 
the EPA considered subcategorization of the off-site waste 
and recovery operations source category and decided not to 
propose subcategories for the off-site waste and recovery 
operations NESHAP. 

As described in section III.B of this notice, the EPA 
identified several different industrial segments to be 
included in the off-site waste and recovery operations 
source category. Most of these off-site waste and recovery 
operations facilities are also hazardous waste TSDF (refer 
to section III.C of this notice). However, the quantity and 
type of organic HAP emissions from an off-site waste and 
recovery operations facility are not dependent upon whether 
a particular facility is subject to RCRA hazardous waste 
management rules. As previously described, off-site waste 
and recovery operations facilities can receive materials 
that are not hazardous wastes under the RCRA rules but still 
contain organics listed as HAP under CAA section 112(b). 
Furthermore, common organic HAP control technologies are 
applicable to the operations used at all of the off-site 
waste and recovery operations facility types. There are no 
significant differences in the organic HAP emissions or the 
control technologies applicable to controlling these 
emissions from any of the off-site waste and recovery 
operations facility types. Thus, based upon these factors, 
the EPA concluded that designation of separate subcategories 
for the purpose of developing the off-site waste and 
recovery operations NESHAP is not warranted. 



C. Selection of Emission Points 



For purpose of developing regulatory alternatives which 
could be effectively compared in developing this rulemaking, 
the EPA identified the predominate types of emissions points 
at off-site waste and recovery operations facilities where 
organic HAP emissions occur. Five emission point type 
classifications were designated as follows: tanks, 
containers, land disposal units, process vents, and 
equipment leaks.

1. Tanks 


The tank emission point type for the off-site waste and 
recovery operations source category represents the organic 
HAP emissions from wastes or recoverable materials 
containing organic HAP stored or treated in tanks. These 
tanks include wastewater treatment tanks. 


2. Containers 


The container emission point type for the off-site 
waste and recovery operations source category represents the 
organic HAP emissions from wastes or recoverable materials 
containing organic HAP stored, treated, or otherwise handled 
in drums, dumpsters, roll-off boxes, trucks, and railcars. 


3. Land Disposal Units 


The land disposal unit emission point type for the 
off-site waste and recovery operations source category 
represents the organic HAP emissions from resulting from the 
disposal of wastes containing organic HAP in surface 
impoundments, landfills, land treatment units, and waste 
piles. 


4. Process Vents 


The process vent emission point type for the off-site 
waste and recovery operations source category represents the 
organic HAP emissions from process vents on enclosed 
treatment processes other than processes which burn the 
waste or recoverable material (e.g., incinerators, boilers, 
furnaces). Examples of enclosed treatment processes 
included in this emission point type are distillation units, 
thin-film evaporators, solvent extraction units, air 
stripping units, and steam stripping units. 


5. Equipment Leaks 


The equipment leak emission point type for the off-site 
waste and recovery operations source category represents the 
organic HAP emissions from gaseous and liquid leaks in 
ancillary equipment used to operate units managing, 
conveying, or handling wastes or recoverable materials. 
This ancillary equipment includes pumps, compressors, 
pressure relief devices, sampling connection systems, 
open-ended valves or lines, valves, flanges and other 
connectors, and product accumulator vessels. 


D. Definition of Source 


To develop a NESHAP, the EPA first defines the source 
category and determines the types of HAP emitted from this 
source category that are to be controlled by establishing 
emission standards. Within a source category, the EPA must 
next decide which of the sources of HAP emissions (i.e., 
emission points or groupings of emission points) are most 
appropriate for establishing separate emission standards in 
the context of the CAA statutory requirements and the 
industry operating practices for the particular source 
category. The EPA considered three options for defining 
``source'' for the off-site waste and recovery operations 
NESHAP.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941013-1-00070 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941013-1-00010 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The first option is to define the source in a very 
broad context as the entire facility. This option was 
rejected by the EPA for the off-site waste and recovery 
operations NESHAP because it would be very difficult to 
apply a single facility-wide emission limitation level for 
MACT to all off-site waste and recovery operations 
facilities for several reasons. First, the mechanism by 
which organic HAP are emitted to the atmosphere and the 
types of air emission controls applicable to reducing these 
emissions vary widely for the emission point types 
identified for off-site waste and recovery operations. For 
example, covers frequently are installed on tanks to control 
air emissions while work practice programs are used to 
control air emissions from equipment leaks. Furthermore, 
not all off-site waste and recovery operations at a 
particular facility may be subject to this rulemaking. As 
previously explained, certain types of waste combustion 
units, landfill units, and other operations are being 
addressed by separate EPA regulatory actions. Finally, some 
waste and recovery operations at a particular facility may 
be dedicated to managing only wastes or recoverable 
materials generated on-site and, thus, would not be subject 
to this rulemaking. 

A second option is to define the source in a more 
narrow context as the entire operation used to manage a 
particular waste or recoverable material from the point 
where the material enters the facility through the point 
where the material exits the facility or, if it is a waste, 
disposed on-site. Under this definition, the source would 
consist of a mix of different types of emission points 
representing the sequence of units in which the waste or 
recoverable material is stored, conveyed, treated, and, in 
some cases, disposed. Under this option, a single emission 
limitation for MACT would be established for the entire 
group of emission points comprising the management sequence 
used to handle the waste or recoverable material. This 
second option for defining sources under the off-site waste 
and recovery operations NESHAP was also rejected by the EPA 
as inappropriate. Unlike manufacturing or production 
processes that produce a specific product, the operations 
used to manage a particular type of waste or recoverable 
material cannot be readily characterized by one or even 
several standardized process configurations which are used 
throughout the industrial segment representing the source 
category. The types, configurations, and sequencing of 
units used for operations handling a particular type of 
waste or recoverable material are not consistent, but 
instead can vary widely from one facility to the next. 
Therefore, the EPA concluded that this option is not an 
appropriate approach for defining sources for the off-site 
waste and recovery operations NESHAP. 

The final option considered by the EPA is to further 
narrow the definition of source to the individual emission 
points identified for the source category (

i.e., 

tanks, 
containers, land disposal units, process vents, and 
equipment leaks). Under this option, an overall emission 
limitation for MACT would be established for each emission 
point type. The EPA believes that this option is the most 
appropriate approach for defining sources for the off-site 
waste and recovery operations NESHAP. This approach defines 
the source in terms of common types of units used at 
off-site waste and recovery operations facilities for 
handling all types of wastes and recoverable materials. 
Also, this approach to defining sources is consistent with 
other EPA air rules for waste and recovery operations. 
Therefore, for the off-site waste and recovery operations 
NESHAP, the EPA is proposing to define the source to be each 
of the individual emission point types. 



E. Determination of MACT Floor 


The statutory requirements under CAA section 112 for 
determination of the MACT floor are explained in 
section II.A of this notice. As explained in section III.C 
of this notice, the off-site waste and recovery operations 
source category contains more than 30 existing sources 
nationwide. Therefore, for the off-site waste and recovery 
operations NESHAP, the MACT floor for existing sources is 
defined the average emission limitation achieved by the best 
performing 12 percent of existing sources. The MACT floor 
for new sources is defined by the emission control that is 
achieved in practice by the best controlled similar source.

1. MACT Floor for Existing Sources


a. Existing Tanks. The MACT floor for existing tanks at off-site waste and recovery operations facilities is determined
to be use of covers on tanks managing wastes or recoverable materials with a VOHAP concentration equal to or greater
than 100 ppmw. This floor determination is based on consideration of data for site-specific tank management practices
reported at 540 of the 710 hazardous waste TSDF and existing EPA air emission standards for tanks.
The EPA's review of its tank data base for the off-site waste and recovery operations source category indicates that
most tanks (significantly more than 12 percent) managing waste or recoverable materials containing organic HAP
are covered tanks. A small portion of these tanks also are reported to use more effective air emission controls such
as venting the tank to a control device or using a floating roof on the tank. However, the higher level of air emission
control achieved by this segment of tanks does not represent the average of the top 12 percent of tanks listed in the
data base. Thus, the EPA determined that the air emission control technology for the existing tank MACT floor is use
of a cover.
For other source categories, the EPA has established the need to use a cover or other air emission controls on a tank
based on a characteristic parameter of the materials placed in the tank. The EPA believes that using this approach
provides an effective and enforceable means for applying air emission controls to those tanks with the potential
for organic air emissions and not requiring the unnecessary installation of controls on tanks with no or little potential
for organic air emissions. Consequently, to complete the definition of the MACT floor for tanks at off-site waste
and recovery operations facilities, an applicability cutoff provision (referred to hereafter in this notice as
an ``action level'') is needed to distinguish the tanks at off-site waste and recovery operations facilities that
need to use air emission controls.
Because of the need to periodically confirm that a material placed in a tank remains below the action level selected
to determine applicability, the indicator parameter must be in a format that is relatively simple to determine by
an affected facility owner or operator and can be expeditiously checked by EPA or State enforcement personnel. Considering
this requirement, the EPA evaluated possible action level formats and decided that an action level format based on
the volatile organic HAP concentration of the materials as determined using EPA Method 305 is appropriate for identifying
those tanks used for off-site waste and recovery operations that are expected to have little or no potential for organic
HAP emissions.

The data available to the EPA at this time for the off-site waste and recovery operations source category are insufficient
to perform a rigorous statistical analysis for the purpose of establishing the minimum VOHAP concentration value
for the wastes or recoverable materials managed in each of the tanks listed in the data base and reported to use air emission
controls. From a qualitative perspective, application of tank air emission controls is not needed when the material
in the tank has little or no potential for organic HAP emissions. In general, these wastes or recoverable materials
can be characterized as materials having low VOHAP concentrations. The EPA considered a range of possible values
to establish the VOHAP concentration limit. Based on consideration of available information regarding the potential
for organic HAP emissions from off-site waste and recovery operations, the EPA concluded that a VOHAP concentration
value of 100 ppmw would best represent the MACT floor for existing tanks required to use air emission controls.
Using a VOHAP concentration value of 100 ppmw also allows owners and operators to use several different methods for
determining the VOHAP concentration of a waste or recoverable material. This is an important factor considering
the diversity of wastes and recoverable materials potentially subject to the off-site waste and recovery operations
NESHAP and the potential interferences of the quantitation limits of certain analytical methods by non-HAP organic
chemicals in the material. Additionally, selection of 100 ppmw would require most existing tanks managing wastes
or recoverable materials having organic HAP emissions to use air emission controls consistent with other EPA regulatory
actions related to off-site waste and recovery operations.
Many waste and recovery operations facilities subject to this regulation will also be subject to other air emission
standards. The EPA is aware that being subject to several standards with differing action levels may create confusion
in the regulated community. To the extent possible within the requirements of the Clean Air Act, the EPA wishes to minimize
discrepancies between the action level in the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP and other emission standards
affecting waste and recovery operations. The EPA therefore requests comment on the 100 ppmw VOHAP concentration
action level, as well as information that can be used to support alternative action levels, such as 500 ppmw. Specifically,
the EPA requests information on action levels for surface impoundments and other land disposal units.
b. Existing Containers. The MACT floor for existing containers at off-site waste and recovery operations facilities
is determined to be the use of covers on containers managing wastes or recoverable materials with a VOHAP concentration
equal to or greater than 100 ppmw. The number and type of containers used to manage organic HAP containing wastes or
recoverable materials at off-site waste and recovery operations vary from site-to-site. Furthermore, at any off-site
waste and recovery operations facility, the number of drums, roll-off boxes, or other containers at the site can often
fluctuate on a weekly or monthly basis depending on the number and origin of new material shipments received at the
facility during a particular week or month. Thus, no data are available to the EPA which allow a statistical determination
of the type of air emission controls used on the average of the top 12 percent of containers located at off-site waste
and recovery operations facilities or the VOHAP concentration of wastes or recoverable materials handled in containers.
Based on existing RCRA rules for containers handling hazardous waste and observations by EPA representatives during
site visits to facilities that manage wastes in containers, the EPA concluded that the average emission limitation
achieved by the best performing 12 percent of containers used to handle wastes and recoverable materials containing
organic HAP is the level of control achieved by the use of covers. Thus, the EPA determined that the air emission control
technology for existing container MACT floor is the use of a cover.
The EPA selected a VOHAP concentration value of 100 ppmw to be the action level for the MACT floor for existing containers
consistent with the level selected for existing tanks. Containers such as drums, tank trucks, roll-off boxes, and
tank rail cars are a primary means used to ship materials to off-site waste and recovery operations facilities. In
many cases, these materials are temporarily stored at the off-site waste and recovery operations facility directly
in the shipping containers or are transferred to tanks or other management units prior to treatment and disposal,
in the case of wastes, or prior to reprocessing and shipment, in the case of recoverable materials. The most volatile
of the organic HAP in a waste or recoverable material will be emitted soon after being exposed to the atmosphere. If
containers at the off-site waste and recovery operations facility are not controlled to the same level required of
tanks, a significant portion of the organic HAP in the waste or recoverable material will be emitted before the material
is transferred to the controlled tanks or other controlled management units. Consequently, the organic HAP emission
reduction effectiveness of applying air emission controls on downstream tanks and other management units would
be significantly diminished since a significant portion of the organic HAP in the waste or recoverable material had
already escaped to the atmosphere from open containers.

c. Existing Land Disposal Units. The MACT floor for existing land disposal units at off-site waste and recovery operations
facilities is determined to be no disposal of wastes that contain equal to or greater than 100 ppmw VOHAP concentration
in open land disposal units. No data are available to the EPA which allow a statistical determination of the type of
air emission controls used on the top 12 percent of land disposal units located at off-site waste and recovery operations
facilities or the VOHAP concentration of the wastes disposed of in these units. However, since most of the facilities
operating land disposal units included in the off-site waste and recovery operations source category are also hazardous
waste TSDF, many of the land disposal units are subject to treatment standards under the RCRA land disposal restrictions
(LDR) codified in 40 CFR part 268.
The LDR treatment standards require hazardous waste TSDF owners and operators to treat certain types of hazardous
waste to reduce the toxicity or mobility of specific chemicals contained in the waste before the owner or operator
can place the waste in a surface impoundment, land treatment unit, landfill, or wastepile. The treatment standards
of the RCRA LDR are established by requiring treatment below constituent specific concentration limits that vary
by type of hazardous waste or by requiring use of specific treatment processes. Many of the chemicals for which LDR
treatment standards have been established are also listed as HAP. Thus, the EPA determined that the air emission control
technology for the existing land disposal unit MACT floor is treatment of wastes to remove or destroy organic HAP in
the waste prior to placing the waste in the land disposal unit.
Treatment of the waste to reduce the organic HAP concentration to a level of 100 ppmw was selected for the MACT floor
for existing land disposal units based on the same reasoning used in determining the MACT floors determined for existing
tanks and containers (i.e., to distinguish those units with little or no potential to emit organic HAP). The degree
of air emission control achieved by placing a waste with a VOHAP concentration above 100 ppmw in tanks and containers
using air emission controls would be lost if these wastes are ultimately allowed to be placed in land disposal units
without first removing or destroying the organic HAP to a level consistent with the level used to apply air emission
controls to tanks and containers.
d. Existing Process Vents. The MACT floor for process vents used on treatment processes subject to the off-site waste
and recovery operations NESHAP is determined to be application of air emission controls on each affected process
used to treat wastes or recoverable materials with a VOHAP concentration equal to or greater than 100 ppmw as determined
at the point where the material enters the facility. All process vents on an affected process are to be connected through
a closed-vent system to a control device with a minimum 95 percent organic HAP emission control efficiency.
As previously explained, most facilities in the off-site waste and recovery operations source category are also
hazardous waste TSDF. Distillation, fractionation, thin-film evaporation, solvent extraction, and stripping
processes that are treating hazardous waste at these TSDF are subject to the existing RCRA air emission standards
for process vents under 40 CFR 264 subpart AA and 40 CFR 265 subpart AA (hereafter referred to in this notice as the ``subpart
AA rules''). The EPA concluded that it is not appropriate to directly transfer the air emission control requirements
of the subpart AA rules to the MACT floor for the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP. Instead, this MACT
floor is based on adapting, to the extent applicable and relevant, the air emission control requirements of the subpart
AA rules.
The subpart AA rules require a TSDF owner or operator to identify all process vents associated with distillation,
fractionation, thin-film evaporation, solvent extraction, and stripping processes that are treating hazardous
waste having an annual average total organic concentration equal to or greater than 10 ppmw (i.e., vents affected
by the subpart AA rules). Total organic emission rates for each affected vent and for the entire facility from all affected
vents must be determined. The total facility process vent emission rate must then be compared to two specified emission
rate limits (3 pounds of total organic emission per hour and 3.1 tons of total organic emission per year) to determine
whether the owner or operator must use additional air emission controls for the affected vents. If the total facility
process vent emission rate exceeds either of the specified emission limits, then the owner or operator is required
to implement control measures that will reduce total facility process vent organic emissions to below both of the
emission limit levels, or to install air emission controls to reduce total facility process vent organic emissions
by at least 95 weight percent.

Adopting a 10 ppmw action level for the process vent MACT floor corresponding to the 10 ppmw total organic concentration
value used for subpart AA rules was considered by the EPA but determined not to be appropriate. The 10 ppmw value used
for the subpart AA rule is not the sole regulatory criterion (i.e., action level) by which the need to apply air emission
controls to affected vents is determined. The need to apply controls under the subpart AA rules is determined by the
total organic emission rates for each affected vent and for the entire facility from all affected vents. The data available
to the EPA at this time for the off-site waste and recovery operations source category are insufficient to correlate
a VOHAP concentration action level value equivalent to the total organic emission rate limits used for the subpart
AA rules. Consequently, the EPA relied on a qualitative assessment to select a VOHAP concentration action level which
would exclude those treatment processes having little or no potential for organic HAP emissions. A VOHAP concentration
action level of 100 ppmw was selected for the MACT floor for existing process vents consistent with the rationale used
to select the action level for tanks, containers, and land disposal units.
e. Existing Equipment Leaks. The MACT floor for equipment leaks is determined to be control of emissions from leaks
in ancillary equipment containing or contacting wastes or recoverable materials with total organic HAP concentrations
equal to or greater than 10 percent by implementing leak detection and repair (LDAR) work practices and equipment
modifications. Most off-site waste and recovery operations facilities are also hazardous waste TSDF. Thus, ancillary
equipment operated at these facilities to treat hazardous waste are subject to the existing RCRA organic air emission
standards for TSDF equipment leaks (40 CFR 264 subpart BB and 40 CFR 265 subpart BB). These standards require implementation
of a LDAR program and modifications to certain types of ancillary equipment operated at the facility that handle hazardous
waste having a total organic concentration equal to or greater than 10 percent. The LDAR and equipment requirements
are consistent with existing NSPS process equipment leak standards promulgated by the EPA under CAA section 111 (i.e.,
40 CFR 60 subparts VV, GG, and KK) and for certain NESHAP process equipment leak standards promulgated under CAA section
112 (i.e., 40 CFR 61 subpart V).


2. MACT Floor for New Sources


The MACT floor for new sources is identical to the MACT floors determined by the EPA for existing sources with the exception
of the MACT floor for new tanks and new containers. For the emission point types other than tanks or containers, the
MACT floor determined for existing sources also represents the emission control that is achieved in practice by the
best controlled similar source.
a. New Tanks. The MACT floor for new tanks is determined to be use of a cover vented to a control device that reduces organic
HAP emissions by 95 percent (or equivalent floating roof technology) for those new tanks in which the organic HAP vapor
pressure of the waste in the tank is equal to or greater than 0.1 kPa (approximately 0.07 psi). This is the level of emission
control that is required for new tanks under the Hazardous Organic NESHAP (40 CFR 63 subpart G). The EPA concluded that
these types of emission controls represent the emission control level achieved in practice by the best controlled
sources similar to the types of new tanks anticipated by the EPA to be built at off-site waste and recovery operations
facilities and used for management of wastes or recoverable materials containing organic HAP.
b. New Containers. The MACT floor for new containers is determined to be the use of covers and submerged loading for
containers in which waste or recoverable material is placed having a VOHAP concentration equal to or greater than
100 ppmw. The EPA's review of its container data base for the off-site waste and recovery operations source category
indicates that some existing TSDF owners and operators (but significantly less than 12 percent) reported using submerged
fill to load material containing organic HAP into containers.

F. Selection of Regulatory Alternatives 



1. Regulatory Alternatives for Existing Sources 



Different regulatory alternatives for control of 
organic HAP emissions from existing sources at off-site 
waste and recovery operations facilities were defined. One 
regulatory alternative was defined by combining the MACT 
floor determinations for each of the five emission point 
types (labeled ``Regulatory Alternative 1''). Four additional 
regulatory alternatives for the off-site waste and recovery 
operations source category were defined which would provide 
increasingly greater amounts of total organic HAP emission 
reduction from the baseline level of organic HAP emissions 
(labeled ``Regulatory Alternative 2'' through ``Regulatory 
Alternative 5''). Additional organic HAP emission control 
requirements were added to the controls defined for Regulatory Alternative 1 in order of increasing emission control
incremental cost effectiveness. 

Regulatory Alternative 1 requires application of air 
emission controls on tanks, containers, and treatment 
processes managing waste or recoverable material with a 
VOHAP concentration equal to or greater than 100 ppmw as 
determined at the point of where the material first enters 
the facility. For tank and container emission points, 
Regulatory Alternative 1 requires use of a cover on each 
unit. For process vent emission points, Regulatory 
Alternative 1 requires connecting the process vent to a 
control device that reduces organic HAP emissions by 
95 percent. For land disposal unit emission points, 
Regulatory Alternative 1 requires treatment of the wastes 
prior to disposal to reduce the waste VOHAP concentration to 
less than 100 ppmw. For equipment leak emission points, 
Regulatory Alternative 1 requires for equipment handling 
waste or recoverable material streams with a total organic 
HAP concentration equal to or greater than 10 percent 
implementation of a leak detection and repair (LDAR) program 
and certain equipment modifications. The requirements of 
the LDAR program and equipment modifications are consistent 
with the existing NSPS process equipment leak standards 
promulgated by the EPA under CAA section 111 (i.e., 40 CFR 
60 subparts VV, GG, and KK) and for certain NESHAP process 
equipment leak standards promulgated under CAA section 112 
(i.e., 40 CFR 61 subpart V). 

Regulatory Alternative 2 adds additional control 
requirements for containers. The control requirements for 
the other emission points remain the same as for Regulatory 
Alternative 1. In addition to using covers on containers, 
Regulatory Alternative 2 requires use of submerged fill when 
wastes or recoverable materials are transferred into 
containers by pumping. 

Regulatory Alternative 3 adds additional control 
requirements for tanks. The control requirements for the 
other emission points remain the same as for Regulatory 
Alternative 2. Tanks in which the organic HAP vapor pressure 
of the waste or recoverable material in the tank is equal to 
or greater than 5.2 kPa (approximately 0.75 psi) are 
required to use a cover and be vented to a control device 
that reduces organic HAP emissions by 95 percent. Tanks in 
which the organic HAP vapor pressure of the waste or 
recoverable material in the tank is less than 5.2 kPa use a 
cover without additional controls (i.e., a cover only 
without being vented to a control device). 

Regulatory Alternative 4 changes the LDAR program 
requirements for the equipment leak emission point category. 
The control requirements for the other emission points 
remain the same as for Regulatory Alternative 3. For 
Regulatory Alternative 4, the LDAR program would be 
conducted in accordance with procedures consistent with the 
Hazardous Organic NESHAP (HON) promulgated by the EPA under 
40 CFR 63 subpart H.

Regulatory Alternative 5 lowers the organic HAP vapor 
pressure level for tanks required to be vented to a control 
device. The control requirements for the other emission 
points remain the same as for Regulatory Alterative 4. 
Tanks in which the organic HAP vapor pressure of the waste 
or recoverable material in the tank is equal to or greater 
than 0.7 kPa (approximately 0.1 psi) use a cover and are 
vented to a control device that reduces organic HAP 
emissions by 95 percent. Tanks in which the organic HAP 
vapor pressure of the waste or recoverable material in the 
tank is less than 0.7 kPa use a cover without additional 
controls. 



2. Regulatory Alternatives for New Sources 



Based on current waste management trends, the EPA 
expects very few, if any, new off-site waste and recovery 
operations facilities to be built in the foreseeable future. 
A more likely scenario is construction of new units (such as 
tanks or treatment units) at existing off-site waste and 
recovery operations facilities to expand facility capacity, 
replace existing surface impoundments, or add new treatment 
capability or expand treatment capacity. However, the 
available information to the EPA is insufficient to make 
projections of the numbers or types of new sources to be 
built during the next 5 years. 

A regulatory alternative representing the MACT floor 
for new sources at off-site waste and recovery operations 
facilities was defined by combining the MACT floor 
determinations for new sources. No regulatory alternatives 
beyond the MACT floor were identified for new sources. 

The regulatory alternative for new sources requires 
application of air emission controls on tanks, containers, 
and treatment processes managing waste or recoverable 
material with a VOHAP concentration equal to or greater than 
100 ppmw as determined at the point where the material first 
enters the facility. For tank emission points, tanks in 
which the organic HAP vapor pressure of the waste or 
recoverable material in the tank is equal to or greater than 
0.7 kPa are required to use a cover and be vented to a 
control device that reduces organic HAP emissions by 
95 percent (or equivalent floating roof technology). Tanks 
in which the organic HAP vapor pressure of the waste or 
recoverable material in the tank is less than 0.7 kPa use a 
cover without additional controls (i.e., a cover only 
without being vented to a control device). For container 
emission points, the regulatory alternative requires use of 
a cover on each unit and use of submerged fill when wastes 
or recoverable materials are transferred into containers by 
pumping. For process vent emission points, the regulatory 
alternative requires connecting the process vent to a 
control device that reduces organic HAP emissions by 
95 percent. For land disposal unit emission points, the 
regulatory alternative requires treatment of the wastes 
prior to disposal to reduce the waste VOHAP concentration to 
less than 100 ppmw. For equipment leak emission points, the 
regulatory alternative requires a implementation of a LDAR 
program and certain equipment modifications specified under 
the existing for ancillary equipment handling waste or 
recoverable material streams with a total organic HAP 
concentration equal to or greater than 10 percent. The 
equipment leak requirements are consistent with the existing 
NSPS process equipment leak standards. 



G. Regulatory Alternative Impacts 



The EPA developed estimates of the impacts associated 
with each of the regulatory alternatives for existing 
sources. As explained in the preceding section, no impacts 
were estimated for the regulatory alternatives for new 
sources because of difficulty in projecting the numbers and 
types of new sources likely to be built over the next 
5 years. 



1. Overview of Impacts Estimation Methodology 



In developing NESHAP and other air standards, the EPA 
frequently uses a model plant approach for comparing 
alternative control options. However, for the off-site 
waste and recovery operations source category, it is 
difficult to adequately characterize the source category 
using a selection of several representative model plants 
because, for many of the facilities in the source category, 
the quantities and characteristics of wastes and recoverable 
materials received at the facility are highly variable and 
can change often (as frequently as on a day-to-day basis). 
In addition, many different waste management unit and 
recoverable material reprocessing unit configurations are 
used at off-site waste and recovery operations facilities to 
manage these ever changing materials. Consequently, the EPA 
decided a model plant approach is not appropriate for 
estimating control option impacts for the off-site waste and 
recovery operations source category.

<TEXT>
 

Instead of using a model plant approach for the off-site waste and recovery operations source category, the EPA decided
to adapt a computer model developed by the Agency to estimate nationwide organic air emission impacts from RCRA hazardous
waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities (TSDF). As explained in section III of this notice, the EPA estimates
that approximately 90 percent of the nationwide organic HAP emissions for the off-site waste and recovery operations
source category occur from hazardous waste TSDF. Consequently, the EPA considers adapting this computer model to
be appropriate for evaluating alternative control options for the off-site waste and recovery operations source
category. 

The primary sources of site-specific waste data used as input to the computer model are two comprehensive nationwide
surveys that the EPA Office of Solid Waste (OSW) conducted in 1987: the National Survey of Hazardous Waste Generators
(referred to hereafter as the ``GENSUR''); and the National Survey of Hazardous Waste Treatment, Storage, Disposal,
and Recycling Facilities (referred to hereafter as the ``TSDR Survey''). These data represent waste quantities,
waste compositions, and waste management practices at hazardous waste TSDF in 1986, and are the most recent nationwide
TSDF waste data available to the EPA on a consistent, industry-wide basis. 

The data base indicates that 710 TSDF received wastes and recoverable materials from off-site waste generators in
1986. The EPA adapted its computer model to simulate the waste management processes reported in the TSDR Survey to
be operating at each of these TSDF. Organic HAP emission factors and emission control cost factors are assigned to
each waste management process using one (or in many cases a combination of several) of the model units developed for
the TSDF RCRA air rule projects. Further details regarding the emission estimation methodology are provided in the
BID for this proposed rulemaking. 

The EPA is aware that some waste management practices have changed since the data were collected for the GENSUR and
TSDR Survey because of new EPA regulations promulgated since 1986 (

e.g.

, the RCRA land disposal restrictions) as well as changes implemented by the waste management industry. To address
these changes in the definition of the baseline used for this rulemaking, assumptions were applied in the computer
model to better reflect current industry-wide waste management trends (

e.g.

, conversion of surface impoundments to tanks, treatment of certain wastes prior to or as an alternative to land disposal).
Additional assumptions were made to simulate the implementation of the different regulatory alternatives in the
computer model. These assumptions are described in further detail in the BID for this proposed rulemaking. 



2. Regulatory Baseline 



For the purpose of evaluating the relative organic emission reduction effectiveness of different regulatory alternatives,
the EPA defines a ``baseline'' as a reference point from which each regulatory alternative can be compared. The baseline
represents the estimated level of organic emissions from the source category that would occur in the absence of implementing
any of the regulatory alternatives. For the off-site waste and recovery operations source category, the EPA chose
a baseline which would reflect the level of organic emissions for each emission point type following implementation
of air emission controls required by federally enforceable air regulations in effective as of July 1991. The EPA defined
the baseline to consist of the following regulations: (1) RCRA organic air emission standards for TSDF process vents
(40 CFR 264 subpart AA and 40 CFR 265 subpart AA); (2) RCRA organic air emission standards for TSDF equipment leaks (40
CFR 264 subpart BB and 40 CFR 265 subpart BB); (3) RCRA land disposal restrictions (40 CFR part 268); and (4) NESHAP for
benzene waste operations (40 CFR 61 subpart FF). 



3. Organic Emissions Impacts 



The EPA estimated organic HAP emission reductions that would be achieved if air rules based on each of the five regulatory
alternatives were implemented. Baseline organic HAP emissions are estimated to be approximately 52,000 Mg/yr.
The organic HAP emissions assuming implementation of the individual regulatory alternatives are estimated to be
approximately: 28,000 Mg/yr for Regulatory Alternative 1, 23,000 Mg/yr for Regulatory Alternative 2, 9,000 Mg/yr
for Regulatory Alternative 3, 9,000 Mg/yr for Regulatory Alternative 4, and 8,000 Mg/yr for Regulatory Alternative
5.

4. Other Environmental and Energy Impacts 



The primary source of other environmental and energy impacts is expected to result from the operation of control devices
used to remove or destroy organics in captured vapor streams. Electric motor-driven fans, blowers, or pumps, depending
on the type of control device, are used for operations such as moving the captured organic vapors to the control device,
circulating cooling water through a condenser, or pumping recovered liquids to an accumulation tank. Generation
of the electricity to operate the control device often requires burning of fuel in an electric utility power plant
which produces air emissions, wastewater discharges, and solid wastes. When carbon adsorption systems are used,
the organic HAP removed from the vapor stream are adsorbed on the activated carbon in the control device. Once the carbon
becomes saturated with organics, it must be regenerated or disposed of in a landfill. Regeneration of the carbon requires
steam. Producing this steam in a boiler creates both secondary air and energy impacts. Disposal of the spent carbon
produces a solid waste impact. 



5. Control Cost Impacts 



Total capital investment (TCI) cost represents the cost to facility owners and operators to purchase and install
air emission control equipment. The TCI costs in 1991 dollars to implement each of the regulatory alternatives is
estimated to be approximately: $11 million for Regulatory Alternative 1, $14 million for Regulatory Alternative
2, $49 million for Regulatory Alternative 3, $57 million for Regulatory Alternative 4, and $78 million for Regulatory
Alternative 5. 

Total annual cost represents the total cost to facility owners and operators each year to: Operate and maintain the
air emission controls required by the proposed rule; perform the inspection, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting
required by the proposed rule; and repay the capital investment for the air emission controls. The capital recovery
was estimated using an interest rate of 7 percent applied over a period ranging from 10 to 20 years depending on the expected
service life for each type of air emission control equipment. The total annual cost to implement each of the regulatory
alternatives is estimated to be approximately: $4.7 million per year for Regulatory Alternative 1, $5.2 million
per year for Regulatory Alternative 2, $24.5 million per year for Regulatory Alternative 3, $26.1 million per year
for Regulatory Alternative 4, and $36.3 million per year for Regulatory Alternative 5. 



6. Economic Impact Analysis 



The EPA performed an economic impact analysis using a model that simulates 60 separate waste disposal markets and
then estimates facility and market responses to the costs of implementing the requirements of the proposed rule.
All dollar amounts for prices and costs were adjusted to reflect 1991 dollars. The EPA made no projections of new off-site
waste and recovery operations that would be affected by the proposed rule.

<TEXT>
 

Complying with the proposed rule will increase the costs of providing services at off-site waste and recovery operations
facilities. The magnitude of the cost increases would vary from facility to facility depending on factors such as
the types of wastes or recoverable materials received, the types of waste or recovery operations performed, the number
and types of emission points for each of these operations, and the level of emission control already in place at the
facility. Cost increases would lead to some price increases, and possibly reduced profits for some firms in the business.


The proposed rule is likely to affect prices charged in almost all of the 60 markets studied, although many markets
are likely to experience very small changes or none at all. The most severely affected market (in percentage terms)
may experience a price increase in excess of 70 percent. The greatest absolute increase in price would be an increase
of $500 per Mg of waste, which would be a 30 percent increase. The greatest decrease in quantity would be 375 Mg of waste.
Overall, the quantity of off-site waste managed at the 700-plus facilities in the data base used for the economic impact
analysis would decrease by slightly over 1,600 Mg, or about 0.009 percent of the estimated 19 million Mg of waste managed.


The EPA's analysis assumed that owners of affected facilities would respond to this rule by either installing and
operating the required air emission control equipment, discontinuing specific individual waste or recovery operations
affected by the rule, or closing the entire facility. The EPA projects that although 100 individual waste and recovery
operations located at a number of facilities could shut down as a result of this proposed rule, only about 10 entire
facilities would close. 

A number of decisions made by the EPA regarding the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP rulemaking since
the completion of the economic impact analysis change the costs to comply with the rule for some individual waste or
recovery operations at a particular facility from the costs used for the economic impact analysis. The compliance
costs for some of these individual operations would increase while for other individual operations the costs would
decrease depending on site-specific factors. However on a facility-wide basis, the EPA expects that the total cost
to comply with the requirements of the proposed rule for most of individual off-site waste and recovery operations
facilities listed in the data base to be about the same as the total individual facility compliance costs used for the
economic impact analysis described above. Thus, the EPA believes that the results of this analysis are representative
of the overall economic impacts of the proposed rule.

V. Selection of Basis for Proposed Rule 



A. Selection of Regulatory Alternative for Existing Sources 



To select one of the five regulatory alternatives to serve as the basis for the proposed standards for existing sources,
the EPA evaluated the organic HAP emission reductions, control costs, economic impacts, and other environmental
and energy impacts associated with implementing the air emission controls under each regulatory alternative. Based
on this evaluation, the EPA selected Regulatory Alternative 3 as the basis for the standards proposed for existing
sources. 

Regulatory Alternative 1, the MACT floor, is estimated to reduce nationwide organic HAP emissions by approximately
24,000 Mg/yr. Regulatory Alternative 2 is estimated to reduce nationwide organic HAP emissions by approximately
29,000 Mg/yr. Substantially higher organic HAP emission reductions beyond those estimated for Regulatory Alternatives
1 and 2 are estimated to be achieved by either Regulatory Alternative 3, 4, or 5. All three of these regulatory alternatives
are estimated to achieve similar levels of organic HAP emission reduction from the regulatory baseline. Nationwide
organic HAP emission reductions are estimated to be 43,000 Mg/yr for Regulatory Alternative 3, 43,000 Mg/yr for Regulatory
Alternative 4, and 44,000 Mg/yr for Regulatory Alternative 5. 

The highest level of nationwide organic HAP emission reduction would be achieved by selecting either Regulatory
Alternative 3, 4, or 5 as the basis for the standards for existing sources. The estimated control cost estimates for
Regulatory Alternatives 4 and 5 are higher than the estimated costs for Regulatory Alternative 3. Because Regulatory
Alternative 3 would provide essentially the same level of nationwide organic HAP emission reduction for a lower cost,
Regulatory Alternatives 4 and 5 were eliminated from further consideration as the basis for the proposed standards.


The EPA may set standards that are more stringent than the MACT floor if such standards are achievable considering
the cost, environmental, and other impacts listed in CAA section 112(d)(2). Based on the information available to
the EPA at this time, the only difference in these cost, environmental, and other impacts that the EPA can distinguish
between Regulatory Alternatives 1, 2, and 3 is related to the estimated nationwide costs of controls required by each
of these regulatory alternatives. 

The total nationwide annual cost estimated to implement controls under either Regulatory Alternative 1 or 2 is approximately
the same ($4.7 million per year for Regulatory Alternative 1 versus $5.2 million per year for Regulatory Alternative
2). The total nationwide annual cost estimated to implement controls under Regulatory Alternative 3 is significantly
higher ($24.5 million per year). However, given the additional 19,000 Mg/yr of nationwide organic HAP emission reduction
that is estimated to be achieved over Regulatory Alternative 1 and the additional 14,000 Mg/yr of nationwide organic
HAP emission reduction that is estimated to be achieved over Regulatory Alternative 2, the EPA concluded that the
additional cost of implementing controls under Regulatory Alternative 3 is reasonable and justifiable. Thus, the
EPA selected Regulatory Alternative 3 as the basis for the proposed standards for existing sources. 



B. Selection of Regulatory Alternative for New Sources 



No regulatory alternatives beyond the MACT floor were identified for new sources. Thus, the MACT floor for new sources
is the basis for the control requirements proposed for new sources. 



C. Selection of Format for Proposed Rule 



Section 112 of the CAA requires that emission standards for control of HAP be established unless it is the Administrator's
judgement that emission standards cannot be established or enforced for a particular type of source. Formats for
emission standards include percent reduction, concentration limits, or a mass emission limit. Section 112(h)(2)
identifies two conditions under which it is not feasible to establish an emission standard: (1) If the pollutants
cannot be emitted through a conveyance designed and constructed to emit or capture the pollutant; or (2) if the application
of measurement technology to a particular class of sources is not practicable because of technology and economic
limitations. In these cases, the EPA may instead establish design, equipment, work practice, or operational standards,
or a combination thereof.

The NESHAP proposed today for the off-site waste and 
recovery operations source category are a combination of 
emission standards and equipment, design, work practice, and 
operational standards. Whenever feasible, emission 
standards have been proposed. However, in some cases, 
emission limitations would not adequately ensure that the 
maximum emission reductions required by the standards are 
achieved. In those cases, a combination of equipment, 
design, work practice, and operational standards have been 
determined by the EPA to be equivalent to the emission 
standards proposed today. 



D. Selection of Test Procedures and Compliance Procedures 



Under the proposed rule, determination of the VOHAP 
concentration would not be required for materials placed in 
units that use air emission controls in accordance with the 
requirements of the rule. To determine whether a particular 
waste or recoverable material may be placed in a unit 
subject to the rule but not using the required air emission 
controls, the owner or operator would be required to conduct 
initial and periodic determinations of the material VOHAP 
concentration. The proposed rule would allow the owner or 
operator to directly measure the VOHAP concentration by 
analyzing samples of the material or to use knowledge of the 
waste or recoverable material. 



E. Selection of Monitoring and Inspection Requirements 



1. Air Emission Control Equipment



Control devices used to comply with the proposed 
percent reduction or concentration limit need to be properly 
operated and maintained if the standards are to be achieved 
on a long term basis. Continuous monitoring of the control 
device operation provides a means to help ensure that the 
control device remains in compliance with the applicable 
emission standard. The EPA considered two monitoring 
options for this NESHAP; (1) the use of continuous 
emissions monitoring (CEM) systems; and (2) the use of 
monitors that measure operating parameters which can be 
directly related to the emission control performance of a 
particular control device. 

The organic HAP emissions from off-site waste and 
recovery operations which would be vented to control devices 
under this NESHAP typically are not composed of a single or 
a few specific organic HAP chemicals. Rather, these 
emissions are more likely to be composed of a mixture of 
many different organic HAP chemicals because of the varying 
compositions of the wastes or recoverable materials received 
at off-site waste and recovery operations facilities. As a 
general rule, CEM systems that uses gas chromatography to 
measure individual gaseous organic HAP compound chemicals 
are not practical for applications where the number of 
organic HAP chemicals to be monitored exceeds five (see 
proposed PS 101 and 102, Appendix A of 40 CFR part 64, 
October 22, 1993 at 58 FR 54648). Therefore for many 
off-site waste and recovery operations applications, a CEM 
system is not currently commercially available which can 
measure total organic HAP for the specific set of organic 
HAP chemicals selected for regulation under the off-site 
waste and recovery operations NESHAP. 

A possible alternative would be to use a CEM system to 
measure total VOC or total hydrocarbons (THC) as surrogate 
for total organic HAP. However, the EPA concluded that 
requiring monitoring based on this alternative is not 
appropriate for this rulemaking. Current CEM systems that 
measure VOC emissions operate by flame ionization detection 
(FID), photoionization detection (PID), non-dispersive 
infrared (NDIR) absorption, or other detection principles 
that respond to VOC levels. These CEM systems provide a 
measure of the relative concentration level of a mixture of 
organic chemicals, rather than a quantification of the 
organic species present (

i.e.

, the total VOC measurement 
device will have a different instrument response for 
different organic chemicals). While CEM systems would 
provide an adequate measure of compliance, monitoring 
control device operating parameters (as described below) is 
common practice and provides at least an equivalent measure 
of control device performance. 

Based on the reasons explained above, the EPA rejected 
requiring the use of CEM systems for the off-site waste and 
recovery operations NESHAP. Instead, the EPA selected 
monitoring of control device operating parameters indicative 
of air emission control performance as the most appropriate 
approach to monitoring for the off-site waste and recovery 
operations NESHAP source category. However, the proposed 
rule would not preclude owners or operators choosing to use 
a CEM system to comply with the rule's monitoring 
requirements for those cases where it is possible to do so. 

The proposed off-site waste and recovery operations 
NESHAP specifies the types of parameters that can be 
monitored for common types of control devices. These 
parameters were selected because they are good indicators of 
control device performance and instrumentation is available 
at a reasonable cost to monitor these parameters 
continuously. The proposed rule also would provide 
provisions under which an owner or operator could be 
approved, on a case-by-case basis, to monitor parameters not 
specifically listed in the rule.

<DOCNO> FR941013-1-00082 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941013-1-00010 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Under the proposed rule, each individual owner or 
operator would establish on a site-specific basis minimum or 
maximum operating parameter values, as appropriate for the 
type of parameter monitored, that the control device must 
not exceed to remain in compliance with the emission 
standards. These site-specific operating parameter values 
could be established through either performance tests, 
control device design analysis, or manufacturer's 
recommendations. The established operating parameter values 
for each control device would be incorporated in the 
operating permit issued for a facility (or, in the absence 
of an operating permit, the established levels would be 
directly enforceable) and would be used to determine a 
facility's compliance status. Excursions outside the 
established operating parameter values would be considered 
violations of the applicable emission standard except when 
the excursion is caused by a startup, shutdown, or 
malfunction that meets the criteria specified in the Part 63 
general provisions (40 CFR 63 subpart A). 

The proposed NESHAP does not require monitoring of any 
of the following boilers or process heaters when used as a 
control device to comply with the requirements of the rule: 
(1) Boilers and process heaters with a heat capacity equal 
to or greater than 44 megawatts (approximately 150 million 
Btu/hr); (2) boilers or process heaters with a heat capacity 
less than 44 MW that introduces the vent stream as a primary 
fuel or mixes it with the primary fuel; or (3) boilers or 
process heaters with a heat capacity less than 44 MW that 
introduces the vent stream through the same burner. The EPA 
concluded that the specific range of temperatures and 
residence times for these types of combustion units which 
facility operators must continuously maintain to meet their 
facility process heat or steam demands will ensure 
compliance with the control device standards without the 
need for monitoring. 

Continuous monitoring is not feasible for those 
emission points required to comply with certain equipment 
standards and work practice standards (

e.g.

, tanks equipped 
with only covers, pumps and valves subject to LDAR 
programs). In such cases, failure to install and maintain 
the required equipment or properly implement the LDAR 
program would constitute a violation of the applicable 
equipment or work practice standard. 

The EPA request comments on the proposed approach for 
determination of control device compliance based on 
continuous operating parameter monitoring. 



2. Treatment Processes 



Under the proposed off-site waste and recovery 
operations NESHAP, wastes or recoverable materials having 
VOHAP concentrations of 100 ppmw or more must be treated to 
remove or destroy organic HAP in accordance with standards 
specified in the rule before the material can be placed in 
certain management units. Like the control devices used for 
organic HAP emission control, the treatment processes used 
to comply with these standards (i.e., minimum percent HAP 
reduction, VOHAP concentration limits, required HAP mass 
removal levels) need to be properly operated and maintained 
if the standards are to be achieved on a long-term basis. 
Therefore, the EPA is proposing to require monitoring of 
operating parameters for the treatment processes used to 
comply with the rule requirements. 

Analogous to the monitoring approach that the EPA is 
proposing for control devices, the EPA would prefer that 
each owner or operator establish on a site-specific basis 
minimum or maximum operating parameter values, as 
appropriate, for the treatment process that the owner or 
operator must not exceed to remain in compliance with the 
standards. To implement this approach for treatment 
processes, monitoring methods are needed that will be 
sufficiently representative, accurate, precise, reliable, 
frequent, and timely to determine whether a deviation occurs 
and therefore to certify whether compliance is continuous or 
intermittent. The EPA has identified for some types of 
treatment process, such as steam stripping, operating 
parameters that can be continuously monitored and recorded 
which directly relate to the treatment process performance. 
The EPA requests comments on establishing monitoring 
requirements for treatment processes that can be used to 
determine compliance with the proposed standards based on 
continuous operating parameter monitoring. The EPA further 
requests comment on establishing an option within the 
regulation for specific default values for treatment process 
operating parameters, in the event that owners or operators 
would rather not establish their own minimum or maximum 
operating parameter values.

F. Selection of Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements 



Under CAA section 114(a), the EPA may require any owner 
or operator of a source subject to a NESHAP to establish and 
maintain records as well as prepare and submit notifications 
and reports to the EPA. General recordkeeping and reporting 
requirements for all NESHAP are specified in the Part 63 
general provisions (40 CFR 63.9 and 40 CFR 63.10). All 
recordkeeping and reporting requirements were selected for 
the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP to be 
consistent with these Part 63 general provisions 
requirements. 



G. Emissions Averaging 



Emissions averaging is an approach used by the EPA for 
certain other NESHAP rulemakings when the average level of 
emissions from individual facilities in the source category 
remains relatively predictable over extended periods of 
time. Application of this approach allows a facility owner 
or operator to obtain emission credits by reducing emissions 
from specific emission points at the facility to a level 
less than that required by the rule. These emission credits 
can then be used to offset emission debits created at those 
emission points at the facility that are not controlled to 
the level required by the rule. Under the EPA's emissions 
averaging policy, a facility owner or operator must 
demonstrate that the overall emissions average determined 
for the facility will not result in greater risk or hazard 
to human health or the environment than would occur by 
complying with the rule requirements at each individual 
emission point. 

During the development of the proposed rule for the 
off-site waste and recovery operations source category, the 
EPA considered including an emissions averaging approach. 
However, the statutory requirements of the CAA do not allow 
emissions averaging between different sources. As explained 
in section II.D of this notice, the EPA is proposing the 
source for the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP 
to be each emission point type (e.g., each tank, container). 
Thus, using a facility-wide emissions averaging approach 
(i.e., establishing a single average organic HAP emission 
level for the entire facility) is not appropriate for the 
off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP. 

Furthermore, independent of the definition of source 
that the EPA selects for this rulemaking, the nature of 
day-to-day operations at off-site waste and recovery 
operations facilities complicates and discourages the 
application of an emissions averaging approach to this 
NESHAP. At an off-site waste and recovery operations 
facility, wastes or recoverable materials are often received 
from many different generators. The quantities of materials 
received from these generators can vary from very small 
amounts (

e.g.

, a single 55-gallon drum of a particular waste 
or recoverable material) to very large amounts (

e.g.

, 
multiple truck or railcar loads of a single material type). 
Consequently, the quantities of waste or recoverable 
material received as well as the compositions and 
concentrations of organic HAP in these materials are 
constantly changing over short periods of time (

i.e.

, daily, 
weekly). On a given day an off-site waste and recovery 
operations facility can receive wastes or recoverable 
materials from one group of generators and the next day the 
facility can receive new wastes or recoverable materials 
from a completely different group of generators. Because of 
this operating mode, it is difficult to predict the 
quantities and organic HAP characteristics of the waste or 
recoverable materials that will be received at an off-site 
waste and recovery operations facility over a future period 
of time. Thus, operating the off-site waste and recovery 
operations facility so not to exceed a specific overall 
average organic HAP emissions level would require the owner 
or operator to rigorously monitor and regulate the flow of 
wastes and recoverable materials into the facility 
throughout the entire averaging period used to determine the 
specified average emissions limit. This would require 
sampling each load of incoming material, updating the 
emissions averaging calculations, and possibly restricting 
quantities of waste or recoverable material with certain 
organic HAP compositions that enter the facility during the 
remainder of the averaging period to ensure the facility 
does not exceed the specific average organic HAP emissions 
limit. The EPA believes this would be a complex and 
resource intensive task for off-site waste and recovery 
operations facility owners and operators to implement and 
for regulatory agency personnel to monitor and enforce. 

The EPA decided not to allow emissions averaging in the 
proposed rule for the off-site waste and recovery operations 
source category because such an approach is not appropriate 
for this source category. The EPA requests comments on the 
feasibility of applying emissions averaging to the off-site 
waste and recovery operations source category and requests 
information and data that would be necessary to support 
development and implementation of an emissions averaging 
approach.

VI. Rule Implementation 



A. Effective Date for Compliance 



In accordance with CAA section 112(i)(3), owners and 
operators of existing sources would be required to comply 
with the requirements of this NESHAP within 3 years after 
promulgation of the rule unless a compliance extension is 
granted to a particular source. Owners and operators of 
sources that begin operation on or after October 13, 1994 would be required to 
comply with all provisions of the NESHAP upon startup. 



B. Modifications and Reconstruction 



Owners and operators of newly constructed or 
reconstructed off-site waste and recovery operations must 
comply with the requirements specified in the Part 63 
general provisions (40 CFR 63.5). For modified sources, the 
EPA has proposed guidance under the authority of CAA 
section 112(g) (refer to 59 FR 15504, April 1, 1994). The 
EPA anticipates that the final promulgated guidance will 
apply to off-site waste and recovery operations. 



C. Relationship to Title V Operating Permit Program 



Under title V of the CAA, the EPA has established a 
program the requires all owners and operators of 
HAP-emitting sources to obtain an operating permit 
(57 FR 32251, July 21, 1992). The EPA's operating permit 
program establishes a single document that includes all of 
the requirements which pertain to a single source. Each 
permit will contain federally enforceable conditions with 
which the source owner and operator must comply. Under this 
program, all applicable requirements of the off-site waste 
and recovery operations NESHAP would ultimately be included 
in a source's title V operating permit. 

State operating permit programs must be approved by the 
EPA. Once a State's permit program has been approved, each 
off-site waste and recovery operations facility within that 
State must apply for and obtain an operating permit. If the 
State where the facility is located does not have an 
approved permitting program, the owner or operator of a 
facility must submit the application to the EPA Regional 
office in accordance with the requirements of the Part 63 
general provisions (40 CFR 63 subpart A). 



VII. Administrative Requirements 



A. Public Hearing 



A public hearing will be held, if requested, to discuss 
the proposed rule in accordance with CAA section 307(d)(5). 
Persons wishing to make an oral presentation regarding the 
proposed off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP 
should contact the EPA contact person listed in the 

FOR 
FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT

 section at the beginning of this 
notice. Oral presentations will be limited to 15 minutes 
each. Any member of the public may file a written statement 
before, during, or within 30 days after the hearing. 
Written statements should be sent the attention of Docket 
No. A-92-16 at EPA's Air and Radiation Docket and 
Information Center (see 

ADDRESSES

 section of this notice). 

A verbatim transcript of the hearing and written 
comments received by the EPA regarding the proposed off-site 
waste and recovery operations NESHAP will be placed in 
Docket No. A-92-16. 



B. Docket 



The docket is an organized and complete file of 
information considered by the EPA in the development of a 
rulemaking. The docket pertaining to the off-site waste and 
recovery operations NESHAP is Docket No. A-92-16. This 
docket contains a copy of the regulatory text of the 
proposed rule, the BID, and copies of all BID references and 
other information related to the development of this 
proposed rule. The public may review all materials in this 
docket at the EPA's Air and Radiation Docket and Information 
Center (see the 

ADDRESSES

 section at the beginning of this 
notice). 



C. Executive Order 12866 



Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993) 
imposes procedural requirements on the development of 
significant regulatory actions. The EPA must therefore 
determine whether a regulatory action is significant. The 
Executive Order defines a significant regulatory action as 
one that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of 
$100 million or more, or adversely affect in a material way 
the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, 
competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, 
or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; (2) 
create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with 
an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially 
alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, users 
fees, or loan programs, or the rights and obligations of 
recipients thereof; or (4) raise novel legal or policy 
issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's 
priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive 
Order.

Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order 12866, it 
has been determined that this action will be treated as a 
``significant regulatory action'' within the meaning of the 
Executive Order. As such, this action was submitted to the 
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review. Changes 
made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations are 
documented in the docket pertaining to the off-site waste 
and recovery operations NESHAP rulemaking (Docket 
No. A-92-16). 



D. Regulatory Flexibility Act 


Section 605 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 
(5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq

.) requires Federal agencies to give 
special consideration to the impacts of regulations on small 
entities, which are small businesses, small organizations, 
and small governments. The major purpose of the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act is to keep paperwork and regulatory 
requirements from being out of proportion to the scale of 
the entities being regulated, without compromising the 
objectives of, in this case, the Clean Air Act. 

A small business with establishments in Standard 
Industrial Classification 4953, Refuse Systems, is defined 
by the Small Business Administration as one receiving less 
than $6 million per year, averaged over the most recent 
three fiscal years. A small organization is a 
not-for-profit enterprise that is independently owned and 
operated and is not dominant in the waste disposal industry. 
A small government is one that serves a population of less 
than 50,000 people. The EPA may use other definitions, but 
elects to use these. The EPA believes that small 
organizations and small governments have at most a very 
minor involvement with the types of off-site waste and 
recovery operations subject to this rulemaking, and 
therefore would not be significantly affected by the 
off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP. Hence, the 
EPA has concentrated its attention on small businesses. 

The Regulatory Flexibility Act specifies that Federal 
agencies must prepare an initial regulatory flexibility 
analysis if a proposed regulatory action would have a 
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small 
entities. The data bases available to the EPA reflect the 
state of the hazardous waste TSDF industry in 1986, and 
provide limited basis for updating the economic factors. 
Furthermore, the EPA does not have reliable projections of 
construction of new facilities with off-site waste and 
recovery operations that would be subject to the proposed 
rule. The EPA therefore assumes the proposed rule may have 
a significant impact on a substantial number of small 
businesses, and has conducted a regulatory flexibility 
analysis. This analysis is part of the economic impact 
analysis (titled Economic Impact Analysis of Proposed 
National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: 
Off-Site Waste and Recovery Operations) prepared for the 
rulemaking and available in the docket (Docket No. A-92-16). 

Even though many off-site waste and recovery operations 
facilities are expected to be area sources and would not be 
subject to the proposed NESHAP, the EPA assumed for the 
regulatory flexibility analysis that all facilities listed 
in the data base are colocated at major sources. Also, the 
analysis did not exclude those off-site waste and recovery 
operations facilities that would not be subject to the 
NESHAP under the proposed applicability exemption for 
facilities at which the total annual organic HAP mass 
content of all wastes and recoverable materials subject to 
the rule entering the facility is less than 1 Mg/yr. From 
its data base, the EPA has identified 110 small businesses 
that own 112 affected facilities. About 90 of these small 
businesses would incur compliance costs associated with 
using air emission control equipment. For about one-third 
of the 90 businesses, the annual compliance costs would 
exceed 5 percent of normal production or waste treatment 
costs. For the median small business, the same costs come 
to less than 0.4 percent of sales `` compared with about 
0.01 percent for the median large business. Excluding the 
costs of monitoring and recordkeeping costs, the capital 
costs would exceed the retained earnings breakpoints (the 
maximum amount of new capital a business can raise without 
issuing new stock and without changing its existing capital 
structure) of about 40 percent of the 90 small businesses. 
Only about 30 percent of large businesses would have capital 
costs of compliance exceeding their breakpoints. 

Finally, the EPA evaluated the possibility that the 
proposed rule might cause a small business to close. 
Although the rule may cause specific waste treatment 
processes to be shut down at many off-site waste and 
recovery operations facilities, only about 10 facilities are 
projected to close outright. Of these, the EPA can single 
out only three small businesses, each of which has only one 
facility. Limiting the analysis, to the extent possible 
with the information available in the data base, to only 
those facilities which are major sources and would not 
qualify for the 1 Mg of HAP applicability exemption does not 
change this number of potential closures. 

Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act, the Administrator certifies that this rule 
may have a significant economic impact on a substantial 
number of small entities.

E. Paperwork Reduction Act 



 The information collection requirements for the 
proposed NESHAP have been submitted for approval to the 
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork 
Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq. 

An Information 
Collection Request (ICR) document has been prepared by the 
EPA (ICR No. 1717.01), and a copy may be obtained from 
Sandy Farmer, Information Policy Branch (2136), U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., 
Washington, DC 20460, or by calling (202) 260-2740. 

The public recordkeeping and reporting burden for this 
collection of information is estimated to average 
1,200 hours per respondent the first year following 
promulgation of the rule. Thereafter, the recordkeeping and 
reporting burden is estimated to average 700 hours per 
respondent. These estimates include time for reviewing 
instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and 
maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing 
the collection of information. 

 Send comments regarding the recordkeeping and reporting 
burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of 
information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, 
to Chief, Information Policy Branch (2136), U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, S.W.; 
Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office of Information and 
Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, 
Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for 
EPA.'' The final rule will respond to any OMB or public 
comments on the information collection requirements 
contained in this proposal.



F. Review 



 The off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP would 
be reviewed 8 years from the date of promulgation. This 
review would include an assessment of such factors as 
evaluation of the residual health risks, any duplication 
with other air programs, the existence of alternative 
methods, enforceability, improvements in air emission 
control technology and health data, and the recordkeeping 
and reporting requirements.

ACTION:

 Notice of intent to delete the Olmsted County Landfill Site from the National Priorities List; request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Region V announces its intent to delete the Olmsted County
Landfill Site from the National Priorities List (NPL) and requests public comment on this action. The NPL constitutes
appendix B of 40 CFR part 300 which is the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Contingency Plan (NCP), which USEPA
promulgated pursuant to section 105 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability
Act of 1980 (CERCLA) as amended. This action is being taken by USEPA, because it has been determined that all Fund-financed
responses under CERCLA have been implemented and USEPA, in consultation with the State of Minnesota, has determined
that no further response is appropriate. Moreover, USEPA and the State have determined that remedial activities
conducted at the Site to date have been protective of public health, welfare, and the environment.

I. Introduction



The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region V announces its intent to delete the Olmsted County Sanitary Landfill
Site from the National Priorities List (NPL), which constitutes appendix B of the National Oil and Hazardous Substances
Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP), and requests comments on the deletion. The EPA identifies Sites that appear to
present a significant risk to public health, welfare or the environment, and maintains the NPL as the list of those
Sites. Sites on the NPL may be the subject of remedial actions financed by the Hazardous Substance Superfund Response
Trust Fund (Fund). Pursuant to  300.425(e)(3) of the NCP, any site deleted from the NPL remains eligible for
Fund-financed remedial actions if the conditions at the site warrant such action.

The USEPA will accept comments on this proposal for thirty (30) days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register

.

Section II of this document explains the criteria for deleting sites from the NPL. Section III discusses procedures
that EPA is using for this action. Section IV discusses the history of this site and explains how the site meets the deletion
criteria.

Deletion of sites from the NPL does not itself create, alter, or revoke any individual's rights or obligations. Furthermore,
deletion from the NPL does not in any way alter USEPA's right to take enforcement actions, as appropriate. The NPL is
designed primarily for informational purposes and to assist in Agency management.



II. NPL Deletion Criteria



The NCP establishes the criteria the Agency uses to delete Sites from the NPL. In accordance with 40 CFR 300.425(e),
sites may be deleted from the NPL where no further response is appropriate. In making this determination, USEPA will
consider, in consultation with the State, whether any of the following criteria have been met:




(i) Responsible parties or other persons have implemented all appropriate response actions required; or 

(ii) All appropriate Fund-financed responses under CERCLA have been implemented, and no further response action
by responsible parties is appropriate; or 
 (iii) The Remedial investigation has shown that the release poses no significant threat to public health or the environment
and, therefore, remedial measures are not appropriate.




III. Deletion Procedures



Upon determination that at least one of the criteria described in  300.425(e) has been met, USEPA may formally
begin deletion procedures once the State has concurred with the intent to delete. This 

Federal Register

 document, and a concurrent notice in the local newspaper in the vicinity of the Site, announce the initiation of a 30-day
comment period. The public is asked to comment on USEPA's intention to delete the site from the NPL. All critical documents
needed to evaluate USEPA's decision are generally included in the information repository and the deletion docket.

Upon completion of the public comment period, if necessary, the USEPA Regional Office will prepare a Responsiveness
Summary to evaluate and address comments that were received. The public is welcome to contact the USEPA Region V Office
to obtain a copy of this responsiveness summary, if one is prepared. If USEPA then determines the deletion from the
NPL is appropriate, final notice of deletion will be published in the 

Federal Register

.



IV. Basis for Intended Site Deletion



The Olmsted County Landfill is located in the Oronoco Township just east of State Highway 52 about three miles north
of Rochester's city limits. The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency issued the landfill's operating permit to the
City of Rochester in 1970, and amended it in 1972, 1979 and 1984. In late 1982 the city transferred ownership of the landfill
to Olmsted County. The facility's permitted boundary encompasses 304 acres. The county stopped sending municipal
wastes to the landfill in 1987, but one cell continued to be used for demolition debris and coal ash from Rochester Public
Utilities until March 1993. The county has now officially ceased using the landfill. It has been permanently covered,
and the landfill was certified closed by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency in December 1993. 

Beginning in 1983, monitoring wells on the Site showed groundwater beneath the landfill was being contaminated with
volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are typically found at landfills. The landfill was added to the Permanent
List of Priorities (the Minnesota Superfund list) in 1984, and in 1986 the USEPA placed it on the National Priorities
List (Federal Superfund list), 51 FR 21054-21112. Under a cooperative agreement with the USEPA, the MPCA assumed
management of Superfund activities at the Site. The MPCA issued a Request for Response Action in 1989 directing the
city and the county to investigate the nature and extent of the contamination. Olmsted County has taken the lead in
funding and conducting the investigation.
 
The Remedial Investigation (RI) of the Olmsted County Landfill Site included an ongoing dye-trace study to determine
the direction and rate of groundwater flow in the vicinity of the landfill. Ambient air and landfill gas samples were
characterized, along with ground- and surface-water samples.

Numerous field investigations were conducted over a 13-month period. The RI was completed in July 1992. The supplemental
RI, which was completed in September 1993, was conducted in order to further investigate gas emissions at the site.
 
Based on the findings in the Remedial Investigation and the Supplemental Remedial Investigation, further response
under CERCLA is not necessary. The low potential for Site impacts will be adequately addressed under the Minnesota
Solid Waste Rules for landfills. The continued monitoring, long-term care and contingency actions are specified
in a Closure Order and Post Closure Care Plan issued to the County on March 22, 1994, by the MPCA. Continued monitoring
to insure compliance with Minnesota Solid Waste Rules will adequately protect human health and the environment.
Annual reviews of the data collected are a current requirement under the Rules.

On June 21, 1994, a Record of Decision was signed that concludes no remedial action under CERCLA is necessary at the
Site. The selected no-action remedial alternative was chosen in accordance with CERCLA. 

EPA, with concurrence of the State of Minnesota, has determined that all appropriate Fund-financed responses under
CERCLA at the Olmsted County Landfill site have been completed, and no further Superfund response is appropriate
in order to provide protection of human health and the environment.

Cable Television Act of 1992



<AGENCY>
agency: 

Federal Communications Commission.




Action: 

Further notice of proposed rulemaking.




</AGENCY>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

This further notice of proposed rulemaking is one segment of the Fifth Order on Reconsideration and Further Notice
of Proposed Rulemaking in this proceeding. The final rules adopted in this decision may be found elsewhere in this
issue. In the Further Notice Proposed Rulemaking, the Commission sought comment on possible alternative definitions
for small cable operators, independent small cable systems, and small cable systems owned by small multiple system
operators. The Commission also sought comment on whether to retain current definitions or use different definitions
for purposes of establishing special rate or administrative treatment for small operators and small multiple system
operators. The Commission specifically seeks comment on these issues in light of Section 3(a) of the Small Business
Act, and on whether the Commission should employ the current Small Business Administration definition of a small
cable company in the cable rules. A change in the definitions of these categories of cable operators may affect eligibility
under any final rules which the Commission may adopt pertaining to small cable systems.

This is the proposed rules segment of the Commission's Fifth Order on Reconsideration and Further Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking in MM Docket No. 92-266 and MM Docket No. 93-215, FCC 94-234, adopted September 12, 1994
and released September 26, 1994. The complete text of this document is available for inspection and copying during

Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking



Background



In 1992, Congress amended  3(a) of the Small Business Act to require federal agencies to use small business definitions
created by the Small Business Administration (``SBA''), or in the alternative, seek public comment on different
definitions and obtain the approval of the Small Business Administrator with regard to any regulation applicable
to small businesses, unless other statutory definitions are applicable. SBA rules currently define a small cable
company as one with $11 million or less in gross revenues. The Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition
Act of 1992 defined a small cable system as one with 1,000 or fewer subscribers. A small cable operator is defined as
one with 15,000 or fewer subscribers that is not affiliated with a larger operator. In addition, a small multiple system
operator (``MSO'') is one serving 250,000 or fewer total subscribers that owns only systems with less than 10,000
subscribers each and has an average system size of 1,000 or fewer subscribers. In this rulemaking, the SBA's Office
of Advocacy and the Small Cable Business Association have expressed concern about the Commission's definitions
of small operators eligible for transition relief and our definition of small MSOs. Specifically, the SBA's Office
of Advocacy and the Small Cable Business Association believe the current definitions in our rules defining eligibility
for transition and administrative relief are under inclusive and were promulgated in violation of  3(a) of
the Small Business Act. They urge us to re-evaluate the definitions and seek public input before deciding on permanent
standards.

The Chief Counsel of the SBA's Office of Advocacy has urged the Commission to explore a full range of burden-reducing
regulatory options in our rate proceedings. We are in full agreement with that suggestion. Based on the existing record,
however, we are not persuaded that the actions taken to date to ease the regulatory difficulties faced by smaller operators
have been undertaken in violation of the law. Specifically, the Commission does not believe that Small Business Administration
size standards, to which federal agencies may be required to adhere under Section 3 of the Small Business Act, are applicable
to the Commission's definitions of small cable operators and small cable systems developed in the Second Order on
Reconsideration, Fourth Report and Order, and Fifth Notice of Proposed Rulemaking MM Docket No. 92-266. For
example, Section 3(a) of the Small Business Act provides that SBA size standards apply for the purposes of all legislation,
unless the legislation specifically authorizes different size standards. The Cable Television Consumer Protection
and Competition Act of 1992 (``1992 Cable Act'') in fact contains a size definition of a small system as one with 1,000
or fewer subscribers. See 47 U.S.C.  543(i). Specifically, the statute requires the Commission to develop
cable rate regulations that reduce cost and administrative burdens for such ``small systems.'' Given the statute's
small system definition of 1,000 or fewer subscribers, Section 3(a) of the Small Business Act is inapplicable. The
Commission has implemented the statutory provision regarding small system relief in a more flexible manner than
is explicitly mandated by the 1992 Cable Act and is now considering further flexibility through extending relief
to additional systems. But this does not alter the fact that the Commission is implementing a statute with an explicit
small business standard. Additionally, the Small Business Act defines small-business concerns as one ``which is
not dominant in its field of operation.'' 15 U.S.C.  632(a)(1). Cable systems subject to rate regulation, regardless
of whether they are large or small, are by definition dominant in their field of operation because they do not face effective
competition. Thus, Section 3(a) of the Small Business Act also does not apply because regulated cable systems do not
meet the definition of a small business concern.

Discussion





We established transition treatment for small operators pending completion of our cost studies, and have established
administrative relief for independent small systems and small systems owned by small multiple system operators
(``MSOs''). Under our interim cost-of-service rules, independent small systems and small systems owned by small
MSOs also may use special forms for cost-of-service showings. When cost studies are completed, we may make permanent,
eliminate, or modify our transition rate treatment of small operators. When we develop average equipment cost schedules,
we may terminate or modify our provisions for streamlined rate reductions for independent small systems and small
systems owned by small MSOs. In our final cost proceeding, we may modify our requirements for cost showings by independent
small systems and small systems owned by small MSOs.



We believe that it would establish a more complete record for purposes of promulgating final rate rules applicable
to small operators, independent small systems, and small systems owned by small MSOs if we obtain comment on possible
alternative definitions that we could use for purposes of determining eligibility for special rate or administrative
treatment provisions that could apply to small businesses. We are initiating the instant Further Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking for purposes of obtaining this comment.




Accordingly, we solicit comment on whether we should retain current definitions or use different definitions for
purposes of establishing special rate or administrative treatment for small operators and small MSOs that could
be small businesses. We specifically seek comment on these issues in light of Section 3(a) of the Small Business Act,
and on whether we should employ the current SBA definition of a small cable company in our cable rules.






Administrative Matters





Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis




Pursuant to Section 603 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Commission has prepared the following initial regulatory
flexibility analysis (IRFA) of the expected impact of these proposed policies and rules on small entities. Written
public comments are requested on the IRFA. These comments must be filed in accordance with the same filing deadlines
as comments on the rest of the Notice, but they must have a separate and distinct heading designating them as responses
to the regulatory flexibility analysis. The Secretary shall cause a copy of the Notice, including the initial regulatory
flexibility analysis, to be sent to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration in accordance
with Section 603(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, Pub. L. No. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. Section 601
et seq. (1981).





Reason for action. 

The Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 requires the Commission to prescribe rules
and regulations for determining reasonable rates for basic tier cable service and to establish criteria for identifying
unreasonable rates for cable programming services. The Commission has adopted rate regulations that require a comparison
to the rates of cable systems subject to effective competition, as defined in the Cable Act of 1992 and represented
in the revised benchmark formula. This Notice proposes to review and determine appropriate definitions of small
systems, small operators, and small MSOs for the purpose of determining rate regulation applicable to these categories
of companies.







Objectives. 

To propose rules to implement Section 3 of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992. We
also desire to adopt rules that will be easily interpreted and readily applicable and, whenever possible, minimize
the regulatory burden on affected parties.






Legal Basis. 

Action as proposed for this rulemaking is contained in Sections 4(i), 4(j), 303(r) and 623 of the Communications Act
of 1934, as amended.





Description, potential impact and number of small entities affected.

 We anticipate a possible impact on small entities because the Notice addresses the definitions of small systems,
small operators and small MSOs for use in determining rate rules affecting these classes of cable operators.





Reporting, recordkeeping and other compliance requirements. 

None.




Federal rules which overlap, duplicate or conflict with this rule. 

None.





Any significant alternatives minimizing impact on small entities and consistent with stated objectives. 

None.

RIN 2700-AB72


NASA FAR Supplement; Assignment of Copyright in Software



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Procurement, Acquisition Liaison Division, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This is a revision of the NASA FAR Supplement (NFS), to allow the Contracting Officer to direct the Contractor to establish
claim to copyright in computer software and assign the copyright to the Government or another party. Assignment to
the Government can only be directed when the Contractor has not previously been granted permission to establish copyright
on its own behalf. This is needed because existing contract clauses do not provide this authority for some types of
contracts.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

A. Background



FAR clause 52.227-14, Rights in Data_General, as modified by the NASA FAR Supplement (NFS), currently allows
contractors to establish copyright in software developed under the contract. The clause also currently requires
contractors to obtain the Contracting Officer's permission prior to exercising this right. This revision will not
restrict this right. However, if a contractor is not interested in obtaining copyright, or developing the software,
and is unwilling to assign the copyright to NASA or its designee, no copyright can be claimed for the software. In many,
if not most, cases this does not matter. However, in some situations where further development of software is needed
before the software can be marketed, the U.S. private sector may be unwilling to invest in developing and marketing
the software without the availability of copyright protection. This revision will provide authority to acquire
assignments of copyright in such situations.

It is NASA's intent to announce to the public the availability of licensable software and the criteria which will be
utilized in selecting licensees. Exclusive and partially exclusive licenses will be granted only after public notice
and opportunity to file written objections. 

FAR 27.404(g)(3) authorizes agencies to include contractual requirements to assign copyright to the Government
or another party. The FAR further directs that any such requirements established by agencies should be added to clause
52.227-14, Right in Data_General. This authority is the same as is presently contained in FAR clause 52.227-17,
Rights in Data_Special Works. That clause is specifically tailored for acquisitions where data is the main deliverable;
it lacks many elements necessary in contracts involving a mix of deliverables. The proposed revision will result
in a clause that more appropriately addresses NASA's needs in acquisitions involving mixed deliverables. Further,
with the increased emphasis in recent years on promoting U.S. competitiveness and the commercialization of Government-generated
technology, it is important that we take steps to protect computer software that has a significant technology transfer
value. The availability of copyright protection will enable NASA to enhance U.S. competitiveness and more effectively
transfer valuable computer software technology.

This revision does not apply to or affect contracts for basic or applied research with a university or college (see
NFS 1827.404(e)(1) or 1827.409(e)).


B. Executive Order 12866



The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has determined that this rule is significant under E.O. 12866. This
regulation is needed on an urgent and compelling basis because valuable computer software developed under NASA contracts
may become part of the public domain, and thereby lose its value, if the software is not copyrighted. Current regulations
grant the contractor the right to request permission to establish copyright, but there is no procedure to force the
contractor to exercise that right or to transfer the copyright to the Government. The regulation meets the need, i.e.,
provides protection for the software's value, by allowing NASA to direct the contractor to establish copyright and
assign the copyright to NASA or another party. The potential costs for this regulatory action are limited to the nominal
costs involved in establishing and transferring copyright. These costs may vary, but are estimated to be less than
$100 per copyright, and it is anticipated that less than 10 contractors annually would each be required to incur this
expense one time. Because the contracts under which valuable software is likely to be developed are usually cost-reimbursable
research and development contracts, the costs for copyright and transfer would normally be charged to the Government.
The potential benefits are the value of the protected software; this value cannot be measured, as it depends on future
discoveries and developments. This value cannot be considered to be taken away from contractors, because it never
belonged to them.


C. Paperwork Reduction Act


The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the proposed changes to the NASA FAR Supplement do not impose any
new recordkeeping or information collection requirements, or new collections of information from offerors, contractors,
or members of the public which require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under 44 U.S.C. 3501,
et seq.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Secretary proposes to amend the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program regulations. The FFEL Program consists
of the Federal Stafford, Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS), Federal PLUS, and the Federal Consolidation
Loan Programs. These amendments are needed to implement certain changes made to the Higher Education Act of 1965,
as amended (HEA), by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, enacted August 10, 1993, and by the Higher Education
Technical Amendments of 1993, enacted December 20, 1993. The proposed regulations would also amend the FFEL Program
regulations to permit a lender to issue a ``master check'' to an institution for purposes of disbursing Federal Stafford
loan proceeds to an institution, to prohibit a subsequent holder of a loan to bill the Secretary for any applicable
interest benefits or special allowance on a loan for which origination fees have not been paid, and to limit the collection
charges that may be assessed a borrower with a defaulted loan that is paid off through loan consolidation. The proposed
regulations would implement section 428(n) of the HEA as amended by OBRA which requires a State to share the costs of
defaulted Federal Stafford and Federal SLS loans with the Federal government. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


The FFEL Program regulations (34 CFR Part 682) govern the Federal Stafford Loan Program, the Federal SLS Program,
the Federal PLUS Program, and the Federal Consolidation Loan Program (formerly the Guaranteed Student Loan programs).

The Secretary is proposing to revise 34 CFR Part 682 to implement changes made to the HEA by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act of 1993 (OBRA) (Pub. L. 103-66) and the Higher Education Technical Amendments of 1993 (the Technical Amendments)(Pub.
L. 103-208). OBRA added section 428(n) to the HEA to require a State to pay a fee to the Secretary based on the State's
new FFEL loan volume and the dollars associated with the most recent cohort default rates calculated for schools in
that State. This provision is intended to encourage a State to ensure that its educational institutions provide quality
services to their students. A State may achieve this objective through licensing and State Postsecondary Review
Entities. This provision is also intended to partially offset the cost to the Federal government of paying student
loan default claims. 
These proposed regulations would also amend the FFEL Program regulations to reflect certain other changes made to
the HEA by OBRA. The Secretary proposes to amend the regulations to reflect statutory provisions providing for the
payment of lender referral fees to guaranty agencies, the reduction of the reinsurance coverage and reinsurance
rates for a guaranty agency's losses on default claims and the reduction of insurance coverage a guaranty agency may
pay on default claims. 
These proposed regulations would also amend the FFEL Program regulations to reflect certain changes to the HEA by
the Technical Amendments. These changes require a lender to rebate excess interest on certain Federal Stafford loans
to either the borrower or the 
Secretary and require lenders to convert the interest rates on certain Federal Stafford loans to a variable interest
rate. 
These proposed regulations would also amend the FFEL Program regulations to permit a lender to disburse Federal Stafford
loan proceeds to a school via a master check. This change is needed to facilitate a lender's ability to disburse Federal
Stafford loans. These proposed regulations would also prohibit a subsequent holder of a loan to bill the Secretary
for any applicable interest benefits or special allowance on a loan for which origination fees have not been paid.
This change is needed to ensure that origination fees are paid on a loan if the loan is sold by considering the loan ineligible
for reinsurance if such fees are not paid. These proposed regulations would also limit the collection charges that
may be assessed a borrower with a defaulted loan that is paid off through loan consolidation. This change will encourage
a borrower to get his or her loan out of default for purposes of Title IV eligibility by having it paid off through consolidation.

The proposed regulations would delete current  682.407_Administrative Cost Allowance for Guaranty Agencies.
This section is no longer needed because OBRA removed the Secretary's authority for paying an administrative cost
allowance to a guaranty agency from the HEA. 


Proposed Regulatory Changes 


The following summarizes the major changes in this notice of proposed rulemaking:

Section 682.202 Permissible charges by lenders to borrowers. 


The proposed regulations would implement the requirements of section 427A(i) of the HEA as amended by the Technical
Amendments. The changes in this section reflect the new statutory language that requires lenders to return excess
interest to certain Stafford loan borrowers or the Secretary and requires the conversion of the interest rate on certain
Federal Stafford loans to a variable interest rate. 


Section 682.207 Due diligence in disbursing a loan. 


The proposed regulations would extend a provision of the FFEL Program regulations that were published on June 28,
1994 (59 FR 33334) that permitted the use of a master check for purposes of disbursing PLUS loans to the Federal Stafford
loan programs. This proposed rule would allow a lender to use a master check to disburse Federal Stafford loans, thereby
facilitating their disbursement. A ``master check'' is a check representing the disbursement of loan proceeds for
more than one borrower. If a master check is used, the lender must provide the school with a list of the borrower's names,
social security numbers, and the loan amounts disbursed through the master check. The proposed regulations would
also require a lender to provide a school with a list of the borrowers' names, social security numbers, and the loan
amounts if the loans are disbursed by electronic funds transfer. 


Section 682.305 Procedures for payment of interest benefits and special allowance. 


The proposed regulations would amend the FFEL Program regulations to require an originating lender to pay origination
fees to the Secretary. In many cases, the Secretary is not recovering the origination fees from the originating lender
or any subsequent holder of a loan when the loan is sold. A June 1994 report conducted by the General Accounting Office
and the Office of the Inspector General (GAO/AIMD-94-131 and ACN 17-30302) has identified this
as a potentially serious area of abuse that may be costing the Department a significant amount of money. The Secretary
has decided that regulatory controls are needed to help reduce the incidence of abuse in this area. Therefore, in addition
to the proposed rule that would require the originating lender to pay origination fees, the proposed regulations
would also prevent a subsequent holder of a loan for which the origination fees were not paid from receiving any interest
benefits or special allowance on that loan, or a guaranty agency from receiving reinsurance payments from the Secretary
on that loan, until the origination fees have been paid. 


Section 682.401 Basic program agreement. 


The proposed regulations are needed to implement section 428(e) of the HEA. Under this section, the Secretary will
pay a lender referral fee to each guaranty agency with whom the Secretary has a lender referral agreement in an amount
equal to 0.5 percent of the principal amount of a loan made as a result of the agency's referral services. 
The proposed regulations would also change the regulations to reflect a change made by OBRA to section 428(b)(1)(G)
of the HEA that limits a guaranty agency to paying 98 percent of the unpaid principal balance of each loan on default
claims on loans disbursed on or after October 1, 1993.

The proposed regulations would add a new paragraph to the regulations that would limit the amount of collection charges
and late fees a guaranty agency may guarantee when a defaulted loan is consolidated. Under the proposed regulations,
a guaranty agency may not guarantee a consolidation loan that includes a defaulted loan if the collection fees and
late charges assessed the borrower on the defaulted loan being consolidated exceeds 18.5 percent of the outstanding
principal and interest on the defaulted loan at the time the pay-off amount of the loan is certified to the consolidating
lender. The Secretary is proposing this provision to limit the amount of collection fees and late charges that a borrower
may be liable for on a defaulted FFEL Program loan if such loan is consolidated. Because collection charges and late
fees may be as high as 42 percent of the outstanding principal and interest of a defaulted loan, the Secretary is proposing
this limitation to encourage a borrower to pay off a defaulted loan through loan consolidation and bring the loan out
of default for purposes of title IV eligibility. 



Section 682.404 Federal reinsurance agreement. 



The proposed regulations would amend this section of the regulations to reflect a change made by OBRA to section 428(c)(1)
of the HEA that reduces the percentages the Secretary will reinsure on a guaranty agency's default claims on loans
made on or after October 1, 1993 from 100, 90, and 80 percent to 98, 88, and 78 percent, respectively, with two exceptions.
First, the Secretary will reinsure loans at 100, 90, or 80 percent that are transferred from an insolvent guaranty
agency or from an agency that withdraws its participation in the FFEL Program, under a plan approved by the Secretary.
Second, the Secretary will provide 100 percent reinsurance for loans made under an approved lender-of-last-resort
program. 



Section 682.418 State share of default costs. 



This proposed rule would add a new  682.418 to the FFEL Program regulations to implement a change made by OBRA
to section 428(n) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA). This provision requires a State to pay a fee to the Secretary
if a school located in that State has a cohort default rate that exceeds 20 percent. The purpose of this fee is to partially
offset the cost to the Federal government of paying default claims on FFEL Program loans by requiring a State to share
the cost of defaults by student borrowers attending schools in the State. A State will be required to pay the fee to the
Secretary within 60 days after the date it is notified by the Secretary of the fee it must pay. 

Section 428(n) mandates a formula for the Secretary to use to determine the amount of the State's fee. The State's fee
is calculated by multiplying the State's new loan volume for FFEL Program loans for all schools in the State for the
current fiscal year by 12.5 percent, and multiplying that result by the sum of the amounts calculated as explained
in the following paragraph for each school in the State with a cohort default rate that exceeds 20 percent. That result
is then divided by the amount of loan volume attributable to current and former students of schools in that State who
entered repayment during the fiscal year used in calculating the cohort default rates. Under section 428(n), the
amount by which the State's new loan volume is multiplied increases from 12.5 percent to 20 percent in fiscal year 1996
and to 50 percent in fiscal year 1997 and succeeding fiscal years. 

The amount by which a school exceeds the 20 percent default standard for this calculation is the amount of loan volume
in default for the cohort default rate for the school minus 20 percent of the loans attributable to current and former
students of the school who entered repayment during the fiscal year used in calculating the cohort default rate. 

The statutory requirements are more clearly represented using the following formula: 




New Loan Volume x 0.125  x  

{

[A^(B  x  .2)] 


'

 C

}






A=Dollars in default attributed to the cohort default rate for all schools in the State that have rates that exceed
20 percent. 

B=Dollars entering repayment attributed to the cohort default rate for all schools in the State that have rates that
exceed 20 percent. 

C=Dollars entering repayment attributed to the cohort default rate for all schools in the State. 




The Secretary is considering the following approaches to implement the formula and is interested in public comment
as to which approach would best implement the statute. The language in the statute indicates that the fee structure
should be calculated using the new loan volume attributable to all institutions in the State for the current fiscal
year. However, the Secretary will not know the final new loan volume data for a fiscal year until after the fiscal year
has ended. The Secretary has identified the following two options to implement the statute: (1) to use the new loan
volume for the fiscal year that precedes the fiscal year in which the fee is determined; or (2) to estimate the new loan
volume for the fiscal year during which the State is assessed a fee. Also, because the time of the year the Secretary
will be determining the fee coincides with the time of the year cohort default rates are generally determined, the
Secretary may be presented with the opportunity to use either the cohort default rates that are currently being issued,
or the rates that were issued the previous year. Schools would have had the chance to appeal the rates that were issued
in the previous year based on inaccurate data, while the newer rates will more likely reflect the school's current
situation. The Secretary is interested in comments regarding which rate should be used if this situation arises.

The following example illustrates the application of the statutory formula and the resulting fee a State would be
required to pay. If the new loan volume for a State is $100 million and $40 million of Stafford and SLS loans entered repayment
during the fiscal year used for the relevant cohort default rates, and the dollars associated with the default rates
of the schools in the State with cohort default rates above 20 percent is $10 million entering repayment and $4 million
entering default, the State would pay $625,000 as a default offset fee for fiscal year 1995.




$100m  x  12.5%  x  

{

[$4m ^ ($10m  x  .2)] 
 $40m

}

 = $625,000 




A State may charge a fee to schools located in the State that participate in the FFEL Program to defray the fee assessed
the State by the Secretary. As required by the statute, the State's fee structure must be approved by the Secretary
and be based on the relationship of the school's cohort default rate to the default fee assessed the State by the Secretary.
A State may not develop its fee structure so that a school is assessed a fee by a State that is greater than that school's
contribution to the fee the State is required to pay the Secretary. The State's school fee payment structure must also
include a procedure by which a school with a high cohort default rate may be exempted from payment of the fee if the school
can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the State that exceptional mitigating circumstances contributed to its cohort
default rate. A State must provide a school a reasonable amount of time from the date it notifies the school that it is
being assessed a fee under this provision to either pay the fee or submit an appeal, with appropriate documentation
that demonstrates that exceptional mitigating circumstances contributed to its cohort default rate. The Secretary
is particularly interested in knowing if the public believes it would be appropriate for the Secretary to provide
regulatory guidance with respect to the exceptional mitigating circumstances a State may select. The Secretary
also is interested in knowing if the public believes the following criteria would assist the States in developing
their exceptional mitigating circumstances: 

(1) The completion and job placement rates of Stafford and SLS loan borrowers at the school whose loans entered repayment
during the fiscal year used for calculating the school's cohort default rate; 

(2) The regional or State unemployment rates during the fiscal year used for calculating the school's cohort default
rate and during the subsequent fiscal year; 

(3) The income level of former Stafford and SLS loan borrowers at the school whose loans entered repayment during the
fiscal year used for calculating the school's cohort default rate and during subsequent fiscal year; 

(4) The exceptional mitigating circumstances criteria currently reflected in 34 CFR 668.17(d)(ii) under which
a school may appeal its loss of eligibility to participate in the FFEL Program; 

(5) The school's status as a Historically Black College and University, a Tribally Controlled Community College
under section 2(a)(4) of the Tribally Controlled Community College Assistance Act of 1978, and a Navajo Community
College under the Navajo Community College Act. 

The Secretary is particularly interested in receiving public comment on these criteria as well as other criteria
the public believes may assist a State in developing its exceptional mitigating circumstances. 

A State may not attempt to collect a fee from a school under these regulations during the school's appeal of the fee to
the State or if the school satisfactorily demonstrates to the State that 
exceptional mitigating circumstances contributed to its cohort default rate. 

The Secretary is interested to know if the public believes that the State should be responsible in whole, or in part,
for the portion of the State's fee that is attributed to: (1) the fees that are attributed to a school that has closed
or no longer participates in the FFEL Program; (2) the fees attributed to schools that meet the exceptional mitigating
circumstances standards established by the State; and, (3) the fees attributed to Historically Black Colleges and
Universities, tribally controlled community colleges, and Navajo Community Colleges that are exempt from losing
eligibility to participate in the FFEL Program under section 435(a)(2) of the HEA, if it is determined that such schools
are not responsible for their contribution to the State's fee. 



Executive Order 12866 



1. Assessment of Costs and Benefits 



These proposed regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order
the Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this proposed regulatory action. 

The potential costs associated with the proposed regulations are those resulting from statutory requirements and
those determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering the Title IV, HEA programs effectively and efficiently.
Burdens specifically associated with information collection requirements, if any, are explained elsewhere in
this preamble under the heading of 

Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.

<TEXT>
 

In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both quantitative and qualitative_of these proposed regulations,
the Secretary has determined that the benefits of the proposed regulations justify the costs. 

The Secretary has also determined that this regulatory action does not unduly interfere with State, local, and tribal
governments in the exercise of their governmental functions. 

To assist the Department in complying with the specific requirements of Executive Order 12866, the Secretary invites
comment on whether there may be further opportunities to reduce any potential costs or increase potential benefits
resulting from these proposed regulations without impeding the effective and efficient administration of the Title
IV, HEA programs. 





2.

 Clarity of the Regulations 



Executive order 12866 requires each agency to write regulations that are easy to understand. 

The Secretary invites comments on how to make these regulations easier to understand, including answers to questions
such as the following: (1) Are the requirements in the regulations clearly stated? (2) Do the regulations contain
technical terms or other wording that interferes with their clarity? (3) Does the format of 
the regulations (grouping and order of sections, use of headings, paragraphing, etc.) aid or reduce their clarity?
Would the regulations be easier to understand if they were divided into more (but shorter) sections? (A ``section''
is preceded by the symbol `` '' and a numbered heading; for example,  682.410 Fiscal, administrative
and enforcement requirements.

) (4) Is the description of the proposed regulations in the ``Supplementary Information'' section of this preamble
helpful in the understanding of the proposed regulations? How could this description be more helpful in making the
proposed regulations easier to understand? (5) What else could the Department do to make the regulations easier to
understand? 

A copy of any comments that concern whether these proposed regulations are easy to understand should also be sent to
Stanley Cohen, Regulations Quality Officer, U.S. Department of Education, 600 Independence Avenue, SW., (Room
5100 FB-10), Washington, D.C. 20202. 


Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification 



The Secretary certifies that these proposed regulations would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Certain reporting, recordkeeping, and compliance requirements are imposed on guaranty
agencies, lenders, schools, and States by the regulations. These requirements, however, would not have a significant
impact because the regulations would not impose excessive regulatory burdens or require unnecessary Federal supervision.



Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 



There are no information collection requirements contained in these proposed regulations. 


Invitation To Comment 



Interested persons are invited to submit comments and recommendations regarding these proposed regulations. All
comments submitted in response to these proposed regulations will be available 
for public inspection, during and after the comment period, in room 4310, Regional Office Building 3, 7th and D Streets,
SW., Washington, DC, between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday of each week except federal holidays.



Assessment of Educational Impact 



The Secretary particularly requests comments on whether the proposed regulations in this document would require
transmission of information that is being gathered by or is available from any other agency or authority of the United
States.
