<SUMMARY>
summary:

 The Department of Commerce (the Department) is notifying the public of its determination not to revoke the countervailing
duty order on sugar from the European Community (EC).




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background




On July 5, 1994, the Department published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 34410) its intent to revoke the countervailing duty order on sugar from the EC (43 FR 33237; July 31, 1978). Under
19 CFR 355.25(d)(4)(iii), the Secretary of Commerce will conclude that an order is no longer of interest to interested
parties and will revoke the order if no domestic interested party objects to revocation and no interested party requests
an administrative review by the last day of the fifth anniversary month.


Within the specified time frame, we received objections from domestic interested parties to our intent to revoke
this countervailing duty order. Therefore, because the requirements of 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4)(iii) have not been met,
we will not revoke the order.

This determination is in accordance with 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4).

Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS); FY95 DRG Updates


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of the Secretary, DoD.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of DRG Revised Rates.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice provides the updated adjusted standardized amounts, DRG relative weights, outlier thresholds, and
beneficiary cost-share per diem rates to be used for FY 1995 under the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system. It also describes
the non-regulatory changes made to the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system in order to conform to changes made to the
Medicare Prospective Payment System (PPS).


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The final rule published on September 1, 1987 (52 FR 32992) set forth the basic procedures used under the CHAMPUS DRG-based
payment system. This was subsequently amended by final rules published August 31, 1988 (53 FR 33461), October 21,
1988 (53 FR 41331), December 16, 1988 (53 FR 50515), May 30, 1990 (55 FR 21863), and October 22, 1990 (55 FR 42560).


An explicit tenet of these final rules, and one based on the statute authorizing use of DRGs by CHAMPUS, is that the CHAMPUS
DRG-based payment system is modeled on the Medicare prospective payment system (PPS), and that, whenever practicable,
the CHAMPUS system will follow the same rules that apply to the Medicare PPS. HCFA publishes these changes annually
in the 

Federal Register

 and discusses in detail the impact of the changes.
In addition, this notice updates the rates and weights in accordance with our previous final rules. The actual changes
we are making, along with a description of their relationship to the Medicare PPS, are detailed below.


I. Medicare PPS Changes Which Affect the CHAMPUS DRG-Based Payment System


Following is a discussion of the changes the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) has made to the Medicare
PPS which affect the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system.


A. DRG Classifications


Under both the Medicare PPS and the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system, cases are classified into the appropriate DRG
by a Grouper program. The Grouper classifies each case into a DRG on the basis of the diagnosis and procedure codes and
demographic information (that is, sex, age, and discharge status). The Grouper used for the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment
system is the same as the current Medicare Grouper with two modifications. The CHAMPUS system has replaced Medicare
DRG 435 with two age-based DRGs (900 and 901), and we have implemented thirty-four (34) neonatal DRGs in place of Medicare
DRGs 385 through 390. Grouping for all other DRGs under the CHAMPUS system is identical to the Medicare PPS.
For FY 1995, HCFA will implement a number of changes in major diagnostic categories (MDCs), revisions to secondary
and major problems lists and surgical hierarchies to improve DRG classifications based on resource utilization.
The CHAMPUS Grouper will incorporate all changes made to the Medicare Grouper.


B. Wage Index and Medicare Geographic Classification Review Board Guidelines


CHAMPUS will continue to use the same wage index amounts used for the Medicare PPS. In addition, CHAMPUS will duplicate
all changes with regard to the wage index for specific hospitals which are redesignated by the Medicare Geographic
Classification Review Board. Consistent with HCFA, rural hospitals will receive the same payment rate as other urban
hospitals.


C. Hospital Market Basket


We will update the adjusted standardized amounts according to the final updated hospital market basket used for the
Medicare PPS according to HCFA's September 1 final rule.


D. Outlier Payments

CHAMPUS is adopting the HCFA outlier thresholds for FY95. The long-stay threshold shall equal the lesser of 3.0 standard
deviations or 22 days above the DRG's geometric LOS. Long-stay outliers will be reimbursed the DRG-based amount plus
49 percent of the per diem rate for the DRG for each covered day of care beyond the long-stay outlier threshold. The cost
outlier will be reimbursed the DRG-based amount plus 80 percent of the standardized costs exceeding the threshold.
The cost outlier threshold shall be the DRG payment (wage-adjusted but prior to adjustment for indirect medical education)
plus a flat rate of $18,800.



E. Hospitals Excluded from the Prospective Payment System



CHAMPUS will continue to follow the limitations of exclusions for hospitals excluded from the prospective payment
system. As HCFA clarified in its final rule of September 2, 1994, ``long-term care units'' of general hospitals are
not exempt nor were they intended to be exempt from the prospective payment system. CHAMPUS shares HCFA's concern
that excluding such units could inadvertently encourage hospitals to divert long-stay cases to the excluded unit,
leaving only the shorter, less costly cases to be paid under the prospective payment system, circumventing the intent
of Congress to use the DRG system to control hospital charges. Designation by Medicare as an exempt hospital will result
in automatic exemption under CHAMPUS. A hospital which has been denied exemption status by Medicare cannot be exempt
under CHAMPUS.



G. Medicare Changes Which Are Not Being Adopted by CHAMPUS



Transfer cases will be paid as in previous years based on a per diem rate for each day of the patient's stay in that hospital
not to exceed the DRG-based payment amount (including outlier payments). The per diem rate is determined by dividing
the appropriate wage-adjusted prospective payment rate, including adjustment for indirect medical education,
by the geometric mean length of stay for the DRG into which the case falls. CHAMPUS is not adopting the graduated per
diem methodology discussed by HCFA at this time. Outlier cases will be paid as in previous years, applying HCFA's outlier
thresholds as described above. Capital costs will continue to be handled as a pass-through cost under CHAMPUS. Only
those hospitals not exempt from the prospective payment system are entitled to payment consideration for capital
costs.


III. Cost-to-Charge Ratio

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941013-2-00014 </DOCNO>

<TEXT>
 

For FY 1995, the cost-to-charge ratio used for the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system will be 0.6193 which is increased
to 0.6293 to account for bad debts. This shall be used to calculate the adjusted standardized amounts and to calculate
cost outlier payments, except for children's hospitals. For children's hospital cost outliers, the cost-to-charge
ratio used is 0.6900.



IV. Updated Rates and Weights



Tables 1 and 2 provide the rates and weights to be used under CHAMPUS DRG-based payments system during FY 1995 and which
are a result of the changes described above. The implementing regulations for the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system
are in 32 CFR Part 199.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

), this notice announces that the Information Collection Request (ICR) abstracted below has been forwarded to the
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and comment. The ICR describes the nature of the information collection
and its expected cost and burden; where appropriate, it includes the actual data collection instrument.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response




Title:

 Applications for ``Preauthorization of a CERCLA Response Action'' and ``Claim for CERCLA Response Action'' (EPA
ICR 

#

1304.04; OMB 

#

2050-0106). This ICR requests renewal of the existing clearance.




Abstract:

 The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), and as amended in 1986,
establishes broad Federal authority to undertake removal and remedial actions in response to releases or threats
of releases of hazardous substances and certain pollutants and contaminants into the environment. One of the uses
of the Hazardous Substance Superfund (the Fund), which is authorized under CERCLA, is the payment of claims for necessary
response costs.

Under section 111(a)(2) of CERCLA, claimants are authorized to be reimbursed from the Fund for necessary response
costs incurred as a result of carrying out the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan.
In addition, section 122(b)(1) of CERCLA delegates to EPA the authority to enter into agreements with potentially
responsible parties (PRPs) to allow the PRPs to perform a preauthorized phase of a response action in return for reimbursement
of an agreed-on portion of response costs from the Fund. Section 112(b)(1) of CERCLA authorizes EPA to prescribe the
appropriate forms and procedures for the filing of response claims against the Fund. All proposed response actions
must be approved in advance by EPA through the preauthorization process in order for a subsequent claim to be awarded.

The information required by the application and claim forms is essential for EPA to adequately review and evaluate
the merits and validity of a response claim, and to make a decision on whether to award that claim from the Fund. The information
and data submitted by applicants under the nine sections of the application for preauthorization will be used by the
Agency to make a determination on whether to approve in advance a proposed response action under the preauthorization
process. The subsequent information submitted to EPA on the claim form will be used to determine whether or not to award
the claim. In its role as manager of the Fund, this information allows EPA to ensure appropriate uses of Fund resources,
meet cost control and budget requirements, protect against potential waste and fraud, and ensure that the proposed
response actions themselves do not create environmental hazards.





Burden Statement:

 The estimated annual public reporting burden for the ``Application for Preauthorization of a CERCLA Response Action''
is estimated to average 258 hours per response. These burden estimates include time for reviewing instructions,
searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining needed data, and completing and reviewing the collection
of information.



Public reporting burden for the ``Claim for CERCLA Response Action'' is estimated to average 44 hours per response,
including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining needed
data, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. In addition, claimants awarded money from the
Fund will be required to maintain their records for a 10 year period. It is estimated that it will require those claimants
an average of 15 workhours per year to maintain their records.





Respondents:

 Preauthorization requests and response claims may be submitted by individuals, private entities, foreign entities,
or PRPs (including States or local governments).



Estimated Number of Respondents:

 34 (10 preauthorization requests, and 24 claim submitters).



Estimated Number of Responses per Respondent:

 1.



Frequency of Collection:

 On occasion_only when an applicant/claimant seeks reimbursement for response costs from the fund.





Estimated Total Annual Burden on Respondents:

 4,000 hours.


Send comments regarding the burden estimate, or any other aspect of this information collection, including suggestions
for reducing the burden, to:




Sandy Farmer, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Information Policy Branch (2136), 401 M Street, S.W., Washington,
D.C. 20460;




  and

Notice of proposed administrative settlement and opportunity for public comment.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to enter into an administrative settlement to resolve
claims under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (CERCLA).
Notice is being published to inform the public of the proposed settlement and of the opportunity to comment. This settlement
is intended to resolve the past liability of one party for costs incurred by EPA at the Radium Chemical Company Superfund
Site.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In accordance with Section 122(i)(1) of CERCLA, notice is hereby given of a proposed administrative settlement concerning
the Radium Chemical Company Superfund Site in Woodside, Queens, New York. Section 122(h) of CERCLA provides EPA with
authority to consider, compromise, and settle certain claims for costs incurred by the United States. The A&Y
Realty Corp. is the party committed to participate in this settlement through the sale of real property, the majority
of the proceeds of which are to be remitted to the United States in settlement of its claims against A&Y Realty Corp.
with respect to the Radium Chemical Company Superfund Site. This proposed settlement represents a compromise of
EPA's total response costs. There are other parties potentially responsible for EPA response costs that are not party
to the proposed settlement agreement.


A copy of the proposed administrative settlement agreement, as well as background information relating to the settlement,
may be obtained in person or by mail from EPA's Region II Office of Regional Counsel, New York/Caribbean Superfund
Branch, Room 437, 26 Federal Plaza, New York City, New York, 10278.

<DOCTITLE>Certain Chemicals Premanufacture Notice; Extension of Review Period </DOCTITLE>





<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is extending the review period for an additional 90 days for premanufacture notices (PMNs) P-94-1799,
P-94-1800, and P-94-1801, under the authority of section 5(c) of the Toxic Substances Control
Act (TSCA). The review period will now expire on December 27, 1994. 




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On July 1, 1994, EPA received PMNs P-94-1799, P-94-1800, and P-94-1801 for three
substances, identified as 1-amino-2-butanol; 1,1' aminodi-2-butanol; and 1,1',1'' Nitrilotri-2-butanol. The
submitter claimed as confidential business information: The production volume, manufacturing process information,
and some other information. Notice of receipt of the premanufacture notice has not yet been published in the 

Federal Register

. The original 90-day review period under section 5(a)(1) of the TSCA was scheduled to expire on September 28,
1994. With this extension under section 5(c) of the TSCA, the 90-day review period is now scheduled to expire
on December 27, 1994.



Based on its analysis, EPA finds that there is a possibility that the substances submitted for review in these PMNs
may be regulated under TSCA. The PMN substances appear to meet the Agency's exposure-based criteria under section
5(e)(1)(A)(ii)(II) in that there may be substantial human exposure to these substances in the form of chronic inhalation
by a large number of workers. The Agency requires an extension of the review period, as authorized by section 5(c) of
TSCA, to investigate further potential risk, to examine its regulatory options, and to prepare the necessary documents,
should regulatory action be required. Therefore, EPA has determined that good cause exists to extend the review period
for an additional 90 days, to December 27, 1994. The PMN substances will be reevaluated once data are received.

PMNs are available for public inspection in the TSCA Nonconfidential Information Center (NCIC), Rm. NE-B607, EPA
headquarters, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC, from 12 noon to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays.

rates, and financial indexes on exchanges previously approved by the Board. Company would not provide FCM services
with respect to foreign currency contracts. BNP also has applied pursuant to section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act, to acquire
Mitsui T&B Futures, Inc., Chicago, Illinois (to be renamed BNP Futures, Inc.), and to provide FCM clearing-only
services with respect to those contracts for which Company would provide execution and advisory services. BNP would
engage in these activities on a worldwide basis.
Section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act provides that a bank holding company may, with Board approval, engage in any activity
which the Board, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, has determined (by order or regulation) to be so closely
related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. This statutory test requires
that two separate tests be met for an activity to be permissible for a bank holding company. First, the Board must determine
that the activity is, as a general matter, closely related to banking. Second, the Board must find in a particular case
that the performance of the activity by the applicant bank holding company may reasonably be expected to produce public
benefits that outweigh possible adverse effects.
A particular activity may be found to meet the ``closely related to banking'' test if it is demonstrated that banks
generally have provided the proposed activity, that banks generally provide services that are operationally or
functionally similar to the proposed activity so as to equip them particularly well to provide the proposed activity,
or that banks generally provide services that are so integrally related to the proposed activity as to require their
provision in a specialized form. 

National Courier Ass'n v. Board of Governors

, 516 F.2d 1229, 1237 (D.C. Cir. 1975). In addition, the Board may consider any other basis that may demonstrate that
the activity has a reasonable or close relationship to banking or managing or controlling banks. Board Statement
Regarding Regulation Y, 49 FR 806 (1984).
BNP states that the Board previously has determined by Regulation that certain of the proposed activities, when conducted
within limitations established by the Board in its regulations and in related interpretations and orders, are closely
related to banking for purposes of section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act. 

See

 12 CFR 225.25(b)(15) (full-service securities brokerage); 12 CFR (b)(4) (investment advisory services); 12 CFR
225.25(b)(7), 

Citicorp

, 72 Federal Reserve Bulletin 497 (1986), and 

Citicorp

, 68 Federal Reserve Bulletin 505 (1982) (data processing services).
BNP also maintains that the Board has determined by order that several of the other proposed activities, when conducted
within the limitations established by the Board in previous orders, are closely related to banking. 

See Sakura Bank, Limited

, 79 Federal Reserve Bulletin 723 (1993) (providing execution-only, clearing-only, and investment advisory services,
and buying and selling contracts through omnibus accounts, with respect to financial futures and options on futures);


Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation

, 75 Federal Reserve Bulletin 217 (1989), and 

Nippon Credit Bank, Ltd.

, 75 Federal Reserve Bulletin 308 (1989) (proprietary trading of futures and options on foreign exchange for nonhedging
and hedging purposes); 

Swiss Bank

, 77 Federal Reserve Bulletin 126 (1991), and 

Societe Generale

, 76 Federal Reserve Bulletin 776 (1990) (acting as a specialist and registered options trader on the Philadelphia
Stock Exchange). BNP maintains that Company and BNP Futures, Inc. would conduct these previously approved activities
in conformance with the conditions and limitations established by the Board in prior cases.
In order to approve the proposal, the Board must determine that the proposed activities to be conducted by Company
and BNP Futures, Inc. ``can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience,
increased competition, or gains in efficiency, that outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration
of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices.'' 12 U.S.C.
 1843(c)(8). BNP believes that the proposal will produce public benefits that outweigh any potential adverse effects.
In particular, BNP maintains that the proposal will enhance competition and enable BNP to offer its customers a broader
range of products. In addition, BNP states that the proposed activities will not result in adverse effects such as
an undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, or unsound banking
practices.
In publishing the proposal for comment, the Board does not take a position on issues raised by the proposal. Notice
of the proposal is published solely to seek the views of interested persons on the issues presented by the application
and does not represent a determination by the Board that the proposal meets, or is likely to meet, the standards of the
BHC Act.
Any comments or requests for hearing should be submitted in writing and received by William W. Wiles, Secretary, Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, D.C. 20551, not later than November 7, 1994. Any request for
a hearing on this application must, as required by  262.3(e) of the Board's Rules of Procedure (12 CFR 262.3(e)), be
accompanied by a statement of the reasons why a written presentation would not suffice in lieu of a hearing, identifying
specifically any questions of fact that are in dispute, summarizing the evidence that would be presented at a hearing,
and indicating how the party commenting would be aggrieved by approval of the proposal. 
This application may be inspected at the offices of the Board of Governors or the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.

In settlement of alleged violations of federal law prohibiting unfair acts and practices and unfair methods of competition,
this consent agreement, accepted subject to final Commission approval, would prohibit, among other things, a Stamford,

evidence.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Agreement Containing Consent Order To Cease and Desist



In the matter of: The American Tobacco Company, a corporation.




The Federal Trade Commission having initiated an investigation of certain acts and practices of The American Tobacco
Company, a corporation, and it now appearing that The American Tobacco Company, a corporation (hereinafter sometimes
referred to as ``proposed respondent''), is willing to enter into an agreement containing an order to cease and desist
from the use of the acts and practices being investigated,




It is hereby agreed

 by and between The American Tobacco Company, by its duly authorized officer, and counsel for the Federal Trade Commission
that:


1. Proposed respondent The American Tobacco Company is a corporation organized, existing and doing business under
and by virtue of the laws of the State of Delaware, with its office and principal place of business located at 281 Tresser
Boulevard, in the City of Stamford, State of Connecticut.

2. Proposed respondent admits all the jurisdictional facts set forth in the draft of complaint here attached.

3. Proposed respondent waives:

a. Any further procedural steps;

b. The requirement that the Commission's decision contain a statement of findings of fact and conclusions of law;

c. All rights to seek judicial review or otherwise to challenge or contest the validity of the order entered pursuant
to this agreement; and

d. All claims under the Equal Access to Justice Act.

4. This agreement shall not become part of the public record of the proceeding unless and until it is accepted by the
Commission. If this agreement is accepted by the Commission, it, together with the draft of complaint contemplated
thereby, will be placed on the public record for a period of sixty (60) days and information in respect thereto publicly
released. The Commission thereafter may either withdraw its acceptance of this agreement and so notify the proposed
respondent, in which event it will take such action as it may consider appropriate, or issue and serve its complaint
(in such form as the circumstances may require) and decision, in disposition of the proceeding.

5. This agreement is for settlement purposes only and does not constitute an admission by proposed respondent that
the law has been violated as alleged in the draft of complaint here attached, or that the facts as alleged in the draft
complaint, other than jurisdictional facts, are true.


6. This agreement contemplates that, if it is accepted by the Commission, and if such acceptance is not subsequently
withdrawn by the Commission pursuant to the provisions of  2.34 of the Commission's Rules, the Commission may,
without further notice to proposed respondent, (1) issue its complaint corresponding in form and substance with
the draft of complaint here attached and its decision containing the following order to cease and desist in disposition
of the proceeding and (2) make information public in respect thereto. When so entered, the order to cease and desist
shall have the same force and effect and may be altered, modified or set aside in the same manner and within the same time
provided by statute for other orders. The order shall become final upon service. Delivery by the U.S. Postal Service
of the complaint and decision containing the agreed-to order to proposed respondent's address as stated in this agreement
shall constitute service. Proposed respondent waives any right it may have to any other manner of service. The complaint
may be used in construing the terms of the order, and no agreement, understanding, representation or interpretation
not contained in the order or the agreement may be used to vary or contradict the terms of the order.


7. Proposed respondent has read the proposed complaint and order contemplated hereby. Proposed respondent understands
that once the order has been issued, it will be required to file one or more compliance reports showing that it has fully
complied with the order. Proposed respondent further understands that it may be liable for civil penalties in the
amount provided by law for each violation of the order after it becomes final.

in or affecting commerce, as ``commerce'' is defined in the Federal Trade Commission Act, do forthwith cease and desist
from representing, through the presentation of the tar ratings of any of respondent's brands of cigarettes as a numerical
multiple, fraction or ratio of the tar of any other brand of cigarettes, and/or the visual depiction of ten packs or
a carton of any of respondent's brands versus one pack of any other brand, directly or by implication, that consumers

in any objective manner by persons qualified to do so, using procedures generally accepted in the profession to yield

nicotine ratings of any other brand (with or without an express or implied representation that respondent's brand
is ``low,'' ``lower,'' or ``lowest'' in tar and/or nicotine) shall not be deemed to constitute a numerical multiple,
fraction or ratio and shall not, in and of itself, be deemed to violate Paragraph I or II of this Order where no more than
a single cigarette or pack of respondent's brand is visually depicted versus a single cigarette or pack of any other
brand.



IV





It is further ordered

 that for five (5) years after the last date of dissemination of any representation covered by this Order, respondent

VII





It is further ordered

Analysis of Proposed Consent Order To Aid Public Comment



The Federal Trade Commission has accepted an agreement to a proposed consent order from The American Tobacco Company
(``American Tobacco'').

The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
or make final the agreement's proposed order.

This matter concerns claims made by American Tobacco in its advertising for cigarettes.

The Commission's complaint in this matter charges American Tobacco with engaging in unfair or deceptive practices
in connection with the advertising of its Carlton brand cigarettes. According to the complaint, American Tobacco
falsely represented, through the presentation of the tar of its Carlton product as a numerical multiple, fraction
or ratio of the tar of other brands of cigarettes, and/or the visual depiction of ten packs or a carton of Carlton cigarettes
versus one pack of the other brands: (1) That consumers will get less tar by smoking ten packs of Carlton brand cigarettes
than by smoking a single pack of the other brands of cigarettes depicted in the ads, which are rated as having more than
10 mg. of tar; and (2) that it had a reasonable basis for claims that consumers will get less tar by smoking ten packs of
Carlton brand cigarettes than by smoking a single pack of the other brands of cigarettes depicted in the ads.

The consent order contains provisions designed to remedy the violations charged and to prevent American Tobacco
from engaging in similar deceptive and unfair acts and practices in the future.

Part I of the order prohibits American Tobacco from representing, through certain means specified in the order, that
consumers will get less tar by smoking ten packs of any cigarette rated as having 1 mg. of tar than by smoking a single
pack of any other brand of cigarettes that is rated as having more than 10 mg. of tar.

Part II of the order prohibits American Tobacco from representing, through those same means, that consumers will
get less tar or nicotine by smoking any number of cigarettes (or packs or cartons of cigarettes) of any of respondent's
brands than by smoking one or more cigarettes (or packs or cartons of cigarettes) of any other brand, unless, the representation
is true and, at the time it makes such claims, American Tobacco has competent and reliable scientific evidence to substantiate
the claims.

Part III of the order provides a limited ``safe harbor'' for advertising that complies with certain specific requirements
in its use of official tar and nicotine ratings. Specifically, presentation of the tar and/or nicotine ratings of
any of American Tobacco's brands of cigarettes and the tar and/or nicotine ratings of any other brand shall not, in
and of itself, be deemed to violate Part I or Part II of the order where no more than a single cigarette or pack or American
Tobacco's brand is visually depicted versus a single cigarette or pack of any other brand.

Part IV of the order requires American Tobacco to maintain copies of all materials relied upon in making any representations
covered by the order, as well as all materials that contradict or call into question those representations.

Part V of the order requires American Tobacco to distribute copies of the order to each of its operating divisions and
to various officers, agents, representatives or employees of American Tobacco.

Part VI of the order requires American Tobacco to notify the Commission of any changes in corporate structure that
might affect compliance with the order.

Part VII of the order requires American Tobacco to file with the Commission one or more reports detailing compliance
with the order.

The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed order, and it is not intended to constitute
an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed order, or to modify any of their terms.

Agreement Containing Consent Order



The Federal Trade Commission (``Commission'') having initiated an investigation of the proposed acquisition by
Sulzer Limited (``Sulzer'') of all of the assets of the Metco Division of The Perkin-Elmer Corporation (``Metco''),
and it now appearing that Sulzer, hereinafter sometimes referred to as ``proposed respondent'', is willing to enter
into an Agreement Containing Consent Order (``Agreement'') to divest certain assets, cease and desist from certain
acts, and to provide for certain other relief,

It is hereby agreed by and between Sulzer, by its duly authorized officers and its attorneys, and counsel for the Commission
that:

1. Proposed respondent is a corporation organized, existing, and doing business under and by virtue of the laws of
Switzerland, with its principal offices located at CH-8401, Winterthur, Switzerland.

2. Proposed respondent admits all the jurisdictional facts set forth in the draft of complaint here attached.

3. Proposed respondent waives:

a. Any further procedural steps;

b. The requirement that the Commission's decision contain a statement of findings of fact and conclusions of law;

c. All rights to seek judicial review or otherwise to challenge or contest the validity of the order entered pursuant
to this agreement; and

d. Any claim under the Equal Access to Justice Act.

4. This agreement shall not become part of the public record of the proceedings unless and until it is accepted by the
Commission. If this agreement is accepted by the Commission it, together with the draft of complaint contemplated
thereby, will be placed on the public record for a period of sixty (60) days and information in respect thereto publicly
released. The Commission thereafter may either withdraw its acceptance of this agreement and so notify the proposed
respondent, in which event it will take such action as it may consider appropriate, or issue and serve its complaint
(in such form as the circumstances may require) and decision, in disposition of the proceeding.
5. This agreement is for settlement purposes only and does not constitute an admission by the proposed respondent
that the law has been violated as alleged in the draft of complaint here attached, or that the facts as alleged in the
draft complaint, other than jurisdictional facts, are true.

6. This agreement contemplates that, if it is accepted by the Commission, and if such acceptance is not subsequently
withdrawn by the Commission pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.34 of the Commission's Rules, the Commission
may, without further notice to the proposed respondent, (1) issue its complaint corresponding in form and substance
with the draft of complaint here attached and its decision containing the following Order to divest and to cease and
desist in disposition of the proceeding, and (2) make information public with respect thereto. When so entered, the
Order shall have the same force and effect and may be altered, modified, or set aside in the same manner and within the
same time provided by statute for other orders. The Order shall become final upon service. Delivery by the United States
Postal Service of the complaint and decision containing the agreed-to Order to proposed respondent's U.S. counsel
as stated in this agreement shall constitute service. Proposed respondent waives any right it may have to any other
manner of service. The complaint may be used in construing the terms of the Order, and no agreement, understanding,
representation, or interpretation not contained in the Order or the agreement may be used to vary or contradict the
terms of the Order.
7. Proposed respondent has read the draft of complaint and Order contemplated hereby. Proposed respondent understands
that once the Order has been issued, it will be required to file one or more compliance reports showing that it has fully
complied with the Order. Proposed respondent further understands that it may be liable for civil penalties in the

to Section 5 (

l

) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. 45(

l

), or any other statute enforced by the Commission, Sulzer shall consent to the appointment of a trustee in such action.
Neither the appointment of a trustee nor a decision not to appoint a trustee under this Paragraph shall preclude the
Commission or the Attorney General from seeking civil penalties or any other relief available to it, including a court-appointed
trustee, pursuant to Section 5 (

l

) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, or any other statute enforced by the Commission, for any failure by respondent
to comply with this Order.


B. If a trustee is appointed by the Commission or a court pursuant to Paragraph III.A. of this Order, respondent shall
consent to the following terms and conditions regarding the trustee's powers, duties, authority, and responsibilities:


1. The Commission shall select the trustee, subject to the consent of Sulzer, which consent shall not be unreasonably

If respondent has not opposed, in writing, including the reasons for opposing, the selection of any proposed trustee
within ten (10) days after notice by the staff of the Commission to respondent of the identity of any proposed trustee,
respondent shall be deemed to have consented to the selection of the proposed trustee.


2. Subject to the prior approval of the Commission, the trustee shall have the exclusive power and authority to divest
both the Amdry 2010 Information and the Metco 601 Information and to take all such steps as may be feasible and necessary
to assist the acquirer of the Amdry 2010 Information and the Metco 601 Information to receive all product approvals
from the original equipment manufacturers necessary for the purchase of an Amdry 2010 Equivalent or a Metco 601 Equivalent
by such manufacturer or by any other person pursuant to standards and qualifications established by such manufacturer.
Such assistance shall include but not be limited to the following:


a. Requiring respondent to pay all costs of testing by or for the original equipment manufacturers for product approvals

4. From the date of appointment, the trustee shall have twelve (12) months to divest both the Amdry 2010 Information
and the Metco 601 Information, to provide all additional assistance reasonably necessary to the acquirer, and to
submit affidavits to the Commission from each of the original equipment manufacturers certifying that each has individually
approved the Amdry 2010 Equivalent or the Metco 601 Equivalent manufactured by the Commisssion-approved acquirer
of the Amdry 2010 Information and the Metco 601 Information for all uses for which Amdry 2010 or Metco 601 is approved
by such original equipment manufacturer, and if such affidavits are not submitted, the trustee shall have an additional
six (6) months thereafter to accomplish the divestiture of both the Amdry 2010 Information and the Metco 601 Information,
to provide the additional assistance, and to submit the affidavits. If, however, at the end of the additional six (6)
month period, the trustee believes that the original equipment manufacturers will approve the Amdry 2010 Equivalent
or the Metco 601 Equivalent manufactured by the Commission-approved acquirer of the Amdry 2010 Information and the
Metco 601 Information for all uses for which Amdry 2010 or Metco 601 is approved by such original equipment manufacturer,
and will submit said affidavits to the Commission within a reasonable time, the time period for approvals and submission
of affidavits may be extended by the Commission, or, in the case of a court-appointed trustee, by the court; provided,
however, the Commission may extend this period only two (2) times.
5. The trustee shall have full and complete access to the personnel, books, records and facilities related to the Amdry
2010 Information and the Metco 601 Information, or to any other relevant information, as the trustee may request.
Respondent shall develop such financial or other information as such trustee may request and shall cooperate with
the trustee. Respondent shall take no action to interfere with or impede the trustee's accomplishment of the divestiture
of the Amdry 2010 Information and the Metco 601 Information, the provision of additional assistance to the acquirer,
and the approval of the Amdry 2010 Equivalent or the Metco 601 Equivalent by the original equipment manufacturers.
Any delays caused by the respondent shall extend the time for the divestiture of the Amdry 2010 Information and the
Metco 601 Information, the additional assistance to the acquirer, and the approvals by the original equipment manufacturers,
under this Paragraph in an amount equal to the delay, as determined by the Commission, or, for a court-appointed trustee,
by the court.
6. The trustee shall use his or her best efforts to negotiate the most favorable price and terms available in each contract
that is submitted to the Commission, subject to respondent's absolute and unconditional obligation to divest at
no minimum price. If the trustee receives bona fide offers from more than one acquiring entity, and if the Commission
determines to approve more than one such acquiring entity, the trustee shall divest to the acquiring entity or such
entities selected by respondent from among those approved by the Commission.
7. The trustee shall serve, without bond or other security, at the cost and expense of respondent, on such reasonable
and customary terms and conditions as the Commission or a court may set. The trustee shall have the authority to employ,
at the cost and expense of respondent, such consultants, accountants, attorneys, investment bankers, business
brokers, appraisers, and other representatives and assistants as are necessary to carry out the trustee's duties
and responsibilities. The trustee shall account for all monies derived from the divestiture and all expenses incurred.
After approval by the Commission and, in the case of a court-appointed trustee, by the court, of the account of the trustee,
including fees for his or her services, all remaining monies shall be paid at the direction of Sulzer and the trustee's
power shall be terminated. The trustee's compensation shall be based at least in significant part on a commission
arrangement contingent on the trustee's divestiture of the Amdry 2010 Information and the Metco 601 Information
and submission of the required affidavits from the original equipment manufacturers.
8. Respondent shall indemnify the trustee and hold the trustee harmless against any losses, claims, damages, or liabilities
arising out of, or in connection with, the performance of the trustee's duties, including all reasonable fees of counsel
and other expenses incurred in connection with the preparation for, or defense of any claim, whether or not resulting
in any liability, except to the extent that such liabilities, losses, damages, claims, or expenses result from misfeasance,
gross negligence, willful or wanton acts, or bad faith by the trustee.
9. If the trustee ceases to act or fails to act diligently, a substitute trustee shall be appointed in the same manner
as provided in this Paragraph of this Order.
10. The Commission or, in the case of a court-appointed trustee, the court, may on its own initiative or at the request
of the trustee issue such additional orders or directions as may be necessary or appropriate to accomplish the divestiture
of the Amdry 2010 Information and the Metco 601 Information, the provision of all additional assistance reasonably
necessary to the acquirer, and the submission of affidavits by each of the original equipment manufacturers as required
by this Order.
11. The trustee shall have no obligation or authority to operate or maintain the Amdry 2010 Information and the Metco
601 Information.
12. The trustee shall report in writing to respondent and to the Commission every sixty (60) days concerning the trustee's
efforts to accomplish the divestiture.

Anaysis of Proposed Consent Order to Aid Public Comment



The Federal Trade Commission (``Commission'') has provisionally accepted an agreement containing a proposed Consent
Order from Sulzer Limited (``Sulzer''), which requires Sulzer to divest a copy of all product information regarding
Amdry 2010, an aluminum polyester powder, to a Commission-approved acquirer and to assist such acquirer in its efforts
to produce and sell an Amdry 2010 equivalent powder (``Amdry 2010 Equivalent''). 

The proposed Consent Order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
or make final the agreement's proposed Order. 

On April 18, 1994, Sulzer and The Perkin-Elmer Corporation (``Perkin-Elmer'') entered into an agreement whereby
Sulzer agreed to purchase all of the assets of Perkin-Elmer's Metco Division (``Metco''). The proposed complaint
alleges that the proposed acquisition, if consummated, would constitute a violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act,
as amended, 15 U.S.C. 18, and Section 5 of the FTC Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 45, in the market for the manufacture and
sale of aluminum polyester powder in the United States. Sulzer's powder is marketed as Amdry 2010 and Metco's powder
is marketed as Metco 601. The proposed Consent Order would remedy the alleged violation by requiring Sulzer to establish
a new competitor in the business of manufacturing and selling aluminum polyester powder and to assist such competitor
to receive the necessary product approvals from three original equipment manufacturers (``OEMs''). Thus, Sulzer
will be required to replace the competition lost due to its acquisition of Metco.

The proposed Consent Order provides that within six (6) months of the Order becoming final, Sulzer shall divest to
a Commission-approved acquirer a copy of all information necessary to purchase ingredients for, manufacture, and
sell aluminum polyester powder (Amdry 2010 Information'') and to assist such acquirer in its efforts to manufacture
an equivalent aluminum polyester powder. The divestiture of the Amdry 2010 Information shall be made only to an acquirer
that receives the prior approval of the Commission and only in a manner that receives the prior approval of the Commission.
Sulzer shall provide all additional assistance, information, and know-how reasonably necessary to the acquirer
to help such acquirer receive all product approvals from three OEMs necessary for the purchase of an Amdry 2010 Equivalent
by such OEMs. The three OEMs included in the Order are General Electric Aircraft Engines Division, Textron Lycoming,
and the Garrett Division of Allied Signal. Sulzer shall submit an affidavit from each OEM to the Commission, certifying
that each OEM has either approved the Amdry 2010 Equivalent or approved another person's aluminum polyester powder.

In the event that Sulzer has not divested the Amdry 2010 Information within six (6) months of the date the Order becomes
final, or submitted the required affidavits to the Commission within nine (9) months of the date the Commission approves
the divestiture, then the proposed Consent Order provides that Sulzer shall consent to the appointment by the Commission
of a trustee to divest the Amdry 2010 Information and a copy of all product information relating to Metco 601 (``Metco
601 Information'') to a Commission-approved acquirer. The trustee shall also have the authority to take such steps
as may be feasible and necessary to assist the acquirer to receive approvals from the three OEMs for an Amdry 2010 or
a Metco 601 equivalent powder.

Under the provisions of the Consent Order, Sulzer is also required to provide to the Commission a report of its compliance
with the divestiture provisions of the Order within sixty (60) days following the date this Order becomes final, and
every sixty (60) days thereafter until Sulzer has completely divested the Amdry 2010 Information and submitted the
required affidavits to the Commission, or consented to the appointment of a trustee to do the same. The proposed Order
will also prohibit Sulzer, for a period of ten (10) years, from acquiring, without Federal Trade Commission approval,
any stock in any concern engaged in the manufacture, sale, or distribution of aluminum polyester powder in the United
States, or any assets used for the manufacture, sale, or distribution of aluminum polyester powder in the United States.

One year from the date the Order becomes final and annually thereafter for nine (9) years, Sulzer will be required to
provide to the Commission a report of its compliance with the Consent Order. The Consent Order also requires Sulzer
to notify the Commission at least thirty (30) days prior to any change in the structure of Sulzer resulting in the emergence
of a successor.

The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed Order, and it is not intended to constitute
an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed Order or to modify in any way their terms.

ACTION:

 Notice. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, proposes that a portion of a land withdrawal continue for an additional

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Forest Service proposes that the existing land withdrawal made by Public Land Order No. 2974 be continued for a

The area described contains 10 acres in Grant County.

 

The purpose of the withdrawal is to protect the Crescent Campground located approximately 15 miles southeast of Prairie

Service requests no change in the purpose or segregative effect of the withdrawal. 
For a period of 90 days from the date of publication of this notice, all persons who wish to submit comments, suggestions,
or objections in connection with the proposed withdrawal continuation may present their views in writing to the undersigned

The authorized officer of the Bureau of Land Management will undertake such investigations as are necessary to determine
the existing and potential demand for the land and its resources. A report will also be prepared for consideration
by the Secretary of the Interior, the President and Congress, who will determine whether or not the withdrawal will
be continued and if so, for how long. The final determination on the continuation of the withdrawal will be published
in the

The Medicine Shoppe Denial of Application



On September 16, 1993, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to The Medicine Shoppe (Respondent), of Newnan, Georgia, proposing to deny its
application for a DEA Certificate of Registration as a retail pharmacy. The Order to Show Cause alleged that Respondent's
registration would be inconsistent with the public interest as that term is used in 21 U.S.C. 823(f). Specifically,
the Order to Show Cause alleged that: Vincent Ehule (Mr. Ehule) was the majority stockholder and president of Respondent's
predecessor pharmacy, Real Vitality, Inc., d/b/a All In One Stop Pharmacy (All In One Stop Pharmacy); Yvonne Ehule,
Mr. Ehule's wife was the minority stockholder of All In One Stop Pharmacy; in 1992, DEA commenced an investigation
of All In One Stop Pharmacy, including an audit for the period September 1990 to September 1992, which revealed substantial
shortages of Schedule III and IV controlled substances; the investigation also revealed that Mr. Ehule had no initial
inventory and that he dispensed large quantities of controlled substances pursuant to prescriptions which he knew,
or should have known, were fraudulent; by letter dated November 11, 1992, Mr. Ehule notified DEA that All In One Stop
Pharmacy changed its location to 97 Temple Avenue, Newnan, Georgia, and was renamed The Medicine Shoppe (Respondent);
in this same letter Mr. Ehule requested a transfer of his registration under the same corporate ownership, i.e. Real
Vitality, Inc.; in response to this letter, DEA indicated that it would initiate proceedings to deny the modification
and revoke All In One Stop Pharmacy's DEA registration; and subsequently DEA received an application for registration
from Yvonne Ehule on behalf of Respondent, dated July 30, 1993.

The Order to Show Cause was sent to Respondent by registered mail. Respondent timely requested a hearing. After the
Government filed its Prehearing Statement, Respondent waived the hearing but requested that Respondent's statements
in its request for a hearing be considered in rendering a final decision regarding its application for a new registration.
Based upon 1301.54(c), Respondent is deemed to have waived its opportunity for a hearing. Accordingly, the Deputy
Administrator now enters his final order in this matter without a hearing and based upon the investigative file and
the material submitted in Respondent's request for hearing. 21 CFR 1301.57.

Respondent's predecessor, Real Vitality, Inc., d/b/a All In One Stop Pharmacy, possessed DEA Certificate of Registration,
BR2400339. In May of 1992, an investigation of All In One Stop Pharmacy commenced when DEA investigators obtained
information from informants that Mr. Ehule, the majority owner and the head pharmacist of All In One Stop Pharmacy,
dispensed controlled substances to customers without a valid prescription and that Mr. Ehule dispensed controlled
substances in excess of what was legitimately prescribed. As a result, DEA investigators executed an administrative
inspection warrant at All In One Stop Pharmacy on September 18, 1992. The inspection revealed that All In One Stop Pharmacy
had no initial or biennial controlled substance inventories.

In addition, a review of the controlled substance prescriptions at All In One Stop Pharmacy revealed that 12 prescriptions
were not dated; 11 had no patient address indicated; 15 had no practitioner's signature; 88 failed to record the practitioner's
address; 37 did not have DEA registrations numbers; 78 Schedule III and IV controlled substance prescriptions were
interspersed among non-controlled prescriptions and were not stamped with letter ``C''; 19 original prescriptions
did indicate the date of dispensing; 6 refills were also not dated dispensed; 66 prescriptions had no initials of the
dispensing pharmacist; 137 refills were not initialed by the dispensing pharmacist; one prescription for a Schedule
III controlled substance had an annotation that it had been refilled eleven times and four of those refills were for
100 dosage units more than authorized by the original prescription; and three other prescriptions were filled more
than five times within a six month period.

An accountability audit of All In One Stop Pharmacy's controlled substances for the period of August 27, 1990 through
September 18, 1992, was conducted. The audit revealed shortages of controlled substances including approximately:
6,500 dosage units of Schedule II controlled substances; 2,450 dosage units of Schedule IV controlled substances;
and 27 ounces of Schedule III liquid form controlled substances.

During the inspection, Mr. Ehule explained to the investigators that controlled substance invoices were interspersed
with non-controlled substance purchases and that he did not believe he had all the controlled substance invoices
for the last two years. The DEA investigators had to assume a zero beginning inventory because Mr. Ehule did not have
a current biennial inventory. In light of the zero beginning inventory and the fact that All In One Stop Pharmacy did
not have records of all purchases of controlled substances during the audit period, the shortages, in all likelihood,
were understated.

After conducting the audit, DEA investigators interviewed over 30 practitioners whose names appeared on the 172
prescriptions removed from All In One Stop Pharmacy during the administrative inspection. Based upon these interviews,
the investigators found that only 55 of these controlled substance prescriptions were authorized. Many prescriptions
had been refilled without any authorization and had been refilled in excess of what was authorized. In some cases the
prescriptions were filled with a higher strength of the controlled substance than originally prescribed. Other
prescriptions were filled with completely different controlled substances than what were authorized on the prescriptions.

Many of the physicians and dentists, who were interviewed, indicated they never saw the patients in question. Many
others indicated that they never saw the patient on the day in question and in some cases the practitioner had not seen
the patient for over a year. In many instances, the practitioners were able to identify the signatures on the prescriptions
as obvious forgeries. A number of the prescriptions indicated DEA registration numbers that were not assigned to
the practitioner who ostensibly signed them. 

Prior to the audit, a person acting in an undercover capacity presented a controlled substance prescription to Mr.
Ehule. This prescription, which was one of the prescriptions recovered during the administrative inspection, was
filled by Mr. Ehule, despite the fact that the practitioner's name and DEA number were fictitious. 

At the time of the audit, Mr. Ehule indicated to the investigators that he was planning on closing All In One Stop Pharmacy
which was incorporated under Real Vitality, Inc. Mr. Ehule owned 60% of Real Vitality, Inc. stock and he operated the
pharmacy. Mrs. Ehule owned 40% of the stock and she operated the other part of the store, which consisted of food and
other convenience items. 

On November 11, 1992, Mr. Ehule wrote DEA requesting that the Certificate of Registration issued to Real Vitality,
Inc., (d/b/a All In One Stop Pharmacy) be transferred to The Medicine Shoppe (Respondent), 97 Temple Avenue, Newnan,
Georgia. The corporate owner, Real Vitality, Inc., in which Mr. Ehule was the majority stockholder, remained the
same. In response to this request, DEA notified Mr. Ehule that it planned to initiate proceedings to revoke his current
DEA number and to deny the request for modification. Since Mr. Ehule discontinued business at his original location,
All In One Stop Pharmacy, the DEA registration for that location terminated pursuant to 21 CFR 1301.62. 

Shortly thereafter, DEA learned that in April 1993, Real Vitality, Inc. sold Respondent to Mr. Ehule's wife, Yvonne
Ehule. DEA then received a new application for registration of Respondent, which was operating as The Medicine Shoppe
and owned by Real Vitality, Inc. It was signed by Mrs. Ehule and dated July 30, 1993. 

Subsequently, DEA investigators determined that Mr. Ehule continued to work as a pharmacist at Respondent. The Georgia
State Board of Pharmacy granted a state controlled substance license to Respondent, based upon the transfer of ownership
of Respondent from Mr. Ehule to Mrs. Ehule. On three occasions, between August 1993 and October 1993, Mr. Ehule accepted
call-in prescriptions for controlled substances even though Respondent was not authorized by DEA to handle controlled
substances. Mr. Ehule then arranged to have another pharmacy fill these prescriptions. 

DEA investigators also uncovered various documents relating to Respondent which revealed that Mr. Ehule has a significant
interest in Respondent. Respondent is a franchise of the Medicine Shoppe International, Inc. (franchisor). On August
25, 1992, Mr. Ehule, as President of Real Vitality, Inc., signed a franchise contract with the franchisor. Both Mr.
and Mrs. Ehule are listed as guarantors of this contract. The credit and security agreement between Real Vitality,
Inc. and the franchisor, dated October 5, 1992, designates Mr. Ehule, as well as Mrs. Ehule, as the shareholders of
Real Vitality, Inc. and all licensing fees are designated to be drawn from Mr. and Mrs. Ehule's joint checking account.
On April 6, 1993, Real Vitality, Inc. assigned its interest in the franchising agreement to Mrs. Ehule. The assignment,
however, provides that Mr. Ehule is not released from the terms and conditions of the agreement. 

Mr. Ehule is listed as the sole lessee for the property of Respondent. The period of the lease agreement is effective
from October 12, 1992 through September 30, 2002. By letter, dated October 26, 1993, the president of the leasing company
stated that Mr. Ehule had not notified the company of any change of ownership of Respondent. Additionally, any change
by way of sublease would not release Mr. Ehule from the terms and conditions of the lease. 

The franchisor also agreed to a financing loan for Respondent and secured such loan using Mr. and Mrs. Ehule's personal
residence as well as the pharmacy, All In One Stop Pharmacy, that Mr. Ehule closed before opening Respondent in Newnan,
Georgia. Again, Mr. Ehule, as well as Mrs. Ehule, signed this agreement and the security deed. 

In evaluating whether Respondent's registration by the Drug Enforcement Administration would be inconsistent
with the public interest, the Deputy Administrator considers the factors enumerated in 21 U.S.C. 823(f). They are
as follows: 
(1) The recommendation of the appropriate State licensing board or professional disciplinary authority. 
(2) The applicant's experience in dispensing, or conducting research with respect to controlled substances. 

(3) The applicant's conviction record under Federal or State laws relating to the manufacture, distribution, or
dispensing of controlled substances. 
(4) Compliance with applicable State, Federal, or local laws relating to controlled substances. 

(5) Such other conduct which may threaten the public health and safety. 

In determining whether a registration would be inconsistent with the public interest, the Deputy Administrator
is not required to make findings with respect to each of the factors listed above. Instead, he has the discretion to
give each factor the weight he deems appropriate, depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case. See David
E. Trawick, D.D.S., 

Docket No. 88-69, 53 FR 5326 (1988).

<TEXT>
 

Factor two applies because Mr. Ehule's experience in dispensing controlled substances was dismal. Based upon the
practitioner interviews, it was established that there were 117 unauthorized controlled substance prescriptions
filled between August 1990 and September 1992. Mr. Ehule's pattern of dispensing without making any bona fide attempts
to verify prescriptions was confirmed when an undercover person presented Mr. Ehule with a controlled substance
prescription that had entirely fictitious information on it. The unauthorized dispensing was not limited to one
specific problem but included diverse violations such as dispensing unauthorized refills, increasing the dosage
units authorized, increasing the strength of the controlled substance from what was authorized and even dispensing
different types of controlled substances in addition to what was authorized. One prescription for a Schedule III
controlled substance had an annotation that it had been refilled eleven times and four of those refills were for 100
dosage units more than authorized by the original prescription. 
 
Factor four is applicable based upon the numerous violations of controlled substance regulations by Mr. Ehule while
operating the All In One Stop Pharmacy between August 1990 and September 1992. He filled 163 controlled substance
prescriptions which did not include the date, patient information and practitioner information (including prescriptions
which did not even have a DEA number on them) in violation of 21 CFR 1306.05(a). Eighty-five initial prescriptions
either did not have the initials of the dispensing pharmacist or failed to denote a date when the controlled substances
were dispensed in violation of 21 CFR 1304.24(d). Six refill prescriptions did not have the date of refill and 137 refills
did not have the initials of the dispensing pharmacist in violation of 21 CFR 1306.22(a). Seventy-eight Schedule
III and IV controlled substance prescriptions were interspersed with non-controlled substance prescriptions
and did not contain the letter ``C'' in the right hand corner. Thus these prescriptions were not readily retrievable
as required under 21 U.S.C. 827(b) and 21 CFR 1304.04(h)(2). Four controlled substance prescriptions were refilled
more than five times within a six month period in violation of 21 CFR 1306.22(a). In one case, the prescription was refilled
eleven times. The audit revealed over 7,500 shortages of various Schedule III and IV controlled substances.
Under these circumstances, there is no question that had Mr. Ehule simply applied for a transfer of the DEA Certificate
of Registration from All In One Stop Pharmacy to Respondent (The Medicine Shoppe) such transfer would have been denied
and All In One Stop Pharmacy's registration revoked. The issue to be addressed, then, is the effect of the transfer
of Real Vitality, Inc., 


d/b/a Respondent to Mrs. Ehule. Given the circumstances of this transfer, the Deputy Administrator concludes that
the transfer does not protect the public interest and thus, the application must be denied.

The transfer of Respondent to Mr. Ehule's wife occurred shortly after Mr. Ehule was informed that DEA would oppose
the modification and seek revocation of All In One Stop Pharmacy's DEA registration. In addition, Mr. Ehule continued
to operate as Respondent's pharmacist. Moreover, on three occasions, Mr. Ehule accepted controlled substance prescriptions
on behalf of Respondent although he had no authority to do since Respondent was not authorized to handle controlled
substances.

In its request for a hearing, Respondent argues that Mrs. Ehule is the current owner and sole assignee of Respondent
and therefore the application should be granted. Yet Mr. Ehule retains a substantial financial interest in Respondent.
He is liable as a guarantor under the franchising agreement and lease. Respondent also obtained a loan from the franchisor;
the collateral for this loan was the personal residence of Mr. and Mrs. Ehule and the corporation of Respondent, Real
Vitality Inc., in which Mr. Ehule was the majority stockholder.

Respondent offers the assurance in its request for a hearing that Mr. Ehule will not be involved in the ownership of
Respondent. Given Mr. Ehule's substantial financial stake in Respondent, this assurance cannot be realized.

Respondent also maintains that Mrs. Ehule has not been convicted of any offenses relating to controlled substances
and that any errors attributable to Mr. Ehule should not reflect on her fitness to operate the Respondent pharmacy.
While Respondent's former assertion may be true, it is not relevant. The relevant issue is whether Mrs. Ehule will
operate Respondent independently of Mr. Ehule. In this respect Mrs. Ehule has demonstrated that such a scenario is
very unlikely. Under similar circumstances, DEA has denied an application based upon the sale of a retail pharmacy
to a spouse. 

Cumberland Prescription Center,

 Docket No. 86-91, 52 FR 37224 (1987).

Mrs. Ehule owned 40% of All In One Stop Pharmacy and operated the non-pharmacy portion while Mr. Ehule was abusing the
pharmacy's controlled substances privileges. Mrs. Ehule exercised no control whatsoever. Mr. Ehule continued
to operate as a pharmacist of Respondent (and represented that he had legal authority to accept controlled substance
prescriptions when he did not) even after Mrs. Ehule became owner of Respondent. Nothing in the present record gives
the Deputy Administrator any confidence that Mrs. Ehule could or would prevent Mr. Ehule from operating the Respondent
pharmacy, her belated assertions in the request for a hearing notwithstanding. Mrs. Ehule's promises are even more
suspect in the face of the fact that the transfer of ownership to her occurred shortly after Respondent was informed
by DEA that modification of his registration would be opposed. Under these circumstances, there is no assurance whatsoever
that the public interest would be protected if the present application were granted.

No evidence of explanation or mitigating circumstances has been offered by Respondent except the assertions and
objections in its request for a hearing which in no way refute the numerous controlled substance violations that occurred.
The public interest cannot be protected by granting Respondent a registration in light of Mr. Ehule's involvement
with Respondent. Therefore, the Deputy Administrator concludes that Respondent's application for a DEA Certification
Registration must be denied.

Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested
in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104 (59 FR 23637), hereby orders that the application executed
by The Medicine Shoppe, on July 30, 1993, for a DEA Certificate of Registration as a retail pharmacy, be, and it hereby
is, denied. This order is effective October 13, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>In the Matter of Duke Power Company (McGuire Nuclear Station Units 1 and 2); Exemption</DOCTITLE>



I



The Duke Power Company (the licensee) is the holder of Facility Operating License Nos. NPR-9 and NPF-17,
which authorize operation of the McGuire Nuclear Station, Units 1 and 2, respectively. The licenses provide, among
other things, that the licensee is subject to all rules, regulations, and orders of the Commission now or hereafter
in effect.

The facilities consist of two pressurized water reactors, McGuire Nuclear Station, Units 1 and 2, at the licensee's
site located in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina.



II



Title 10 CFR 50.60, ``Acceptance Criteria for Fracture Prevention Measures for Light-water Nuclear Power Reactors
for Normal Operation,'' states that all light-water nuclear power reactors must meet the fracture toughness and
material surveillance program requirements for the reactor coolant pressure boundary as set forth in appendices
G and H to 10 CFR part 50. Apendix G to 10 CFR part 50 defines pressure/temperature (P/T) limits during any condition
of normal operation, including anticipated operational occurrences and system hydrostatic tests to which the pressure
boundary may be subjected over its service lifetime. 10 CFR 50.60(b) specifies that alternatives to the described
requirements in appendices G and H to 10 CFR part 50 may be used when an exemption is granted by the Commission under 10
CFR 50.12. 

To prevent low temperature overpressure transients that would produce pressure excursions exceeding the appendix
G P/T limits while the reactor is operating at low temperatures, the licensee installed a low temperature overpressure
(LTOP) system. The system includes pressure-relieving devices called Power-Operated Relief Valves (PORVs). The
PORVs are set at a pressure low enough so that if an LTOP transient occurred, the mitigation system would prevent the
pressure in the reactor vessel from exceeding the appendix G P/T limits. To prevent the PORVs from lifting as a result
of normal operating pressure surges (e.g., reactor coolant pump starting, and shifting operating charging pumps)
with the reactor coolant system in a water solid condition, the operating pressure must be maintained below the PORV
setpoint. In addition, in order to prevent cavitation of a reactor coolant pump, the operator must maintain a differential
pressure across the reactor coolant pump seals. Hence, the licensee must operate the plant in a pressure window that
is defined as the difference between the minimum required pressure to start a reactor coolant pump and the operating
margin to prevent lifting of the PORVs due to normal operating pressure surges. The licensee LTOP analysis indicates
that using the appendix G safety margins to determine the PORV setpoint would result in a pressure setpoint within
its operating window, but there would be no margin for normal operating pressure surges. Therefore, operating with
these limits could result in the lifting of the PORVs and cavitation of the reactor coolant pumps during normal operation.

The licensee proposed that in determining the design setpoint for LTOP events for McGuire Units 1 and 2, the allowable
pressure be determined using the safety margins developed in an alternate methodology in lieu of the safety margins
currently required by appendix G, 10 CFR part 50. Designated Code Case N-514, the proposed alternate methodology
is consistent with guidelines developed by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Working Group on
Operating Plant Criteria to define pressure limits during LTOP events that avoid certain unnecessary operational
restrictions, provide adequate margins against failure of the reactor pressure vessel, and reduce the potential
for unnecessary activation of pressure-relieving devices used for LTOP. Code Case N-514, ``Low Temperature
Overpressure Protection,'' has been approved by the ASME Code Committee. The content of this code case has been incorporated
into appendix G of section XI of the ASME Code and published in the 1993 Addenda to Section XI. The MRC staff is revising
10 CFR 50.55a, which will endorse the 1993 Addenda and appendix G of Section XI into the regulations.

An exemption from 10 CFR 50.60 is required to use the alternate methodology for calculating the maximum allowable
pressure for the LTOP setpoint. By application dated June 28, 1994, the licensee requested an exemption from 10 CFR
50.60 for this purpose.

By letter dated August 18, 1994 (and further clarified by letter dated September 7, 1994), the licensee supplied additional
information that described the use of a secondary side heat source to permit the heatup of the reactor coolant system,
assuming that the exemption was not granted. Since the secondary side heat source could cause primary side transients,
the staff considers the use of a secondary side heat source to be an undesirable method of operation.

III



Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12, the Commission may, upon application by any interested person or upon its own initiative,
grant exemptions, from the requirements of 10 CFR part 50 when (1) the exemptions are authorized by law, will not present
an undue risk to public health or safety, and are consistent with the common defense and security; and (2) when special
circumstances are present. Special circumstances are present whenever, according to 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii), ``Application
of the regulation in the particular circumstance would not serve the underlying purpose of the rule or is not necessary
to achieve the underlying purpose of the rule* * *''.

The underlying purpose of 10 CFR 50.60 Appendix G is to establish fracture toughness requirements for ferritic materials
of pressure-retaining components of the reactor coolant pressure boundary to provide adequate margins of safety
during any condition of normal operation, including anticipated operational occurrences, to which the pressure
boundary may be subjected over its service lifetime. Section IV.A.2 of this appendix requires that the reactor vessel
be operated with P/T limits at least as conservative as those obtained by following the methods of analysis and the
required margins of safety of appendix G of the ASME Code.

Appendix G of the ASME Code requires that the P/T limits be calculated: (a) Using a safety factor of 2 on the principal
membrane (pressure) stresses, (b) assuming a flaw at the surface with a depth of one-quarter 
(1/4) of the vessel wall thickness and a length of six (6) times its depth, and (c) using a conservative fracture toughness
curve that is based on the lower bound of static, dynamic, and crack arrest fracture toughness tests on material similar
to the McGuire reactor vessel material.

In determining the setpoint for LTOP events, the licensee proposed to use safety margins based on an alternate methodology
consistent with the proposed ASME Code Case N-514 guidelines. The ASME Code Case N-514 allows determination
of the setpoint for LTOP events such that the maximum pressure in the vessel would not exceed 110 percent of the P/T limits
of the existing ASME appendix G. This results in a safety factor of 1.8 on the principal membrane stresses. All other
factors, including assumed flaw size and fracture toughness, remain the same. Although this methodology would reduce
the safety factor on the principal membrane stresses, the proposed criteria will provide adequate margins of safety
to the reactor vessel during LTOP transients and will satisfy the underlying purpose of 10 CFR 50.60 for fracture toughness
requirements.

Using the licensee's proposed safety factors instead of appendix G safety factors to calculate the LTOP setpoint
will permit a higher LTOP setpoint than would otherwise be required and will provide added margin to prevent normal
operating surges from lifting the PORVs or cavitation of the reactor coolant pumps.



IV



For the foregoing reasons, the NRC staff has concluded that the Licensee's proposed use of the alternate methodology
in determining the acceptable setpoint for LTOP events will not present an undue risk to public health and safety and
is consistent with the common defense and security. The NRC staff has determined that there are special circumstances
present, as specified in 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2), such that application of 10 CFR 50.60 is not necessary in order to achieve
the underlying purpose of this regulation.

Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12(a), an exemption is authorized by law,
will not endanger life or property or common defense and security, and is, otherwise, in the public interest. Therefore,
the Commission hereby grants the Duke Power Company an exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR 50.60 such that in
determining the setpoint for LTOP events, the appendix G curves for P/T limits are not exceeded by more than 10 percent
in order to be in compliance with these regulations. This exemption is applicable only to LTOP conditions during normal
operation.

Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that the granting of this exemption will not result in any significant
adverse environmental impact. Publication of the Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact
in the 

Federal Register 

was delayed due to circumstances beyond the Commission's control. The Commission has determined that emergency
circumstances exist and therefore is issuing this exemption pursuant to 10 CFR 51.13 and 51.35 without prior publication.
Publication in the 

Federal Register 

will occur on October 3, 1994.

This exemption is effective upon issuance.

<DOCTITLE>Duke Power Company; Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed No Significant
Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing</DOCTITLE>


The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License Nos. NPF-9 and NPF-17 issued to Duke Power Company (the licensee) for operation of the McGuire
Nuclear Station, Units 1 and 2, located in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina.
The proposed amendment would correct a technical deficiency existing in the Technical Specifications (TS) which
has caused difficulty to plant operations when swapping of the NV pumps was needed in Modes 4, 5, and 6. This amendment
is requested to permit flexibility in the operation of the NV pumps during unit startup. McGuire Unit 1 is currently
in cycle 10 startup process.
Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.
The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the
proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee
has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:



1. Basis for Conclusion That the Amendment Would Not Involve a Significant Increase in the Probability or Consequences
of an Accident Previously Evaluated:
No significant increase in probability of an accident previously analyzed will occur. While the probability of the
mass addition pressure transient will increase slightly, this increase is judged to be insignificant due to the short
time of operation with two NV pumps (>15 minutes) and the accompanying TS 3.4.9.3 requirement for two operable
NC system PORVs.
The consequences of the mass addition pressure transient accident will not increase for the same reasons described
above.
2. Basis for Conclusion that the Amendment Would Not Create the Possibility of a New or Different Kind of Accident From
Any Previously Analyzed:
The accident related to the operation of an additional NV pump is the mass addition pressure transient accident as
previously analyzed and documented in the basis for TS 3.1.2.3, 3.1.2.4, and 3.5.3. No other new accident or different
kind of accident will be created by allowing two NV pump operation for 15 minutes via this proposed TS Amendment.
3. Basis for Conclusion That the Amendment Would Not Represent A Significant Reduction in A Margin of Safety:
The margin of safety regarding the mass addition pressure transient will not be appreciably decreased due to the short
duration (>15 minutes) of two NV pump operation combined with the operability of two NC system PORVs required by
TS 3.4.9.3 in Mode 4 (>300
 F). Additionally, the margin of safety will be marginally increased as relates to the NC pump seal failure small
break LOCA due to the increased assurance of NC pump seal flow during NV train swaps.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission
take this action, it will publish in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently.
Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville,
Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the
NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555.

The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.

By November 14, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at Atkins Library, University of North Carolina, Charlotte
(UNCC Station), North Carolina 28223. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above
date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.

As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspects(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.

Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the basis of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue to law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party.
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.

If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held.

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment.

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment.

A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri
1-(800) 342-6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023
and the following message addressed to Herbert N. Berkow, petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition
was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register 

notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,

<DOCTITLE>Northeast Nuclear Energy Company; Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed
No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing</DOCTITLE>




The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. DPR-65, issued to Northeast Nuclear Energy Company (NNECO/the licensee), for operation of the
Millstone Nuclear Power Station, Unit No. 2, located in New London County, Connecticut.

The proposed amendment would revise the Technical Specifications (TS) by adding a footnote to Surveillance Requirement
(SR) 4.6.1.2.d that defers the performance of Type B and C containment leak rate tests to the end of the twelfth refueling
outage.

On September 24, 1994, NNECO requested the NRC to exercise its discretion not to enforce compliance with the required
actions for Millstone Unit 2 Limiting Conditions for Operations (LCOs) 3.6.1.1 and 3.6.1.2 for the remainder of Cycle
12 operations. The enforcement discretion would permit NNECO to operate Millstone Unit 2 while the proposed amendment
is being processed. Millstone Unit 2 was scheduled to begin its refueling outage on October 1, and to enter Mode 5 on
October 3, 1994. On September 23, 1994, NNECO discovered that Type B and C containment leak rate tests for certain containment
penetrations had not been performed within the 24 months as required by SR 4.6.1.2.d. The specific Action Statement
for LCO 3.6.1.2. applies and requires that containment integrity to be restored within 1 hour or place the plant in
hot standby within the next 6 hours, and in cold shutdown within the following 30 hours. Since SR 4.6.1.2.d was inadvertently
missed, SR 4.0.3 was invoked at approximately 1 p.m. on September 23, 1994. This SR permits the action requirements
to be delayed for up to 24 hours to permit the completion of a missed surveillance when the allowable outage time limits
of the action requirements are less than 24 hours. Since the Type C test cannot be performed while at power and the Type
B tests that have exceeded the 24-month period cannot be completed within the 24-hour window, Millstone Unit 2 would
have been forced to shutdown to comply with the requirements of the Millstone Unit 2 TS.

The NRC staff granted orally on September 24, 1994, NNECO's request for enforcement discretion associated with Action
Statements of LCOs 3.6.1.1. and 3.6.1.2. to be effective until the proposed amendment would be issued. This enforcement
discretion was confirmed by the NRC letter to NNECO dates September 30, 1994.

Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.

Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.91(a)(6) for amendment to be granted under exigent circumstances, the NRC staff must determine
that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations
in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve
a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the
possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant
reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue
of no significant hazards (SHC) consideration, which is presented below:

The proposed changes do not involve a SHC because the changes would not:




1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed.

The proposed change to Surveillance Requirement 4.6.1.2.d of the Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical Specifications
will extend the frequency for the Type B and C tests that were due between June 2 and September 1, 1994, to the end of the
twelfth refueling outage. This change will allow Millstone Unit No. 2 to continue to operate until the plant conducts
an orderly shutdown for the next refueling outage. This proposal does not modify the maximum allowable leakage rate
at the calculated peak containment pressure, does not impact the design basis of the containment, and does not change
the post-accident containment response.

On February 8, 1988, NNECO conducted the first Type A test for the Millstone Unit No. 2 present 10-year service period.
The test passed the ``As-Found'' and ``As-Left'' ILRTs. The ``As-Found'' leakage result was 0.201 weight percent
per day and the ``As-Left'' leakage result was 0.138 weight percent per day. These values represent 53.6% of 36.8%
of the Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical Specification Limit of 0.75 L

a

 (0.375 weight percent per day, based on an L

a

 equal to 0.5 weight percent per day), respectively. The second Type A test for the present 10-year service period was
conducted on December 24, 1992. The ``As-Found'' and ``As-Left'' ILRT results were 0.2809 and 0.2577 weight percent
per day, respectively. This values represent 74.9% and 68.7% of the Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical Specification
limit of 0.75L

a

 (0.375 weight percent per day, based on an L

a

 equal to 0.5 weight percent per day). In addition, as of December 1992, the total Type B and C ``As-Found'' and ``As-Left''
leakage results were 0.049 and 0.008 weight percent per day, respectively. These values represent 16.3% and 2.7%
of the Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical Specification limit of 0.6 L

a

 (0.3 weight percent per day, based on an L

a

 equal to 0.5 weight percent per day), respectively. The results of these tests demonstrate that Millstone Unit No.
2 has maintained control of containment integrity by maintaining a conservative margin between the acceptance criterion
and the ``As-Found'' and ``As-Left'' leakage rates.

During the past two refueling outages, there have been few failures of penetrations/values to pass their LLRTs. During
the 1992 and 1990 refueling outages, there were a total of five failures (four in 1992 and one in 1990) of penetrations/valves
to pass their LLRTs. Of these failures, only one (penetration 23/72 with valves MS-191B and MS-220B) was
a repeat failure. This penetration was tested successfully approximately five months ago.

During Cycle 12, maintenance has been performed on several penetrations/valves. Their operability has been assured
by the performance of post-maintenance LLRTs which demonstrated that the leakage from the penetrations/valves
were within their acceptance criteria.

Additionally, the 48 Type B penetrations (electrical) and 21 Type C penetrations (valves) that are currently outside
of the 24 month interval have each passed their last two ``As-Found'' tests, as a minimum. These results indicate that
the penetration/valves are reliable.

Based on the above, the proposed change to Surveillance Requirement 4.6.1.2.d of the Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical
Specifications does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
analyzed.

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed.

The proposed change to Surveillance Requirement 4.6.2.1.d of the Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical Specifications
will extend the frequency for the Type B and C tests that were due between June 2 and September 1, 1994, to the end of the
twelfth refueling outage. This change will allow Millstone Unit No. 2 to continue to operate until the plant conducts
an orderly shutdown for the next refueling outage. This proposal does not make any physical or operational changes
to existing plant structures, systems, or components, does not modify the maximum allowable leakage rate at the calculated
peak containment pressure, does not impact the design basis of the containment, and does not change the post-accident
containment response.

In addition, the proposed changes do not modify the acceptance criteria for the Type A, B, or C tests. Maintaining the
leakage through the containment boundary to the atmosphere within a specific value ensures that the plant complies
with the requirements of 10CFR100. The containment boundary serves as an accident mitigator; it is not an accident
initiator.

Based on the above, the proposed change to Surveillance Requirement 4.6.1.2.d of the Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical
Specifications does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed.

3. Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
The proposed change to Surveillance Requirement 4.6.1.2.d of the Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical Specifications
will extend the frequency for the Type B and C tests that were due between June 2 and September 1, 1994, to the end of the
twelfth refueling outage. This change will allow Millstone Unit No. 2 to continue to operate until the plant conducts
an orderly shutdown for the twelfth refueling outage. This proposal does not make any physical or operational changes
to existing plant structures, systems, or components, does not modify the containment pressure, does not impact
the design basis of the containment, and does not change the post-accident containment response.
Additionally, the past Type A, B, and C tests have demonstrated the leak-tightness of the containment and the reliability
of the penetrations/valves.
Based on the above, the proposed change to Surveillance Requirement 4.6.1.2.d of the Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical
Specifications does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 15 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 15-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period, such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
15-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission
take this action, it will publish in the 

Federal Register 

a notice of issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take this action will occur very infrequently.
Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register 

notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville
Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the
NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555.
The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.
By November 14, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the Learning Resource Center, Three Rivers Community-Technical
College, Thames Valley Campus, 574 New London Turnpike, Norwich, Connecticut 06360. If a request for a hearing or
petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board,
designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request
and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing
or an appropriate order.
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party.
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.
If the amendment is issued before the expiration of the 30-day hearing period, the Commission will make a final determination
on the issue of no significant hazards consideration. If a hearing is requested, the final determination will serve
to decide when the hearing is held.
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no signficant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment.
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment.
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri
1-(800) 342-6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023
and the following message addressed to Phillip F. McKee, Director, Project Directorate I-4: petitioner's
name and telephone number, date petition was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register 

notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to Ms. L. M. Cuoco, Senior Nuclear Counsel, Northeast Utilities Service Company, Post Office
Box 270, Hartford, CT 06141-0270, attorney for the licensee.
Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the presiding
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the
factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d).
For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment dated September 26, 1994, which
is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street,

AGENCY: 

Pacific Northwest Electric Power and Conservation Planning Council (Northwest Power Planning Council).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed amendments to the Columbia River Basin Fish and Wildlife Program (measures for anadromous fish).






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Pursuant to the Pacific Electric Power Planning and Conservation Act (the Northwest Power Act, 16 U.S.C. section
839, et seq.) the Pacific Northwest Electric Power and Conservation Planning Council (Council) is proposing amendments
to the anadromous fish provisions of the Columbia River Basin Fish and Wildlife Program (program). 


Background


In August, 1994, the Council received recommendations from fish and wildlife agencies, Indian tribes and others,
for amendments to the anadromous fish sections of the program. Soon after receiving the recommendations, the Council
distributed copies of these recommendations to interested parties. The Council has reviewed the recommendations,
and is making its own proposals for program amendments based on the recommendations and on information that has been
developed since 1992. The Council will consider the recommendations in light of the standards of the Northwest Power
Act, and the September 9, 1994, opinion in 

Northwest Resource Information Center

 v. 

Northwest Power Planning Council,

 No. 92-70190, slip opinion (9th Cir. September 9, 1994), which remanded the Strategy for Salmon to the Council
to make new findings on recommendations submitted in the Strategy for Salmon process. Simultaneously with the Council's
review of the August 1994 recommendations, the Council will reexamine the Strategy for Salmon record and make new
findings on recommendations submitted in that process.




Opportunity To Comment


The Council invites comments on the August 1994 recommendations (document 94-42) and the Council's proposed
amendments (document 94-48). Commenters also may submit comments on recommendations submitted in the Strategy
for Salmon process (document 91-24). Written comments must be submitted by 5 p.m. Pacific time on November 10,
1994, to Steve Crow, Director, Public Affairs Division, Northwest Power Planning Council, 851 S.W. Sixth Avenue,

Order Approving Proposed Rule Change and Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Amendment No.
3 to the Proposed Rule Change by the American Stock Exchange, Inc., Relating to the Listing and Trading of Options on
the Israeli Index



October 5, 1994.



On May 31, 1994, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange
Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change to list and trade options on the Israeli Index (``Israeli Index'' or ``Index''). On August 2,
1994, the Exchange filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change, the subject matter of which supersedes the original
proposal.
 On August 8, 1994, the Exchange filed Amendment No. 2 (``Amendment No. 2'') to the proposal to clarify how the index
will be weighted when the composition of the Index changes from its current number of eleven components.
 On September 28, 1994, the Exchange filed Amendment No. 3 (``Amendment No. 3'') to the proposal to extend the trading
hours of the Index options by five minutes, to 4:15 p.m., and to reduce the index value in half by doubling the size of
the divisor.










Notice of the proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34554 (Aug. 19,
1994) and appeared in the 

Federal Register

, 59 FR 44198 (Aug. 26, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal. This order approves the proposal, as amended.



I. Description of the Proposal



The Amex has developed a new index called The Amex/Oscar Gruss Israel Index, based entirely on shares of widely held
Israeli stocks and American Depositary Receipts (``ADRs'') traded on the NYSE, Amex, or that are National Market
(``NM'') securities traded through the National Association of Securities Dealers. Automated Quotation system
(``NASDAQ''). The Index contains securities of highly capitalized companies with major business interests in Israel.
These include companies which are incorporated in Israel, whose offices are located in Israel, or whose research
and development activities are concentrated in Israel.



Index Calculation and Maintenance



The Index is calculated using a ``modified'' equal dollar weighting methodology. Five of the eleven component securities
have been given a higher weighting in the Index in order to more closely approximate the weight the industry represented
by that component has in the Israeli stock market. For example, ECI Telecom Ltd. and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries,
which are the largest capitalized components in the Index, will have a higher weight in the Index, but not as high as
if the Index were capitalization weighted. The Amex believes that this ``modified'' equal dollar weighting methodology
allows the Index to be a more accurate reflection of the Israeli market since it provides a higher weighting for the
larger capitalized components, yet does not permit those stocks to dominate the Index.

The following is a description of how the ``modified'' equal dollar weighting calculation method works. As of the
market close on June 17, 1994, a $100,000 portfolio comprised of eleven Israeli component securities was established
representing a hypothetical ``investment'' (rounded to the nearest whole share) of $12,000 in the five largest capitalized
Index components and $6,667 in each of the six remaining Index components. The value of the Index equals the current
market value (

i.e., 

based on U.S. primary market prices) of the sum of the assigned number of shares of each of the Index components divided
by the Index divisor. The Index divisor was initially determined to yield the benchmark value of 213.00 at the close
of trading on June 17, 1994, however, the Amex has since doubled the Index divisor in order to reduce the Index level.
 Each quarter thereafter, following the close of trading on the third Friday of March, June, September and December,
the Index components will be ranked in descending market capitalization order and the Index portfolio adjusted by
changing the number of whole shares of each component stock so that the five largest capitalized stocks in the Index
represent 60% of the Index value, and the remaining 40% of the Index value is evenly distributed over the remaining
securities. If the number of components in the Index changes from eleven securities, the Amex will continue to weigh
the five components with the highest market capitalizations 12%. The remaining components will then be weighted
equally.
 For example, if two new components are added to the Index, the five securities with the highest market capitalizations
will be assigned 12% weightings while the remaining eight securities in the Index would be weighted 5%.






The Exchange has chosen to rebalance following the close of trading on the quarterly expiration cycle because it allows
an option contract to be held for up to three months without a change in the Index portfolio while at the same time, maintaining
the ``modified'' equal dollar weighting feature of the Index. If necessary, a divisor adjustment is made at the rebalancing
to ensure continuity of the Index's value. The newly adjusted portfolio becomes the basis for the Index's value on
the first trading day following the quarterly adjustment.

Adjustments to the Index are done on a regular basis and timely, proper and adequate notice is given to investors. An
information circular is distributed to all Exchange members notifying them of the quarterly changes. This circular
is also sent by facsimile to the Exchange's contacts at the major options firms, mailed to recipients of the Exchange's
options related information circulars, and made available to subscribers of the Options News Network. In addition,
the Exchange will include in its promotional and marketing materials for the Index a description of the ``modified''
equal dollar weighting methodology.

As noted above, the number of shares of each component stock in the Index portfolio remains fixed between quarterly
reviews except in the event of certain types of corporate actions such as the payment of a dividend other than an ordinary
cash dividend, a stock distribution, stock splits, reverse stock splits, a rights offering distribution, reorganization,
recapitalization, or similar event with respect to the component stocks. In a merger or consolidation of an issuer
of a component stock, if the stock remains in the Index, the number of shares of that security in the portfolio may be
adjusted, to the nearest whole share, to maintain the components's relative weight in the Index at the level immediately
prior to the corporate action. In the event of a stock replacement, the average dollar value of the remaining portfolio
components in the same weighting tier as the stock being replaced will be calculated and that amount ``invested''
in the stock of the new component, to the nearest whole share. In all cases, the divisor will be adjusted, if necessary,
to ensure Index continuity.

The Amex will calculate and maintain the Index, and pursuant to Exchange Rule 901C(b) may at any time or from time to
time substitute stocks, or adjust the number of stocks included in the Index, based on changing conditions in Israel.
However, the Exchange will not decrease the number of Index component stocks to less than nine or increase the number
of component stocks to greater than fourteen without prior Commission approval. 

The value of the Index will be calculated continuously and disseminated every 15 seconds over the Consolidated Tape
Association's Network B. 



Expiration and Settlement



The Exchange proposes to trade cash-settled, European-style Index options (

i.e.

, exercises are permitted to expiration only). The Exchange also proposes that Israeli Index options will have trading
hours from 9:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. EST.
 As with other index options traded on the Amex, the options on the Index will expire on the Saturday following the third
Friday of the expiration month (``Expiration Friday''), The last trading day in an option series will normally be
the second to last business day preceding the Saturday following the third Friday of the expiration month (normally
a Thursday). Trading in expiring options will cease at the close of trading on the last trading day.





The Index value for purposes of settling a specific Israeli Index option will be calculated based upon the primary
exchange regular way opening sale prices for the component securities.
 In the case of NM securities, the first reported sale price will be used. As trading begins in each of the Index's component
securities, its opening sale price is used in the calculation. Once all of the component stocks have opened, the value
of the Index is determined and that value is used as the settlement value of the option. If any of the component stocks
do not open for trading on the last trading day before expiration, then the prior day's last sale price is used in the
calculation.





The Exchange plans to list options series with expirations in the three near-term calendar months and in the two additional
calendar months in the March cycle. In addition, longer term option series having up to thirty-six months to expiration
may be traded. In lieu of such long-term options on a full-value Index level, the Exchange may instead list long-term,
reduced-value put and call options based on one-tenth (1/10th) the Index's full-value. In either event, the interval
between expiration months for either a full-value or reduced-value long-term option will not be less than six months.



Eligibility Standards for Index Components 



The Index's component securities all have major business interests in Israel, and have been selected on the basis
of their market capitalization, trading liquidity, and representation of Israeli business industries. The Amex
believes the components represent the largest and most liquid of all Israeli securities trading in the U.S., and that
the Index tracks closely the performance of larger broad market Israeli indexes, such as the Oscar Gruss Israel Index,
which contains all of the more than 50 Israeli securities currently traded in the U.S. this index is carried in the Israeli
press as well as by Bloomberg L.P., a major U.S. data vendor.

In choosing among Israeli stocks that meet the minimum criteria set forth in Exchange Rule 901C, the Exchange will
select stocks that: (1) Have a minimum market value in U.S. dollars of at least $75 million, except that for each of the
lowest weighted component securities in the Index that in the aggregate account for no more than 10% of the weight of
the Index, the market value may be at least $50 million; (2) have an average monthly trading volume in the U.S. markets
over the previous six month period of not less than 500,000 shares (or ADRs); (3) have at least 85% of the numerical Index
value and at least 80% of the total number of component securities meeting the current criteria for standardized option
trading set forth in Exchange Rule 915; and (4) are reported securities that trade on either the NYSE, Amex (subject
to the limitations of Rule 901C), or are NM securities.


The Amex will ensure that not more than 20% of the weight of the Index is represented by ADRs overlying foreign securities
that are not subject to comprehensive surveillance sharing agreements.
 Currently no Index components have the majority of their trading volume occurring on an exchange with which the Amex
does not currently have in place an effective surveillance sharing agreement.





Exchange Rules Applicable to Stock Index Options



Amex Rules 900C through 980C will apply to the trading of regular and long-term contracts based on the Index. These
Rules cover issues such as surveillance, exercise prices, and position limits. Surveillance procedures currently
used to monitor trading in each of the Exchange's other index options will also be used to monitor trading in options
on the Index. The Index is deemed to be a Stock Index option under Rule 901C(a) and a Stock Index Industry Group under
Rule 900C(b)(1). With respect to Rule 903C(b), the Exchange proposes to list near-the-money (

i.e.

, within ten points above or below the current index value) options series on the Index at 21/2 point strike (exercise)
price intervals when the value of the Index is below 200 points. In addition, the Exchange proposes to establish, pursuant
to Rule 904C(c), a position limit of 7,500 contracts on the same side of the market. 

The Exchange seeks to have the ability to utilize its Auto-Ex system for orders in Index options of up to 50 contracts.
Auto-Ex is the Exchange's automated execution system which provides for the automatic execution of market and marketable
limit orders at the best bid or offer at the time the order is entered. The Amex represents that it has the necessary systems
capacity to support new series that would result from the introduction of Israeli Index Options.






II. Discussion



The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section
6(b)(5).
 Specifically, the Commission finds that the trading of Israeli Index options, including full-value and reduced-value
Index LEAPS, will serve to promote the public interest and help to remove impediments to a free and open securities
market by providing investors with a means of hedging exposure to market risk associated with Israeli securities.

<TEXT>
 

The trading of options on the Israeli Index, including full-value and reduced-value Index LEAPS, however, raises
several concerns, namely issues related to index design, customer protection, surveillance, and market impact.
The Commission believes, for the reasons discussed below, that the Amex adequately has addressed these concerns.




A. Index Design and Structure



The Commission finds that the Israeli Index is a narrow-based index. The Israeli Index is composed of only eleven securities,
all of which represent Israeli companies.
 Accordingly, in light of the limited number of components in the Index, the Commission believes it is proper to classify
the Israeli Index as narrow-based and apply Amex's rules governing narrow-based index options to trading in the Index
options.





The Commission also finds that the large capitalizations, liquid markets, and relative weightings of the Index's
component securities significantly minimize the potential for manipulation of the Index. First, the overwhelming
majority of the components that comprise the Index are actively traded, with an average daily trading volume for the
period from January, 1994 through June, 1994, ranging from a high of 453,000 shares per day to a low of 32,000 shares
per day. Second, the market capitalizations of the securities in the Index are very large, ranging, during the same
period, from a high of $1.46 billion to a low of $80 million, with the mean and median being $487.7 million and $252.95
million, respectively. Third, although the Index is only comprised of eleven component securities, no one particular
security or group of securities dominates the Index. Specifically, no one stock or ADR comprises more than 12% of the
Index's total value and the percentage weighting of the five largest issues in the Index account for 60% of the Index's
value. Fourth, at least 85% of the securities in the Index, by weight, and at least 80% of the number of components of
the Index, must be eligible for standardized options trading. This proposed maintenance requirement will ensure
that the Index is substantially comprised of options-eligible securities.
 Fifth, if the Amex increases the number of component securities to more than fourteen or decreases that number to less
than nine, the Amex will be required to seek Commission approval pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act before listing
new strike price or expiration month series of Israeli Index options and Index LEAPS. This will help protect against
material changes in the composition and design of the Index that might adversely affect the Amex's obligations to
protect investors and to maintain fair and orderly markets in Israeli Index options and Index LEAPS. Sixth, the Amex
will be required to ensure that each component of the Index is subject to last sale reporting pursuant to Rule 11Aa3-1
of the Act. This will further reduce the potential for manipulation of the value of the Index. Finally, the Commission
believes that, as discussed below, the existing mechanisms to monitor trading activity in the underlying Index components
(or options on those securities), will help deter such illegal activity.





The Commission finds that the Exchange's requirements covering minimum capitalization, monthly trading volume,
and relative weightings of component stocks are designed to ensure that the trading markets for component stocks
are adequately capitalized and sufficiently liquid, and that no one stock or stock group dominates an index. Thus,
the Commission believes these standards are reasonably designed to ensure the protection of investors and the public
interest and that the satisfaction of these requirements significantly minimizes the potential for manipulation
of the Index.




B. Customer Protection



The Commission believes that a regulatory system designed to protect public customers must be in place before the
trading of sophisticated financial instruments, such as Israeli Index options (including full-value and reduced-value
Israeli LEAPS), can commence on a national securities exchange. The Commission notes that the trading of standardized
exchange-traded options occurs in an environment that is designed to ensure, among other things, that: 
(1) The special risks of options are disclosed to public customers; 
(2) only investors capable of evaluating and bearing the risks of options trading are engaged in such trading; and

(3) special compliance procedures are applicable to options accounts. Accordingly, because the Index options and
Index LEAPS will be subject to the same regulatory regime as the other standardized options currently traded on the
Amex, the Commission believes that adequate safeguards are in place to ensure the protection of investors in Israeli
Index options and full-value and reduced-value Israeli Index LEAPS.




C. Surveillance



The Commission believes that a surveillance sharing agreement between an exchange proposing the list a security
index derivative product and the exchange(s) trading the securities underlying the derivative product is an important
measure for surveillance of the derivative and underlying securities markets. Such agreements ensure the availability
of information necessary to detect and deter potential manipulations and other trading abuses, thereby making the
security index product less readily susceptible to manipulation.
 In this regard, the Amex, NYSE, and NASD are all members of the ISG, which provides for the exchange of all necessary
surveillance information.
 Further, as to present and future ADR components of the Index, either the Exchange must have comprehensive surveillance
sharing agreements with the primary foreign markets for the securities underlying the ADRs or the U.S. must be the
relevant market for surveillance purposes.

D. Market Impact 

 

The Commission believes that the listing and trading of Israeli Index options, including full-value and reduced-value
Index LEAPS, on the Amex will not adversely impact the underlying securities markets. First, as described above,
for the most part, no one security or group of securities dominates the Index. Second, because at least 85% of the numerical
value of the Index and at least 80% of the components of the Index must be accounted for by securities that meet the Exchange's
options listing standards, and because each of the component securities must be subject to last sale reporting pursuant
to Rule 11Aa3-1 of the Act, the component securities generally will be actively-traded, highly-capitalized
securities. Third, the 7,500 contract position and exercise limits applicable to Index options and Index LEAPS will
serve to minimize potential manipulation and market impact concerns. 

 The Commission believes that settling expiring Israeli Index options (including full-value and reduced-value
Index LEAPS) based on the opening prices of component securities is consistent with the Act. As noted in other contexts,
valuing options for exercise settlement on expiration based on opening prices rather than closing prices may help
reduce adverse effects on markets for securities underlying options on the Index.
 Lastly, the Commission believes the ability to use Auto-Ex for orders of up to 50 contracts will provide customers
with liquid markets and efficient executions. 

 



The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 3 to the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day
after the date of publication of notice there in the 

Federal Register

. The Commission believes that the Amex's doubling of the size of the Index divisor in order to reduce the value of the
Index in half is consistent with the purposes of the Act. A lower Index should make the Index options more affordable
and available to individual investors, thereby resulting in improved efficiency or liquidity in the execution of
these Index options. Furthermore, the Commission believes the Amex's extension of its trading hours in the Index
options by five minutes is non-substantive and does not raise any new or unique regulatory issues. Both the Chicago
Board Options Exchange, Inc. and Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. currently trade a form of Index options on an Israeli
Index and their trading hours extend until 4:15 p.m. The Amex's change simply brings the three Exchange's into conformity.
Accordingly, the Commission believes it is consistent with Sections 6(b)(5) and 19(b) of the Act to approve Amendment
No. 3 to the proposed rule change on an accelerated basis.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change
American Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating to Market Index Option Escrow Receipts</DOCTITLE>


October 5, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 notice is hereby given that on August 26, 1994, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in
Items I and II below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. On October 3, 1994, the Exchange
submitted Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change to codify certain aspects of the market index option escrow receipt
(``MIOER'') program in the text of its rules.
 The Amex has requested accelerated approval of the proposal. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit
comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.






I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


The Amex proposes to amend Exchange Rule 462 to provide for an index option escrow receipt program. The text of the proposed
rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, Amex, and at the Commission.


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item III below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.


A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


1. Purpose


In October 1984, the Exchange filed a proposal to amend Rule 462 to provide for the use of cash, cash equivalents, one
or more qualified securities, or a combination of the foregoing, as collateral for escrow receipts issued to cover
short call positions in broad-based stock index options.
 The proposal was approved as a pilot program at each of the options exchanges and was successfully extended over the
years. The Amex now seeks to join the other exchanges and make the pilot program permanent. The Amex also seeks to make
conforming changes to Rule 462, so that the rule will correspond to rule language adopted by OCC
 and the other options exchanges.








2. Statutory Basis



The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the objectives of Section
6(b)(5) in particular in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote
just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in facilitating
transactions in securities, and to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national
market system.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition




The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others




No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change.



III. Solicitation of Comments




Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth St., NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of the Amex. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-Amex-94-31
and should be submitted by November 3, 1994.



IV. Commission's Findings and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change




The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements
of Section 6(b).
 In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the Section 6(b)(5) requirements that the
rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, prevent fraudulent and manipulative
acts, and, in general, protect investors and the public interest.






For various reasons, such as state and federal regulations, many institutions may write call options only on a covered
basis in a cash account.
 Many of these institutions, however, are legally restrained from having deposits of cash or securities at a brokerage
firm. Accordingly, in lieu of such a deposit, a bank may issue to the broker an escrow receipt on behalf of their mutual
customer, in order to meet the margin requirements for any short options the customer may have written.








Because it is difficult to apply the traditional concept of ``cover'' to broad-based, cash-settled index options,
 the Commission approved in 1984 an Amex proposal to allow index options writers to enter into escrow agreements without
requiring them to collateralize the agreements with all the securities underlying the index.
 The original MIOER program permitted the use of escrow receipts for short call positions if, among other things, a
bank or trust company held for the customer a ``basket'' of at least ten qualified equity securities. Due to inadequate
recordkeeping procedures, settlement delays and financial disincentives, many market participants found this
program to be impracticable and uneconomic, particularly in comparison to similar products traded on commodities
exchanges.

Accordingly, in 1985, the Commission approved, on a pilot basis, an Amex proposal to change the type of property acceptable
as an escrow deposit.
 This pilot program subsequently has been extended seven times,
 in order to provide the Amex and OCC with the opportunity to resolve certain matters concerning the format of the receipt
and administration of the program.





Currently, a MIOER may be collateralized by cash, cash equivalents, one or more qualified equity securities, or a
combination thereof. Pursuant to Regulation T, the term ``cash equivalents'' is defined to mean the market value
of any of the following instruments with one year or less to maturity: (1) Securities issued or guaranteed by the United
States or its agencies; (2) negotiable bank certificates of deposit; or (3) bankers acceptances issued by banking
institutions in the United States and payable in the United States.
 An equity security (other than warrants, rights or options) is qualified to be used as collateral for MIOERs issued
to cover short call positions if it is traded on a national securities exchange and substantially meets the listing
requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE'') or Amex or if it is enumerated on the current list of over-the-counter
margin stocks published by the Federal Reserve Board.




The current escrow receipt program requires that, at the time the option is written, the total value of the collateral
underlying the MIOER must be at least equal to the aggregate initial position value (

i.e., 

the index value at trade date times the applicable index multiplier times the number of options contracts covered
by the collateral). Although the escrow deposit may include only one or even no securities, the customer must affirm
that he is writing index options against a diversified portfolio. In addition, the issuing bank or trust company must
be approved by OCC if the receipt is to be forwarded to OCC to meet the clearing member's margin obligations.





Thereafter, the terms of the MIOER
 specify that, if the value of the collateral falls below 55% of the current position value, the issuing bank or trust
company promptly must notify the customer and request that the escrow deposit be supplemented. If the value of the
collateral falls below 50% of the current position value, the bank or trust company promptly must notify OCC and the
broker who, in turn, will disregard the MIOER and request that margin be deposited for the previously covered short
position.




The Amex proposes to convert its MIOER program from pilot to permanent status and to conform Rule 462 with recently
approved amendments to the rules of OCC
 and the other options exchanges.
 Despite certain refinements, as discussed in more detail below, the current rules will, for the most part, continue
to apply.





First, the Amex proposal will limit acceptable ``cash equivalents'' to securities issued or guaranteed by the United
States and having one year or less to maturity (``short-term United States government securities''). As a result,
securities issued or guaranteed by agencies of the United States, certificates of deposit and bankers acceptances
will no longer be eligible as collateral for MIOERs issued to cover short call positions.
In addition, the definition of ``qualified equity securities'' will be amended to incorporate all exchange-traded
securities, whether or not they meet NSE or Amex listing standards. The proposals also will make certain editorial
changes to the Exchange's rules regarding the use of over-the-counter securities to collateralize an escrow receipt,
in order to conform that language with the phrasing used in OCC's rules.
After careful review of the operation of the pilot program, the Commission has concluded that the revised MIOER should
help provide a safe and efficient mechanism by which index call options can be written in a cash account. As set forth
in more detail in its order approving the pilot procedures,
 the Commission believes that the range of collateral permitted thereunder should provide market participants with
greater flexibility, prevent settlement delays and eliminate many of the problems encountered under the original
MIOER program. To the extent that the revised escrow receipt is a cost-effective means for institutions restricted
to cash account transactions to manage portfolio risk, its implementation on a permanent basis should encourage
broader participation in the index options market, thereby adding depth and liquidity to that market.

Based on its experience with the pilot program, however, the Amex, along with OCC, has proposed certain minor refinements
to the types of property acceptable as collateral for MIOERs issued to cover short call positions. As the Commission
noted in regard to the recently approval proposal by OCC,
 these new standards will ensure that only liquid assets are eligible to underlie escrow receipts. Specifically,
the Commission believes that the proposed rule change is a reasonable response to OCC's finding that certificates
of deposit and bankers acceptances present an undue risk to OCC because it has no means of ensuring that issuers of such
instruments are financially sound.
 Thus, the Commission agrees that limiting ``cash equivalents'' to short-term United States government securities
will enhance the integrity of escrowed collateral. Moreover, the changes to the definition of ``qualified equity
security'' are consistent with the Federal Reserve Board's definition of ``margin security'' or existing OCC rules.






Finally, the Commission has determined that the escrow receipt contains safeguards (

e.g.,

 minimum collateral levels; the requirement that issuing banks or trust companies notify customers and OCC of reductions
in collateral)
 that should help ensure the adequacy of the collateral posted and diminish the risks associated with MIOERs. To date,
the Amex's experience with the pilot program supports the Commission's earlier conclusion that, absent extremely
unusual circumstances, the value of the collateral should be greater than the cash difference between the current
index value and the exercise price of the option (

i.e,

 the amount the must be delivered upon assignment.
 The Commission therefore believes that implementation on a permanent basis is now appropriate.






The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of
publication of notice of filing thereof in the 

Federal Register

. This will permit the portfolio management benefits of the proposed rule change to be realized as soon as possible.
In addition, the Amex's proposal is identical to proposals by the CBOE, PSE and Phlx that were published in the 

Federal Register

 for the full comment period and were approved by the Commission.






It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)
 that the proposed rule change (SR-Amex-94-31) is hereby approved.





For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago Board Options Exchange,
Inc. Relating to the Reporting by the Exchange to the Central Registration Depository (``CRD'') of Information Concerning
Pending Formal Exchange Disciplinary Proceedings</DOCTITLE>



October 5, 1994.



Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 notice is hereby given that on September 15, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'')
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items
I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the CBOE. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit
comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.






I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The CBOE proposes to add Rule 17.14 to the CBOE's rules to provide for the reporting by the CBOE to the Central Registration
Depository (``CRD''), for disclosure to the public, of information concerning pending formal CBOE disciplinary
proceedings. In addition, the CBOE proposes to renumber the provisions which are currently contained in CBOE Rule
17.12 without affecting the substance of these provisions. The text of the proposed rule change is available at the
Office of the Secretary, CBOE, and at the Commission.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The CBOE has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.


(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


The purpose of the proposed rule change is to add Rule 17.14 to the exchange's rules to provide for the reporting by the
Exchange to the CRD,3 for disclosure to the public, of information concerning pending formal Exchange disciplinary
proceedings.
 Currently, the Exchange discloses to the CRD information with respect to formal Exchange disciplinary proceedings
only upon the conclusion of such proceedings.





Under the proposed rule change, the amount of information concerning formal Exchange disciplinary proceedings
 reported by the Exchange to the CRD would be expanded to include the issuance of a statement of charges in such proceedings
and all significant changes in the status of such proceedings while such proceedings are pending. For the purposes
of Rule 17.14, a formal Exchange disciplinary proceeding would be considered to be pending from the time that a statement
of charges is issued in the proceeding
 until the outcome of the proceeding becomes final. In addition, under Rule 17.14, significant changes in the status
of a formal Exchange disciplinary proceeding would be deemed to include, but not be limited to, the scheduling of a
disciplinary hearing, the issuance of a decision by the BCC, the filing of an appeal to the Exchange's Board of Directors,
and the issuance of a decision by the Exchange's Board of Directors.





According to the Exchange, information on pending formal Exchange disciplinary proceedings, among other events,
is currently in the CRD, but only to the extent that reports are made by Exchange members, member organizations, and
associated persons pursuant to their reporting obligations on the Uniform Application for Securities Industry
Registration or Transfer (Form U-4) and Form BD, the uniform application form for broker-dealer registration.
The proposed rule change would expand the information available to the public concerning pending formal Exchange
disciplinary proceedings by requiring the Exchange to report information concerning such pending proceedings
to the CRD.
In addition to the foregoing, the proposed rule change would renumber the provisions which are currently contained
in Rule 17.12 (Miscellaneous Provisions) without affecting the substance of these provisions. Specifically, under
the proposed rule change, the current provisions of Rule 17.12 would be separated into two rules, Rule 17.12 and Rule
17.13.
The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6 of the Act, in general, and furthers
the objectives of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act,
 in particular, in that it will protect investors and the public interest by enhancing the public's access to information
regarding disciplinary proceedings involving Exchange members, member organizations, and associated persons.




(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any inappropriate burden on competition.


(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others


Written comments on the proposed rule change were neither solicited nor received.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register 

or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the Exchange consents, the Commission
will:
(a) by order approve such proposed rule change, or 
(b) institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.


IV. Solicitation of Comments


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC. Copies of such filing will also be available for
inspection and copying at the principal office of the CBOE. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-CBOE.
All submissions should refer to File No. SR-CBOE-94-33 and should be submitted by November 3, 1994.



For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.



Applicants' Representations



1. The Funds are registered management investment companies. Some of the Funds (the ``Portfolios'') issue shares
to other Funds that invest all or substantially all of their assets in the Portfolios. Eaton Vance Management (``Eaton
Vance'') currently serves as the administrator or investment adviser for each of the Funds, except the Portfolios.
Boston Management and Research, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eaton Vance, serves as investment adviser to each of
the Portfolios. Eaton Vance and Boston Management are each registered under the Investment Advisers Act. Eaton Vance
Distributors, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eaton Vance, serves as the Funds' principal underwriter. Applicants
request that the proposed relief apply to the funds and any requested investment companies that in the future are advised
by Eaton Vance or any entity under common control with or controlled by Eaton Vance. The proposed relief would not,
however, apply to any investment company that is a money market fund that relies on rule 2a-7 under the Act. Any
relief granted from section 13(a)(3) of the Act would extend only to named Funds.

2. A majority of the board of trustees of each Fund currently consists of trustees who are not ``interested persons''
of that Fund within the meaning of section 2(a)(19) of the Act. The non-interested trustees receive annual fees from
the Funds. Applicants propose to offer a deferred fee arrangement to the trustees (the ``Eligible Trustees'') who
receive fees from one or more of (i) the Portfolios and (ii) Funds that do not invest all or substantially all of their
assets in a Portfolio (the ``Participating Funds''). Under this arrangement, the Eligible Trustees will be entitled
to defer to a later date the receipt of all or part of their trustees' fees in order to defer payment of income taxes or
for other reasons.
3. The proposed deferred fee arrangements would be implemented by means of a deferred fee agreement (the ``Agreement'')
entered into between an Eligible Trustee and the appropriate Participating Fund. Under each Agreement, the deferred
fees will be credited to a book reserve account (the ``Deferred Fee Account'') established by a Participating Fund
with respect to each of its series. The deferred fees will be accrued in an amount equal to that which would have been
earned had such fees (and all income earned thereon) been invested and reinvested in shares of any of a selection of
the Participating Funds (the ``Investment Funds'') that may be designated from time to time by the management of the
appropriate Participating Fund and the participating Eligible Trustee. Such shares of the Investment Fund that
are purchased by a Participating Fund are referred to as the ``Underlying Securities.'' The return on the Deferred
Fee Accounts will be based upon the return of the Investment Fund(s) selected by the particular Eligible Trustee or,
to the extent one or more of the Investment Funds selected for investment are no longer in existence, upon a recognized
measure of prevailing market interest rates (

e.g.

, the Treasury Bill rate).
4. The obligations to make payments from the Deferred Fee Accounts will be general unsecured obligations of each series
of a Participating Fund, and payments from the Deferred Fee Accounts will be made from the general assets and property
of such Participating Fund. The Agreement will provide that the Participating Fund is under no obligation to purchase,
hold or dispose of any investments, but, if the Participating Fund chooses to purchase investments to cover its obligations
under such Agreement, then all such investments will continue to be a part of the general assets and property of the
Participating Fund.
5. As a matter of prudent risk management, the Participating Funds will purchase and hold shares of the Underlying
Securities in amounts equal to the deemed investment of the deferred fee accounts of its Eligible Trustees. Thus,
in cases where the Participating Funds purchase shares of the Underlying Securities, liabilities created by the
credits to the Deferred Fee Accounts under the Agreement are expected to be matched by an equal amount of assets (

i.e.

, a direct investment in the Underlying Securities). The Agreement will not obligate any Participating Fund to retain
the services of any trustee, nor will they obligate any Participating Fund to pay any particular level of compensation
to the trustee.
6. Under the Agreement, deferred trustee's fees (including interest accrued thereon) will become payable in cash
upon the Eligible Trustee's retirement or disability. Payments shall be made in a lump sum or in up to ten annual installments.
In addition, in the event of the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the appropriate Participating Fund or the
distribution of all or substantially all of the Participating Fund's assets and property to its shareholders, all
unpaid amounts in the Deferred Fee Account shall be paid in a lump sum on the effective date thereof. In the event of the
Eligible Trustee's death, the deferred compensation will be paid to his or her designated beneficiary. In all other
situations, the Eligible Trustee's right to receive payments will be non-transferable.



Applicants' Legal Analysis



1. Applicants request an order under sections 6(c) and 17(b) of the Act to exempt applicants from sections 13(a)(2),
13(a)(3), 17(a)(1), 18(a), 18(c), 18(f)(1), 22(f), 22(g) and 23(a) of the Act to the extent necessary to permit the
Funds to offer certain deferred fee arrangements, and section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 thereunder to permit
the Funds to effect certain joint transactions incident to such deferred fee arrangements. The finding required
by section 17(b)(2) is predicated on the assumption that relief is granted from section 13(a)(3).
2. Sections 18(a) and 18(c) restrict the ability of a registered closed-end investment company to issue senior securities.
Section 18(f)(1) generally prohibits a registered open-end investment company from issuing senior securities.
Section 13(a)(2) requires that a registered investment company obtain shareholder authorization before issuing
any senior security not contemplated by the recitals of policy in its registration statement. Applicants state that
the Agreement possesses none of the characteristics of senior securities that led Congress to enact these sections.
The Agreement would not: (a) induce speculative investments or provide opportunities for manipulative allocation
of any Fund's expenses or profits; (b) affect control of any Fund; (c) confuse investors or convey a false impression
as to the safety of their investments; or (d) be inconsistent with the theory of mutuality of risk. All liabilities
created by credits to Deferred Fee Accounts are expected to be offset by equal amounts of assets that would not otherwise
exist if the fees were paid on a current basis.
3. Section 22(f) prohibits undisclosed restrictions on transferability or negotiability of redeemable securities
issued by open-end investment companies. The Agreement would set forth all such restrictions, which would be included
primarily to benefit the participating trustees and would not adversely affect the interests of such trustees or
of any shareholder.

4. Sections 22(g) and 23(a) prohibit registered open-end investment companies and closed-end investment companies,
respectively, from issuing any of their securities for services or for property other than cash or securities. These
provisions prevent the dilution of equity and voting power that may result when securities are issued for consideration
that is not readily valued. Applicants believe that the Agreement would merely provide for deferral of payment of
such fees and thus would be viewed as being issued not in return for services but in return for a Fund not being required
to pay such fees on a current basis.

5. Section 13(a)(3) provides that no registered investment company shall, unless authorized by the vote of a majority
of its outstanding voting securities, deviate from any investment policy that is changeable only if authorized by
shareholder vote. With limited exceptions, each Fund has adopted an investment policy regarding the purchase of
investment company shares, which policy could prohibit or restrict the Fund from purchasing shares of other investment
companies. Applicants believe that it is appropriate to exempt applicants as necessary from section 13(a)(3) so
as to enable the Participating Funds to invest in Underlying Securities without a shareholder vote. Applicants will
provide notice to shareholders in the statement of additional information of each Participating Fund of the deferred
fee arrangement with the participating trustees. The value of the Underlying Securities will be 

de minimis 

in relation to the total net assets of the respective Fund, and will at all times equal the value of the Fund's obligations
to pay deferred fees. Because investment companies that might exist in the future could establish fundamental policies
that would accommodate purchases of shares of investment companies in connection with the deferred fee arrangement,
the relief requested from section 13(a)(3) would extend to named applicants only.

6. Section 17(a)(1) generally prohibits an affiliated person of a registered investment company from selling any
security to such registered investment company, except in limited circumstances. Funds that are advised by the same
entity may be ``affiliated persons'' under section 2(a)(3)(C) of the Act. Section 17(a)(1) was designed to prevent
sponsors of investment companies from using investment company assets as capital for enterprises with which they
were associated or to acquire controlling interest in such enterprises. Applicants believe that an exemption from
this provision would facilitate the matching of each Fund's liability for deferred fees with the Underlying Securities
that would determine the amount of such liability.

7. Section 17(d) and rule 17d-1 generally prohibit a registered investment company's joint or joint and several
participation with an affiliated person in a transaction in connection with any joint enterprise or other joint arrangement
or profit-sharing plan ``on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of'' the affiliated person. Under
the Agreement, Eligible Trustees will not receive a benefit, directly or indirectly, that would otherwise inure
to a Fund or its shareholder. Eligible Trustees will receive tax deferral, but the Agreement otherwise will maintain
the parties, viewed both separately and in their relationship to one another, in the same position as if the deferred
fees were paid on a current basis. When all payments have been made to an Eligible Trustee, the trustee will be no better
off (apart from the effect of tax deferral) than if he or she had received trustee fees on a current basis and invested
them in Underlying Securities.



Applicants' Condition



Applicants agree that the order granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following condition:

If a Participating Fund purchases Underlying Securities issued by an affiliated Fund, the Participating Fund will
vote such shares in proportion to the votes of all other holders of shares of such affiliated Fund.




For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority.

 Notice of public meeting.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Transportation's (DOT) Office of Commercial Space Transportation (OCST) is holding a public meeting
to obtain industry input to assist it with rulemaking activities currently under consideration. OCST seeks information
that will assist it in developing a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) addressing specific requirements for launch
and launch site operator license applications submitted to OCST. OCST seeks to standardize its review of license
applications while at the same time allowing prospective licensees design and operational flexibility for their
proposals. OCST also plans to develop a second NPRM addressing implementation of financial responsibility requirements
and allocation of risks associated with the conduct of licensed activities. Accordingly, OCST seeks views concerning
the range of activities that may be covered by these requirements and the scope of the U.S. Government's payment of
third-party claims that exceed the amount of required liability insurance.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

Background



The Commercial Space Launch Act of 1984, 49 U.S.C. 2601-2623, as recodified at 49 U.S.C. Subtitle IX_Commercial
Space Transportation, ch. 701, Commercial Space Launch Activities, 49 U.S.C. 70101-70119 (1994) (the Act),
authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to oversee and regulate commercial launch activities and the commercial
operation of launch sites carried out within the United States or by its citizens. The Act requires that this responsibility
be exercised to protect the public health and safety, safety of property, and national security and foreign policy
interests of the United States. The Secretary's responsibilities under the Act, including licensing commercial
launches and the operation of launch sites, as well as the obligation to encourage, facilitate and promote establishment
of a competitive United States commercial space transportation industry, are implemented by OCST. 

OCST implements its licensing and regulatory authority through the Commercial Space Transportation Licensing
Regulations (Regulations), 14 C.F.R. Ch. III. At the time the Regulations were published in April 1988, no commercial
launches had yet taken place. In adopting its approach to licensing commercial launch activities, as reflected in
the Regulations, OCST recognized the need to establish a regulatory environment responsive to the needs of an emerging
industry while assuring the public that commercial launch activities would be conducted safely and responsibly.
At that time, OCST indicated that it would ``continue to evaluate and, when necessary, re-shape its program in response
to growth, innovation, and diversity in this critically important industry.'' 53 Fed. Reg. 11006. 

Both OCST's experience in administering the Act and launch companies' experience in operating in a commercial environment
subject to DOT's regulatory oversight have evolved with time. OCST now seeks to streamline its licensing process
while continuing to ensure safety and preserving the flexibility necessary to address myriad launch technologies
and associated issues. Accordingly, OCST contemplates issuing rules of general applicability to enhance industry
certainty regarding what is required of an applicant in the licensing process and what is required of a licensee after
a license has been issued.

 
 

Launch and Launch Site Operator Licensing Procedures



Under the Act, a DOT license is required for any person to launch a launch vehicle or operate a launch site within the
United States. In addition, a license is also required for a U.S. citizen to launch a launch vehicle or operate a launch
site outside the United States. Foreign corporations, partnerships, joint ventures, associations or other entities
controlled by U.S. citizens do not need licenses to conduct these activities from foreign territory unless the foreign
nation involved has agreed that the United States shall exercise jurisdiction over the activity. In exercising this
licensing authority under the Act, the Secretary must protect public health and safety, safety of property, and national
security and foreign policy interests of the United States. 

The Regulations issued in 1988 reflect OCST's approach to evaluating license applications on a case-by-case basis.
To date, OCST has relied on these Regulations, and on guidelines it makes available upon applicant request, to advise
prospective applicants of the information OCST requires to perform safety and mission reviews of a launch license
application. Having obtained six years of experience in evaluating launch proposals and conducting safety research,
OCST is now prepared to streamline the launch licensing process by standardizing requirements wherever possible
without impeding innovation. In response to industry requests for greater certainty in the application process,
and in order to achieve consistency, OCST proposes to codify certain specific information requirements in regulations.
In doing so, the issues to be addressed include: (1) the scope of launch licenses; (2) risk management techniques that
enable license applicants to demonstrate acceptable levels of safety; (3) application information requirements;
(4) relationship to and consistency with Federal range requirements; and (5) reliance by license applicants on,
among other things, industry standards. With respect to launch license application reviews, OCST is interested
in obtaining views on at least the following:

 What elements of a launch proposal must OCST evaluate to assure launch safety;

 Which pre-launch or launch processing operations and procedures should OCST assess to assure launch safety;

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941013-2-00123 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941013-2-00088 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 What safety methodologies do launch operators currently utilize to assure safe launch operations, and what
approaches are available to evaluate these methodologies;

 How should OCST utilize the analyses of Federal ranges in its licensing review process;

 What information must launch license applicants submit to other federal agencies, including federal ranges,
that must also be submitted to OCST as part of the license application review? Can OCST utilize that information to
avoid duplicative document preparation and submissions by license applicants; and

 What should OCST require with respect to on orbit safety.

When the Regulations were published in 1988, OCST indicated that it would handle commercial launch site proposals
on a case-by-case basis while safety studies and research were ongoing. Since 1988, the vast majority of licensing
proposals submitted to OCST have been for commercial launches of launch vehicles from a Federal range. However, in
light of the growing and intensified interest in operating commercial launch sites, OCST has determined that establishing
certainty in the site operator licensing process through rules of general applicability is necessary to facilitate
this burgeoning industry. With respect to OCST's approach to reviewing applications for a license to operate a commercial
launch site, OCST seeks views concerning such matters as: (1) the scope of launch site operator licenses; (2) risk
management techniques that enable license applicants to demonstrate acceptable levels of safety; (3) application
information requirements; (4) reliance by license applicants on industry standards; and (5) reliance by license
applicants on other Federal safety standards. With respect to site operator license applications, OCST is interested
in obtaining views on at least the following:

 How should OCST assess a proposed launch site with respect to geography, meteorology, proximity to population,
risk to downrange population, and other characteristics associated with the physical site;

 What process and standards should OCST utilize, including safety methodologies, to assess the capability
of a launch site operator to manage safety; 

 What is the relationship between a site operator license and its associated safety reviews, and a launch license
authorizing a launch from a commercial launch site and its associated safety reviews;

 For launches conducted from a commercial launch site, how should responsibility for safety be allocated between
the launch licensee and the site operator; and

 Given that OCST must evaluate flight safety functions, such as flight termination or tracking, to assure the
safety of launch operations, how should those functions be addressed by the licensing process when the launch will
be conducted from a commercial launch site. 



Scope of Financial Responsibility Requirements



In 1988, Congress amended the Act to require that licensees obtain liability insurance or otherwise demonstrate
financial responsibility up to a statutory limit of $500,000,000, in order to protect launch participants from third-party
claims resulting from activities carried out under a license in connection with a particular launch. Licensees must
also obtain liability insurance or otherwise demonstrate financial responsibility up to $100,000,000, to compensate
the U.S. Government for damage or loss to its property resulting from those activities. Reciprocal waivers of claims
are also required whereby each party involved in launch services agrees to be responsible for certain losses it may
sustain and losses sustained by its own employees resulting from an activity carried out under the license. 

The 1988 Amendments further provide that, to the extent provided in advance in an appropriation law or authorized
by statute, the Secretary of Transportation shall provide for the payment by the U.S. Government of successful third-party
claims against a licensee, contractor, subcontractor, or customer of the licensee, or a contractor or subcontractor
of a customer, resulting from an activity carried out under a license, to the extent the total amount of claims arising
out of any one launch exceeds the amount of third-party liability insurance required of the licensee, up to a total
of $1.5 billion above that amount. The U.S. Government bears the risk of government property losses that exceed the
level of insurance coverage required of the licensee. 
OCST prescribes financial responsibility requirements for licensees on a case-by-case basis after analyzing the
maximum probable third-party and government property losses associated with proposed licensed activities. Those
requirements are imposed on licensees in license orders. Currently, license orders issued by OCST reflect insurance
requirements for both launches and launch site operations associated with the conduct of those launches. Concerns
have arisen over the extent to which pre-launch activities are intended to be covered by the financial responsibility
requirements of the Act, and the Government payment of excess third-party claims provision. Clarification is needed
to provide certainty to the industry so that it may manage risks appropriately.

The Act provides guidance on these issues. To the extent the Act provides for payment by the U.S. Government of successful
third-party claims in excess of required insurance, it is only available for claims ``

resulting from an activity carried out under the license 

issued or transferred under [chapter 701] for death, bodily injury, or property damage or loss 

resulting from an activity carried out under the license.

'' 49 U.S.C. 70113(a)(1)(emphasis added). Moreover, claims may be paid under this provision of the Act only to the
extent the total amount of successful claims 

related to one launch 

exceeds the required amount of third-party liability insurance and does not exceed $1.5 billion above that amount.
49 U.S.C. 70113(a)(1)(emphasis added). 
Licenses are available to authorize the conduct of a launch, as defined in the Act, or the operation of a launch site.
Because the U.S. Government payment of excess third-party claims provision is only available for claims resulting
from an activity carried out under the license for damage or loss resulting from an activity carried out under a license,
and because the Act defines launch as ``to place or try to place'' a launch vehicle and any payload in a suborbital trajectory,
in Earth orbit in outer space or otherwise in outer space, 49 U.S.C. 70102(3), one interpretation of this language
is that, with respect to launches, it only extends to claims resulting from ignition and flight of a launch vehicle.
In other words, it may not be available for claims resulting from preparatory activities conducted at the launch site.
Alternatively, some preparatory activities may reasonably be considered integral to the launch itself or part of
the launch process. OCST seeks industry views on what those activities are and why they may fall within the statutory
definition of a ``launch.'' 

OCST plans to adopt specific criteria for determining when an activity would be considered part of a launch for purposes
of imposing financial responsibility requirements and to determine when U.S. Government payment of excess third-party
claims may be available. OCST also seeks industry views on how the U.S. Government payment of excess third-party claims
provision applies to licensed site operators, if at all. Diverse points of view exist regarding these issues, and
OCST seeks information regarding the basis for each point of view as well as recommendations as to which should be adopted.

OCST recognizes that many other issues are associated with implementation of the financial responsibility and allocation
of risk requirements of the Act. The issues presented in this Notice are limited in scope because their resolution
will necessarily affect OCST's approach to licensing launch activities and site operators. At the meeting, OCST
will welcome any other comments on financial responsibility matters, as time allows. 




Standards




In accordance with the Presidential Decision Directive, NSTC-4, outlining the National Space Transportation
Policy issued August 5, 1994, OCST would like to work with the U.S. commercial space sector to promote the establishment
of technical standards for commercial space products and services. OCST solicits industry views on what safety standards
should be developed to support this goal, and how they should be implemented. 



Meeting Schedule




Because of time constraints and the need to ensure that each subject area is fully aired, OCST intends that one full
meeting day be accorded to licensing issues and one-half day to issues concerning the scope of financial responsibility
requirements. Licensing issues will be discussed on October 27, 1994. Financial responsibility issues will be addressed
in the morning session on October 28, 1994. If licensing issues are exhausted before the time allotted on October 27th,
the meeting will move directly to financial responsibility issues. 


OCST looks forward to an informative and interactive discussion of the issues among the participants at the meeting,
as opposed to a forum for the presentation of prepared statements. However, persons wishing to present prepared remarks
at the meeting, whether in a personal or a representative capacity on behalf of an organization, will be given an opportunity
to do so during the afternoon session on October 28, 1994, between 1:30 p.m. and 4:00 p.m., and may reserve between five
and 15 minutes to do so. In addition, OCST plans to reserve an hour at the end of each day to discuss technical standards
and other issues of concern to participants that may not be part of the rulemaking activity. Any time remaining on October
28, 1994, may be used for further discussion of the issues related to rulemaking activities.
 

Those who are interested in presenting remarks at the meeting should notify OCST no later than October 17, 1994, to
reserve up to 15 minutes of time. If possible, OCST will notify interested persons if additional time is available.
DOT officials chairing the meeting may take additional time to ask clarifying questions of the speaker. To reserve
speaking time, please telephone Ms. Linda Strine (202) 366-2980.

<DOCTITLE>Noise Exposure Map Notice, Receipt of Noise Compatibility Program and Request for Review; General Mitchell International
Airport, Milwaukee, WI</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announces its determination that the noise exposure maps submitted by
Milwaukee County for General Mitchell International Airport under the provisions of title I of the Aviation Safety
and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (Pub. L. 96-193) and 14 CFR part 150 are in compliance with applicable requirements.
The FAA also announces that it is reviewing a proposed noise compatibility program that was submitted for General
Mitchell International Airport under part 150 in conjunction with the noise exposure map, and that this program will
be approved or disapproved on or before March 22, 1995.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This notice announces that the FAA finds that the noise exposure maps submitted for General Mitchell International
Airport are in compliance with applicable requirements of part 150, effective September 23, 1994. Further, FAA is
reviewing a proposed noise compatibility program for that airport which will be approved or disapproved on or before
March 22, 1995. This notice also announces the availability of this program for public review and comment.




Under section 103 of title I of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (hereinafter referred to as ``the
Act''), an airport operator may submit to the FAA noise exposure maps which meet applicable regulations and which
depict noncompatible land uses as of the date of submission of such maps, a description of projected aircraft operations,
and the ways in which such operations will affect such maps. The Act requires such maps to be developed in consultation
with interested and affected parties in the local community, government agencies, and persons using the airport.

An airport operator who has submitted noise exposure maps that are found by FAA to be in compliance with the requirements
of Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) part 150, promulgated pursuant to title I of the Act, may submit a noise compatibility
program for FAA approval which sets forth the measures the operator has taken or proposes for the reduction of existing
noncompatible uses and for the prevention of the introduction of additional noncompatible uses.

Milwaukee County submitted to the FAA on December 3, 1993, noise exposure maps, descriptions and other documentation
which were produced during the FAR part 150 Noise Compatibility Study from September 1989 to December 1993. It was
requested that the FAA review this material as the noise exposure maps, as described in section 103(a)(1) of the Act,
and that the noise mitigation measures, to be implemented jointly by the airport and surrounding communities, be
approved as a noise compatibility program under section 104(b) of the Act.

The FAA has completed its review of the noise exposure maps and related descriptions submitted by Milwaukee County.
The specific maps under consideration are the 1992 existing Noise Exposure Map and the 1997 future Noise Exposure
Map. The FAA has determined that these maps for General Mitchell International Airport are in compliance with applicable
requirements. This determination is effective on September 23, 1994. FAA's determination on an airport operator's
noise exposure maps is limited to a finding that the maps were developed in accordance with the procedures contained
in appendix A of FAR part 150. Such determinations does not constitute approval of the applicant's data, information
or plans, or a commitment to approve a noise compatibility program or to fund the implementation of that program.

If questions arise concerning the precise relationship of specific properties to noise exposure contours depicted
on a noise exposure map submitted under section 103 of the Act, it should be noted that the FAA is not involved in any way
in determining the relative locations of specific properties with regard to the depicted noise contours, or in interpreting
the noise exposure maps to resolve questions concerning, for example, which properties should be covered by the provisions
of section 107 of the Act. These functions are inseparable from the ultimate land use control and planning responsibilities
of local government. These local responsibilities are not changed in any way under part 150 or through FAA's review
of noise exposure maps. Therefore, the responsibility for the detail overlaying of noise exposure contours onto
the map depicting properties on the surface rests exclusively with the airport operator who submitted those maps,
or with those public agencies and planning agencies with which consultation is required under section 103 of the Act.
The FAA has relied on the certification by the airport operator, under section 150.21 of FAR part 150, that the statutory
required consultation has been accomplished.

The FAA has formally received the noise compatibility program for General Mitchell International Airport, also
effective on September 23, 1994. Preliminary review of the submitted material indicates that it conforms to the requirements
for the submittal of noise compatability programs, but that further review will be necessary prior to approval or
disapproval of the program. The formal review period, limited by law to a maximum of 180 days, will be completed on or
before March 22, 1995.

The FAA's detailed evaluation will be conducted under the provisions of 14 CFR part 150, section 150.33. The primary
considerations in the evaluation process are whether the proposed measures may reduce the level of aviation safety,
create an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce, or be reasonably consistent with obtaining the goal of reducing
existing noncompatible land uses and preventing the introduction of additional noncompatible land uses.

Interested persons are invited to comment on the proposed program with specific reference to these factors. All comments,
other than those properly addressed to local land use authorities, will be considered by the FAA to the extent practicable.
Copies of the noise exposure maps, the FAA's evaluation of the maps, and the proposed noise compatibility program
are available for examination at the following locations:

<AGENCY>

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed new system of records.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In accordance with the requirements of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, 5 U.S.C. 552a, the Department of the Treasury
(Department) gives notice of a newly proposed Treasury-wide system of records, Telephone Call Detail Records_Treasury/DO
.211. Two existing systems of records will be removed from the Treasury's inventory of Privacy Act systems when the
Treasury-wide notice is effective.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This report is to give notice of a proposed new Treasury-wide system of records entitled Telephone Call Detail Records_Treasury/DO
.211 which is subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a.




The Department is establishing the Telephone Call Detail Records system to enhance its ability to assess employee
use of the telephone system provided by the Department. Since parts of this system are retrieved by individual identifier,
the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, requires a general notice of the existence of this system of records to the public.
The information may be used for telecommunication traffic studies, cost projections or other management studies
and to enable the Department to verify call usage, determine responsibility for placement of specific long distance
and/or local calls, and detect possible abuse of the government-provided long distance network. The records generated
by the telephone systems used by the Department may identify individual telephone numbers and, in some instances,
individual users. The records may also identify the originating number from which long distance and local calls are
made. This system may contain telephone assignment records, results of administrative inquiries to determine responsibility
for the placement of specific local or long distance calls if waste, fraud or abuse patterns are detected, or other
records as required by individual components. The Department will maintain these records to further the Government's
fiscal responsibility and accountability provision.

The Privacy Act notices covering the comptroller of the Currency's Telephone Usage Information System (TUIS)_Treasury/CC
.315 and the Internal Revenue Service's FTS2000 On-line Certification of Usage System (FOCUS)_Treasury/IRS 24.100
are duplicative of the proposed Treasury-wide system of records and will be incorporated into the Treasury-wide
system. In accordance with OMB Circular A-130, the two existing notices will be deleted from the Treasury Department's
inventory of systems of records. The notice for Treasury/CC .315 was last published at 57 FR 13943 dated April 17, 1992.
The notice for Treasury/IRS 24.100 was last published at 58 FR 64350 dated December 6, 1993.

The new system of records report, as required by 5 U.S.C. 551a(r) of the Privacy Act, has been submitted to the Committee
on Government Operations of the House of Representatives, the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate, and
the Office of Management and Budget, pursuant to Appendix I to OMB Circular A-130, ``Federal Agency Responsibilities
for Maintaining Records About Individuals,'' dated July 15, 1994.

The following Privacy Act notices: Comptroller of the Currency's Telephone Usage Information System (TUIS)_Treasury/CC
.315, and Internal Revenue Service's FTS2000 On-line Certification of Usage System (FOCUS)_Treasury/IRS 24.100
are removed.

The proposed Treasury-wide system of records Telephone Call Detail Records_Treasury/DO .211 is published in its
entirety below.

<DOCTITLE>Tax on Certain Imported Substances (Dimethyl-2,6-Naphthalene </DOCTITLE>
Dicarboxylate); Notice of Determination 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Treasury. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice announces a determination, under Notice 
89-61, that the list of taxable substances in section 
4672(a)(3) will be modified to include dimethyl-2,6-naphthalene dicarboxylate. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


Under section 4672(a), an importer or exporter of any 
substance may request that the Secretary determine whether 
such substance should be listed as a taxable substance. The 
Secretary shall add such substance to the list of taxable 
substances in section 4672(a)(3) if the Secretary determines 
that taxable chemicals constitute more than 50 percent of the 
weight, or more than 50 percent of the value, of the 
materials used to produce such substance. This determination 
is to be made on the basis of the predominant method of 
production. Notice 89-61, 1989-1 C.B. 717, sets forth the 
rules relating to the determination process. 


Determination 



On October 5, 1994, the Secretary determined that 
dimethyl-2,6-naphthalene dicarboxylate should be added to the 
list of taxable substances in section 4672(a)(3), effective 
April 1, 1995. 

The rate of tax prescribed for dimethyl-2,6-naphthalene 
dicarboxylate, under section 4671(b)(3), is $5.97 per ton. 
This is based upon a conversion factor for xylene of 0.690, a 
conversion factor for butadiene of 0.390, and a conversion 
factor for methane of 0.208. 

The petitioner is Amoco Corporation, a manufacturer and 
exporter of this substance. No material comments were 
received on this petition. The following information is the 
basis for the determination. 




HTS number: 2917.39.50 
CAS number: 840-65-3 




Dimethyl-2,6-naphthalene dicarboxylate is derived from the 
taxable chemicals xylene, butadiene, and methane. Dimethyl-2,6-naphthalene dicarboxylate is a solid produced

predominantly by esterification of naphthalene dicarboxylic 
acid (2,6-NDA). 2,6-NDA is made by air oxidation of dimethyl 
naphthalene (2,6-DMN). 2,6-DMN is prepared via the 
alkenylation of orthoxylene acid butadiene. 
The stoichiometric material consumption formula for 
dimethyl-2,6-naphthalene dicarboxylate is: 




C

8

H

10 

(xylene) + C

6 

(butadiene) + 2 CH

dicarboxylate) + 2 H

(water) 




Dimethyl-2,6-naphthalene dicarboxylate has been determined 
to be a taxable substance because a review of its 
stoichiometric material consumption formula shows that, based 
on the predominant method of production, taxable chemicals 
constitute 60 percent by weight of the materials used in its 
production.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Pursuant to the Bureau's authorizing legislation, programs must maintain a non-political character and should
be balanced and representative of the diversity of American political, social, and cultural life. ``Diversity''
should be interpreted in the broadest sense and encompass differences including but not limited to race, gender,
religion, geographic location, socio-economic status, and physical challenges. Applicants are strongly encouraged
to adhere to the advancement of this principle.





Overview: 

Proposals must be for projects which encourage the growth of democratic institutions and political and economic
pluralism. Listed in order of priority are the areas in which USIA is interested in receiving proposals: (1) local
government/public administration, (2) independent media development, and (3) business administration. Projects
should lay the groundwork for new and continuing links between American and Central/Eastern European professionals
organizations.



Projects may include: 

study tours in the U.S. for small groups; short-term non-technical workshops conducted in Central/Eastern Europe;
and four- to ten-week internships in the U.S.; consultations in Central/Eastern Europe.

All proposals should demonstrate:



(1) In-depth, substantive knowledge of the issues of concern to these countries;


(2) Established connections with the partner institutions;


(3) The capacity to organize and conduct the program, including appropriate orientation activities for the participants;
detailed work plan for all phases of the project; tentative agendas for study tours, workshops, and internships;
letters of commitment from internship hosts; and selection procedures. Applicants should consult the USIS office
at the U.S. embassies before submitting proposals.




USIA will give priority to proposals from U.S. organizations with partner organizations in Central/Eastern Europe,
which will assist logistically and will contribute to the realization of program goals and objectives and will themselves
to enhanced by the program. Applicants are encouraged to demonstrate partner relationships by providing copies
of correspondence or other materials as appendices to the proposals.




The CEE partner institutions are encouraged to provide cost-sharing or significant in-kind contributions such
as local housing, transportation, interpreting, translating, and other local currency costs and to assist with
the organization of projects.



Local Government






USIA is interested in proposals for training programs which will foster effective administration of local and regional
governments. Programs might examine and seek to improve relationships among local executive, legislative, and
judicial elements, or they might address the knowledge and skills necessary to administer one or more of these branches
of local government.


Program topics might include one or more of the following: judicial administration, budget development, financial
management, tax policies and mechanisms, election practices, management of municipal services, privatization
of government property, consumer protection, business regulation (as opposed to control), licensing, and environmental
protection. Programs might further the development of information and library systems relevant to local government,
improve committee and staff structures, research capability, legislation drafting capability, structural and
procedural needs of local governments. Training should be conducted mostly in local centers, preferably situated
outside the capital cities.

Mass Media Development


The focus of the proposals should be directed toward the development of a free and independent media.
Programs in this general topic fall under two training subcategories: working reporters and media business management.
Preference will be given to mass media training programs which contain a U.S. internship component. For training
programs in CEE, preference will be given to those of at least two weeks duration; they could focus on either basic journalism
or business management techniques. Training, especially for journalists outside of the CEE capital cities, should
emphasize skills such as effective writing, investigative reporting, objectivity, evaluation of sources, clear
labelling of editorials and opinion pieces, conformance to copyright laws, and ethics.
Media management training (both print and broadcast) should focus on management of media as a profitable business.
Topics to be addressed might include management techniques, desk top publishing, advertising, marketing, distribution,
public relations, staff development, accountability, and the pitfalls of journalistic advocacy, among others.


Business Administration


While this topic is broad, proposals should focus primarily on management training, small business development
(including incubators and Small Business Centers), agri-business, banking, credit practices, financial management,
marketing management, industrial relations, and/or privatization.
Program design should clearly differentiate CEE target audiences, such as professors and instructors of economics,
senior business leaders, government officials, or promising practitioners, and demonstrate how the proposed agenda
addresses the selected audience(s).
USIA has a strong interest in programs on the development of business structures and the creating of jobs in non-urban
areas.


Scope


Proposals should limit their focus to one of the CEE countries and to one of the three major topics: local governance,
independent media development, or business administration. Proposals for programs that are broader in scope will
be eligible, but are less likely to receive USIA support. USIA will consider geographic distribution in selecting
grantee institutions to ensure a wide distribution of this program.
USIA encourages proposals which feature ``train-the-trainers'' models' the creation of indigenous training centers;
schemes to create professional networks or professional associations to disseminate information; and other enduring
aspects.


Guidelines: Selection of Participants. 

All grant proposals must clearly describe the type of persons who will participate in the program as well as the process
by which participants will be selected. Programs that include internships in the U.S. should provide letters tentatively
committing host institutions to support the internships. In the selection of all foreign participants, USIA and
USIS posts retain the right to nominate participants and to approve or reject participants recommended by the program
institution. Programs must also comply with J-1 visa regulations. Please refer to program specific guidelines
in the Application Package for further details.

USIA does not support proposals limited to conferences or seminars (i.e., one- to fourteen-day programs with plenary
sessions, major speakers, and panels with a passive audience). It will support conferences only insofar as they are
a minor part of a larger project in duration and scope which is receiving USIA funding from this competition. Furthermore,
USIA will not support research projects or projects limited to technical issues. Publications intended for dissemination
in the United States, individual student exchanges, film festivals or exhibits are also not eligible for support.
In addition, this Office will not provide scholarships or other support for long-term (i.e. a semester or more) academic
studies. Proposals that request support for the development of university curriculums or for degree-based programs
will not be eligible under this RFP.

Proposals to link university departments or to exchange faculty and/or students are funded by USIA's Office of Academic
Programs (E/A) under the University Affiliation Program and should not be submitted under this RFP.

Competitions sponsored by other offices of USIA's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs are also announced
in the 

Federal Register

, and may have different guidelines or restrictions.



Proposed budget: 

The amount requested from USIA should not exceed $200,000. However, exchange organizations with less than four years
of successful experience in managing international exchange programs are limited to $60,000.

Applicants must submit a comprehensive budget for the entire program. There must be a summary budget as well as a breakdown
reflecting both the administrative budget and the program budget. Please refer to the Application Package for complete
formatting instructions. For better understanding or further clarification, applicants may provide separate
sub-budgets for each program component, phase, location, or activity in order to facilitate USIA decisions on funding.






Please note: 

All USIA-funded delegates will be covered under the terms of a USIA-sponsored health insurance policy. The premium
is paid by USIA directly to the insurance company.




Allowable costs for the program include the following:

(1) International and domestic air fares; visas; transit costs; and ground transportation costs.

(2) Per Diem. For the U.S. program, organizations have the option of using a flat $140/day for program participants
or the published U.S. Federal per diem rates for individual American cities.






Note: 

U.S. escorting staff must use the published Federal per diem rates, not the flat rate. For activities in Central/Eastern
Europe, the Federal per diem rates must be used.




(3) Interpreters. Interpreters for the U.S. program are provided by the U.S. State Department Language Services
Division. Typically, a pair of simultaneous interpreters is provided for every four visitors who need interpretation.
USIA grants do not pay for foreign interpreters to accompany delegations from their home country. Grant proposal
budgets should contain a flat $140/day per diem for each DOS interpreter, as well as home-program-home air transportation
of $400 per interpreter plus any U.S. travel expenses during the program. Salary expenses are covered centrally and
should not be part of an applicant's proposed budget.

(4) Book and cultural allowance. Participants and escorts are entitled to a one-time cultural allowance of $150 per
person, plus a book allowance of $50. U.S. staff do not get these benefits.

(5) Consultants may be used to provide specialized expertise or to make presentations. Daily honoraria generally
do not exceed $250 per day. Subcontracting organizations may also be used, in which case the written agreement between
the prospective grantee and subcontractor should be included in the proposal.

(6) Room rental should not exceed $250 per day.

(7) One working meal per project. Per capita costs may not exceed $5-8 for a lunch and $14-20 for a dinner;
this includes room rental if applicable. The number of invited guests may not exceed participants by more than a factor
of two to one.

(8) A return travel allowance of $70 for each participant which is to be used for incidental expenditures incurred
during international travel.

(9) Audit Requirements. The proposal shall include the cost of an audit that:
a. Complies with the requirements of OMB circular No. 1-133, Audits of Institutions of Higher Education and
Other Nonprofit Institutions;
b. Complies with the requirements of American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) statement of Position
(SOP) No. 92-9; and 
c. Includes review by the recipient's independent auditor of a recipient-prepared supplemental schedule of indirect
cost rate computation, if such a rate is being proposed.

The audit costs shall be identified separately for: 


a. Preparation of basic financial statements, and other accounting services; and

b. Preparation of the supplemental reports and schedules required by OMB Circular No. A-133, AICPA SOP 92-9,
and the review of the supplemental schedule of indirect cost rate computation.

11. Cost-sharing is encouraged. Cost-sharing may be in the form of allowable direct or indirect costs. The Recipient
must maintain written records to support all allowable costs which are claimed as being its contributions to cost
participation, as well as costs to be paid by the Federal government. Such records are subject to audit. The basis for
determining the value of cash and in-kind contributions must be in accordance with OMB Circular A-110, Attachment
E, ``Cost-sharing and Matching'' and should be described in the proposal. In the event the Recipient does not provide
the minimum amount of cost-sharing as stipulated in the Recipient's budget, the Agency's contribution will be reduced
in proportion to the Recipient's, contribution. Please refer to the Application Package for complete budget guidelines.


Review Process


USIA will acknowledge receipt of all proposals and will review them for technical eligibility. Proposals will be

to adhere to the advancement of this principle.



Overview



The U.S. Information Agency (USIA) is soliciting proposals from U.S. professional, not-for-profit institutions/organizations
to recruit, place and manage 30-40 English Teaching Fellows who will serve as full-time teachers of English
as a Foreign Language, as materials or test developers or as teacher trainers in countries around the world. The English
Teaching Program is designed to increase the American presence, enhance the American cultural component, and improve
academic standards at universities, teacher-training colleges, binational centers, and other post-selected
institutions with English teaching programs. The program enables recent recipients of M.A.'s in teaching English
as a foreign/second language (TEFL/TESL) to acquire overseas teaching experience, while providing host institutions
with up-to-date professional expertise in the methods and theory of English teaching.

Programs must comply with J-1 visa regulations. Please refer to program specific guidelines in the Application
Package for further details.



Proposed Budget



The proposal must contain a specific and detailed line-item budget. The budget should be constructed in such a way
as to reflect the task of recruiting and placing 30-35-40 fellows, and carrying out follow-up activities.
At this time the Agency has not determined the full funding level for FY'95.

Grants awarded to eligible organizations with less than four years of experience in conducting international exchange
programs will be limited to $60,000.

Applicants must submit a comprehensive budget for the entire program. There must be a summary budget as well as a breakdown
reflecting both the administrative budget and the program budget. Please refer to the Application Package for complete
formatting instructions. For better understanding or further clarification, applicants may provide separate
sub-budgets for each program component, phase, location, or activity in order to facilitate USIA decisions on funding.

2. Program planning:

 Detailed agenda and relevant work plan should demonstrate substantive undertakings and logistical capacity. Agenda
and plan should adhere to the program overview and guidelines described above.


3. Ability to achieve program objectives:

 Objectives should be reasonable, feasible, and flexible. Proposals should clearly demonstrate how the institution
will meet the program's objectives and plan.


4. Multiplier effect/impact:

 Proposed programs should strengthen long-term mutual understanding, including maximum sharing of information
and establishment of long-term institutional and individual linkages.


5. Support of Diversity:

 Proposals should demonstrate the recipient's commitment to promoting the awareness and understanding of diversity
throughout the program. This can be accomplished through documentation (such as a written statement or account)
summarizing past and/or on-going activities and efforts that further the principle of diversity within both the
organization and the program activities.


6. Institutional Capacity:

 Proposed personnel and institutional resources should be adequate and appropriate to achieve the program or project's
goals.


7. Institution's Record/Ability:

 Proposals should demonstrate an institutional record of successful exchange programs, including responsible
fiscal management and full compliance with all reporting requirements for past Agency grants as determined by USIA's
Office of Contracts. The Agency will consider the past performance of prior recipients and the demonstrated potential
of new applicants.


8. Follow-on Activities:

 Proposals should provide a plan for continued follow-on activity (without USIA support) which insures that USIA
supported programs are not isolated events.


9. Project Evaluation:

 Proposals should include a plan to evaluate the activity's success, both as the activities unfold and at the end of
the program. USIA recommends that the proposal include a draft survey questionnaire or other technique plus description
of a methodology to use to link outcomes to original project objectives. Award-receiving organizations/institutions
will be expected to submit intermediate reports after each project component is concluded or quarterly, whichever
is less frequent.


10. Cost-effectiveness:

 The overhead and administrative components of the proposal, including salaries and honoraria, should be kept as
low as possible. All other items should be necessary and appropriate.


11. Cost-sharing:

 Proposals should maximize cost-sharing through other private sector support as well as institutional direct funding
contributions.


12. Value to U.S.-Partner Country Relations:

 Proposed projects should receive positive assessments by USIA's geographic area desk and overseas officers of program
need, potential impact, and significance in the partner country(ies).


13. TEFL/TESL Background:

 Must possess a proven ability to network that provides and allows for the greatest dissemination of information to
and among the profession of Teachers of English as a Second or Foreign Language; must be able to provide knowledgeable,
TEFL-qualified, experienced staff capable of interviewing candidates and evaluating their qualifications for
teaching, and/or for developing materials, or for conducting teacher-training in the context of English as a foreign
language, in accord with criteria established by USIA.

ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) is providing notice that the Council of Representatives
of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) has decided, pursuant to a request by the Government of Venezuela,
to establish a dispute settlement panel to review the complaint by Venezuela against the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency's (EPA) Regulation of Fuels and Fuel Additives: Standards for Reformulated and Conventional Gasoline, signed
on December 15, 1993 (59 FR 7716; February 16, 1994) (``Final Rule'').



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

USTR is providing notice of the request for, and establishment of, a dispute settlement panel to examine the consistency
of EPA's Final Rule with the obligations of the United States under the GATT. Venezuela is the complaining party in
this dispute, and the European Community, Canada, Norway and Australia have reserved their rights to intervene in
the panel proceedings as third parties.



Venezuela has asked the panel to review the compatibility of the Final Rule with the provisions of Articles I, III,
VIII, and XI of the GATT.

Members of the panel are currently being selected. Once the panel has been formed, it is expected to meet as necessary
at the GATT headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland, to consider information relevant to the dispute. The panel will
then provide a report to the GATT Council detailing its findings and recommendations.

<DOCTITLE>Initiation of Section 302 Investigation and Request for Public Comment: Barriers To Access to the Auto Parts Replacement
Market in Japan</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of the United States Trade Representative.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of initiation of investigation under section 302(b)(1)(A) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2412(b)(1)(A);
request for written comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The United States Trade Representative (USTR) has initiated an investigation under section 302(b)(1)(A) of the
Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the Trade Act), with respect to certain acts, polices and practices of the Government
of Japan that restrict or deny U.S. auto parts suppliers' access to the auto parts replacement and accessories market
(``after-market'') in Japan. USTR invites written comments from the public on the matters being investigated.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Section 302(b)(1)(A) of the Trade Act authorizes the USTR to initiate an investigation under chapter 1 of Title III
of the Trade Act (commonly referred to as ``section 301''), with respect to any matter in order to determine whether
the matter is actionable under section 301. Matters actionable under section 301 include, 

inter alia, 

acts, policies, and practices of a foreign country that are unreasonable or discriminatory and burden or restrict
U.S. commerce. An act, policy or practice is unreasonable if the act, policy or practice, while not necessarily in
violation of, or inconsistent with, the international legal rights of the United States, is otherwise unfair or inequitable.
Unreasonable acts, policies or practices include, 

inter alia, 

denial of fair and equitable market opportunities.




On October 1, 1994, USTR determined that an investigation should be initiated to determine whether specific barriers
to access to the after-market for auto parts in Japan are unreasonable or discriminatory and burden or restrict U.S.
commerce. The barriers subject to investigation include Japanese Government regulations such as the so-called
``critical parts'' and ``alteration regulations and the certification system for garages and mechanics. These
regulations are vague and very broad in scope. They support and work in combination with market restrictive practices
by Japanese auto companies and parts distributors substantially to limit foreign access to the Japanese auto parts
after-market, particularly for foreign parts suppliers unable to sell original equipment to Japanese auto manufacturers.
U.S. parts suppliers could significantly expand sales to the Japanese after-market if the critical parts and alteration
regulations were made clearer and less restrictive.



Investigation and Consultations



Pursuant to section 303(a) of the Trade Act, the USTR has requested consultations with the Government of Japan concerning
the issues under investigation. USTR will seek information and advice from the appropriate representatives provided
for under section 135 of the Trade Act in preparing the U.S. presentations for such consultations.

Pursuant to section 304 of the Trade Act, the USTR must determine within 12 months after the date on which this investigation
was initiated (i.e., on or before October 1, 1995), on the basis of the investigation and the consultations, whether
any act, policy, or practice described in section 301 of the Trade Act exists and, if that determination is affirmative,
determine what action, if any, to take under section 301 of the Trade Act.

Public Comment: Requirements for Submissions



Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the acts, policies and practices of the Government of
Japan that are the subject of this investigation, the amount of burden or restriction on U.S. commerce caused by these
acts, policies and practices, and the determinations required under section 304 of the Trade Act.

Comments must be filed in accordance with the requirements set forth in 15 CFR 2006.8(b) (55 FR 20593) and are due no

Counsel, Attn: Auto Parts Investigation, Room 223, USTR, 600 17th Street, NW, Washington, DC 20506.

Comments will be placed in a file (Docket 301-93) open to public inspection pursuant to 15 CFR 2006.13, except
confidential business information exempt from public inspection in accordance with 15 CFR 2006.15. Confidential
business information submitted in accordance with 15 CFR 2006.15 must be clearly marked ``BUSINESS CONFIDENTIAL''
in a contrasting color ink at the top of each page on each of 20 copies, and must be accompanied by a nonconfidential summary
of the confidential information. The nonconfidential summary shall be placed in the file that is open to public inspection.

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Termination of Sanctions With Respect to Japan Pursuant to Title VII of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness
Act of 1988</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of the United States Trade Representative.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Termination of sanctions scheduled to be imposed on Japan pursuant to Title VII of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness
Act of 1988.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On October 4, 1994, the United States Trade Representative determined that sanctions, scheduled to go into effect
on Japanese goods and services on September 30, 1994, under Title VII of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act
of 1988, should be terminated, effective September 30, 1994, as a result of an agreement between the United States
and Japan relating to procurement of telecommunications and medical technology goods and services.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On July 31, 1994, the Administration cited Japan under Title VII of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988
(19 U.S.C. 2515, as amended) as a country that maintains, in government procurement of telecommunications and medical
technology goods and services, a significant and persistent pattern or practice discrimination against U.S. products
or services that results in identifiable harm to U.S. businesses. Title VII provides that if the identified practices
are not satisfactorily addressed during a 60-day consultation period, then the President must formally identify
the country and the statutory sanctions take effect on the following day.




On October 1, 1994, the Governments of the United States and Japan reached an agreement relating to procurement of
telecommunications and medical technology goods and services. The Japanese Government agreed to adopt improved
procurement measures. These new measures and an accompanying exchange of letters between the United States and Japan
address all the major U.S. concerns in the telecommunications and medical technology sectors. The United States
Trade Representative (USTR) concluded that implementation of the improved measures and the accompanying exchange
of letters will eliminate the discrimination identified under Title VII. Based on delegation of authority from the
President, the USTR terminated sanctions effective September 30, 1994. A copy of the USTR's determination is attached.

Determination Under Title VII of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act



On July 31, 1994, the United States identified Japan under Title VII of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of
1988 (19 U.S.C. 2515, as amended) as a country that maintains, in government procurement of telecommunications and
medical technology goods and services, a significant and persistent pattern or practice of discrimination against
U.S. products or services that results in identifiable harm to U.S. businesses. Since that time, we have held intensive
discussions with the Government of Japan to resolve the identified discriminatory practices.
Sanctions were scheduled to go into effect on September 30, 1994. On October 1, 1994, the United States reached an agreement
with the Government of Japan relating to procurement of telecommunications and medical technology goods and services,
which will address the discrimination identified by the United States. The procurement measures to be implemented
by the Government of Japan and an accompanying exchange of letters between the United States and Japan represent a
significant change in Japanese Government practices in the procurement of telecommunications and medical technology
goods and services and address all the major U.S. concerns in these sectors.

Pursuant to the authority vested in me by the President of the United States by Presidential Determination No. 94-52
of September 29, 1994, I have determined that implementation of the agreement with Japan will eliminate the discrimination
identified under Title VII and therefore terminated sanctions effective September 30, 1994.

Early Education Program for Children With Disabilities; Technology, Educational Media, and Materials for Individuals
With Disabilities Program; and Program for Children and Youth With Serious Emotional Disturbance 



<AGENCY>

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of final priorities.



 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Secretary announces final priorities for three programs administered by the Office of Special Education and
Rehabilitative Services (OSERS) under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. The Secretary may use these
priorities in Fiscal Year 1995 and subsequent years. The Secretary takes this action to focus Federal assistance
on identified needs to improve outcomes for children with disabilities. The final priorities are intended to ensure
wide and effective use of program funds.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This notice contains one final priority under the Early Education Program for Children with Disabilities, one final
priority under the Technology, Educational Media, and Materials for Individuals with Disabilities Program, and
one final priority under the Program for Children and Youth with Serious Emotional Disturbance. The purpose of each
program is stated separately under the title of that program. 



On August 1, 1994, the Secretary published a notice of proposed priorities for these programs in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 39234-39238). 

These final priorities support the National Education Goals by improving understanding of how to enable children
and youth with disabilities to reach higher levels of academic achievement. 

The publication of these final priorities does not preclude the Secretary from proposing additional priorities,
nor does it limit the Secretary to funding only these priorities, subject to meeting applicable rulemaking requirements.
Funding of particular projects depends on the availability of funds, and the quality of the applications received.
Further, priorities could be affected by enactment of legislation reauthorizing these programs.






Note: 

This notice of final priorities does not solicit applications. A notice inviting applications under these competitions
is published in separate notices in this issue of the 

Federal Register

Analysis of Comments and Changes 



In response to the Secretary's invitation in the notice of proposed priorities, one party submitted comments. The
comments concerned the priority titled ``Collaborative Research on Technology, Media, and Materials for Children
and Youth with Disabilities'' proposed under the Technology, Educational Media, and Materials for Individuals
with Disabilities Program. An analysis of the comments and of the changes in the proposed priorities follows. Technical
and other minor changes are not addressed. 



Comment:

 The commenter expressed concern that only researchers and practitioners are described as actively involved in all
phases of the research under the priority titled ``Collaborative Research on Technology, Media, and Materials for
Children and Youth with Disabilities.'' The commenter suggested that the priority be revised to include family members
and students with disabilities as active participants in the research. 




Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees that collaborative research means partnerships between all stakeholders, including family
members and students with disabilities, and that their inclusion is important to reducing the gap between research
and practice. 




Changes:

 A sentence has been added to the priority to emphasize the importance of including input from family members and students
with disabilities in the research project. The new sentence states: ``To further reduce the gap between research
and practice, projects are encouraged to include input from family members and students with disabilities.'' 




Comment:

 Under the priority titled ``Collaborative Research on Technology, Media, and Materials for Children and Youth with
Disabilities'', the same commenter expressed concern that the unique needs of students with cognitive disabilities
are too frequently not considered. The commenter suggested that projects should indicate how such research will
benefit this population of students. 




Discussion:

 The priority as written does not preclude projects that focus on students with cognitive disabilities. However,
it is the responsibility of the applicant to develop the project focus in terms of curriculum areas, grade/age levels,
disabilities, types of services provided, and/or specific types of technology, media and materials. The Secretary
does not believe it would be appropriate to limit projects to certain disability areas, but prefers to give potential
applicants the latitude to include any disability. 




Changes:

 None. 



Early Education Program for Children With Disabilities 






Purpose of Program:

 The purpose of this program is to support activities that are designed (a) to address the special needs of children
with disabilities, birth through age eight, and their families; and, (b) to assist State and local entities in expanding
and improving programs and services for these children and their families. 



Priority




Under 34 CFR 75.105(c)(3) the Secretary gives an absolute preference to applications that meet the following priority.
The Secretary will fund under this competition only applications that meet this absolute priority: 




Proposed Absolute Priority_Early Childhood Research Institute: Follow Through 






Background:

 This priority supports an Early Childhood Research Institute to develop, evaluate and disseminate strategies and
procedures that will move the successful practices of early intervention and preschool programs into the early elementary
school grades. These successful practices include, but are not limited to, (1) family-friendly and family-focused
approaches to planning and providing special education and related services, (2) extensive parent involvement
in service planning and delivery, (3) integrated and coordinated delivery of services when multiple services are
necessary, (4) multi-disciplinary input into service planning and delivery, (5) developmentally appropriate
services delivered in ungraded/mixed-age and mixed ability group settings, and (6) a pro-active approach to service
planning and delivery in which services (e.g., team teaching, assistive technology applications, use of paraprofessionals)
are integrated and concentrated to ensure that as many children with disabilities as possible successfully acquire
critical skills taught in the primary grades (e.g., beginning literacy, social skills) that are crucial to children's
progress and adjustment in school. 


The Institute's research, development and evaluation activities must (1) identify administrative, attitudinal,
and programmatic barriers to establishing these successful practices in kindergarten through grade three (or equivalent)
for children with disabilities and their families; (2) develop and evaluate strategies and procedures that are designed
to overcome these 
barriers, such as strategies parents can use to maintain their involvement once their child reaches school age, and
strategies school personnel can use to encourage and facilitate continued parent involvement; and (3) identify
effective ways to disseminate the findings and products of the Institute so that successful practices, or combinations
of practices, can be adopted easily by school systems. 

The Secretary anticipates funding one cooperative agreement with a project period of up to 60 months subject to the
requirements of 34 CFR 75.253(a) for continuation awards. In determining whether to continue the Institute for the
fourth and fifth years of the project period, the Secretary, in addition to applying the requirements of 34 CFR 75.253(a),
considers the recommendation of a review team consisting of three experts selected by the Secretary. The services
of the review team, including a two-day visit to the project, are to be performed during the last half of the Institute's
second year and may be included in that year's evaluation required under 34 CFR 75.590. 



Priority:

 The Early Childhood Research Institute considered for funding under this priority must_

<TEXT>
 

(a) Conduct a program of research that addresses the issues identified above. 


(b) Identify specific strategies and procedures that will be investigated. 


(c) Carry out the research within a conceptual framework, based on previous research or theory, that provides a basis
for the strategies and procedures to be studied, the research methods 
and instrumentation that will be used, and the specific target populations and settings that will be studied. 


(d) Collect, analyze, and report a variety of descriptive and outcome data, including (1) specific information on
the settings, the service providers, the children and families targeted by the Institute (e.g., age, disability,
level of functioning and membership in a special population, if appropriate); (2) multiple, functional outcome
data for the children and families who are the focus of the strategies and procedures; and (3) multiple outcome data
for the teachers, administrators, and other school staff involved in the research. 


(e) Conduct the research in typical school settings, including settings that are, or will be, implementing different
combinations of the successful practices. 


(f) Conduct the research using methodological procedures that are designed to produce unambiguous findings regarding
the effects of the strategies and procedures, as well as any findings on interaction effects between particular strategies
or procedures and particular characteristics of participants or settings. These findings will be rendered through
appropriate sample selection and adequate sample size to permit use of the findings in policy analyses. 


(g) Design all activities in a manner that is likely to lead to improved services for children with disabilities and
their families, including those who are members of cultural, linguistic, or racial minority groups. 


(h) Develop, field test, and disseminate a variety of 
products that can be used for training and technical assistance activities with policy makers, administrators,
school board members, parents, and service providers and that are likely to facilitate the implementation of the
successful practices in early elementary school settings. 


(i) Coordinate research and dissemination activities with other relevant efforts sponsored by the U.S. Department
of Education, including other research institutes, technical assistance entities, and information clearinghouses.



(j) Provide research training and experience for at least 10 graduate students annually. 


In determining whether to continue the Institute for the fourth and fifth years of the project period, in addition
to considering factors in 34 CFR 75.253(a), the Secretary considers the following: 


(a) The timeliness and effectiveness with which all requirements of the negotiated cooperative agreement have been
or are being met by the Institute. 


(b) The degree to which the Institute's research designs and methodological procedures demonstrate the potential
for producing significant new knowledge and products. 


In order to apply for funding for years four and five, the Institute must set aside in its budget for the second year,
funds to cover costs associated with the services to be performed by the review team appointed by the Secretary to evaluate
the project in the second year. These funds are estimated to be approximately $4,000.

Technology, Educational Media, and Materials for Individuals With Disabilities Program 






Purpose of Program:

 The purpose of this program is to support projects and centers for advancing the availability, quality, use, and effectiveness
of technology, educational media, and materials in the education of children and youth with disabilities and the
provision of early intervention services to infants and toddlers with disabilities. In creating Part G of the Individuals
with Disabilities Education Act, Congress expressed the intent that the projects and centers funded under that part
should be primarily for the purpose of enhancing research and development advances and efforts being undertaken
by the public or private sector, and to provide necessary linkages to make more efficient and effective the flow from
research and development to application. 



Priority 




Under 34 CFR 75.105(c)(3) the Secretary gives an absolute preference to applications that meet the following priority.
The Secretary will fund under this competition only applications that meet this absolute priority: 



Proposed Absolute Priority_Collaborative Research on Technology, Media, and Materials for Children and Youth
With Disabilities 






Background:

 In 1993 an agenda was developed for the Technology, Educational Media, and Materials for Individuals with Disabilities
Program which set forth four program commitments. These four commitments were derived from broad-based input from
the field, and together they represent the means by which the Office of Special Education Programs intends to advance
the use of technology, media, and materials with students with disabilities. They are: 


(1)

 Enable the Learner Across Environments.

 This means fostering instructional environments, both in and out of school, that use technology, educational media,
and materials to enable students with disabilities to access knowledge, develop skills and problem-solving strategies,
and engage in educational experiences necessary for their success as adults.

(2) 

Promote Effective Policy. 

This means policymaking at all levels in government, schools, and business to ensure accessibility, availability,
effective application, and consistent use of appropriate technology, media, and materials. 
(3) 

Foster Use Through Professional Development. 

This means training and supporting teachers, administrators, parents, and related service personnel on the benefits
of instructional and assistive technologies so that they can increase productive use of instructional time, prepare
students with disabilities for employment and citizenship, and promote their intellectual, ethical, cultural,
emotional, and physical growth. 
(4) 

Create Innovative Tools. 

This means encouraging development of varied and integrated technologies, media, and materials which open up and
expand the lives of those with disabilities. 
However, research is needed on how these interrelated commitments can be applied in the complex reality of educational
practice. This priority addresses that need by supporting collaborative research, which means research based on
a partnership between researchers and practitioners in which both are actively involved in all phases of the research_initial
planning and design, collection of information or data, analysis of information or data, and reporting and dissemination.
This research strategy is intended to produce methodologically sound research information that is relevant and
applicable to practice and reduces the gap between research and practice. To further reduce the gap between research
and practice, projects are encouraged to include input from family members and students with disabilities. 


Priority:

 The Assistant Secretary establishes an absolute priority for collaborative research projects that_
(a) Formulate a research topic and design based on commitments (1), (2), and (3), as described above, as they relate
to improving education and/or related services at the local level for students with disabilities. This priority
is not intended to support projects that are primarily engaged in product development; thus, commitment (4) may be
included only as a supporting activity. In formulating the research topic, projects must develop a focus in terms
of curriculum areas, grade/age levels, disabilities, types of services provided, and/or specific types of technology,
media and materials. In formulating the research design, projects must apply the standards for conducting rigorous
social science research. The following research topics are offered as illustrative examples and do not represent
the full range of possible topics. These examples are broad, and projects may opt for more narrow focuses. However,
projects must address all three program commitments_either as background, contextual factors, or as components
of interventions or manipulations. 


Example 1

: Research on how local policies in schools and other agencies restrict or facilitate the acquisition and use of assistive
devices, and how professional development within the context of these policies can yield improved assistive technology
services to better enable students to access school, home, and community environments. 


Example 2

: Research on how local policies regarding curriculum and accountability can be revised to promote interdisciplinary
professional collaboration in the effective use of technology, media and materials to enable students with disabilities
to acquire high-level problem-solving strategies. 


Example 3

: Research on how policies and professional practices may contribute to inequitable access and use of technology,
media and materials for some students with disabilities, and how the inequities can be reduced by means of policy and/or
professional interventions to better enable students with disabilities to engage in beneficial educational experiences.

(b) Conduct a program of collaborative research on the research topic. 
(c) Measure the effects of the intervention and relationships within and across the program commitments (1, 2, and
3). 
(d) Disseminate information on the findings of the collaborative research in a form conducive to use by other schools
or service providers, as well as other researchers. 
(e) Coordinate their activities, as appropriate, with recipients of grants under the Technology-Related Assistance
for Individuals with Disabilities Act (Pub. L. 100-407 as amended by Pub. L. 103-218). 
A project must budget for two trips annually to Washington, D.C., for (1) a two-day Research Project Directors' meeting;
and (2) another meeting, to meet and collaborate with the project officer of the Office of Special Education Programs
and the other projects funded under this priority, to share information and to discuss findings and joint methods
of dissemination.

Priority


Under 34 CFR 75.105(c)(3) the Secretary gives an absolute preference to applications that meet the following priority.
The Secretary will fund under this competition only applications that meet this absolute priority: 


Proposed Absolute Priority_Nondiscriminatory, Culturally-Competent, Collaborative Demonstration Models
To Improve Services for Students With Serious Emotional Disturbance and Prevention Services for Students With Emotional
and Behavioral Problems 




Background:

 The rates of identification, placement, and achievement of children and youth with emotional and behavioral problems
vary across racial, cultural, gender, and socioeconomic dimensions. For example, African-American students are
most likely to be identified as students with serious emotional disturbance (SED). African-Americans comprise
16 percent of public school enrollment, but represent 22 percent of all students identified with SED (based on data
from the 1990 OCR survey of school districts), and 25 percent of secondary students with SED (based on data from OSEP
National Longitudinal Transition Study). Rates of SED identification for African-American students vary greatly
across States but, on average, States with the lowest overall African-American enrollment have the highest SED incidence
rates for those students and, conversely, States with the highest overall African-American enrollment have the
lowest average rate of SED classification for these students (based on data from the 1990 OCR survey of school districts).
These data suggest that African-American students may be over-represented in SED programs in some States, and underserved
in others, and that some of these differences may be related to identification, evaluation, and placement methods
that fail to recognize cultural differences. 
Diversity must be acknowledged and valued, and both prevention and SED service delivery systems must be culturally-competent.
Cultural competencies represent the interpersonal skills and attitudes that enable individuals to increase their
understanding and appreciation of the rich and fluid nature of culture and of differences and similarities within,
among, and between cultures and individuals. 
Culturally-competent approaches recognize the cultural origins of teachers' and service providers' views, behaviors,
and methods. These approaches also recognize that language and language use conventions are culturally based, and
attend to the communicative styles of students and their families. Culturally-competent approaches address culturally-based
definitions of family and networks. They view family and community as critical parts of a student's support system.
Such approaches also demonstrate a willingness and ability to draw on community-based values, traditions, customs,
and resources. Assessment, pre-referral, and preventive approaches that are culturally-competent and linguistically
appropriate recognize and nurture the strengths_individual and cultural_that students bring to school. 
There is a need to improve the capacity of individuals and systems to respond skillfully, respectfully, and effectively
to students, families, teachers, and other providers in a manner that recognizes, affirms, and values their worth
and dignity. To accomplish this, collaboration must be fostered_among families, professionals, students, and
communities_to identify and provide culturally-competent services for students with SED and prevention services
that address the needs of children and youth with emotional and behavioral problems. 


Priority

: The Assistant Secretary establishes an absolute priority for demonstration projects that develop, implement,
evaluate, and disseminate nondiscriminatory, culturally-competent, collaborative practices to prevent children
with emotional and behavioral problems from developing SED, and to improve special education and related services
for ethnic and cultural minority students, in the least restrictive environment. The projects must establish local,
community-based assessment, planning, prevention, and intervention teams that involve participation from education,
mental health, juvenile justice agencies, other appropriate community service agencies, and organizations representing
families. The first stage of each project must consist of the development and refinement of working agreements between
the various community agencies and organizations, to identify approaches that improve the capacity of individuals
and systems to respond skillfully, respectfully, and effectively to students, families, teachers, and other providers
in a manner that recognizes, affirms, and values their worth and dignity. 
The first stage planning must include the collaborative consideration and development, by all participating groups,
of non-discriminatory, culturally-competent techniques that enhance the fairness and effectiveness of key service
delivery elements, including but not necessarily limited to assessment, education, training, transition planning,
and the provision of related services. The second stage of each project must consist of the implementation and evaluation
of the services delivered, across service providers, followed by dissemination of the results. 
A project must budget for two trips annually to Washington, D.C., for (1) a two-day Research Project Directors' meeting;
and (2) another meeting, to meet and collaborate with the OSEP project officer and the other projects funded under
this priority, to share information and to discuss findings and methods of dissemination.
