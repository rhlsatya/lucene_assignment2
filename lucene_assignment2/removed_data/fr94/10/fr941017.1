</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is proposing to amend its regulations to update the criteria used in decisions
regarding power reactor siting, including geologic, seismic, and earthquake engineering considerations for future
nuclear power plants. The proposed rule would allow NRC to benefit from experience gained in the application of the
procedures and methods set forth in the current regulation and to incorporate the rapid advancements in the earth
sciences and earthquake engineering. In addition, this proposed rule benefits from the public comments received
on the first proposed revision of the regulations. This proposed rule primarily consists of two separate changes,
namely, the source term and dose considerations, and the seismic and earthquake engineering considerations of reactor
siting. The Commission is also proposing to deny the remaining issue in petition (PRM-50-20) filed by
Free Environment, Inc. et al.

I. Background 




The present regulation regarding reactor site criteria (10 CFR part 100) was promulgated April 12, 1962 (27 FR 3509).
NRC staff guidance on exclusion area and low population zone sizes as well as population density was issued in Regulatory
Guide 4.7, ``General Site Suitability Criteria for Nuclear Power Stations,'' published for comment in September
1974. Revision 1 to this guide was issued in November 1975. On June 1, 1976, the Public Interest Research Group (PIRG)
filed a petition for rulemaking (PRM-100-2) requesting that the NRC incorporate minimum exclusion area
and low population zone distances and population density limits into the regulations. On April 28, 1977, Free Environment,
Inc. et al., filed a petition for rulemaking (PRM-50-20). The remaining issue of this petition requests
that the central Iowa nuclear project and other reactors be sited at least 40 miles from major population centers.
In August 1978, the Commission directed the NRC staff to develop a general policy statement on nuclear power reactor
siting. The ``Report of the Siting Policy Task Force'' (NUREG-0625) was issued in August 1979 and provided recommendations
regarding siting of future nuclear power reactors. In the 1980 Authorization Act for the NRC, the Congress directed
the NRC to decouple siting from design and to specify demographic criteria for siting. On July 29, 1980 (45 FR 50350),
the NRC issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) regarding revision of the reactor site criteria,
which discussed the recommendations of the Siting Policy Task Force and sought public comments. The proposed rulemaking
was deferred by the Commission in December 1981 to await development of a Safety Goal and improved research on accident
source terms. On August 4, 1986 (51 FR 23044), the NRC issued its Policy Statement on Safety Goals that stated quantitative
health objectives with regard to both prompt and latent cancer fatality risks. On December 14, 1988 (53 FR 50232),
the NRC denied PRM-100-2 on the basis that it would unnecessarily restrict NRC's regulatory siting policies
and would not result in a substantial increase in the overall protection of the public health and safety. Because of
possible renewed interest in power reactor siting, the NRC is proceeding with a rulemaking in this area. The Commission
proposes to address the remaining issue in PRM-50-20 as part of this rulemaking action. 




Appendix A to 10 CFR part 100, ``Seismic and Geologic Siting Criteria for Nuclear Power Plants,'' was originally issued
as a proposed regulation on November 25, 1971 (36 FR 22601), published as a final regulation on November 13, 1973 (38
FR 31279), and became effective on December 13, 1973. There have been two amendments to 10 CFR part 100, appendix A.
The first amendment, issued November 27, 1973 (38 FR 32575), corrected the final regulation by adding the legend under
the diagram. The second amendment resulted from a petition for rulemaking (PRM-100-1) requesting that
an opinion be issued that would interpret and clarify Appendix A with respect to the determination of the Safe Shutdown
Earthquake. A notice of filing of the petition was published on May 14, 1975 (40 FR 20983). The substance of the petitioner's
proposal was accepted and published as an immediately effective final regulation on January 10, 1977 (42 FR 2052).


The first proposed revision to these regulations was published for public comment on October 20, 1992 (57 FR 47802).
The availability of the five draft regulatory guides and the standard review plan section that were developed to provide
guidance on meeting the proposed regulations was published on November 25, 1992 (57 FR 55601). The comment period
for the proposed regulations was extended two times. First, the NRC staff initiated an extension (58 FR 271) from February
17, 1993 to March 24, 1993, to be consistent with the comment period on the draft regulatory guides and standard review
plan section. Second, in response to a request from the public, the comment period was extended to June 1, 1993 (58 FR
16377). 

The proposed regulations published on October 20, 1992 (57 FR 47802) and draft guidance documents cited in the availability
notice published on November 25, 1992 (57 FR 55601) are withdrawn because of the substantive nature of the changes
to be made in response to public comments and are replaced with the second proposed revision of the regulations presented
in this document. 



II. Objectives 



The objectives of this proposed regulatory action are to_

1. State basic site criteria for future sites that, based upon experience and importance to risk, have been shown as
key to protecting public health and safety; 

2. Provide a stable regulatory basis for seismic and geologic siting and applicable earthquake engineering design
of future nuclear power plants that will update and clarify regulatory requirements and provide a flexible structure
to permit consideration of new technical understandings; and

<TEXT>
 

3. Relocate source term and dose requirements that apply primarily to plant design into 10 CFR part 50. 



III. Genesis 



The proposed regulatory action reflects changes that are intended to (1) benefit from the experience gained in applying
the existing regulation and from research; (2) resolve interpretive questions; (3) provide needed regulatory flexibility
to incorporate state-of-the-art improvements in the geosciences and earthquake engineering; and (4) simplify
the language to a more ``plain English'' text. In addition, the proposed regulatory action will benefit from public
comments received on the first proposed revision of the regulations and guidance documents. 

The proposed regulatory action would apply to applicants who apply for a construction permit, operating license,
preliminary design approval, final design approval, manufacturing license, early site permit, design certification,
or combined license on or after the effective date of the final regulations. 

Criteria not associated with the selection of the site or establishment of the Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground Motion
(SSE) have been placed into 10 CFR part 50. This action is consistent with the location of other design requirements
in 10 CFR part 50. 

Because the revised criteria presented in the proposed regulation would not be applied to existing plants, the licensing
bases for existing nuclear power plants must remain part of the regulations. Therefore, the non-seismic and seismic
reactor site criteria for current plants would be retained as subpart A and appendix A to 10 CFR part 100, respectively.
The proposed revised reactor site criteria would be added as subpart B in 10 CFR part 100 and would apply to site applications
received on or after the effective date of the final regulations. Non-seismic site criteria would be added as a new
 100.21 to subpart B in 10 CFR part 100. The criteria on seismic and geologic siting would be added as a new  100.23
to subpart B in 10 CFR part 100. The dose calculations and the earthquake engineering criteria would be located in 10
CFR part 50 ( 50.34(a) and Appendix S, respectively). Because Appendix S is not self executing, applicable
sections of part 50 ( 50.34 and  50.54) are revised to reference appendix S. The proposed regulation would
also make conforming amendments to 10 CFR part 52. Section 52.17(a)(1) would be amended to reflect changes in 50.34(a)(1)
and 10 CFR Part 100. 



IV. Alternatives 



The first alternative considered by the Commission was to continue using current regulations for site suitability
determinations. This is not considered an acceptable alternative. Accident source terms and dose calculations
currently primarily influence plant design requirements rather than siting. It is desirable to state basic site
criteria which, through importance to risk, have been shown to be key to assuring public health and safety. Further,
significant advances in understanding severe accident behavior, including fission product release and transport,
as well as in the earth sciences and in earthquake engineering have taken place since the promulgation of the present
regulation and deserve to be reflected in the regulations.

The second alternative considered was replacement of the existing regulation with an entirely new regulation. This
is not an acceptable alternative because the provisions of the existing regulations form part of the licensing bases
for many of the operating nuclear power plants and others that are in various stages of obtaining operating licenses.
Therefore, these provisions should remain in force and effect. 

The approach of establishing the revised requirements in new sections to 10 CFR part 100 and relocating plant design
requirements to 10 CFR part 50 while retaining the existing regulation was chosen as the best alternative. The public
will benefit from a clearer, more uniform, and more consistent licensing process that incorporates updated information
and is subject to fewer interpretations. The NRC staff will benefit from improved regulatory implementation (both
technical and legal), fewer interpretive debates, and increased regulatory flexibility. Applicants will derive
the same benefits in addition to avoiding licensing delays caused by unclear regulatory requirements. 



V. Major Changes



A. Reactor Siting Criteria (Nonseismic) 



Since promulgation of the reactor site criteria in 1962, the Commission has approved more than 75 sites for nuclear
power reactors and has had an opportunity to review a number of others. In addition, light-water commercial power
reactors have accumulated about 1800 reactor-years of operating experience in the United States. As a result of these
site reviews and operational experience, a great deal of insight has been gained regarding the design and operation
of nuclear power plants as well as the site factors that influence risk. In addition, an extensive research effort
has been conducted to understand accident phenomena, including fission product release and transport. This extensive
operational experience together with the insights gained from recent severe accident research as well as numerous
risk studies on radioactive material releases to the environment under severe accident conditions have all confirmed
that present commercial power reactor design, construction, operation and siting is expected to effectively limit
risk to the public to very low levels. These risk studies include the early ``Reactor Safety Study'' (WASH-1400),
published in 1975, many Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) studies conducted on individual plants as well as several
specialized studies, and the recent ``Severe Accident Risks: An Assessment for Five U.S. Nuclear Power Plants,''
(NUREG-1150), issued in 1990. Advanced reactor designs currently under review are expected to result in even
lower risk and improved safety compared to existing plants. Hence, the substantial base of knowledge regarding power
reactor siting, design, construction and operation reflects that the primary factors that determine public health
and safety are the reactor design, construction and operation. 

Siting factors and criteria, however, are important in assuring that radiological doses from normal operation and
postulated accidents will be acceptably low, that natural phenomena and potential man-made hazards will be appropriately
accounted for in the design of the plant, and that site characteristics are amenable to the development of adequate
emergency plans to protect the public and adequate security measures to protect the plant. The Commission has also
had a long standing policy of siting reactors away from densely populated centers, and is continuing this policy in
the proposed rule. 

The Commission is proposing to incorporate basic reactor site criteria in the proposed rule to accomplish the above
purposes. 

The Commission proposes to retain source term and dose calculations to verify the adequacy of a site for a specific
plant, but source term and dose calculations will be relocated to part 50, since experience has shown that these calculations
have tended to influence plant design aspects such as containment leak rate or filter performance rather than siting.
No specific source term would be referenced in part 50. Rather, the source term would be required to be one that is ``* * *
assumed to result in substantial meltdown of the core with subsequent release into the containment of appreciable
quantities of fission products.'' Hence, this guidance could be utilized with the source term currently used for
light-water reactors, or used in conjunction with revised accident source terms, currently under development within
the NRC staff as well as in the industry. 

The proposed relocation of source term and dose calculations to part 50 represent a partial decoupling of siting from
accident source term and dose calculations. The siting criteria are envisioned to be utilized together with standardized
plant designs whose features will be certified in a separate design certification rulemaking procedure. Each of
the standardized designs would specify an atmospheric dilution factor that would be required to be met, in order to
meet the dose criteria at the exclusion area boundary. For a given standardized design, a site having relatively poor
dispersion characteristics would require a larger exclusion area distance than one having good dispersion characteristics.
Additional design features would be discouraged in a standardized design to compensate for otherwise poor site conditions.


Although individual plant tradeoffs would be discouraged for a given standardized design, a different standardized
design could require a different atmospheric dilution factor. For custom plants that do not involve a standardized
design, the source term and dose criteria will continue to provide assurance that the site is acceptable for the proposed
design.

Rationale for Individual Criteria 


A. 

Exclusion Area.

 An exclusion area surrounding the immediate vicinity 
of the plant has been a requirement for siting power reactors from the very 
beginning. This area provides a high degree of protection to the public from 
a variety of potential plant accidents and also affords protection to the 
plant from potential man-related hazards. The Commission considers an 
exclusion area to be an essential feature of a reactor site and is proposing 
to retain this requirement for future reactors. 
The proposed rule issued for comment in October 1992 proposed a minimum 
distance to the exclusion area boundary of 0.4 miles (640 meters), based upon 
the suggested value given in Regulatory Guide 4.7, without utilizing source 
term and dose calculations. This was based upon a conservative evaluation of 
the performance of fission product cleanup systems such as containment sprays 
or filter systems. Numerous comments were received stating that source term 
and dose calculations should be retained, and that the exclusion area distance 
should also be based upon a more realistic evaluation of actual fission 
product cleanup systems. In response to these comments, the Commission is 
proposing, in the present rule, to retain the use of source term and dose 
calculations, in part 50, to verify that an applicant's proposed exclusion 
area distance is adequate to assure that the radiological dose to an 
individual will be acceptably low in the event of a postulated accident. 
However, as noted above, if source term and dose calculations are used in 
conjunction with standardized designs, unlimited plant tradeoffs to compensate 
for poor site conditions would not be permitted. For plants that do not 
involve standardized designs, the source term and dose calculations would 
continue to provide assurance that the site is acceptable for the proposed 
design. 
The present regulation requires that the exclusion area be of such size 
that an individual located at any point on its boundary for two hours 
immediately following onset of the postulated fission product release would 
not receive a total radiation dose in excess of 25 rem to the whole body or 
300 rem to the thyroid gland. A footnote in the present regulation notes that 
a whole body dose of 25 rem has been stated to correspond numerically to the 
once in a lifetime accidental or emergency dose to radiation workers which 
could be disregarded in the determination of their radiation exposure status 
(NBS Handbook 69 dated June 5, 1959). However, the same footnote also clearly 
states that the Commission's use of this value does not imply that it 
considers it to be an acceptable limit for an emergency dose to the public 
under accident conditions, but only that it represents a reference value to be 
used for evaluating plant features and site characteristics intended to 
mitigate the radiological consequences of accidents in order to provide 
assurance of low risk to the public under postulated accidents. The 
Commission, based upon extensive experience in applying this criterion, and in 
recognition of the conservatism of the assumptions in its application (a large 
fission product release within containment associated with major core damage, 
maximum allowable containment leak rate, a postulated single failure of any of 
the fission product cleanup systems, such as the containment sprays, adverse 
site meteorological dispersion characteristics, an individual presumed to be 
located at the boundary of the exclusion area at the centerline of the plume 
for two hours without protective actions), believes that this criterion has 
clearly resulted in an adequate level of protection. As an illustration of 
the conservatism of this assessment, the maximum whole body dose received by 
an actual individual during the Three Mile Island accident in March 1979, 
which involved major core damage, was estimated to be about 0.1 rem. 
In the proposed rule, the Commission is proposing two changes in this 
area. 
First, the Commission is proposing that the use of different doses for 
the whole body and thyroid gland be replaced by a single value of 25 rem, 
total effective dose equivalent (TEDE). The total effective dose equivalent 
concept is consistent with part 20 of the Commission's regulations, and is 
defined as the deep dose equivalent (for external exposures) plus the 
committed effective dose equivalent (for internal exposures). The deep dose 
equivalent is the same as the present whole body dose, while the committed 
effective dose equivalent is the sum of the products of doses to selected body 
organs times weighting factors for each organ that are representative of the 
radiation risk associated with that organ.

<TEXT>
 

The proposed use of the total effective dose equivalent, or TEDE, is 
based upon two considerations. First, since it utilizes a risk consistent 
methodology to assess the radiological impact of all relevant nuclides upon 
all body organs, use of TEDE promotes a uniformity and consistency in 
assessing radiation risk that may not exist with the separate whole body and 
thyroid organ dose values in the present regulation. Second, use of TEDE 
lends itself readily to the application of updated accident source terms, 
which can vary not only with plant design, but in which additional nuclides 
besides the noble gases and iodine are predicted to be released into 
containment. 
The Commission has examined the current dose criteria of 25 rem whole 
body and 300 rem thyroid with the intent of selecting a TEDE numerical value 
equivalent to the risk implied by the current dose criteria. These risks 
consist of the risk of developing cancer some time after the exposure (latent 
cancer incidence), as well as a delayed risk of cancer fatality (latent cancer 
fatality). For a dose of 25 rem whole body, the individual risk of latent 
cancer fatality is estimated to be about 2.5 x 10

^2

; the risk of latent cancer 
incidence is about twice that (using risk coefficients expressed by ICRP 
Publication 60 and in NUREG/CR-4214). For a dose of 300 rem thyroid, the risk 
of latent cancer fatality is about 2 x 10

^3

; the risk of latent cancer 
incidence is about a factor of ten higher. 
If the risk of latent cancer fatality is selected as the appropriate 
risk measure to be used, the current dose criteria represent a risk of about 
2.7 x 10

^2

. Using a risk coefficient of about 10

^3

 per rem, the risk of latent cancer fatality implied by the current dose criteria is equivalent to 27 rem TEDE. (BEIR
V estimates a latent cancer fatality risk coefficient of about 5 x 10

^4

 per rem, if the dose is received over a period of days or more; however, 
if the exposure period is shorter, such as 2 hours, the risk coefficient is 
approximately double.) 
If latent cancer incidence rather than fatality were used, the current 
dose criteria would correspond to a value of about 35 rem TEDE. 
The Commission is proposing to use the risk of latent cancer fatality as 
the appropriate risk measure since quantitative health objectives (QHOs) for 
it have been established in the Commission's Safety Goal policy. Although the 
current dose criteria are equivalent in risk to 27 rem TEDE, as noted above, 
the Commission is proposing to use 25 rem TEDE as the dose criterion for plant 
evaluation purposes, since this value is essentially the same level of risk as 
the current criteria. 
Nevertheless, the Commission is specifically requesting comments on the 
use of TEDE. Comments are requested on whether the current dose criteria 
should be modified to utilize the total effective dose equivalent, or TEDE, 
concept. The Commission is also requesting comments on whether a TEDE value 
of 25 rem (consistent with latent cancer fatality), or 34 rem (consistent with 
latent cancer incidence), or some other value should be used. Finally, 
because the thyroid weighting factor is equal to a value of 0.03, there exists 
a theoretical possibility that an accidental release composed only of iodine 
could result in a TEDE less than 25 rem, yet result in a thyroid dose of over 
800 rem. Although the Commission believes that the likelihood that an actual 
accident would release only iodine is highly unlikely, comments are also 
requested as to whether the dose criterion should also include a ``capping'' 
limitation, that is, an additional requirement that the dose to any individual 
organ not be in excess of some fraction of the total.

<TEXT>
 

The second change being proposed in this area is in regard to the time 
period that a hypothetical individual is assumed to be at the exclusion area 
boundary. While the duration of the time period remains at a value of two 
hours, the Commission is proposing that this time period not be fixed in 
regard to the appearance of fission products within containment, but that 
various two-hour periods be examined with the objective that the dose to an 
individual not be in excess of 25 rem TEDE for any two-hour period after the 
appearance of fission products within containment. The Commission is proposing 
this change to reflect improved understanding of fission product release into 
the containment under severe accident conditions. For an assumed instantaneous 
release of fission products, as contemplated by the present rule, the two hour 
period that commences with the onset of the fission product release clearly 
results in the highest dose to a hypothetical individual offsite. Improved 
understanding of severe accidents shows that fission product releases to the 
containment do not occur instantaneously, and that the bulk of the releases 
may not take place for about an hour or more. Hence, the two-hour period 
commencing with the onset of fission product release may not represent the 
highest dose that an individual could be exposed to over any two-hour period. 
As a result, the Commission is proposing that various two-hour periods be 
examined to assure that the dose to a hypothetical individual at the exclusion 
area boundary will not be in excess of 25 rem TEDE over any two-hour period 
after the onset of fission product release. 
B. 

Site Dispersion Factors.

 Site dispersion factors have been utilized 
to provide an assessment of dose to an individual as a result of a postulated 
accident. Since the Commission intends to require that a verification be made 
that the exclusion area distance is adequate to assure that the guideline dose 
to a hypothetical individual will not be exceeded under postulated accident 
conditions, as well as to assure that radiological limits are met under normal 
operating conditions, the Commission is proposing that the atmospheric 
dispersion characteristics of the site will be required to be evaluated, and 
that site dispersion factors based upon this evaluation be determined and used 
in assessing radiological consequences of normal operations as well as 
accidents. 
C. 

Low Population Zone.

 The present regulation requires that a low 
population zone (LPZ) be defined immediately beyond the exclusion area. 
Residents are permitted in this area, but the number and density must be such 
that there is a reasonable probability that appropriate protective measures 
could be taken in their behalf in the event of a serious accident. In 
addition, the nearest densely populated center containing more than about 
25,000 residents must be located no closer than one and one-third times the 
outer boundary of the LPZ. Finally, the dose to a hypothetical individual 
located at the outer boundary of the LPZ over the entire course of the 
accident must not be in excess of the dose values given in the regulation. 
Before 1980, the LPZ generally defined the distance over which public 
protective actions were contemplated in the event of a serious accident. The 
regulations in 10 CFR 50.47 now requires plume exposure Emergency Planning 
Zones (EPZ) of about 10 miles for each plant. 
While the Commission considers that the siting functions intended for 
the LPZ, namely, a low density of residents and the feasibility of taking 
protective actions, have been accomplished by other regulations or can be 
accomplished by other guidance, the Commission continues to believe that a 
requirement that limits the radiological consequences over the course of the 
accident provides a useful evaluation of the plant's long-term capability to 
mitigate postulated accidents. For this reason, the Commission is proposing 
to retain the requirement that the dose consequences be evaluated at the outer 
boundary of the LPZ over the course of the postulated accident and that these 
not be in excess of 25 rem TEDE. 

D. 

Physical Characteristics of the Site.

 It has been required that 
physical characteristics of the site, such as the geology, seismology, 
hydrology, meteorology characteristics be considered in the design and 
construction of any plant proposed to be located there. The proposed rule 
would require that these characteristics be evaluated and that site 
parameters, such as design basis flood conditions or tornado wind loadings be 
established for use in evaluating any plant to be located on that site in 
order to ensure that the occurrence of such physical phenomena would pose no 
undue hazard. 
E. 

Nearby Transportation Routes, Industrial and Military Facilities.

 As 
for natural phenomena, it has been a long-standing NRC staff practice to 
review man-related activities in the site vicinity to provide assurance that 
potential hazards associated with such facilities or transportation routes 
will pose no undue risk to any plant proposed to be located at the site. The 
proposed rule would codify this practice. 

F. 

Adequacy of Security Plans.

 The proposed rule would require that the 
characteristics of the site be such that adequate security plans and measures 
for the plant could be developed. The Commission envisions that this would 
entail a small secure area considerably smaller than that envisioned for the 
exclusion area. 
G. 

Adequacy of Emergency Plans.

 The proposed rule would also require that 
the site characteristics be such that adequate plans to carry out protective 
measures for members of the public in the event of emergency could be 
developed.

H. 

Siting Away From Densely Populated Centers.

 Population density considerations beyond the exclusion area have been required since issuance of part 100 in 1962.
The current rule requires a ``low population zone'' (LPZ) beyond the immediate exclusion area. The LPZ boundary 
must be of such a size that an individual located at its outer boundary must 
not receive a dose in excess of the values given in part 100 over the course 
of the accident. While numerical values of population or population density 
are not specified for this region, the regulation also requires that the 
nearest boundary of a densely populated center of about 25,000 or more persons 
be located no closer than one and one-third times the LPZ outer boundary. 
Part 100 has no population criteria other than the size of the LPZ and the 
proximity of the nearest population center, but notes that ``where very large 
cities are involved, a greater distance may be necessary.'' 
Whereas the exclusion area size is based upon limitation of individual 
risk, population density requirements serve to set societal risk limitations 
and reflect consideration of accidents beyond the design basis, or severe 
accidents. Such accidents were clearly a consideration in the original 
issuance of part 100, since the Statement of Considerations (27 FR 3509; April 
12, 1962) noted that: 



Further, since accidents of greater potential hazard than those 
commonly postulated as representing an upper limit are conceivable, 
although highly improbable, it was considered desirable to provide for 
protection against excessive exposure doses to people in large centers, 
where effective protective measures might not be feasible * * *. Hence, the 
population center distance was added as a site requirement.



Limitation of population density beyond the exclusion area has the following 
benefits: 


(a) It facilitates emergency preparedness and planning; and 
(b) It reduces potential doses to large numbers of people and reduces 
property damage in the event of severe accidents. 
Although the Commission's Safety Goal policy provides guidance on 
individual risk limitations, in the form of the Quantitative Health Objectives 
(QHO), it provides no guidance with regard to societal risk limitations and 
therefore cannot be used to ascertain whether a particular population density 
would meet the Safety Goal. 
However, results of severe accident risk studies, particularly those 
obtained from NUREG-1150, can provide useful insights for considering 
potential criteria for population density. Severe accidents having the 
highest consequences are those where core-melt together with early bypass of 
or containment failure occurs. Such an event would likely lead to a ``large 
release'' (without defining this precisely). Based upon NUREG-1150, the 
probability of a core-melt accident together with early containment failure or 
bypass for some current generation LWRs is estimated to be between 10

^5

 and 10

^6

 per reactor year. For future plants, this value is expected to be less than 10

^6

 per reactor year. 
If a reactor was located nearer to a large city than current NRC 
practice permitted, the likelihood of exposing a large number of people to 
significant releases of radioactive material would be about the same as the 
probability of a core-melt and early containment failure, that is, less than 
10

^6

 per reactor year for future reactor designs. It is worth noting that 
events having the very low likelihood of about 10

^6

 per reactor year or lower 
have been regarded in past licensing actions to be ``incredible'', and as such, 
have not been required to be incorporated into the design basis of the plant. 
Hence, based solely upon accident likelihood, it might be argued that siting a 
reactor nearer to a large city than current NRC practice would pose no undue 
risk. 
If, however, a reactor were sited away from large cities, the likelihood 
of the city being affected would be reduced because of two factors. First, 
because the wind is expected to blow in all directions with roughly the same 
frequency, the likelihood that radioactive material would actually be carried 
towards the city is reduced significantly because it is likely that the wind 
will blow in a direction away from the city. Second, the radiological dose 
consequences would also be reduced with distance because the radioactive 
material becomes increasingly diluted by the atmosphere and the inventory 
becomes depleted due to the natural processes of fallout and rainout before 
reaching the city. Analyses indicate that if a reactor were located at 
distances ranging from 10 to about 20 miles away from a city, depending upon 
its size, the likelihood of exposure of large numbers of people within the 
city would be reduced by factors of ten to one hundred or more compared with 
locating a reactor very close to a city. 
In summary, next-generation reactors are expected to have risk 
characteristics sufficiently low that the safety of the public is reasonably 
assured by the reactor and plant design and operation itself, resulting in a 
very low likelihood of occurrence of a severe accident. Such a plant can 
satisfy the QHOs of the Safety Goal with a very small exclusion area distance 
(as low as 0.1 miles). The consequences of design basis accidents, analyzed 
using revised source terms and with a realistic evaluation of engineered 
safety features, are likely to be found acceptable at distances of 0.25 miles 
or less. With regard to population density beyond the exclusion area, siting 
a reactor closer to a densely populated city than is current NRC practice 
would pose a very low risk to the populace. 
Nevertheless, the Commission considers that defense-in-depth 
considerations and the additional enhancement in safety to be gained by siting 
reactors away from densely populated centers should be maintained. 
The Commission is proposing a two-tier approach with regard to 
population density and reactor sites. The proposed rule states that reactor 
sites should be located away from very densely populated centers, and that 
areas of low population density are, generally, preferred. The Commission 
believes that a site not falling within these two categories, although not 
preferred, could be found acceptable under certain conditions. 
The Commission is not establishing specific numerical criteria for 
evaluation of population density in siting future reactor facilities because 
the acceptability of a specific site from the standpoint of population density 
must be considered in the overall context of safety and environmental 
considerations. The Commission's intent is to assure that a site that has 
significant safety, environmental or economic advantages is not rejected 
solely because it has a higher population density than other available sites. 
Population density is but one factor that must be balanced against the other 
advantages and disadvantages of a particular site in determining the site's 
acceptability. Thus, it must be recognized that sites with higher population 
density, so long as they are located away from very densely populated centers, 
can be approved by the Commission if they present advantages in terms of other 
considerations applicable to the evaluation of proposed sites. 
On April 28, 1977, Free Environment, Inc. et al., filed a petition for 
rulemaking (PRM-50-20) requesting, among other things, that ``the central Iowa 
nuclear project and other reactors be sited at least 40 miles from major 
population centers.'' The petitioner also stated that ``locating reactors in 
sparsely-populated areas * * * has been endorsed in non-binding NRC guidelines 
for reactor siting.'' The petitioner did not specify what constituted a major 
population center. The only NRC guidelines concerning population density in 
regard to reactor siting are in Regulatory Guide 4.7, issued in 1974, and 
revised in 1975, prior to the date of the petition. This guide states 
population density values of 500 persons per square mile out to a distance of 
30 miles from the reactor, not 40 miles.

Regulatory Guide 4.7 does provide effective separation from population 
centers of various sizes. Under this guide, a population center of about 
25,000 or more residents should be no closer than 4 miles (6.4 km) from a 
reactor because a density of 500 persons per square mile within this distance 
would yield a total population of about 25,000 persons. Similarly, a city of 
100,000 or more residents should be no closer than about 10 miles (16 km); a 
city of 500,000 or more persons should be no closer than about 20 miles (32 
km), and a city of 1,000,000 or more persons should be no closer than about 30 
miles (50 km) from the reactor. 

The Commission has examined these guidelines with regard to the Safety 
Goal. The Safety Goal quantitative health objective in regard to latent 
cancer fatality states that, within a distance of ten miles (16 km) from the 
reactor, the risk to the population of latent cancer fatality from nuclear 
power plant operation, including accidents, should not exceed one''tenth of one percent of the likelihood of latent
cancer fatalities from all other causes. In addition to the risks of latent cancer fatalities, the Commission has
also investigated the likelihood and extent of land contamination arising from the release of long lived radioactive
species, such as cesium-137, in the event of a severe reactor accident. 

The results of these analyses indicate that the latent cancer fatality 
quantitative health objective noted above is met for current plant designs. 
From analysis done in support of this proposed change in regulation, the 
likelihood of permanent relocation of people located more than about 20 miles 
(50 km) from the reactor as a result of land contamination from a severe 
accident is very low. 

Therefore, the Commission concludes that the current NRC staff guidance 
in Regulatory Guide 4.7 provide a means of locating reactors away from 
population centers, including ``major'' population centers, depending upon their size, that would limit societal
consequences significantly, in the event of a severe accident. The Commission finds that granting of the petitioner's

request to specify population criteria out to 40 miles would not substantially 
reduce the risks to the public. As noted, the Commission also believes that a 
higher population density site could be found to be acceptable, compared to a 
lower population density site, provided there were safety, environmental or 
economic advantages to the higher population site. Granting of the 
petitioner's request would neglect this possibility and would make population 
density the sole criterion of site acceptability. For these reasons, the 
Commission has decided not to adopt the proposal by Free Environment, 
Incorporated. 

The Commission also notes that future population growth around a nuclear 
power plant site, as in other areas of the region, is expected but cannot be 
predicted with great accuracy, particularly in the long-term. Since higher 
population density sites are not unacceptable, per se, the Commission does not 
intend to consider license conditions or restrictions upon an operating 
reactor solely upon the basis that the population density around it may reach 
or exceed levels that were not expected at the time of site approval. Finally, 
the Commission wishes to emphasize that population considerations as well as 
other siting requirements apply only for the initial siting for new plants and 
will not be used in evaluating applications for the renewal of existing 
nuclear power plant licenses. 



Change to 10 CFR Part 50 



The proposed change to 10 CFR part 50 would relocate from 10 CFR Part 
100 the dose requirements for each applicant at specified distances. Because 
these requirements affect reactor design rather than siting, they are more 
appropriately located in 10 CFR part 50. 

These requirements would apply to future applicants for a construction 
permit, design certification, or an operating license. The Commission will 
consider after further experience in the review of certified designs whether 
more specific requirements need to be developed regarding revised accident 
source terms and severe accident insights. 



B. Seismic and Earthquake Engineering Criteria



The following major changes in the proposed revision to Appendix A, 
``Seismic and Geologic Siting Criteria for Nuclear Power Plants,'' to part 100, are associated with the proposed
seismic and earthquake engineering criteria rule making. These changes reflect new information and research results,
and incorporate the intentions of this regulatory action as defined in Section III of this proposed rule including
comments from the public on the first proposed revision of the regulations. A specific document explaining the NRC
staff's disposition of pertinent comments will be prepared coincident with the final rulemaking. 



1. Separate Siting From Design

Criteria not associated with site suitability or establishment of the 
Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground Motion (SSE) have been placed into 10 CFR part 
50. This action is consistent with the location of other design requirements 
in 10 CFR part 50. Because the revised criteria presented in the proposed 
regulation will not be applied to existing plants, the licensing basis for 
existing nuclear power plants must remain part of the regulations. The 
criteria on seismic and geologic siting would be designated as a new  100.23 to subpart B in 10 CFR part 100. Criteria
on earthquake engineering 
would be designated as a new Appendix S, ``Earthquake Engineering Criteria for 
Nuclear Power Plants,'' to 10 CFR part 50. 



2. Remove Detailed Guidance From the Regulation



The current regulation contains both requirements and guidance on how to 
satisfy the requirements. For example, Section IV, ``Required Investigations,'' of Appendix A, states that investigations
are required for vibratory ground motion, surface faulting, and seismically induced floods and water waves. Appendix
A then provides detailed guidance on what constitutes an acceptable investigation. A similar situation exists in
Section V, ``Seismic and Geologic Design Bases,'' of Appendix A. 

Geoscience assessments require considerable latitude in judgment. This 
latitude in judgment is needed because of limitations in data and the state-of-the-art of geologic and seismic analyses
and because of the rapid evolution 
taking place in the geosciences in terms of accumulating knowledge and in 
modifying concepts. This need appears to have been recognized when the 
existing regulation was developed. The existing regulation states that it is 
based on limited geophysical and geological information and will be revised as 
necessary when more complete information becomes available. 

However, having geoscience assessments detailed and cast in a regulation 
has created difficulty for applicants and the staff in terms of inhibiting the 
use of needed latitude in judgment. Also, it has inhibited flexibility in 
applying basic principles to new situations and the use of evolving methods of 
analyses (for instance, probabilistic) in the licensing process. 

The proposed regulation would be streamlined, becoming a new section in 
Subpart B to 10 CFR part 100 rather than a new appendix to part 100. Also, 
the level of detail presented in the proposed regulation would be reduced 
considerably. This approach reflects the philosophy of the first proposed 
revision that the regulation only contains the basic requirements and that the 
detailed guidance, which is contained in the current regulation, Appendix A to 
10 CFR part 100, be removed to guidance documents. Thus, the proposed 
regulation contains: (a) Required definitions, (b) A requirement to determine 
the geological, seismological, and engineering characteristics of the proposed 
site, and (c) A requirement to determine the Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground 
Motion (SSE) and its uncertainty, to determine the potential for surface 
deformation, and to determine the design bases for seismically induced floods 
and water waves. The guidance documents describe how to carry out these 
required determinations. The key elements of the balanced approach to 
determine the SSE are presented in the following section. The elements are 
the guidance that will be fully described in the guidance documents. 
The proposed regulation is a new section in part 100 rather than an appendix 
to Part 100. The proposed regulation would identify and establish basic 
requirements. Detailed guidance, that is, the procedures acceptable to the 
NRC for meeting the requirements, would be contained in a draft regulatory 
guide to be issued for public comment as Draft Regulatory Guide, DG-1032, 
``Identification and Characterization of Seismic Sources and Determination of 
Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground Motions.'' 



3. Uncertainties and Probabilistic Methods 



The existing approach for determining a Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground 
Motion (SSE) for a nuclear reactor site, embodied in appendix A to 10 CFR part 
100, relies on a ``deterministic'' approach. Using this deterministic approach, an applicant develops a single
set of earthquake sources, develops for each source a postulated earthquake to be used as the source of ground motion
that can affect the site, locates the postulated earthquake according to prescribed rules, and then calculates ground
motions at the site. 

Although this approach has worked reasonably well for the past two 
decades, in the sense that SSEs for plants sited with this approach are judged 
to be suitably conservative, the approach has not explicitly recognized 
uncertainties in geosciences parameters. Because so little is known about 
earthquake phenomena (especially in the eastern United States), there have 
often been differences of opinion and differing interpretations among experts 
as to the largest earthquakes to be considered and ground-motion models to be 
used, thus often making the licensing process relatively unstable. 

Over the past decade, analysis methods for incorporating these different 
interpretations have been developed and used. These ``probabilistic'' methods 
have been designed to allow explicit incorporation of different models for 
zonation, earthquake size, ground motion, and other parameters. The advantage 
of using these probabilistic methods is their ability to not only incorporate 
different models and different data sets, but also to weight them using judgments as to the validity of the different
models and data sets, and thereby providing an explicit expression for the uncertainty in the ground motion estimates
and a means of assessing sensitivity to various input parameters. Another advantage of the probabilistic method
is the target exceedance probability is set by examining the design bases of more recently licensed nuclear power
plants. 

The proposed revision to the regulation now explicitly recognizes that 
there are inherent uncertainties in establishing the seismic and geologic 
design parameters and allows for the option of using a probabilistic seismic 
hazard methodology capable of propagating uncertainties as a means to address 
these uncertainties. The rule further recognizes that the nature of 
uncertainty and the appropriate approach to account for it depend greatly on 
the tectonic regime and parameters, such as, the knowledge of seismic sources, 
the existence of historical and recorded data, and the understanding of 
tectonics. Therefore, methods other than the probabilistic methods, such as 
sensitivity analyses, may be adequate for some sites to account for 
uncertainties. 

The NRC staff has achieved an appropriate balance between deterministic 
and probabilistic seismic hazard evaluations to be used in the revision of the 
seismic and geologic siting criteria for nuclear power plants. The key 
elements of this balanced approach are:


 

_Conduct site-specific and regional geoscience investigations,

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941017-1-00012 </DOCNO>

_Target exceedance probability is set by examining the design bases 
of more recently licensed nuclear power plants, 
_Conduct probabilistic seismic hazard analysis and determine ground 
motion level corresponding to the target exceedance probability, 
_Determine if information from geoscience investigations change 
probabilistic results, 
_Determine site-specific spectral shape and scale this shape to the 
ground motion level determined above, 
_NRC staff review using all available data including insights and 
information from previous licensing experience, and 
_Update the data base and reassess probabilistic methods at least 
every ten years.




Thus, the proposed approach requires thorough regional and site-specific 
geoscience investigations. The proposed approach reflects some of the 
comments of the U.S. utility industry. The U.S. Geological Survey provided a 
series of comments and recommendations that led to and can be met by the above 
integrated approach. 



Results of the regional and site-specific investigations must be 
considered in application of the probabilistic method. The current 
probabilistic methods, the NRC sponsored study conducted by Lawrence Livermore 
National Laboratory (LLNL) or the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) 
seismic hazard study, are essentially regional studies without detailed 
information on any specific location. The regional and site-specific 
investigations provide detailed information to update the database of the 
hazard methodology to make the probabilistic analysis site-specific. 

It is also necessary to incorporate local site geological factors such 
as stratigraphy and topography and to account for site-specific geotechnical 
properties in establishing the design basis ground motion. In order to 
incorporate local site factors and advances in ground motion attenuation 
models, ground motion estimates are determined using the procedures outlined 
in the Draft Standard Review Plan Section 2.5.2, Second Proposed Revision 3, 
``Vibratory Ground Motion.'' 

Methods acceptable to the NRC staff for implementing the proposed 
regulation are described in Draft Regulatory Guide DG-1032, ``Identification 
and Characterization of Seismic Sources and Determination of Safe Shutdown 
Earthquake Ground Motions.'' 

The NRC staff's review approach to evaluate an application is described 
in Draft SRP Section 2.5.2. This review takes into account the information 
base developed in licensing more than 100 plants. This staff review is 
consistent with the intent of a USGS recommendation. Although the basic 
premise in establishing the target exceedance probability is that the current 
design levels are adequate, a staff review further assures that there is 
consistency with previous licensing decisions and that the scientific basis 
for decisions are clearly understood. This review approach will also assist 
in assessing the fairly complex regional probabilistic modeling which 
incorporates multiple hypotheses and a multitude of parameters. Furthermore, 
this process should provide a clear basis for the staff's decisions and 
facilitate communication with nonexperts. 



4. Safe Shutdown Earthquake

The existing regulation (10 CFR part 100, appendix A, section 
V(a)(1)(iv)) states ``The maximum vibratory accelerations of the Safe Shutdown 
Earthquake at each of the various foundation locations of the nuclear power 
plant structures at a given site shall be determined * * *''. The location of the seismic input motion
control point as stated in the existing regulation has led to confrontations with many applicants that believe this
stipulation is inconsistent with good engineering fundamentals. 

The proposed regulation would move the location of the seismic input 
motion control point from the foundation-level to the free-field at the free 
ground surface. The 1975 version of the Standard Review Plan placed the 
control motion in the free-field. The proposed regulation is also consistent 
with the resolution of Unresolved Safety Issue (USI) A-40, ``Seismic Design 
Criteria'' (August 1989), that resulted in the revision of Standard Review Plan Sections 2.5.2, 3.7.1, 3.7.2, and
3.7.3. However, the proposed regulation 
requires that the horizontal component of the Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground 
Motion in the free-field at the foundation level of the structures must be an 
appropriate response spectrum considering the site geotechnical properties, 
with a peak ground acceleration of at least 0.1g. 



5. Value of the Operating Basis Earthquake Ground Motion (OBE) and 
Required OBE Analyses 



The existing regulation (10 CFR, appendix A, section V(a)(2)) states 
that the maximum vibratory ground motion of the OBE is at least one half the 
maximum vibratory ground motion of the Safe Shutdown Earthquake ground motion. 
Also, the existing regulation (10 CFR, appendix A, section VI(a)(2)) states 
that the engineering method used to insure that structures, systems, and 
components are capable of withstanding the effects of the OBE shall involve 
the use of either a suitable dynamic analysis or a suitable qualification 
test. In some cases, for instance piping, these multi-facets of the OBE in 
the existing regulation made it possible for the OBE to have more design 
significance than the SSE. A decoupling of the OBE and SSE has been suggested 
in several documents. For instance, the NRC staff, SECY-79-300, suggested 
that design for a single limiting event and inspection and evaluation for 
earthquakes in excess of some specified limit may be the most sound regulatory 
approach. NUREG-1061, ``Report of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
Piping Review Committee,'' Vol. 5, April 1985, (Table 10.1) ranked a decoupling of the OBE and SSE as third out of six
high priority changes. In SECY-90-016, ``Evolutionary Light Water Reactor (LWR) Certification Issues
and Their Relationship to Current Regulatory Requirements,'' the NRC staff states that it agrees that the OBE should
not control the design of safety systems. 

Activities equivalent to OBE-SSE decoupling are also being done in 
foreign countries. For instance, in Germany their new design standard 
requires only one design basis earthquake (equivalent to the SSE). They 
require an inspection-level earthquake (for shutdown) of 0.4 SSE. This level 
was set so that the vibratory ground motion should not induce stresses 
exceeding the allowable stress limits originally required for the OBE design. 

The proposed regulation would allow the value of the OBE to be set at 
(i) one-third or less of the SSE, where OBE requirements are satisfied without 
an explicit response or design analyses being performed, or (ii) a value 
greater than one-third of the SSE, where analysis and design are required. 
There are two issues the applicant should consider in selecting the value of 
the OBE: first, plant shutdown is required if vibratory ground motion 
exceeding that of the OBE occurs (discussed below in Item 6, Required Plant 
Shutdown), and second, the amount of analyses associated with the OBE. An 
applicant may determine that at one-third of the SSE level, the probability of 
exceeding the OBE vibratory ground motion is too high, and the cost associated 
with plant shutdown for inspections and testing of equipment and structures 
prior to restarting the plant is unacceptable. Therefore, the applicant may 
voluntarily select an OBE value at some higher fraction of the SSE to avoid 
plant shutdowns. However, if an applicant selects an OBE value at a fraction 
of the SSE higher than one-third, a suitable analysis shall be performed to 
demonstrate that the requirements associated with the OBE are satisfied. The 
design shall take into account soil-structure interaction effects and the 
expected duration of the vibratory ground motion. The requirement associated 
with the OBE is that all structures, systems, and components of the nuclear 
power plant necessary for continued operation without undue risk to the health 
and safety of the public shall remain functional and within applicable stress, 
strain and deformation limits when subjected to the effects of the OBE in 
combination with normal operating loads. 

As stated above, it is determined that if an OBE of one-third of the SSE 
is used, the requirements of the OBE can be satisfied without the applicant 
performing any explicit response analyses. In this case, the OBE serves the 
function of an inspection and shutdown earthquake. Some minimal design checks 
and the applicability of this position to seismic base isolation of buildings 
are discussed below. There is high confidence that, at this ground-motion 
level with other postulated concurrent loads, most critical structures, 
systems, and components will not exceed currently used design limits. This is 
ensured, in part, because PRA insights will be used to support a margins-type 
assessment of seismic events. A PRA-based seismic margins analysis will 
consider sequence-level High Confidence, Low Probability of Failures (HCLPFs) 
and fragilities for all sequences leading to core damage or containment 
failures up to approximately one and two-thirds the ground motion acceleration 
of the design basis SSE (Reference: Item II.N, Site-Specific Probabilistic 
Risk Assessment and Analysis of External Events, memorandum from Samuel J. 
Chilk to James M. Taylor, Subject: SECY-93-087_Policy, Technical, and 
Licensing Issues Pertaining to Evolutionary and Advance Light-Water Reactor 
(ALWR) Designs, dated July 21, 1993. 

There are situations associated with current analyses where only OBE is 
associated with the design requirements, for example, the ultimate heat sink 
(see Regulatory Guide 1.27, ``Ultimate Heat Sink for Nuclear Power Plants''). 
In these situations, a value expressed as a fraction of the SSE response would 
be used in the analyses. Section VIII of this proposed rule identifies 
existing guides that would be revised technically to maintain the existing 
design philosophy. 

In SECY-93-087, ``Policy, Technical, and Licensing Issues Pertaining to 
Evolutionary and Advance Light-Water Reactor (ALWR) Designs,'' the NRC staff 
requested Commission approval on 42 technical and policy issues pertaining to 
either evolutionary LWRs, passive LWRs, or both. The issue pertaining to the 
elimination of the OBE is designated I.M. The NRC staff identified actions 
necessary for the design of structures, systems, and components when the OBE 
design requirement is eliminated. The staff clarified that guidelines should 
be maintained to ensure the functionality of components, equipment, and their 
supports. In addition, the staff clarified how certain design requirements 
are to be considered for buildings and structures that are currently designed 
for the OBE, but not the SSE. Also, the NRC staff has evaluated the effect on 
safety of eliminating the OBE from the design load combinations for selected 
structures, systems, and components and has developed proposed criteria for an 
analysis using only the SSE. Commission approval is documented in the Chilk 
to Taylor memorandum dated July 21, 1993, cited above. 

More than one earthquake response analysis for a seismic base isolated 
nuclear power plant design may be necessary to ensure adequate performance at 
all earthquake levels. Decisions pertaining to the response analyses 
associated with base isolated facilities will be handled on a case by case 
basis.

6. Required Plant Shutdow 



The current regulation (Section V(a)(2)) states that if vibratory ground 
motion exceeding that of the OBE occurs, shutdown of the nuclear power plant 
is required. The supplementary information to the final regulation (published 
November 13, 1973; 38 FR 31279, Item 6e) includes the following statement: ``A 
footnote has been added to  50.36(c)(2) of 10 CFR part 50 to assure that each 
power plant is aware of the limiting condition of operation which is imposed 
under section V(2) of appendix A to 10 CFR part 100. This limitation requires 
that if vibratory ground motion exceeding that of the OBE occurs, shutdown of 
the nuclear power plant will be required. Prior to resuming operations, the 
licensee will be required to demonstrate to the Commission that no functional 
damage has occurred to those features necessary for continued operation 
without undue risk to the health and safety of the public.'' At that time, it 
was the intention of the Commission to treat the Operating Basis Earthquake as 
a limiting condition of operation. From the statement in the Supplementary 
Information, the Commission directed applicants to specifically review 10 CFR 
Part 100 to be aware of this intention in complying with the requirements of 
10 CFR 50.36. Thus, the requirement to shut down if an OBE occurs was 
expected to be implemented by being included among the technical 
specifications submitted by applicants after the adoption of Appendix A. In 
fact, applicants did not include OBE shutdown requirements in their technical 
specifications. 


The proposed regulation would treat plant shutdown associated with 
vibratory ground motion exceeding the OBE or significant plant damage as a 
condition in every operating license. A new  50.54(ff) would be added to the 
regulations to require a process leading to plant shutdown for licensees of 
nuclear power plants that comply with the earthquake engineering criteria in 
Paragraph IV(a)(3) of Proposed Appendix S, ``Earthquake Engineering Criteria 
for Nuclear Power Plants,'' to 10 CFR part 50. Immediate shutdown could be 
required until it is determined that structures, systems, and components 
needed for safe shutdown are still functional. 


Draft Regulatory Guide DG-1034, ``Pre-Earthquake Planning and Immediate 
Nuclear Power Plant Operator Post-Earthquake Actions,'' is being developed to 
provide guidance acceptable to the NRC staff for determining whether or not 
vibratory ground motion exceeding the OBE ground motion or significant plant 
damage had occurred and the timing of nuclear power plant shutdown. The 
guidance is based on criteria developed by the Electric Power Research 
Institute (EPRI). The decision to shut down the plant should be made within 
eight hours after the earthquake. The data from the seismic instrumentation, 
coupled with information obtained from a plant walk down, are used to make the 
determination of when the plant should be shut down, if it has not already 
been shut down by operational perturbations resulting from the seismic event. 
The guidance being developed in Draft Regulatory Guide DG-1034 is based on two 
assumptions, first, that the nuclear power plant has operable seismic 
instrumentation, including the equipment and software required to process the 
data within four hours after an earthquake, and second, that the operator walk 
down inspections can be performed in approximately four to eight hours 
depending on the number of personnel conducting the inspection. The 
regulation also includes a provision that requires the licensee to consult 
with the Commission and to propose a plan for the timely, safe shutdown of the 
nuclear power plant if systems, structures, or components necessary for a safe 
shutdown or to maintain a safe shutdown are not available. (This 
unavailability may be due to earthquake related damage.) 


Draft Regulatory Guide DG-1035, ``Restart of a Nuclear Power Plant Shut 
Down by a Seismic Event,'' is being developed to provide guidelines that are 
acceptable to the NRC staff for performing inspections and tests of nuclear 
power plant equipment and structures prior to plant restart. This guidance is 
also based on EPRI reports. Prior to resuming operations, the licensee must 
demonstrate to the Commission that no functional damage has occurred to those 
features necessary for continued operation without undue risk to the health 
and safety of the public. The results of post-shutdown inspections, 
operability checks, and surveillance tests must be documented in written 
reports and submitted to the Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation. 
The licensee shall not resume operation until authorized to do so by the 
Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation.

7. Clarify Interpretations 



In  100.23 to 10 CFR part 100, changes have been made to resolve 
questions of interpretation. As an example, definitions and required 
investigations stated in the proposed regulation would be significantly 
changed to eliminate or modify phrases that were more applicable to only the 
western part of the United States. 

The institutional definition for ``safety-related structures, systems, 
and components'' is drawn from appendix A to part 100 under III(c) and VI(a). 
With the proposed relocation of the earthquake engineering criteria to 
appendix S to part 50 and the proposed relocation and modification to dose 
guidelines in  50.34(a)(1), the definition of safety-related structures, 
systems, and components is included in part 50 definitions with reference to 
both the part 100 and part 50 dose guidelines. 



VI. Related Regulatory Guides and Standard Review Plan Section 



The NRC is developing the following draft regulatory guides and standard 
review plan sections to provide prospective licensees with the necessary 
guidance for implementing the proposed regulation. The notice of availability 
for these materials will be published in a later issue of the 

Federal 
Register

. 

1. DG-1032, ``Identification and Characterization of Seismic Sources and 
Determination of Shutdown Earthquake Ground Motions.'' The draft guide 
provides general guidance and recommendations, describes acceptable procedures 
and provides a list of references that present acceptable methodologies to 
identify and characterize capable tectonic sources and seismogenic sources. 
Section V.B.3 of this Proposed rule describes the key elements. 

2. DG-1033, Third Proposed Revision 2 to Regulatory Guide 1.12, ``Nuclear 
Power Plant Instrumentation for Earthquakes.'' The draft guide describes 
seismic instrumentation type and location, operability, characteristics, 
installation, actuation, and maintenance that are acceptable to the NRC staff. 

3. DG-1034, ``Pre-Earthquake Planning and Immediate Nuclear Power Plant 
Operator Post-Earthquake Actions.'' The draft guide provides guidelines that 
are acceptable to the NRC staff for a timely evaluation of the recorded 
seismic instrumentation data and to determine whether or not plant shutdown is 
required. 

4. DG-1035, ``Restart of a Nuclear Power Plant Shut Down by a Seismic 
Event.'' The draft guide provides guidelines that are acceptable to the NRC 
staff for performing inspections and tests of nuclear power plant equipment 
and structures prior to restart of a plant that has been shut down because of 
a seismic event. 

5. Draft Standard Review Plan Section 2.5.1, Proposed Revision 3, ``Basic 
Geologic and Seismic Information.'' The draft describes procedures to assess 
the adequacy of the geologic and seismic information cited in support of the 
applicant's conclusions concerning the suitability of the plant site. 

6. Draft Standard Review Plan Section 2.5.2, Second Proposed Revision 3 
``Vibratory Ground Motion.'' The draft describes procedures to assess the 
ground motion potential of seismic sources at the site and to assess the 
adequacy of the SSE. 

7. Draft Standard Review Plan Section 2.5.3, Proposed Revision 3, 
``Surface Faulting.'' The draft describes procedures to assess the adequacy of 
the applicant's submittal related to the existence of a potential for surface 
faulting affecting the site. 

8. DG-4003, Second Proposed Revision 2 to Regulatory Guide 4.7, ``General 
Site Suitability Criteria for Nuclear Power Plants.'' This guide discusses the 
major site characteristics related to public health and safety and 
environmental issues that the NRC staff considers in determining the 
suitability of sites. 



VII. Future Regulatory Action 



Several existing regulatory guides will be revised to incorporate 
editorial changes or maintain the existing design or analysis philosophy. 
These guides will be issued subsequent to the publication of the final 
regulations that would implement this proposed action. 

The following regulatory guides will be revised to incorporate editorial 
changes, for example to reference new sections to part 100 or appendix S to 
part 50. No technical changes will be made in these regulatory guides. 

1. 1.57, ``Design Limits and Loading Combinations for Metal Primary 
Reactor Containment System Components.''

2. 1.59, ``Design Basis Floods for Nuclear Power Plants.''

3. 1.60, ``Design Response Spectra for Seismic Design of Nuclear Power 
Plants.'' 

4. 1.83, ``Inservice Inspection of Pressurized Water Reactor Steam 
Generator Tubes.'' 

5. 1.92, ``Combining Modal Responses and Spatial Components in Seismic 
Response Analysis.''

6. 1.102, ``Flood Protection for Nuclear Power Plants.'' 

7. 1.121, ``Bases for Plugging Degraded PWR Steam Generator Tubes.''

8. 1.122, ``Development of Floor Design Response Spectra for Seismic 
Design of Floor-Supported Equipment or Components.''


The following regulatory guides will be revised to update the design or 
analysis philosophy, for example, to change OBE to a fraction of the SSE: 

1. 1.27, ``Ultimate Heat Sink for Nuclear Power Plants.''

IBM PC/DOS or MS/DOS format. Data files should be provided in one of the 
following formats: WordPerfect, IBM Document Content Architecture/Revisable-Form-Text (DCA/RFT), or unformatted
ASCII code. The format and version should 
be identified on the diskette's external label. 



X. Questions 


In addition to soliciting comments on all aspects of this rulemaking, 
the Commission specifically requests comments on the following questions. 


A. Nonseismic Criteria


1. Should the dose acceptance criteria be modified from 25 rem whole 
body and 300 rem to the thyroid to utilize the concept of total effective dose 
equivalent (TEDE), and if so, what TEDE value should be adopted? 
2. Assuming that a dose acceptance criterion of 25 rem total 
effective dose equivalent (TEDE) is adopted, should an organ limitation or 
``capping'' dose be included, and if so, what should such a limit be? 



XI. Finding of No Significant Environmental Impact: Availability 


The Commission has determined under the National Environmental Policy 
Act of 1969, as amended, and the Commission's regulations in Subpart A of 10 
CFR Part 51, that this proposed regulation, if adopted, would not be a major 
Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment 
and therefore an environmental impact statement is not required. 
The revisions associated with the reactor siting criteria in 10 CFR part 
100 and the relocation of the plant design requirements from 10 CFR part 100 
to 10 CFR Part 50 have been evaluated against the current requirements. The 
Commission has concluded that relocating the requirement for a dose 
calculation to Part 50 and adding more specific site criteria to part 100 does 
not decrease the protection of the public health and safety over the current 
regulations. The proposed amendments do not affect nonradiological plant 
effluents and have no other environmental impact. 
The addition of  100.23 to 10 CFR part 100, and the addition of appendix 
S to 10 CFR part 50, will not change the radiological environmental impact 
offsite. Onsite occupational radiation exposure associated with inspection 
and maintenance will not change. These activities are principally associated 
with base line inspections of structures, equipment, and piping, and with 
maintenance of seismic instrumentation. Base line inspections are needed to 
differentiate between pre-existing conditions at the nuclear power plant and 
earthquake related damage. The structures, equipment and piping selected for 
these inspections are those routinely examined by plant operators during 
normal plant walkdowns and inspections. Routine maintenance of seismic 
instrumentation ensures its operability during earthquakes. The location of 
the seismic instrumentation is similar to that in the existing nuclear power 
plants. The proposed amendments do not affect nonradiological plant effluents 
and have no other environmental impact. 
The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact on 
which this determination is based are available for inspection at the NRC 
Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC. Single 
copies of the environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact 
are available from Mr. Leonard Soffer, Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research, 
U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, telephone (301) 415-6574, or Dr. Andrew Murphy,
Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research, U.S. 
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, telephone (301) 415-6010. 


XII. Paperwork Reduction Act Statement 


This proposed regulation amends information collection requirements that 
are subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

). This proposed regulation has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review and approval of the
paperwork requirements. 
There is no public reporting burden related to the nonseismic siting 
criteria. Public reporting burden for the collection of information related 
to the seismic and earthquake engineering criteria is estimated to average 
800,000 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, 
searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, 
and completing and reviewing the collection of information. 
Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this 
collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to 
the Information and Records Management Branch (T-6 F33), U.S. Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555; and to the Desk Officer, Office 
of Information and Regulatory Affairs, NEOB-10202, (3150-0011 and 3150-0093), 
Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503. 


XIII. Regulatory Analysis 


The Commission has prepared a draft regulatory analysis on this proposed 
regulation. The analysis examines the costs and benefits of the alternatives 
considered by the Commission. The draft analysis is available for inspection 
in the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW. (Lower Level), Washington, 
DC. Single copies of the analysis are available from Mr. Leonard Soffer, 
Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 
Washington, DC 20555, telephone (301) 415-6574, or Dr. Andrew J. Murphy, 
Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 
Washington, DC 20555, telephone (301) 415-6010.

The Commission requests public comment on the draft regulatory analysis. 
Comments on the draft analysis may be submitted to the NRC as indicated under 
the 

ADDRESSES

 heading. 


XIV. Regulatory Flexibility Certification 


In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 
605(b)), the Commission certifies that this proposed regulation will not, if 
promulgated, have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of 
small entities. This proposed regulation affects only the licensing and 
operation of nuclear power plants. Nuclear power plant site applicants do not 
fall within the definition of small businesses as defined in Section 3 of the 
Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632), the Small Business Size Standards of the 
Small Business Administrator (13 CFR part 121), or the Commission's Size 
Standards (56 FR 56671; November 6, 1991). 

 


XV. Backfit Analysis 


The NRC has determined that the backfit rule, 10 CFR 50.109, does not 
apply to this proposed regulation, and therefore, a backfit analysis is not 
required for this proposed regulation because these amendments do not involve 
any provisions that would impose backfits as defined in 10 CFR 50.109(a)(1). 
The proposed regulation would apply only to applicants for future nuclear 
power plant construction permits, preliminary design approval, final design 
approval, manufacturing licenses, early site reviews, operating licenses, and 
combined operating licenses.

2. Section 50.2 is amended by adding in alphabetical order the 
definitions for 

Committed dose equivalent, Committed effective dose 
equivalent, Deep-dose equivalent, Exclusion area, Low population zone, Safety-related structures, systems,
and components

 and 

Total effective dose 
equivalent 

to read as follows: 



 50.2 



Definitions. 



* * * * * 





Committed dose equivalent 

means the dose equivalent to organs or 
tissues of reference that will be received from an intake of radioactive 
material by an individual during the 50-year period following the intake. 



Committed effective dose equivalent 

is the sum of the products of 
the weighting factors applicable to each of the body organs or tissues that 
are irradiated and the committed dose equivalent to these organs or tissues. 



* * * * * 





Deep-dose equivalent, 

which applies to external whole-body 
exposure, is the dose equivalent at a tissue depth of 1 cm (1000 mg/cm

2

). 



* * * * * 





Exclusion area

 means that area surrounding the reactor, in which 
the reactor licensee has the authority to determine all activities including 
exclusion or removal of personnel and property from the area. This area may 
be traversed by a highway, railroad, or waterway, provided these are not so 
close to the facility as to interfere with normal operations of the facility 
and provided appropriate and effective arrangements are made to control 
traffic on the highway, railroad, or waterway, in case of emergency, to 
protect the public health and safety. Residence within the exclusion area 
shall normally be prohibited. In any event, residents shall be subject to 
ready removal in case of necessity. Activities unrelated to operation of the 
reactor may be permitted in an exclusion area under appropriate limitations, 
provided that no significant hazards to the public health and safety will 
result. 



* * * * * 





Low population zone

 means the area immediately surrounding the 
exclusion area which contains residents, the total number and density of which 
are such that there is a reasonable probability that appropriate protective 
measures could be taken in their behalf in the event of a serious accident. 
These guides do not specify a permissible population density or total 
population within this zone because the situation may vary from case to case. 
Whether a specific number of people can, for example, be evacuated from a 
specific area, or instructed to take shelter, on a timely basis will depend on 
many factors such as location, number and size of highways, scope and extent 
of advance planning, and actual distribution of residents within the area. 



* * * * * 





Safety-related structures, systems, and components 

means those 
structures, systems, and components that are relied on to remain functional 
during and following design basis (postulated) events to assure: 

(1) The integrity of the reactor coolant pressure boundary, 

(2) The capability to shutdown the reactor and maintain it in a 
safe shutdown condition, and 

(3) The capability to prevent or mitigate the consequences of 
accidents which could result in potential offsite exposures comparable to the 
applicable guideline exposures set forth in  50.34(a)(1) or  100.11 of this 
chapter. 



* * * * * 





Total effective dose equivalent

 (TEDE) means the sum of the deep-dose equivalent (for external exposures) and the committed effective dose 
equivalent (for internal exposures). 



* * * * * 



3. In  50.8, paragraph (b) is revised to read as follows: 



 50.8 



Information collection requirements: OMB approval. 



* * * * * 



(b) The approved information collection requirements contained in this 
part appear in   50.30, 50.33, 50.33a, 50.34, 50.34a, 50.35, 50.36, 50.36a, 
50.48, 50.49, 50.54, 50.55, 50.55a, 50.59, 50.60, 50.61, 50.63, 50.64, 50.65, 
50.71, 50.72, 50.80, 50.82, 50.90, 50.91, and Appendices A, B, E, G, H, I, J, 
K, M, N, O, Q, R, and S. 



* * * * * 



4. In  50.34, footnotes 6, 7, and 8 are redesignated as footnotes 8, 
9 and 10 and paragraph (a)(1) is revised and paragraphs (a)(12), 
(b)(10), and (b)(11) are added to read as follows:

Contents of applications; technical information. 



(a) * * * 

(1) Stationary power reactor applicants for a construction permit 
pursuant to this part, or a design certification or combined license pursuant 
to Part 52 of this chapter who apply on or after [EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE FINAL 
RULE], shall comply with paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section. All other 
applicants for a construction permit pursuant to this part or a design 
certification or combined license pursuant to part 52 of this chapter, shall 
comply with paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section. 

(i) A description and safety assessment of the site on which 
the facility is to be located, with appropriate attention to features 
affecting facility design. Special attention should be directed to the site 
evaluation factors identified in part 100 of this chapter. The assessment must 
contain an analysis and evaluation of the major structures, systems and 
components of the facility which bear significantly on the acceptability of 
the site under the site evaluation factors identified in part 100 of this 
chapter, assuming that the facility will be operated at the ultimate power 
level which is contemplated by the applicant. With respect to operation at 
the projected initial power level, the applicant is required to submit 
information prescribed in paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(8) of this section, as 
well as the information required by this paragraph, in support of the 
application for a construction permit, or a design approval. 

(ii) A description and safety assessment of the site and a 
safety assessment of the facility. It is expected that reactors will reflect 
through their design , construction and operation an extremely low probability 
for accidents that could result in the release of significant quantities of 
radioactive fission products. The following power reactor design 
characteristics and proposed operation will be taken into consideration by the 
Commission: 

(A) Intended use of the reactor including the proposed maximum power 
level and the nature and inventory of contained radioactive materials; 

(B) The extent to which generally accepted engineering standards are 
applied to the design of the reactor; 

(C) The extent to which the reactor incorporates unique, unusual or 
enhanced safety features having a significant bearing on the probability or 
consequences of accidental release of radioactive materials; 

(D) The safety features that are to be engineered into the facility 
and those barriers that must be breached as a result of an accident before a 
release of radioactive material to the environment can occur. 
Special attention must be directed to plant design features intended to 
mitigate the radiological consequences of accidents. In performing this 
assessment, an applicant shall assume a fission product release
 from the core into the containment assuming that the facility is operated at the 
ultimate power level contemplated. The applicant shall perform an evaluation 
and analysis of the postulated fission product release, using the expected 
demonstrable containment leak rate and any fission product cleanup systems 
intended to mitigate the consequences of the accidents, together with 
applicable site characteristics, including site meteorology, to evaluate the 
offsite radiological consequences. Site characteristics must comply with part 
100 of this chapter. The evaluation must determine that: 





(

1

) An individual located at any point on the boundary of the 
exclusion area for any 2 hour period following the onset of the postulated 
fission product release, would not receive a radiation dose in excess of 25
 rem total effective dose equivalent (TEDE). 





(

2

) An individual located at any point on the outer boundary of 
the low population zone, who is exposed to the radioactive cloud resulting 
from the postulated fission product release (during the entire period of its 
passage) would not receive a radiation dose in excess of 25 rem total 
effective dose equivalent (TEDE). 

(E) With respect to operation at the projected initial power level, 
the applicant is required to submit information prescribed in paragraphs 
(a)(2) through (a)(8) of this section, as well as the information required by 
this paragraph, in support of the application for a construction permit, or a 
design approval. 



* * * * * 



(12) On or after [EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE FINAL RULE], stationary power 
reactor applicants who apply for a construction permit pursuant to this part, 
or a design certification or combined license pursuant to part 52 of this 
chapter, as partial conformance to General Design Criterion 2 of appendix A to 
this part, shall comply with the earthquake engineering criteria in appendix S 
of this part. 

(b) * * * 

(10) On or after [EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE FINAL RULE], stationary power 
reactor applicants who apply for an operating license pursuant to this part, 
or a design certification or combined license pursuant to part 52 of this 
chapter, as partial conformance to General Design Criterion 2 of appendix A to 
this part, shall comply with the earthquake engineering criteria of appendix S 
to this part. However, if the construction permit was issued prior to 
[EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE FINAL RULE], the stationary power reactor applicant 
shall comply with the earthquake engineering criteria in Section VI of 
appendix A to part 100 of this chapter. 

(11) On or after [EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE FINAL RULE], stationary power 
reactor applicants who apply for an operating license pursuant to this Part, 
or a combined license pursuant to part 52 of this chapter, shall provide a 
description and safety assessment of the site and of the facility as in 
 50.34(a)(1)(ii) of this part.

5. In  50.54, paragraph (ff) is added to read as follows: 


 50.54 


Conditions of licenses. 


* * * * * 


(ff) For licensees of nuclear power plants that have implemented the earthquake engineering criteria in appendix
S of this part, plant shutdown is required as provided in paragraph IV(a)(3) of appendix S. Prior to resuming operations,
the licensee shall demonstrate to the Commission that no functional damage has occurred to those features necessary
for continued operation without undue risk to the health and safety of the public and the licensing basis is maintained.

Appendix S to Part 50_Earthquake Engineering Criteria for Nuclear Power Plants 



General Information 


This appendix applies to applicants for a design certification or combined license pursuant to part 52 of this chapter
or a construction permit or operating license pursuant to Part 50 of this chapter on or after [EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE
FINAL RULE]. However, if the construction permit was issued prior to [EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE FINAL RULE], the operating
license applicant shall comply with the earthquake engineering criteria in Section VI of appendix A to 10 CFR part
100. 



I. Introduction 


Each applicant for a construction permit, operating license, design certification, or combined license is required
by  50.34(a)(12), (b)(10), and General Design Criterion 2 of appendix A to this part to design nuclear power
plant structures, systems, and components important to safety to withstand the effects of natural phenomena, such
as earthquakes, without loss of capability to perform their safety functions. Also, as specified in  50.54(ff),
nuclear power plants that have implemented the earthquake engineering criteria described herein must shut down
if the criteria in paragraph IV(a)(3) of this appendix are exceeded. 

These criteria implement General Design Criterion 2 insofar as it requires structures, systems, and components
important to safety to withstand the effects of earthquakes. 



II. Scope 



The evaluations described in this appendix are within the scope of investigations permitted by  50.10(c)(1).





III. Definitions 



As used in these criteria: 



Combined license 

means a combined construction permit and operating license with conditions for a nuclear power facility issued pursuant
to subpart C of part 52 of this chapter. 



Design Certification 

means a Commission approval, issued pursuant to subpart B of part 52 of this chapter, of a standard design for a nuclear
power facility. A design so approved may be referred to as a ``certified standard design.'' 

The 

Operating Basis Earthquake Ground Motion (OBE) 

is the vibratory ground motion for which those features of the nuclear power plant necessary for continued operation
without undue risk to the health and safety of the public will remain functional. The Operating Basis Earthquake Ground
Motion is only associated with plant shutdown and inspection unless specifically selected by the applicant as a design
input. 

A 

response spectrum 

is a plot of the maximum responses (acceleration, velocity, or displacement) of idealized single-degree-of-freedom
oscillators as a function of the natural frequencies of the oscillators for a given damping value. The response spectrum
is calculated for a specified vibratory motion input at the oscillators' supports. 

The 

Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground Motion 

(SSE) is the vibratory ground motion for which certain structures, systems, and components must be designed to remain
functional. 


The 

structures, systems, and components required to withstand the effects of the Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground Motion
or surface deformation 

are those necessary to assure: 

(1) The integrity of the reactor coolant pressure boundary, 
(2) The capability to shut down the reactor and maintain it in a safe shutdown condition, or 
(3) The capability to prevent or mitigate the consequences of accidents that could result in potential offsite exposures
comparable to the guideline exposures of  50.34(a)(1)(ii). 



Surface deformation 

is distortion of geologic strata at or near the ground surface by the processes of folding or faulting as a result of
various earth forces. Tectonic surface deformation is associated with earthquake processes. 



IV. Application to Engineering Design 



The following are pursuant to the seismic and geologic design basis requirements of  100.23 of this chapter:


(a) Vibratory Ground Motion. 

(1) Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground Motion. The Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground Motion must be characterized by
free-field ground motion response spectra at the free ground surface. In view of the limited data available on vibratory
ground motions of strong earthquakes, it usually will be appropriate that the design response spectra be smoothed
spectra. The horizontal component of the Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground Motion in the free-field at the foundation
level of the structures must be an appropriate response spectrum with a peak ground acceleration of at least 0.1g.


The nuclear power plant must be designed so that, if the Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground Motion occurs, certain structures,
systems, and components will remain functional and within applicable stress, strain, and deformation limits. In
addition to seismic loads, applicable concurrent normal operating, functional, and accident-induced loads must
be taken into account in the design of these safety-related structures, systems, and components. The design of the
nuclear power plant must also take into account the possible effects of the Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground Motion
on the facility foundations by ground disruption, such as fissuring, lateral spreads, differential settlement,
liquefaction, and landsliding, as required in  100.23 to part 100 of this chapter. 

The required safety functions of structures, systems, and components must be assured during and after the vibratory
ground motion associated with the Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground Motion through design, testing, or qualification
methods. 

The evaluation must take into account soil-structure interaction effects and the expected duration of vibratory
motion. It is permissible to design for strain limits in excess of yield strain in some of these safety-related structures,
systems, and components during the Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground Motion and under the postulated concurrent loads,
provided the necessary safety functions are maintained. 
(2) Operating Basis Earthquake Ground Motion.

<TEXT>
 

(i) The Operating Basis Earthquake Ground Motion must be characterized by response spectra. The value of the Operating
Basis Earthquake Ground Motion must be set to one of the following choices: 

(A) One-third or less of the Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground Motion design response spectra. The requirements associated
with this Operating Basis Earthquake Ground Motion in paragraph (a)(2)(i)(B)(I) can be satisfied without the applicant
performing explicit response or design analyses, or 

(B) A value greater than one-third of the Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground Motion design response spectra. Analysis
and design must be performed to demonstrate that the requirements associated with this Operating Basis Earthquake
Ground Motion in paragraph (a)(2)(i)(B)(I) are satisfied. The design must take into account soil-structure interaction
effects and the duration of vibratory ground motion. 

(I) When subjected to the effects of the Operating Basis Earthquake Ground Motion in combination with normal operating
loads, all structures, systems, and components of the nuclear power plant necessary for continued operation without
undue risk to the health and safety of the public must remain functional and within applicable stress, strain, and
deformation limits. 

(3) Required Plant Shutdown. If vibratory ground motion exceeding that of the Operating Basis Earthquake Ground
Motion or if significant plant damage occurs, the licensee must shut down the nuclear power plant. If systems, structures,
or components necessary for the safe shutdown of the nuclear power plant are not available after the occurrence of
the OBE, the licensee must consult with the Commission and must propose a plan for the timely, safe shutdown of the nuclear
power plant. Prior to resuming operations, the licensee must demonstrate to the Commission that no functional damage
has occurred to those features necessary for continued operation without undue risk to the health and safety of the
public. 

(4) Required Seismic Instrumentation. Suitable instrumentation must be provided so that the seismic response of
nuclear power plant features important to safety can be evaluated promptly after an earthquake. 

(b) Surface Deformation. The potential for surface deformation must be taken into account in the design of the nuclear
power plant by providing reasonable assurance that in the event of deformation, certain structures, systems, and
components will remain functional. In addition to surface deformation induced loads, the design of safety features
must take into account seismic loads, including aftershocks, and applicable concurrent functional and accident-induced
loads. The design provisions for surface deformation must be based on its postulated occurrence in any direction
and azimuth and under any part of the nuclear power plant, unless evidence indicates this assumption is not appropriate,
and must take into account the estimated rate at which the surface deformation may occur. 

(c) Seismically Induced Floods and Water Waves and Other Design Conditions. Seismically induced floods and water
waves from either locally or distantly generated seismic activity and other design conditions determined pursuant
to  100.23 of this chapter must be taken into account in the design of the nuclear power plant so as to prevent undue
risk to the health and 
safety of the public.

11. Section 100.1 is revised to read as follows: 



 100.1 

Purpose. 



(a) The purpose of this part is to establish approval requirements for 
proposed sites for stationary power and testing reactors subject to part 50 or 
part 52 of this chapter. 

(b) There exists a substantial base of knowledge regarding power reactor 
siting, design, construction and operation. This base reflects that the primary 
factors that determine public health and safety are the reactor design, 
construction and operation. 

(c) Siting factors and criteria are important in assuring that radiological 
doses from normal operation and postulated accidents will be acceptably low, that 
natural phenomena and potential man-made hazards will be appropriately accounted 
for in the design of the plant, and that the site characteristics are amenable 
to the development of adequate emergency plans to protect the public and adequate 
security measures to protect the plant. 

(d) This approach incorporates the appropriate standards and criteria for 
approval of stationary power and testing reactor sites. The Commission intends 
to carry out a traditional defense-in-depth approach with regard to reactor 
siting to ensure public safety. Siting away from densely populated centers has 
been and will continue to be an important factor in evaluating applications for 
site approval. 

12. Section 100.2 is revised to read as follows: 



 100.2 

Scope. 



The siting requirements contained in this part apply to applications for site 
approval for the purpose of constructing and operating stationary power and 
testing reactors pursuant to the provisions of parts 50 or 52 of this chapter. 

13. Section 100.3 is revised to read as follows: 



 100.3 

Definitions. 



As used in this part: 



Combined license

 means a combined construction permit and operating license 
with conditions for a nuclear power facility issued pursuant to subpart C of part 
52 of this chapter. 



Early site permit 

means a Commission approval, issued pursuant to subpart 
A of part 52 of this chapter, for a site or sites for one or more nuclear power 
facilities. 



Exclusion area

 means that area surrounding the reactor, in which the 
reactor licensee has the authority to determine all activities including 
exclusion or removal of personnel and property from the area. This area may be 
traversed by a highway, railroad, or waterway, provided these are not so close 
to the facility as to interfere with normal operations of the facility and 
provided appropriate and effective arrangements are made to control traffic on 
the highway, railroad, or waterway, in case of emergency, to protect the public 
health and safety. Residence within the exclusion area shall normally be 
prohibited. In any event, residents shall be subject to ready removal in case 
of necessity. Activities unrelated to operation of the reactor may be permitted 
in an exclusion area under appropriate limitations, provided that no significant 
hazards to the public health and safety will result. 



Low population zone

 means the area immediately surrounding the exclusion 
area which contains residents, the total number and density of which are such 
that there is a reasonable probability that appropriate protective measures could 
be taken in their behalf in the event of a serious accident. These guides do not 
specify a permissible population density or total population within this zone 
because the situation may vary from case to case. Whether a specific number of 
people can, for example, be evacuated from a specific area, or instructed to take 
shelter, on a timely basis will depend on many factors such as location, number 
and size of highways, scope and extent of advance planning, and actual 
distribution of residents within the area. 



Population center distance

 means the distance from the reactor to the 
nearest boundary of a densely populated center containing more than about 25,000 
residents. 



Power reactor

 means a nuclear reactor of a type described in   50.21(b) or 
50.22 of this chapter designed to produce electrical or heat energy. 

A 

Response spectrum

 is a plot of the maximum responses (acceleration, 
velocity, or displacement) of idealized single-degree-of-freedom oscillators as 
a function of the natural frequencies of the oscillators for a given damping 
value. The response spectrum is calculated for a specified vibratory motion 
input at the oscillators' supports. 

The 

Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground Motion

 is the vibratory ground motion 
for which certain structures, systems, and components must be designed pursuant 
to Appendix S to part 50 of this chapter to remain functional. 



Surface deformation

 is distortion of geologic strata at or near the ground 
surface by the processes of folding or faulting as a result of various earth 
forces. Tectonic surface deformation is associated with earthquake processes. 



Testing reactor

 means a 

testing facility

 as defined in  50.2 of this 
chapter.

Information collection requirements: OMB approval. 



(a) The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has submitted the information 
collection requirements contained in this part to the Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB) for approval as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). OMB has approved
the information collection requirements contained in this part under control number 3150-0093. 

(b) The approved information collection requirements contained in this 
part appear in  100.23 and Appendix A. 

16. A heading for Subpart A (consisting of   100.10 and 100.11) is added directly before  100.10

Applications Before [EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE FINAL RULE] and for Testing 
Reactors 



Sec.



100.10 Factors to be considered when evaluating sites.

100.11 Determination of exclusion area, low population zone, and population center distance.



 100.10 

Factors to be considered when evaluating sites. 



Factors considered in the evaluation of sites include those relating both 
to the proposed reactor design and the characteristics peculiar to the site. It 
is expected that reactors will reflect through their design, construction and 
operation an extremely low probability for accidents that could result in release 
of significant quantities of radioactive fission products. In addition, the site 
location and the engineered features included as safeguards against the hazardous 
consequences of an accident, should one occur, should insure a low risk of public 
exposure. In particular, the Commission will take the following factors into 
consideration in determining the acceptability of a site for a power or testing 
reactor: 

(a) Characteristics of reactor design and proposed operation including_

(1) Intended use of the reactor including the proposed maximum power level 
and the nature and inventory of contained radioactive materials; 

(2) The extent to which generally accepted engineering standards are 
applied to the design of the reactor; 

(3) The extent to which the reactor incorporates unique or unusual features 
having a significant bearing on the probability or consequences of accidental 
release of radioactive materials; 

(4) The safety features that are to be engineered into the facility and 
those barriers that must be breached as a result of an accident before a release 
of radioactive material to the environment can occur. 

(b) Population density and use characteristics of the site environs, 
including the exclusion area, low population zone, and the population center 
distance. 

(c) Physical characteristics of the site, including seismology, 
meteorology, geology, and hydrology. 

(1) Appendix A to Part 100, ``Seismic and Geologic Siting Criteria for 
Nuclear Power Plants'' describes the nature of investigations required to obtain 
the geologic and seismic data necessary to determine site suitability and to 
provide reasonable assurance that a nuclear power plant can be constructed and 
operated at a proposed site without undue risk to the health and safety of the 
public. It describes procedures for determining the quantitative vibratory 
ground motion design basis at a site due to earthquakes and describes information 
needed to determine whether and to what extent a nuclear power plant need be 
designed to withstand the effects of surface faulting. 

(2) Meteorological conditions at the site and in the surrounding area 
should be considered. 

(3) Geological and hydrological characteristics of the proposed site may 
have a bearing on the consequences of an escape of radioactive material from the 
facility. Special precautions should be planned if a reactor is to be located 
at a site where a significant quantity of radioactive effluent might accidentally 
flow into nearby streams or rivers or might find ready access to underground 
water tables.

(d) Where unfavorable physical characteristics of the site exist, the 
proposed site may nevertheless be found to be acceptable if the design of the 
facility includes appropriate and adequate compensating engineering safeguards. 



 100.11 

Determination of exclusion area, low population zone, and population 
center distance. 



(a) As an aid in evaluating a proposed site, an applicant should assume a 
fission product release
 from the core, the expected demonstrable leak rate from 
the containment and the meteorological conditions pertinent to his site to derive 
an exclusion area, a low population zone and population center distance. For the 
purpose of this analysis, which shall set forth the basis for the numerical 
values used, the applicant should determine the following: 





(1) An exclusion area of such size that an individual located at any point 
on its boundary for two hours immediately following onset of the postulated 
fission product release would not receive a total radiation dose to the whole 
body in excess of 25 rem
 or a total radiation dose in excess of 300 rem to the 
thyroid from iodine exposure. 





(2) A low population zone of such size that an individual located at any 
point on its outer boundary who is exposed to the radioactive cloud resulting 
from the postulated fission product release (during the entire period of its 
passage) would not receive a total radiation dose to the whole body in excess of 
25 rem or a total radiation dose in excess of 300 rem to the thyroid from iodine 
exposure. 
(3) A population center distance of at least one and one''third times the 
distance from the reactor to the outer boundary of the low population zone. In 
applying this guide, the boundary of the population center shall be determined 
upon consideration of population distribution. Political boundaries are not 
controlling in the application of this guide. Where very large cities are 
involved, a greater distance may be necessary because of total integrated 
population dose consideration. 
(b) For sites for multiple reactor facilities consideration should be given 
to the following: 
(1) If the reactors are independent to the extent that an accident in one 
reactor would not initiate an accident in another, the size of the exclusion 
area, low population zone and population center distance shall be fulfilled with 
respect to each reactor individually. The envelopes of the plan overlay of the 
areas so calculated shall then be taken as their respective boundaries. 

(2) If the reactors are interconnected to the extent that an accident in 
one reactor could affect the safety of operation of any other, the size of the 
exclusion area, low population zone and population center distance shall be based 
upon the assumption that all interconnected reactors emit their postulated 
fission product releases simultaneously. This requirement may be reduced in 
relation to the degree of coupling between reactors, the probability of 
concomitant accidents and the probability that an individual would not be exposed 
to the radiation effects from simultaneous releases. The applicant would be 
expected to justify to the satisfaction of the Commission the basis for such a 
reduction in the source term. 
(3) The applicant is expected to show that the simultaneous operation of 
multiple reactors at a site will not result in total radioactive effluent 
 releases beyond the allowable limits of applicable regulations. 

 




Note:

 For further guidance in developing the exclusion area, the low population 
zone, and the population center distance, reference is made to Technical 
Information Document 14844, dated March 23, 1962, which contains a procedural 
method and a sample calculation that result in distances roughly reflecting 
current siting practices of the Commission. The calculations described in 
Technical Information Document 14844 may be used as a point of departure for 
consideration of particular site requirements which may result from evaluation 
of the characteristics of a particular reactor, its purpose and method of 
operation. 

 


Copies of Technical Information Document 14844 may be obtained from the 
 Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW.(Lower Level), Washington, 
DC, or by writing the Director of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, U.S. Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555. 

17. through 19. Subpart B (  100.20-100.23) is added to read as follows: 



Subpart B_Evaluation Factors for Stationary Power Reactor Site Applications on 
or After [EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE FINAL RULE]

100.21 Non-seismic siting criteria.
100.23 Geologic and seismic siting factors. 



 100.20 

Factors to be considered when evaluating sites. 




The Commission will take the following factors into consideration in 
determining the acceptability of a site for a stationary power reactor: 

(a) Population density and use characteristics of the site environs, 
including the exclusion area, the population distribution, and site-related 
characteristics must be evaluated to determine whether individual as well as 
societal risk of potential plant accidents is low, and that site-related 
characteristics would not prevent the development of a plan to carry out suitable 
protective actions for members of the public in the event of emergency. 

(b) The nature and proximity of man-related hazards (e.g., airports, 
dams, transportation routes, military and chemical facilities) must be evaluated 
to establish site parameters for use in determining whether a plant design can 
accommodate commonly occurring hazards, and whether the risk of other hazards is 
very low.

(c) Physical characteristics of the site, including seismology, meteorology, geology, and hydrology. 

(1)  100.23, ``Geologic and seismic siting factors,'' of this part describes the criteria and nature of investigations
required to obtain the geologic and seismic data necessary to determine the suitability of the proposed site and the
plant design bases. 

(2) Meteorological characteristics of the site that are necessary for safety analysis or that may have an impact upon
plant design (such as maximum probable wind speed and precipitation) must be identified and characterized. 

(3) Factors important to hydrological radionuclide transport such as soil, sediment, and rock characteristics,
adsorption and retention coefficients, ground water velocity, and distances to the nearest surface body of water)
must be obtained from on-site measurements. The maximum probable flood along with the potential for seismically
induced floods discussed in  100.23(d)(3) of this part must be estimated using historical data. 



 100.21 


Non-seismic siting criteria. 



Applications for site approval for commercial power reactors shall demonstrate that the proposed site meets the
following criteria:

(a) Every site must have an exclusion area and a low population zone, as defined in  100.3; 

(b) The population center distance, as defined in  100.3, must be at least one and one-third times the distance
from the reactor to the outer boundary of (the low population zone. In applying this guide, the boundary of the population
center shall be determined upon consideration of population distribution. Political boundaries are not controlling
in the application of this guide; 

(c) Site atmospheric dispersion characteristics must be evaluated and dispersion parameters established such
that: 

(1) Radiological effluent release limits associated with normal operation from the type of facility proposed to
be located at the site can be met for any individual located offsite; and 

(2) Radiological dose consequences of postulated accidents shall meet the criteria set forth in  50.34(a)(1)
of this chapter for the type of facility proposed to be located at the site; 
(d) The physical characteristics of the site, including meteorology, geology, seismology, and hydrology must be
evaluated and site parameters established such that potential threats from such physical characteristics will
pose no undue risk to the type of facility proposed to be located at the site; 

(e) Potential hazards associated with nearby transportation routes, industrial and military facilities must be
evaluated and site parameters established such that potential hazards from such routes and facilities will pose
no undue risk to the type of facility proposed to be located at the site; 

(f) Site characteristics must be such that adequate security plans and measures can be developed; 

(g) Site characteristics must be such that adequate plans to take protective actions for members of the public in the
event of emergency can be developed: 

(h) Reactor sites should be located away from very densely populated centers. Areas of low population density are,
generally, preferred. However, in determining the acceptability of a particular site located away from a very densely
populated center but not in an area of low density, consideration will be given to safety, environmental, economic,
or other factors, which may result in the site being found acceptable.






 100.23 

Geologic and seismic siting factors. 



This section sets forth the principal geologic and seismic considerations that guide the Commission in its evaluation
of the suitability of a proposed site and adequacy of the design bases established in consideration of the geologic
and seismic characteristics of the proposed site, such that, there is a reasonable assurance that a nuclear power
plant can be constructed and operated at the proposed site without undue risk to the health and safety of the public.


Applications to engineering design are contained in appendix S to part 50 of this chapter. 

(a) Applicability. The requirements in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section apply to applicants for an early site
permit or combined license pursuant to part 52 of this chapter, or a construction permit or operating license for a
nuclear power plant pursuant to Part 50 of this chapter on or after [EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE FINAL RULE]. However, if the
construction permit was issued prior to [EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE FINAL RULE], the operating license applicant shall
comply with the seismic and geologic siting criteria in appendix A to part 100 of this chapter. 

(b) Commencement of construction. The investigations required in paragraph (c) of this section are within the scope
of investigations permitted by  50.10(c)(1) of this chapter. 

(c) Geological, seismological, and engineering characteristics. The geological, seismological, and engineering
characteristics of a site and its environs must be investigated in sufficient scope and detail to permit an adequate
evaluation of the proposed site, to provide sufficient information to support evaluations performed to arrive at
estimates of the Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground Motion, and to permit adequate engineering solutions to actual
or potential geologic and seismic effects at the proposed site. The size of the region to be investigated and the type
of data pertinent to the investigations must be determined based on the nature of the region surrounding the proposed
site. Data on the vibratory ground motion, tectonic surface deformation, nontectonic deformation, earthquake
recurrence rates, fault geometry and slip rates, site foundation material, and seismically induced floods and water
waves must be obtained by reviewing pertinent literature and carrying out field investigations. However, each applicant
shall investigate all geologic and seismic factors (for example, volcanic activity) that may affect the design and
operation of the proposed nuclear power plant irrespective of whether such factors are explicitly included in this
section.

(d) Geologic and seismic siting factors. The geologic and seismic siting 
factors considered for design must include a determination of the Safe Shutdown 
Earthquake Ground Motion for the site, the potential for surface tectonic and 
nontectonic deformations, the design bases for seismically induced floods and 
water waves, and other design conditions as stated in paragraph (d)(4) of this 
section. 
(1) Determination of the Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground Motion. The Safe 
Shutdown Earthquake Ground Motion for the site is characterized by both 
horizontal and vertical free-field ground motion response spectra at the free 
ground surface. The Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground Motion for the site is 
determined considering the results of the investigations required by paragraph (c) of this section. Uncertainties
are inherent in such estimates. These 
uncertainties must be addressed through an appropriate analysis, such as a 
probabilistic seismic hazard analysis or suitable sensitivity analyses. 
Paragraph IV(a)(1) of appendix S to part 50 of this chapter defines the minimum 
Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground Motion for design. 
(2) Determination of the potential for surface tectonic and nontectonic 
deformations. Sufficient geological, seismological, and geophysical data must 
be provided to clearly establish whether there is a potential for surface 
deformation. 
(3) Determination of design bases for seismically induced floods and water 
waves. The size of seismically induced floods and water waves that could affect 
a site from either locally or distantly generated seismic activity must be 
determined. 
(4) Determination of siting factors for other design conditions. Siting 
factors for other design conditions that must be evaluated include soil and rock 
stability, liquefaction potential, natural and artificial slope stability, 
cooling water supply, and remote safety-related structure siting. Each applicant 
shall evaluate all siting factors and potential causes of failure, such as, the 
physical properties of the materials underlying the site, ground disruption, and 
the effects of vibratory ground motion that may affect the design and operation 
of the proposed nuclear power plant.

Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Model A310 and A300-600 Series Airplanes 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Airbus Model
A310 and A300-600 series airplanes. This proposal would require that certain flight control computers be modified
so that the autopilot will disengage whenever the airplane is in the ``go-around'' mode. This proposal is prompted
by an accident in which the flight crew may have attempted a go-around while the airplane was in an out-of-trim condition.
The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent severely reduced controllability of the airplane
due to an out-of-trim condition between the trimmable horizontal stabilizer and the elevator.

Discussion 



The Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC), which is the airworthiness authority for France,
recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Airbus Model A310 and A300-600 series
airplanes. The French DGAC advises that a Model A300-600 series airplane was recently involved in an accident
during which the flight crew may have attempted a go-around while the airplane was in an out-of-trim condition. Investigation
into the cause of this out-of-trim condition revealed that the flight crew may have attempted to override the autopilot
while it was engaged in the COMMAND mode. If the airplane is in pitch axis, and the autopilot is overridden for prolonged
periods by the flight crew via manual input from the control column, and if the autopilot is subsequently disengaged,
the resultant out-of-trim condition between the trimmable horizontal stabilizer and the elevator could reduce
controllability of the airplane. 

Further investigation indicates that the design of Model A300-600 series airplanes does not provide for disengagement
of the autopilot in a manner that would allow for manual input from the control column without adversely affecting
controllability of the airplane. The design of Model A310 series airplanes is identical in this respect to Model A300-600
series airplanes. 

The French DGAC issued French Airworthiness Directive 94-185-165(B), dated August 17, 1994, in order
to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in France. The French AD requires modification of FCC's
having part numbers (P/N) B216ABM6, B350AAM1, B350AAM2, B350AAM3, and B470ABM1 (for Model A310 series airplanes);
and P/N's B297AAM3, B297AAM4, B297AAM5, and B470AAM1 (for Model A300-600 series airplanes). 

The French AD references Airbus Service Bulletins A310-22-2036, dated December 14, 1993 (for Model A310
series airplanes), and A300-22-6021, Revision 1, dated December 24, 1993 (for Model A300-600 series
airplanes), as the appropriate sources of service information to accomplish the modification of the FCC's. However,
Airbus Service Bulletin A310-22-2036, dated December 14, 1993, describes procedures for modification
of only one of the FCC's, P/N B470ABM1, which is installed on Model A310 series airplanes; while Airbus Service Bulletin
A300-22-6021, Revision 1, dated December 24, 1993, describes procedures for modification of only one
of the FCC's, P/N B470AAM1, which is installed on Model A300-600 series airplanes. Upon accomplishment of this
software modification, the autopilot will disengage whenever the airplane is in the ``go-around'' mode above 400
feet radio altitude and whenever the pilot attempts to override the autopilot by exerting a certain amount of manual
force on the control column. 

This airplane model is manufactured in France and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the
provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the French DGAC has kept the FAA informed of the situation
described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the French DGAC, reviewed all available information, and determined
that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.


Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require modification of FCC's having P/N's B216ABM6,
B350AAM1, B350AAM2, and B350AAM3 (for Model A310 series airplanes); and P/N's B297AAM3, B297AAM4, and B297AAM5
(for Model A300-600 series airplanes). Since the manufacturer has not yet developed a modification for these
FCC's, these modifications are to be accomplished in accordance with a method approved by the FAA.

<TEXT>
 

This is considered to be interim action until final action is identified, at which time the FAA may consider further
rulemaking. 

Modification of FCC's having P/N's B470ABM1 (for Model A310 series airplanes) and B470AAM1 (for Model A300-600
series airplanes) has been addressed in a separate rulemaking action (reference Airworthiness Directive Rules
Docket Number 94-NM-134-AD). Since the manufacturer has advised that an ample number of required
parts will be available for modification of FCC's having these two part numbers, and in light of the degree of urgency
associated with the subject unsafe condition, the FAA finds that modification of those FCC's must be accomplished
sooner than the modification of the FCC's addressed in this proposal. That AD action also requires a revision to the
FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) that warns the flight crew to avoid overriding the autopilot while the
airplane is in the COMMAND mode and cautions the flight crew to check the status of the autopilot in the event the flight
controls respond abnormally. 

The FAA estimates that 15 Model A310 series airplanes and 36 Model A300-600 series airplanes of U.S. registry
would be affected by this proposed AD. 

Since the manufacturer has not yet developed one specific modification commensurate with the requirements of this
proposal, the FAA is unable at this time to provide a specific information as to the number of work hours or cost of parts
that would be required to accomplish the proposed modification. A further problem in developing a specific cost estimate
is the fact that modification costs are expected to vary from operator to operator and from airplane to airplane depending
upon airplane configuration. The proposed compliance time of 24 months should provide ample time for the development,
approval, and installation of an appropriate modification. 

However, based on similar modifications accomplished previously on other FCC's installed on other airplane models,
the FAA can reasonably estimate that the proposed modification may require as few as 2 work hours or as many as 50 work
hours to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. The cost of required parts could range from a negligible
amount to as much as $1,500 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators
is estimated to be between $5,610 ($110 per airplane) and $216,750 ($4,250 per airplane). 

As indicated earlier in this preamble, the FAA specifically invites the submission of comments and other data regarding
this economic aspect of proposal. 

The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting

Food Labeling; Nutrition Labeling of Raw Fruit, Vegetables, and Fish; Guidelines for Voluntary Nutrition Labeling
of Raw Fruit, Vegetables, and Fish; Identification of the 20 Most Frequently Consumed Raw Fruit, Vegetables, and
Fish; Reopening of Comment Period 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule; reopening of comment period.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is reopening to November 16, 1994, the comment period for a proposed rule that
appeared in the 

Federal Register

 of July 18, 1994 (59 FR 36379). The document proposed to revise the guidelines for voluntary nutrition labeling of
raw fruit, vegetables, and fish; revise the definition for compliance with respect to adherence by retailers to those
guidelines; and revise the labeling regulations and labeling values for the 20 most frequently consumed raw fruit,
vegetables, and fish. This action is in response to the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990. In addition,
the document solicited comments on all aspects of the FDA data base review process. FDA is taking this action in response
to several requests for an extension of the comment period.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of July 18, 1994 (59 FR 36379), FDA issued a proposed rule to adopt regulations to revise the guidelines for voluntary
labeling of raw fruit, vegetables, and fish. The agency also published a correction document on July 21, 1994 (59 FR
37190), to correct an inadvertent error in the proposal. Interested persons were given until September 16, 1994,
to comment on the proposal. 


FDA has received several requests from trade associations for an extension of the comment period in order to better
review the proposal and prepare comments. Most requests ask for a 30-day extension. 
After careful review of these requests, FDA has concluded that it is in the public interest to allow additional time
for comments. With the additional period, the agency is providing more than 90 days for comments. FDA considers that
this amount of time should be more than ample for interested persons to complete and submit their comments. Accordingly,
the agency is reopening the comment period to November 16, 1994. 
Interested persons may, on or before November 16, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written
comments regarding this proposal. Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit
one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received
comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

Withdrawal of Proposed Amendment to the Bank Secrecy Act Regulations for Mandatory Aggregation of Currency Transactions
for Certain Financial Institutions and Mandatory Magnetic Media Reporting of Currency Transaction Reports 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Departmental Offices, Treasury. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Withdrawal of Regulatory Proposal.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On September 6, 1990, Treasury published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) proposing requirements for banks
with deposits over $100 million, and certain nonbank financial institutions, regardless of asset size, to maintain
specific systems to aggregate currency transactions and proposing requirements for financial institutions that
file more than 1,000 Currency Transaction Reports per year to file by magnetic media. After analysis of the comments
received in response to this NPRM and further study and review, Treasury has decided to withdraw it. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On September 6, 1990 (55 FR 36663), Treasury published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) with two separate proposals.
The first would have required: (1) banks with deposits in excess of $100 million to maintain systems to aggregate currency
transactions that are conducted by or on behalf of accountholders at the bank and that affect an account during a business
day; and (2) currency dealers and exchangers, check cashers, and transmitters of funds to maintain systems and procedures
to aggregate currency transactions that are conducted by or on behalf of customers at the financial institution during
a business day. The second proposal would have required financial institutions that file more than 1,000 Currency
Transaction Reports (CTRs) a year, to file by magnetic media. Treasury sought comments on each proposal. 



Following publication of the NPRM, numerous financial institutions implemented aggregation and magnetic media
filing systems. Some implemented these systems in anticipation of a Final Rule. Others adopted aggregation systems
because those systems save costs and enhance financial institutions' ability to monitor currency activity for BSA
compliance, as well as for other management and marketing purposes. 

In 1990, multiple transaction CTRs accounted for only 51% of the total number of CTRs filed, while in 1993, multiple
transaction CTRs comprised 70% of all CTRs received by Treasury. Treasury believes the increased reporting of multiple
transactions reflects an increased awareness in the financial services industry of the importance of BSA compliance
and the availability of automated systems to assist in this endeavor. Because these systems also meet other important
needs of financial institutions, it is not expected that financial institutions will discontinue using their aggregation
systems upon withdrawal of the NPRM. 

The number of banks filing CTRs magnetically has increased dramatically. (In 1989, only 50 banks magnetically filed
CTRs. By mid-1994, the number of banks filing magnetically has increased to 532.) Because magnetic filing reduces
financial institutions' CTR processing and storage costs, it is unlikely that banks will return to paper processing
when the proposed NPRM is withdrawn. 

Treasury is currently considering ways to reduce the regulatory burden of complying with the BSA while enhancing
the utility of information it receives from financial institutions. After careful consideration of comments describing
the potential costs that would be incurred by financial institutions not yet using automated systems to aggregate
currency transactions, as well as Treasury's intention to implement additional regulatory changes, Treasury has
decided to withdraw the NPRM. 

In reaching this decision, Treasury analyzed comments received in response to the NPRM and consulted with the Bank
Secrecy Act Advisory Group. The Group, a committee which comprises 30 representatives from the financial services
industry, trades and businesses and state and federal government, expressed the view that financial institution
resources would be better devoted to programs specifically geared toward the detection and reporting of suspicious
transactions, and the implementation of mandatory ``know your customer'' programs. Treasury agrees with this reasoning
and is considering regulatory changes including reporting of suspicious transactions, mandatory ``know your customer''
programs, and federal licensing and state registration of nonbank financial institutions.

Commercial Mobile Radio Services; Louisiana State Petition to Retain Existing Jurisdiction Over Commercial Mobile
Radio Services



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Communications Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule; extension of time.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The amendments to the Communications Act in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 preempted state rate and
entry regulation of commercial mobile radio services. States were given the opportunity to file petitions for the
authority to continue regulating these intrastate rates. This Order extends the deadlines for reply comments in
this proceeding in response to a request filed by the Louisiana Public Service Commission. This extension will provide
interested parties enough time to complete their review and submit meaningful replies on the issues we raised in this
proceeding.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 


Order



Adopted: October 4, 1994. 

Released: October 4, 1994.




By the Chief, Private Radio Bureau:

1. The Louisiana Public Service Commission (Louisiana) has filed an ``emergency'' motion for a 10-day extension
of time from the October 4, 1994 deadline for filing reply comments, and a motion for expedited consideration of that
motion.
 For the reasons given below, we grant the motion.





2. The amendments to the Communications Act in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 preempted state rate
and entry regulation of commercial mobile radio services. A state could, however, obtain intrastate rate regulatory
authority by filing a properly supported petition with the FCC.
 States with existing rate regulation could petition by August 10, 1994 to continue regulating, and would obtain a
stay of statutory preemption until the FCC acted. The Commission has one year in which to rule on the petition and to
decide any reconsideration. Louisiana filed such a petition on August 9, 1994. Pursuant to the Commission's rules,
 interested parties had 30 days in which to comment and then 15 days for replies.








3. Louisiana states that an extension ``is necessary in order to provide the Commission with a complete and accurate
record on which to decide the numerous complex issues in this matter.'' The State claims that this extension ``will
not cause any undue hardship to any party nor will it retard the progress of this proceeding.''
 It adds that this proceeding will affect state interests in the manner in which mobile carriers are regulated, the
development of the industry, and the rates paid by and services rendered to Louisiana ratepayers. It states that it
has a constitutional charge to protect ratepayers' interests.
 In requesting expedited consideration, Louisiana states that it has orally notified counsel of record of the filing
of its motions.








4. We believe that the motion has merit. The record in this proceeding is large, and the issues, including the state
of competition in the cellular market in the state and the reasonableness of rates, intricate. We find that good cause
has been shown for the requested extension.

5. Pursuant to  1.46 of the Commission's Rules,
 we GRANT the Motion for Expedited Consideration of Emergency Motion on Behalf of the Louisiana Public Service Commission
for 10-Day Extension of Time to Reply to Comments Filed by Various Mobile Carriers and the Emergency Motion on Behalf
of the Louisiana Public Service Commission for 10-Day Extension of Time to Reply to Comments Filed by Various Mobile
Carriers, And Hereby Extend the period for filing replies UNTIL October 14, 1994.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule; request for comments. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This proposed rule would implement Amendment 21a to the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Groundfish Fishery
of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI), and would prohibit the use of trawl gear in specified
areas surrounding the Pribilof Islands. This action is necessary to protect areas of biological importance to certain
crab stocks and to reduce interference with seabird and marine mammal populations. It is intended to promote the objectives
of the FMP.


 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Fishing for groundfish by U.S. vessels in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the BSAI is managed by NMFS according
to the FMP for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI. The FMP was prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council
(Council) under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 

et seq.

) (Magnuson Act), and is implemented by regulations governing the U.S. groundfish fisheries at 50 CFR parts 675 and
676. General regulations that pertain to U.S. fisheries are codified at 50 CFR part 620. 



This action proposes regulations to implement Amendment 21a to the FMP. If approved, this amendment would prohibit
the use of trawl gear in specified areas of the EEZ surrounding the Pribilof Islands. A description of, and reasons
for, the proposed measures are presented below. 

Fishing for groundfish using trawl gear is authorized in the waters off St. Paul, St. George, Walrus, and Otter Islands
(Pribilof Islands area) under regulations at 50 CFR part 675. In addition to providing habitat for commercially important
groundfish, the Pribilof Islands area provides the necessary habitat for blue king crab, juvenile groundfish, Korean
hair crab, marine mammals, seabirds, and their prey species. The rocky benthic habitat immediately surrounding
the Pribilof Islands area provides essential food resources and protection for juvenile crab and fish species, which
are prey species for marine mammals and seabirds. 

NMFS trawl surveys indicate that during 1975, the historic estimated abundance of blue king crab in the Pribilof Islands
area decreased significantly. During 1980-1992, the abundance decreased from 106 million animals to 10 million
animals, according to the estimates obtained from NMFS trawl surveys. Unlike other crab species, blue king crab populations
do not extend uniformly across the Bering Sea shelf, but are found in isolated populations located in waters surrounding
the Pribilof, St. Matthew, and St. Lawrence Islands. As a result of the decrease in crab abundance, commercial crab
fisheries in the Pribilof Islands area have not been authorized since 1987. Continued trawling under the current
FMP for groundfish in the Pribilof Islands area could jeopardize the recovery of depressed blue king crab stocks and
the productivity of marine resources living in this habitat. 

The Pribilof Islands area contributes an essential food resource of prey species that allows for optimal foraging
and breeding opportunities for marine resources dependent on the habitat in this area. Fish, crab, seabird, and marine
mammal populations are dependent on the habitat that the Pribilof Islands area provides. Although sea lions and red-legged
kittiwakes are listed as a threatened species and as a candidate for threatened species, respectively, this action
would further protect these species. The northern fur seal is listed as depleted under the Marine Mammal Protection
Act. During the breeding season, approximately two-thirds of the northern fur seal population, and an estimated
88 and 92 percent of red-legged kittiwakes and Alaskan thick-billed murre, respectively, breed in the Pribilof Islands
area. The Pribilof Islands area also provides the rocky habitat necessary to protect fish and crab populations during
their juvenile stages. 

In 1989, the Central Bering Sea Fishermen's Association initiated a proposal to establish areas closed to trawling
in the Pribilof Islands area. The intent of this proposal was to protect this unique habitat and ecosystem so that it
could contribute long-term benefits to the fisheries surrounding the waters of the Pribilof Islands area. 

At its meeting in September 1991, the Council requested that an analysis be prepared to identify those areas needing
protection. The State of Alaska Department of Fish and Game prepared a draft EA/RIR for that proposal. The Pribilof
Islands habitat conservation area was determined by the Council at its April 1992 meeting, based on an analysis of
the distribution of crab and groundfish species.

The analysis was released for public review on October 29, 1992, and again in September 1993. During both review processes,
the Council recommended that additional alternatives be studied to define the areas that would protect a majority
of the species and habitat, while providing access to groundfish resources. The analysis identified areas of high
blue king crab bycatch and low groundfish harvests. 

The analysis indicated that the proposed Pribilof Islands habitat conservation area would not significantly impact
groundfish fishermen because it would affect only 14 vessels in the entire BSAI groundfish fleet and the operators
of these vessels would have the opportunity to fish in the remainder of the BSAI. 

At its meeting in December 1993, the Council again reviewed the draft EA/RIR and sent the document out for public review.
At its meeting in April 1994, the Council considered the testimony and recommendations of its Advisory Panel, Scientific
and Statistical Committee, fishing industry representatives, and the general public on alternative habitat protection
zones and how these areas would be defined, established, and managed. The Council reviewed information about the
distribution and habitat of blue king crab in the NMFS annual trawl surveys, and on observer data. The proposed trawl
closure encompasses a major portion of the historic blue king crab distribution during years of low abundance and
during years when the population was expanding. 

Amendment 21a would prohibit trawling within the EEZ in an area bounded by a straight line connecting the following
pairs of coordinates in the following order: 







The Council determined that this area protects most of the crab habitat in the Pribilof Islands area, without significant
adverse impacts on trawl operations for groundfish. This action balances the protection of the marine resources
dependent on this habitat with the needs of the groundfish fishery. 
The Council voted to recommend that Amendment 21a, which prohibit trawling in this area, be submitted to NMFS for approval.


Section 304(a)(1)(D) of the Magnuson Act requires the publication of regulations proposed by a Council within 15
days of receipt of the FMP amendments and regulations. At this time, NMFS has not determined that the FMP amendment
these regulations would implement are consistent with the national standards, other provisions of the Magnuson
Act, and other applicable laws. NMFS, in making a final determination about the FMP amendment and in implementing
a final rule, will take into account the data, views, and comments received during the comment period. 



Classification 



The Assistant General Counsel of the Department of Commerce certified to the Chief Counsel of the Small Business Administration
that this proposed rule, if adopted, would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. The proposed action would not have a significant economic impact on the fishing industry because less than
3 percent of the Bering Sea groundfish is harvested in the Pribilof Islands area by 14 vessels in the groundfish fleet.
The volume of groundfish historically caught in this area can be harvested elsewhere in the Bering Sea. As a result,
a regulatory flexibility analysis was not prepared. 

This proposed rule has been determined to be not significant 
for purposes of E.O. 12866.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Social Security Independence and Program Improvements Act of 1994 contains provisions affecting benefits under
titles II and XVI of the Social Security Act to individuals whose medically determined drug addiction or alcoholism
(DA&A) is a contributing factor material to the finding of disability. Most of these provisions are effective
for benefits payable beginning March 1, 1995. Certain implementing regulations must be issued by February 11, 1995,
180 days after enactment. The Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) is requesting early public comment
on several important policy issues. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Social Security Administration
(SSA) plan to use the comments, along with other public views and information obtained, to help formulate rules necessary
to implement some provisions. For provisions not requiring final regulations by February 1995, principally representative
payment provisions, HHS plans to issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to solicit public comments.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Background 



Section 201 of the Social Security Independence and Program Improvements Act of 1994, Public Law (Pub. L.) 103-296,
enacted August 15, 1994, contains several provisions affecting the payment of Social Security and supplemental
security income (SSI) benefits to individuals whose medically determined drug addiction or alcoholism (DA&A)
is a contributing factor material to the finding of disability. (For ease of reference in this Notice of Intent, we
refer to these individuals as being ``disabled based on DA&A.'') The provisions may affect individuals currently
receiving benefits, as well as those awarded benefits in the future. 

The law places new restrictions on Social Security and SSI benefit payments to individuals disabled based on DA&A,
which are intended to discourage a beneficiary from using Social Security or SSI benefits to support an addiction.
It also requires the Secretary to promulgate regulations necessary to implement the statutory provisions by February
11, 1995. 

HHS decided to request advance comments on the provisions involving nonpayment or termination of benefits under
section 201 of Public Law 103-296 for several reasons. Congress mandated in the law that in promulgating the
required regulations we consult with professionals in the field of DA&A treatment. This consultation must take
place before the regulations can be drafted. We also believe it warranted that we obtain public comment on the novel
program requirements of the law and policy issues at the same time. In addition, it is clear from the law that HHS must
have regulations in place by February 11, 1995. Accordingly, we are seeking advance public comments to be used in the
initial formulation of the rules through this request. In addition, we have requested individual comments directly
from various treatment professionals and advocacy groups around the country. We are holding and attending meetings
with various treatment professionals, representatives of referral and monitoring agencies (RMAs), and others
with knowledge of DA&A-related issues to discuss, in general, contemporary treatment philosophies and receive
the individual views of those in attendance. 



II. Summary of DA&A Provisions Prior to the Passage of Public Law 103-296 



Prior to the passage of Public Law 103-296, there were no special program rules for Social Security DA&A
beneficiaries. SSI beneficiaries disabled based on DA&A were required to receive payment through a representative
payee. These SSI beneficiaries are required to undergo treatment, when available, at approved facilities. They
also must comply with the terms of their treatment program and take part in the monitoring and testing procedures established
by the Secretary. 



III. Major DA&A-Related Provisions of Public Law 103-296 Involving Nonpayment or Termination of Benefits




A. Payment Limitation 



The payment of SSI benefits will be limited to 36 months for individuals disabled based on DA&A. Also, the payment
of Social Security benefits will be limited to 36 months, but this limitation will begin with the first month for which
treatment is available, and only months for which treatment is available are counted in the 36-month period. The 36-month
DA&A payment restrictions for both Social Security and SSI benefits will cease to be effective with respect to
benefits for months after September 2004. Medicare and Medicaid benefits will continue as long as a DA&A beneficiary
whose benefits have been suspended for less than 12 months, or terminated after 36 months, continues to be disabled
and otherwise eligible. Dependents' benefits will continue as long as the DA&A beneficiary whose benefits have
been suspended, or terminated after 12 months of noncompliance or the 36-month payment limit, continues to be disabled
and otherwise eligible. The payment limit will not apply to individuals who are disabled independent of their DA&A.
Suspension months will not be counted in the 36 months. 



B. Suspension for Noncompliance 



Benefits will be suspended for noncompliance with treatment for both Social Security and SSI beneficiaries, beginning
the first month following the month beneficiaries are notified of such noncompliance. Once an individual is determined
to be in noncompliance and benefits are suspended, benefits must continue to be suspended until after the beneficiary
demonstrates compliance with treatment requirements for specified periods_a minimum of 2 months, 3 months, and
6 months, respectively, for the first, second, and third or subsequent instances of noncompliance. Suspension of
benefits for 12 consecutive months for noncompliance will result in termination of benefits. 



C. Treatment Requirement 



The treatment participation requirement, which now applies only to SSI beneficiaries, will be extended to Social
Security beneficiaries disabled based on DA&A. Additionally, SSA will be required to provide for the monitoring
of progress in treatment. The provision is to be implemented beginning after the effective date with newly adjudicated
cases and Social Security beneficiaries already on the rolls with a primary diagnosis of DA&A and extended to
other applicable beneficiaries as quickly as possible. 



D. Referral and Monitoring Agencies (RMAs) 



Contracts with RMAs are in place in most States as a result of statutory requirements that the Secretary provide for
the monitoring and testing of title XVI DA&A beneficiaries. Pursuant to Public Law 103-296, new RMA contracts
must be established in each State and regulations must be issued which define appropriate treatment and establish
guidelines to be used to review and evaluate compliance and measure progress for individuals disabled based on DA&A.
The new contracts are needed in part because the RMAs will handle additional workloads (i.e., title II beneficiaries)
and will take on additional functions. New regulations are required by the legislation to implement the new program
requirements.

E. Retroactive Benefits


The law requires incremental payment, on a prorated basis, of retroactive Social Security and SSI benefits to individuals
disabled based on DA&A, with a limited exception for those who have outstanding debts related to housing and are
at high risk of homelessness. Retroactive benefits due an individual whose entitlement terminates will continue
in prorated amounts until they are fully paid. No retroactive payments will be made in periods of suspension for noncompliance
with treatment requirements. In addition, if a beneficiary dies without having received all retroactive benefits,
the unpaid amount is treated like any other underpayment. 


IV. Policy Questions 


The statutory provisions regarding nonpayment and termination of benefits present many novel policy issues. SSA
has made separate contacts with DA&A treatment professionals to obtain views on issues of treatment, compliance
and monitoring. In addition, SSA is facing many operational issues in terms of putting the processes and systems in
place to implement these provisions. This request for public comments is focused on the policy issues which, in our
opinion, have a broad public import, and on which SSA will benefit from receiving a wide range of public views. 
The questions which follow may necessitate different responses depending on whether the answer relates to alcoholism
or to different types of drug addiction. SSA requests that commenters identify to which type(s) of addiction a particular
response applies. Public comments are requested on the following policy issues: 


A. Defining Appropriate Treatment 


The new legislation requires that individuals disabled based on DA&A undergo appropriate substance abuse treatment.
Currently, there are no specific guidelines in the regulations which define ``appropriate treatment.'' HHS defines
``appropriate treatment'' at  416.937 for SSI cases as ``recognized medical or other professional procedures
for treatment of drug addiction or alcoholism which is carried out at or under the supervision of, an approved institution
or facility (or facilities). This treatment may include_ (a) Medical examination and treatment; (b) Psychiatric,
psychological and vocational counselling; or (c) Other appropriate services for drug addiction or alcoholism.''
Instead of requiring the use of specific regulatory guidelines, SSA has directed employees of treatment facilities
or of RMAs under contract with SSA to make judgments in determining appropriate treatment. 

SSA is considering adopting a policy defining ``appropriate substance abuse treatment'' for individuals disabled
based on DA&A in general terms under which SSA would continue to rely on the judgments of treatment professionals.
For example, a general definition of appropriate treatment could refer to substance abuse treatment which serves
the need of the individuals in the least restrictive setting. Accordingly, appropriate treatment would be determined
on the basis of a comprehensive assessment in which each individual's needs are defined and compliance with such individualized
treatment would be overseen by an approved institution or facility as defined in regulations. SSA may also incorporate
the examples from our current regulations cited above. 


Questions: 

What is considered ``appropriate'' substance abuse treatment? What factors should be considered in placing an individual
in treatment? What ranges of treatment modalities fall within an appropriate treatment spectrum for the most common
types of substance abuse problems? Recognizing that some individuals may abuse more than one substance, how should
``appropriate treatment'' be defined when there is more than one substance involved? With the objective of placing
as many clients as possible in appropriate treatment, how should the parameters of appropriate treatment be defined,
i.e., what would be the circumstances under which the client would not benefit from treatment? Should the regulations
refer generally to individual assessments being made by professionals or should specific treatment guidelines
be included? 




B. Availability of Treatment 


The legislation requires the disabled individual to undergo treatment which is ``available'' but does not define
the term. The current substance abuse treatment requirements are applicable only to title XVI beneficiaries, and
not to title II beneficiaries. The current regulations at  416.939 provide guidance on when treatment for DA&A
is considered available for title XVI beneficiaries. Generally, SSA determines whether treatment is available
based on: obtaining a treatment vacancy at no cost to the individual; the location of the facility; availability and
cost of transportation to the individual; the individual's general health; the individual's particular condition
and circumstances; and, the treatment that is required.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941017-1-00041 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941017-1-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

SSA is considering the adoption of the same guidelines for determining the availability of treatment to title II and
title XVI beneficiaries. However, we would like to receive any comments on whether these guidelines are adequate
or if other factors should be considered. 
Questions: 

How should SSA define available substance abuse treatment? Should availability take into consideration the client's
access to transportation, education, familial situation and/or health? What other factors should be considered,
if any? Should clients seeking readmission to treatment after a period of noncompliance be given priority for a treatment
slot over other clients awaiting initial intake into treatment? 




C. Defining and Measuring Progress 


Currently, SSA has no rules for defining and measuring progress expected to be achieved by participants in treatment
programs. The law requires that such regulations be developed in establishing guidelines used to review and evaluate
compliance with treatment. Treatment professionals may have differing views and opinions on defining and measuring
progress. Progress is related to compliance. Currently, providers determine treatment and measures of progress.
The difficult task for SSA is to determine to what extent it can be externally validated. SSA is considering defining
parameters of progress as clinical measures, such as attendance, participation in activities, changes in physical
and mental limitations, degree of abstinence, drug testing results, attitude, cooperation, mental/psychological
status and instances of relapse. 
Questions: 

What constitutes progress in substance abuse treatment? What are the most effective and reliable means of measuring
progress in substance abuse treatment? How can these be quantified and reported regularly in a cost-effective mode?
What methods currently exist for validating progress with treatment? 


D. Evaluating Compliance With Treatment 


Currently, there are no specific guidelines in the regulations to evaluate beneficiaries' compliance with the treatment
requirements. Determinations on compliance generally have been based on judgments made by employees of the treatment
facilities or of the RMAs under contract with SSA. The statute requires that the Secretary issue regulations establishing
guidelines for evaluating whether individuals entitled to benefits based on DA&A are in compliance and progressing
with treatment requirements. 
There are a wide range of issues that pertain to evaluating compliance with treatment, including views on how to define
success within a treatment modality. For example, some believe that individuals can be expected to undergo periods
of drug or alcohol use even though they are following a treatment plan in large part. 


Questions: 

What are the factors we should use to evaluate compliance with substance abuse treatment? How should a relapse be treated
or evaluated for purposes of compliance? Are there varying degrees of relapse which may or may not indicate noncompliance?
While one isolated incident may not be defined as noncompliance, what number of ``second chances'' should be provided?
Should positive drug or alcohol tests be used as a tool to measure compliance? If yes, how, i.e., a single test, a certain
number of tests, or tests in conjunction with other indicators? If other indicators should be factored in, what are
those indicators? How reliable are these tests? Are there other types of testing or criteria that could be used to monitor
compliance with the substance abuse treatment requirements? How frequently should testing be done? What are the
customary and reasonable charges for testing? How and by whom are test specimens (blood, urine, breath) collect
