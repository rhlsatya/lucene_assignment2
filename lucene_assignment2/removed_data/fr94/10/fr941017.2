<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice affirms the announcement made on September 29, 1994 by the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) that marketing
allotments have been established for sugar and crystalline fructose for fiscal year 1995. The overall allotment
quantity for sugar is 7,889 thousand short tons (TST). The beet sugar allotment is 4,355.5 TST (55.2 percent), and
the cane sugar allotment is 3,533.5 TST (44.8 percent). State cane sugar allotments and individual sugar beet and
sugarcane processor allocations are provided in this notice. The marketing allotment for crystalline fructose
is 159,757 short tons.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



Throughout its history the United States has been a net importer of sugar. In order to support the domestic production
of sugar beets and sugarcane, Congress has mandated, continuously since 1981, that the CCC provide price support
for domestically produced sugar beets and sugarcane. CCC has provided such price support by making nonrecourse loans
available, at minimum levels prescribed by Congress, to sugar beet and sugarcane processors in accordance with the
provisions of the Agricultural Act of 1949, as amended (the ``1949 Act'') (

See 

7 U.S.C.  1446g). In order to receive a price-support loan, an eligible processor must agree to pay not less than
the minimum price-support levels specified by the CCC to all producers who deliver sugar beets or sugarcane to such
processor for processing. During fiscal year 1994, three sugar beet processors declined to participate in the price-support
loan program, in part to avoid the minimum grower payment requirements, and two other sugar beet processors defaulted
on price-support loans, resulting in 13,950 short tons of sugar pledged as loan collateral being forfeited to the
CCC. 

The national average loan rates for the 1994 crop year (i.e., July 1, 1994 through June 30, 1995) have not yet been published
but are expected to be the minimum rates allowed by statute. The loan rate for raw cane sugar is expected to remain at
18 cents per pound, and the loan rate for refined beet sugar is expected to increase, under the statutory formula, by
up to 40 points from the 23.62 cents per pound loan rate for the 1993 crop year. The increase of the beet sugar loan rate
means that market prices will have to increase correspondingly in order to avoid risks of price-support loan defaults
and the forfeiture of sugar collateral in fiscal year 1995. Since the minimum grower payments are a function of the
loan rate, an increase in the loan rate also increases pro rata the minimum grower payment levels. Without an increase
of refined sugar prices, more sugar beet processors may elect not to participate in the price-support program, thereby
undermining the purpose of the program to support the prices received by sugar beet growers. 

Section 902(a) of the Food Security Act of 1985 (the ``1985 Act'') requires that the President ``use all authorities
available to the President as is necessary to enable the Secretary of Agriculture to operate the sugar program established
under section 206 of the Agricultural Act of 1949 at no cost to the Federal government by preventing the accumulation
of sugar acquired by the Commodity Credit Corporation.'' Since the price-support levels mandated by Congress generally
are substantially above world market prices, import restrictions have been primarily relied upon to maintain the
domestic price-support program at no cost to the Federal government. Currently, additional U.S. note 3(a) to chapter
17 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to determine
the total amount of sugars, syrups, and molasses that may be entered at the low tier of tariffs under an import tariff-rate
quota which effectively limits sugar imports. 

Prior to enactment of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 (the ``1990 Farm Act''), the only
mechanism available to the Secretary to regulate the domestic price of sugar was the tariff-rate quota. But the continued
use of a restrictive quota had a devastating effect on U.S. cane sugar refiners and the economies of exporting countries.
To alleviate these negative effects, the 1990 Farm Act provided the Secretary of Agriculture with authority to establish
domestic marketing allotments in order to maintain the price of domestic sugar without reducing imports below the
minimum level_1.25 million short tons, raw value_deemed needed to allow refineries to continue efficient operations.
On August 6, 1994, the Secretary of Agriculture modified the existing tariff-rate quota period for imports, from
the period October 1, 1992 through September 30, 1994 to the period October 1, 1992 through July 31, 1994, and announced
a new quota period from August 1, 1994 through September 30, 1995 and a total quota amount of 1,322,978 metric tons,
raw value (1,458,333 short tons). Effectively, this action means a monthly average of quota imports that will total
1.25 million short tons in FY 1995.

Establishment of Marketing Allotments 



The Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, as amended (the ``1938 Act''), requires that, before the beginning of a fiscal
year, the Secretary shall determine if marketing allotments for the fiscal year for sugar processed from domestically
produced sugar beets or sugarcane must be established based on estimates of consumption, reasonable ending stocks,
beginning stocks, and production. Specifically, section 359b(a)(1) of the 1938 Act requires that the Secretary
make estimates of the following: 

(1) the quantity of sugar that will be consumed in the United States during the fiscal year (other than sugar imported
for the production of polyhydric alcohol or to be refined and reexported in refined form or in sugar containing products)
and the quantity of sugar that would provide for reasonable carryover stocks; 

(2) the quantity of sugar that will be available from carry-in stocks or from domestically produced sugarcane and
sugar beets for consumption in the United States during the year; and 

(3) the quantity of sugar that will be imported for consumption in the United States during the year (other than sugar
imported for the production of polyhydric alcohol or to be refined and reexported in refined form or in sugar-containing
products), based on the difference between the sum of the quantity of estimated consumption and reasonable carryover
stocks and the quantity of sugar estimated to be available from domestically produced sugarcane and sugar beets and
from carry-in stocks. 

Section 359b(b)(1) of the 1938 Act provides for the establishment of marketing allotments for domestically processed
sugar for a fiscal year, if imports of sugar, based upon these estimates, will be less than 1,250,000 short tons, raw
value. 

The estimate of the quantity of sugar that ``would provide for reasonable carryover stocks'' differs from the estimates
of production, consumption, and beginning stocks and from the estimate of actual ending stocks, which are conventional
predictions of supply and use parameters, in that it is not a straightforward estimate of the quantity of sugar that
actually will be carried over at the end of the fiscal year. By contrast, the estimate of ``reasonable'' ending stocks
is a policy determination of the quantity of unrestrained stocks that is expected to result in market prices at least
high enough to achieve the goals of the no-cost price-support program for sugar beets and sugarcane. Accordingly,
the level of ending stocks which would be ``reasonable'' must reflect that quantity that is necessary to achieve the
price-support objectives of section 206 of the 1949 Act as well as the ``no cost'' mandate of section 902(a) of the 1985
Act, without reducing import access below 1.25 million short tons. 

Similarly, the estimate of imports is not an estimate of the quantity of sugar expected to actually be entered into
the U.S. customs territory during the fiscal year but rather the level of imports that would be required to achieve
the determined quantity of reasonable ending stocks, based upon the statutory formula. Accordingly, the import
estimate indicates whether, in the absence of domestic marketing allotments, the Secretary would be required to
reduce the tariff-rate quota amount to a quantity less than 1.25 million short tons in order to achieve the desired
level of reasonable ending stocks for maintaining the price-support program at no cost. 



Estimates of Sugar Consumption, Stocks, Production, and Imports for Fiscal Year 1995 



Pursuant to section 359b(a)(1) of the 1938 Act, the Secretary has estimated the quantities of sugar consumption,
stocks, production, and imports in the United States (including Puerto Rico) for fiscal year 1995 as follows:

<PARENT> FR941017-2-00001 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The current situation and outlook for sugar in fiscal year 1995 indicates that the probability of forfeiture of sugar
pledged as collateral for price-support loans would be high without allotments, because estimated actual ending
stocks are high and refined beet sugar prices, which softened in mid-September, were likely to fall further without
allotments. Marketing allotments are expected to raise market prices to levels which will provide effective price
support and avoid costs to the Federal Government. Any level of ending stocks at or above 1,279 TST determined to be
``reasonable'' would not trigger marketing allotments and would very likely leave market prices depressed at levels
that would result in not achieving the price-support objectives and cause forfeitures of sugar held as collateral
under the price-support loan program. A determination of reasonable ending stocks of less than 1,279 TST would trigger
marketing allotments, which would have the effect of raising sugar prices by reducing marketings of sugar in fiscal
year 1995. Therefore, a level of unrestrained ending stocks of 1,278 TST would be reasonable in light of the objectives
of the sugar program of assuring an adequate supply of sugar to the U.S. market while supporting domestic sugar beet
and sugarcane growers and also avoiding costs to the Federal Government. Accordingly, the quantity of sugar needed
to be imported into the United States during the fiscal year in order to achieve such level of ending stocks would be
less than 1.25 million short tons, raw value, in the absence of domestic marketing allotments.


Establishment of Marketing Allotments for Crystalline Fructose


Section 359b(c) of the 1938 Act provides that for any fiscal year in which sugar marketing allotments are established,
the Secretary shall establish allotments for the marketing by manufacturers of crystalline fructose manufactured
from corn, at a total level not to exceed the equivalent of 200,000 tons of sugar, raw value, during the fiscal year.


Overall Allotment Quantity


Section 359c(b) of the 1938 Act provides that the Secretary shall establish the overall allotment quantity of sugar
by deducting from the sum of the estimated sugar consumption and reasonable carryover stocks for the fiscal year (1)
1,250,000 short tons, raw value and (2) carry-in stocks of sugar. This formula yields an overall allotment quantity
for sugar of 7,889 TST, calculated as follows:



9,247 (consumption) + 1,278 (reasonable carry-over stocks) ^ 1,386 (carry-in stocks) ^ 1,250 = 7,889.


Beet Sugar and Cane Sugar Allotments


Pursuant to sections 359c (c) and (d) of the 1938 Act, the Secretary must establish overall beet sugar and cane sugar
allotments by using percentage factors established in a fair and equitable manner on the basis of past marketings
of sugar, processing and refining capacity, and the ability of processors to market the sugar covered under the allotments.
Section 359c(f) of the 1938 Act provides that the cane sugar allotment shall be further allotted among the 5 States
in the United States in which sugarcane is produced (i.e., Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, Puerto Rico, and Texas) in
a fair and equitable manner on the basis of past marketings of sugar, processing capacity, and the ability of processors
to market the sugar covered under the allotments. Section 359d(a) of the 1938 Act provides for the allocation among
processors of the State cane sugar allotments and the beet sugar allotment after such hearing and on such notice as
the Secretary by regulation may prescribe, in such manner and in such quantities as to provide a fair, efficient, and
equitable distribution of the allocations by taking into consideration processing capacity, past marketings of
sugar, and the ability of each processor to market sugar covered by that portion of the allotment allocated to it. For
purposes of these divisions of the overall allotment quantity, past marketings are based on the 1985-1989 crops,
processing or refining capacity is defined as the highest crop year production of the previous 5 years, and ability
to market is defined as the current crop year production estimate.

The 1938 Act is silent on the specific weights that should be assigned to each factor but directs that the allotments
and allocations should result in fairness, efficiency, and equity. CCC regulations governing the marketing allotments
provide for the three factors to be weighted equally or as determined appropriate by CCC for the fiscal year. Equal
weights were assigned to each of the factors when allotments were instituted in FY 1993. However, experience gained
during the administration of the FY 1993 allotment program made it clear that the use of equal factor weights could
result in a disproportionate share of the negative impacts of allotments being placed on a relatively few processors,
while other processors who were also expanding production would incur little or no negative impact. Due to this disparate
impact, the allotments in FY 1993 also resulted in an increase in refined sugar prices to levels in excess of those needed
to achieve the price support and no-cost objectives of the sugar program. This experience indicated that CCC should
adjust the weighting of the three factors in light of the data available in order to achieve the statutory goals of fairness,
efficiency, and equity in allocating market shares and to avoid driving prices for consumers and industrial users
to excessive levels. The Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) have also
suggested that the factors be weighted differently (e.g., weights of 10 percent for past marketings, 30 percent for
processing capacity, and 60 percent for ability to market), based on the premise that sugar delivered to the market
by the most efficient processors will result in the lowest prices for users and consumers.
The use of equal factor weights for FY 1995 would again restrain marketings by rather few processors and would be inappropriate
to ensure a fair, efficient, and equitable sharing of both the burden and benefits of marketing allotments. Equal
factor weighting would also be likely to have a much greater price impact than necessary to achieve price-support
objectives. CCC has determined that it would be most appropriate, given the relevant statutory purposes and the expected
market impact, to provide greater weight on ability to market (50 percent versus 33.3 percent) and less weight on past
marketings (25 percent) and processing or refining capacity (25 percent). The estimated restraint on beet sugar
marketings would decrease from approximately 195,000 tons, under an equal weighting scheme, to 144,000 tons. Constraining
marketings by this amount is expected to have the necessary price impact to deter forfeitures and sufficiently support
sugar beet prices while not contributing unnecessarily to inflation and not unduly restraining a small segment of
the industry.

Establishment of Proportionate Shares


Section 359f(b) of the 1938 Act provides that whenever a State cane sugar allotment is established and there are in
excess of 250 sugarcane producers in such State, other than Puerto Rico, the Secretary is required to determine, for
each such State allotment, whether the production of sugar, in the absence of proportionate shares, will be greater
than the quantity needed to enable processors to fill the State's allotment and provide a normal carryover inventory,
and, if so, establish proportionate shares for the crop of sugarcane that is harvested during the fiscal year the allotment
is in effect. There are in excess of 250 sugarcane producers in Louisiana, and the production of sugar, in the absence
of proportionate shares, is estimated to be greater than the quantity needed to enable processors to fill the State's
allotment and provide a normal carryover inventory. Accordingly, proportionate shares must be established for
sugarcane farms in Louisiana.


Notice


Pursuant to sections 359b(b)(1) and 359b(c) of the 1938 Act, the Secretary of Agriculture has established allotments
for the marketing of sugar processed from domestically produced sugar beets or sugarcane and crystalline fructose
produced from field corn during fiscal year 1995. In addition, the Secretary has made the following determinations:
1. The September 1994 estimate of the quantities of sugar consumption, stocks, production, and imports in the United
States (including Puerto Rico) for fiscal year 1995 is as follows:






2. The overall allotment quantity for sugar is 7,889 TST.
3. The percentage factors for the beet sugar and raw cane sugar allotments are 55.2 percent and 44.8 percent, respectively.
The Secretary established the percentage factors for the beet sugar and cane sugar allotments on the basis of past
marketings of sugar (defined as the average of marketings of sugar from the 1985 through 1989 crops, excluding the
highest and lowest years), processing and refining capacity (defined as the highest year's production in the preceding
5 crop years), and the ability of processors to market the sugar covered under the allotments (defined as the crop-year
production estimate for the fiscal year in which allotments are implemented). In order to make the percentage factors
fair, equitable, and efficient, the three criteria were weighted 25 percent for past marketings, 25 percent for processing
and refining capacity, and 50 percent for ability to market. The data used to determine the percentage factors are
as follows:

4. The beet sugar allotment is 4,355.5 TST.
5. The cane sugar allotment is 3,533.5 TST.
6. The State cane sugar allotments are:






7. Proposed marketing allocations for fiscal year 1995 for domestically produced beet sugar and raw cane sugar by
U.S. sugar beet processors and sugarcane processors are as follows:






8. The overall allotment in fiscal year 1995 for the marketing of crystalline fructose manufactured from corn is 159,757
short tons. Allotments will be established for the two U.S. manufacturers of crystalline fructose, and they will
be notified of such allotments by certified mail.
9. There are in excess of 250 sugarcane producers in Louisiana, and the production of sugar, in the absence of proportionate
shares, is estimated to be greater than the quantity needed to enable processors to fill the State's allotment and
provide a normal carryover inventory. Therefore, as required the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, as amended,
proportionate shares on acreage of sugarcane that may be harvested in Louisiana for sugar or seed are established
for the 1994 crop of sugarcane, in an amount equal to 108.57 percent of each farm's sugar acreage base.

Discussion of the 1995 Census Test Service-Based Enumeration Operation; Notice of Public Meeting 



The Census Bureau is giving notice of a meeting to provide information about the ``Service-Based Enumeration Operation''
planned for the 1995 Census Test. The meeting will convene on October 31, 1994, at 9 a.m. and will adjourn at 11 a.m. This
meeting will be held at the Census Bureau, Conference Center, Federal Building 3, Suitland, Maryland. 

The 1995 Census Test is a continuation of the Census Bureau's research on fundamental changes to reduce the differential
undercount from the 1990 census and to contain the cost of the census. The 1995 Census Test will include operations
to count people in housing units and in group quarters (such as nursing facilities and college dormitories), and at
selected locations that provide services to homeless and needy people. The Census Bureau plans to conduct a test of
the feasibility of enumerating people at locations that provide services to homeless and needy people, such as shelters
and soup kitchens. Beginning March 1995, Oakland, California; Paterson, New Jersey; and six parishes in northwest
Louisiana will be enumerated. This operation is one of the various enumeration methods aimed at improving coverage
in the 2000 census for people likely to be missed by standard enumeration procedures for housing units. 

The Census Bureau will invite representatives from national organizations that represent providers of services
to the homeless population. At the meeting, the Census Bureau will discuss the general purpose of the 1995 Census Test
and will provide details of the Service-Based Enumeration operational activities. This meeting should be of significant
interest to those organizations that are representatives of national and state coalitions on the homeless, involved
with homeless research issues, homeless advocates, service providers, and users of population data from the decennial
census. 

The tentative agenda for the meeting is: (1) Opening Remarks, (2) Overview of the 1995 Census Test, (3) Overview of
the ``Service-Based Enumeration Operation,'' (4) Public Questions, and (5) Closing Remarks. The meeting will be
audio recorded. 

This meeting is open to the public; however, seating is limited. Please contact Sandra Lucas on 301-763-5337
by October 24 if you plan to attend. The meeting is physically accessible to people with disabilities. Requests for
sign language interpretation or other auxiliary aids also should be directed to Sandra Lucas by October 24. 

Persons wishing additional information regarding this meeting, may contact Sandra Lucas, Decennial Management
Division, Bureau of the Census, Room 3561-3, Washington, DC 20233-7100. Telephone: 301-763-5337

<DOCTITLE>National Defense Stockpile Market Impact Committee Request for Public Comments</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Strategic Industries and Economic Security, Bureau of Export Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of request for public comment on the market impact of: (1) proposed disposals of excess commodities currently
held in the National Defense Stockpile under the Fiscal Year 1996 Annual Materials Plan, and (2) revisions to commodities
proposed for disposal under the fiscal Year 1995 Annual Materials Plan. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice is to advise the public that the National Defense Stockpile Market Impact Committee (co-chaired by the
Departments of Commerce and State) is seeking public comment on the market impact of proposed disposals of excess
materials currently held in the National Defense Stockpile.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act of 1979, as amended, (50 U.S.C. 98 

et seq.

) authorizes the maintenance of strategic and critical materials in the National Defense Stockpile ``to decrease
and to preclude, when possible, a dangerous and costly dependence by the United States upon foreign sources of supplies
of such materials in times of national emergency.'' The Department of Defense, as National Defense Stockpile Manager,
may dispose of materials in the stockpile that have previously been authorized for disposal by law and have been determined
to be excess to national security requirements. In managing the stockpile, Defense must protect the United States
against avoidable loss while at the same time ``efforts shall be made * * * to avoid undue disruption
of the usual markets of producers, processors, and consumers of such materials.''

Section 3314 of the Fiscal Year (FY) 1993 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) (50 U.S.C. 98h-1) formally

projected domestic and foreign economic effects of all acquisitions and disposals of materials from the stockpile
* * *.'' the Committee includes representatives from the Departments of Commerce, State, Agriculture,
Defense, Energy, Interior, Treasury and the Federal Emergency Management Agency and is co-chaired by the Departments
of Commerce and State. The NDAA for Fiscal Year 1993 directs the Committee to ``consult from time to time with representatives
of producers, processors and consumers of the types of materials stored in the stockpile.''

It is Defense's intent that the National Defense Stockpile be a dependable, long term source of material. The material
will be sold as close to market prices as the conditions of sale permit (e.g., consideration will be given for the certifiable
quality of the materials being sold, and any appropriate transportation differential). In order to protect the United
States against avoidable loss, Defense intends to exercise restraint regarding the quantities and timing of any
offers of excess materials for sale.

The Committee will soon begin its consideration of Defense's FY 1996 annual Materials Plan (AMP) of proposed disposals
and acquisitions of stockpile materials and will also consider revisions to the FY 1995 AMP. The following, with exceptions
noted, are the materials for which Defense has been granted disposal authority by Congress, and which therefore may
be included in the FY 1996 AMP.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of preliminary results of countervailing duty administrative review.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Commerce has conducted an administrative review of the countervailing duty order on viscose rayon
staple fiber from Sweden. We preliminarily determined the net subsidy to be 0.26 percent 

ad valorem 

for the period January 1, 1991 through December 31, 1991. In accordance with 19 CFR 355.7, any rate less than 0.50 percent


ad valorem 

is 

de minimis

. We invite interested parties to comment on these preliminary results.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background



On May 6, 1992, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of ``Opportunity to Request Administrative Review'' (57 FR 19412) of the countervailing duty order on viscose
rayon staple fiber from Sweden (44 FR 28319; May 15, 1979). Svenska Rayon AB, a producer and exporter of viscose rayon
staple fiber, made a timely request that we conduct an administrative review of the order for the period January 1,
1991 through December 31, 1991. We initiated the review on June 18, 1992 (57 FR 27212). The Department is conducting
this administrative review in accordance with section 751(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act).


Scope of Review



Imports covered by this review are shipments of Swedish regular viscose rayon staple fiber and high-wet modulus (modal)
viscose rayon staple fiber. Such merchandise is classifiable under item number 5504.10.00 of the 

Harmonized Tariff Schedule 

(HTS). The HTS item number is provided for convenience and Customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive.

The review covers the period January 1, 1991 through December 31, 1991, and one program. The only known Swedish producer/exporter
of this merchandise to the United States is Svenska Rayon AB (Svenska).

Analysis of Program




Elderly Employment Compensation Program





The Swedish government provided a subsidy to certain companies within the textile and apparel industries through
a special employment contribution for older workers. This program provided compensation to a company based upon
the number of hours worked by employees over 50 years of age. A company participating in the program had to agree not
to dismiss or release redundant employees of any age for any reason other than normal attrition. Payments were calculated
on the basis of 28 Swedish kroner per hour for employees over age 50 who were involved in production. The payment could
not exceed 15 percent of the company's total labor costs. In prior administrative reviews of this order, this program
was determined to be countervailable because the program was available only to certain companies within the textile
and apparel industry. (

See e.g., Viscose Rayon Staple Fiber From Sweden; Preliminary Results of Countervailing Duty Administrative Review

 (57 FR 6493; February 25, 1992) and 

Viscose Rayon Staple Fiber From Sweden; Final Results of Countervailing Duty Administrative Review

 (57 FR 12912; April 14, 1992)).



Svenska received its last payment under this program in July 1982. In January 1983, the Swedish government excluded
the rayon fiber industry, including Svenska, from this program. We have calculated the benefit stream using the declining
balance methodology. We allocated the benefits from the grant received in 1982 over the 10-year average useful life
of assets in the rayon fiber industry, according to the ``Asset Guideline Classes'' of the Internal Revenue Service.
As in prior reviews of the subject merchandise, we used Svenska's 1982 weighted cost of capital as the discount rate.



We divided the benefit attributable to the review period by the value of Svenska's total revenue during the review
period. On this basis, we preliminarily determine the benefit from this program to be 0.26 percent 

ad valorem.




Preliminary Results of Review





As a result of our review, we preliminarily determine the net subsidy to be 0.26 percent ad valorem

 for the period January 1, 1991 through December 31, 1991. In accordance with 19 CFR 355.7, any rate less than 0.50 percent


ad valorem

 is 

de minimis

.



If the final results of this review remain unchanged from these preliminary results, the Department intends to instruct
the Customs Service to liquidate, without regard to countervailing duties, all shipments of this merchandise exported
on or after January 1, 1991 and on or before December 31, 1991.



Further, upon completion of this review the Department intends to instruct the Customs Service to collect a cash deposit
of estimated countervailing duties of zero, as provided for by section 751(a)(1) of the Act, on all shipments of this
merchandise from Sweden entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication
of the final results of this administrative review.



Parties to the proceeding may request disclosure of the calculation methodology. Interested parties may request
a hearing not later than 10 days after the date of publication of this notice. Interested parties may submit written
arguments in case briefs on these preliminary results within 30 days of the date of publication. Rebuttal briefs,
limited to arguments raised in case briefs, may be submitted seven days after the time limit for filing the case brief.
Any hearing, if requested, will be held seven days after the scheduled date for submission of rebuttal briefs. Copies
of case briefs and rebuttal briefs must be served on interested parties in accordance with 19 C.F.R. 355.38(e).



Representatives of parties to the proceeding may request disclosure of proprietary information under administrative
protective order no later than 10 days after the representative's client or employer becomes a party to the proceeding,
but in no event later than the date the case briefs, under 19 C.F.R. 355.38(c), are due.



The Department will publish the final results of this administrative review, including the results of its analysis
of issues raised in any case or rebuttal brief or at a hearing.


This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1))
and 19 CFR 355.22.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In accordance with Executive Order 11625 and 15 U.S.C. 1512, the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) is soliciting
competitive applications for its Cleveland, Ohio Minority Business Development Center (MBDC).



The purpose of the MBDC Program is to provide business development services to the minority business community to
help establish and maintain viable minority businesses. To this end, MBDA funds organizations to identify and coordinate
public and private sector resources on behalf of minority individuals and firms; to offer a full range of client services
to minority entrepreneurs; and to serve as a conduit of information and assistance regarding minority business.
The MBDC will provide service in the Cleveland, Ohio Metropolitan Area. The award number of the MBDC will be 05-10-95003-01.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Contingent upon the availability of Federal funds, the cost of performance for the first budget period (12 months)
from April 1, 1995 to March 31, 1996, is estimated at $222,196. The total Federal amount is $188,867 and is composed
of $184,260 plus the Audit Fee amount of $4,607. The application must include a minimum cost share 15% $33,329 in non-federal
(cost-sharing) contributions for a total project cost of $222,196. Cost-sharing contributions may be in the form
of cash, client fees, third party in-kind contributions, non-cash applicant contributions or combinations thereof.




The funding instrument for this project will be a cooperative agreement. Competition is open to individuals, non-profit
and for-profit organizations, state and local governments, American Indian tribes and educational institutions.

Applications will be evaluated on the following criteria: the knowledge, background and/or capabilities of the
firm and its staff in addressing the needs of the business community in general and, specifically, the special needs
of minority businesses, individuals and organizations (45 points), the resources available to the firm in providing
business development services (10 points); the firm's approach (techniques and methodologies) to performing the
work requirements included in the application (25 points); and the firm's estimated cost for providing such assistance
(20 points). An application must receive at least 70% of the points assigned to each evaluation criteria category
to be considered programmatically acceptable and responsive. Those applications determined to be acceptable and
responsive will then be evaluated by the Director of MBDA. Final award selections shall be based on the number of points
received, the demonstrated responsibility of the applicant, and the determination of those most likely to further
the purpose of the MBDA program. Negative audit findings and recommendations and unsatisfactory performance under
prior Federal awards may result in an application not being considered for award. The applicant with the highest point
score will not necessarily receive the award. Periodic reviews culminating in year-to-date evaluations will be
conducted to determine if funding for the project should continue. Continued funding will be at the total discretion
of MBDA based on such factors as the MBDC's performance, the availability of funds and Agency priorities.

The MBDC shall be required to contribute at least 15% of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions.
To assist in this effort, the MBDC may charge client fees for services rendered. Fees may range from $10 to $60 per hour
based on the gross receipts of the client's business.

Anticipated processing time of this award is 120 days. Executive order 12372, ``Intergovernmental Review of Federal
Programs,'' is not applicable to this program. Federal funds for this project include audit funds for non-CPA recipients.
In event that a CPA firm wins the competition, the funds allocated for audits are not applicable. Questions concerning
the preceding information can be answered by the contact person indicated above, and copies of application kits and
applicable regulations can be obtained at the above address. The collection of information requirements for this
project have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and assigned OMB control number 0640-0006.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Contingent upon the availability of Federal funds, the cost of performance for the first budget period (12 months)
from April 1, 1995 to March 31, 1996, is estimated at $198,971. The total Federal amount is $169,125 and is composed
of $165,000 plus the Audit Fee amount of $4,125. The application must include a minimum cost share 15% $29,846 in non-Federal
(cost-sharing) contributions for a total project cost of $198,971. Cost-sharing contributions may be in the form
of cash, client fees, third party in-kind contributions, non-cash applicant contributions or combinations thereof.




The funding instrument for this project will be a cooperative agreement. Competition is open to individuals, non-profit
and for-profit organizations, state and local governments, American Indian tribes and educational institutions.

Applications will be evaluated on the following criteria: the knowledge, background and/or capabilities of the
firm and its staff in addressing the needs of the business community in general and, specifically, the special needs
of minority businesses, individuals and organizations (45 points), the resources available to the firm in providing
business development services (10 points); the firm's approach (techniques and methodologies) to performing the
work requirements included in the application (25 points); and the firm's estimated cost for providing such assistance
(20 points). An application must receive at least 70% of the points assigned to each evaluation criteria category
to be considered programmatically acceptable and responsive. Those applications determined to be acceptable and
responsive will then be evaluated by the Director of MBDA. Final award selections shall be based on the number of points
received, the demonstrated responsibility of the applicant, and the determination of those most likely to further
the purpose of the MBDA program. Negative audit findings and recommendations and unsatisfactory performance under
prior Federal awards may result in an application not being considered for award. The applicant with the highest point
score will not necessarily receive the award. Periodic reviews culminating in year-to-date evaluations will be
conducted to determine if funding for the project should continue. Continued funding will be at the total discretion
of MBDA based on such factors as the MBDC's performance, the availability of funds and Agency priorities.

The MBDC shall be required to contribute at least 15% of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions.
to assist in this effort, the MBDC may charge client fees for services rendered. Fees may range from $10 to $60 per hour
based on the gross receipts of the client's business.

Anticipated processing time of this award is 120 days. Executive order 12372, ``Intergovernmental Review of Federal
Programs,'' is not applicable to this program. Federal funds for this project include audit funds for non-CPA recipients.
In event that a CPA firm wins the competition, the funds allocated for audits are not applicable. Questions concerning
the preceding information can be answered by the contact person indicated above, and copies of application kits and
applicable regulations can be obtained at the above address. The collection of information requirements for this
project have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and assigned OMB control number 0640-0006.

Awards under this program shall be subject to all Federal laws, and Federal and Departmental regulations, policies,
and procedures applicable to Federal financial assistance awards.



Pre-Award Costs.

_Applicants are hereby notified that if they incur any costs prior to an award being made, they do so solely at their
own risk of not being reimbursed by the Government. Notwithstanding any verbal assurance that an applicant may have
received, there is no obligation on the part of the Department of Commerce to cover pre-award costs.



Outstanding Account Receivable.

_No award of Federal funds shall be made to an applicant who has an outstanding delinquent Federal debt until either
the delinquent account is paid in full, repayment schedule is established and at least one payment is received, or
other arrangements satisfactory to the Department of Commerce are made.



Name Check Policy

._All non-profit and for-profit applicants are subject to a name check review process. Name checks are intended to
reveal if any key individuals associated with the applicant have been convicted of or are presently facing criminal
charges such as fraud, theft, perjury or other matters which significantly reflect on the applicant's management
honesty of financial integrity.



Award Termination

._The Departmental Grants Officer may terminate any grant/cooperative agreement in whole or in part at any time before
the date of completion whenever it is determined that the award recipient has failed to comply with the conditions
of the grant/cooperative agreement. Examples of some of the conditions which can cause termination are failure to
meet cost-sharing requirements; unsatisfactory performance of the MBDC work requirements; and reporting inaccurate
or inflated claims of client assistance. Such inaccurate or inflated claims may be deemed illegal and punishable
by law.



False Statements.

_A false statement on an application for Federal financial assistance is grounds for denial or termination of funds,
and grounds for possible punishment by a fine or imprisonment as provided in 18 U.S.C. 1001.



Primary Applicant Certifications.

_All primary applicants must submit a completed Form CD-511, ``Certifications Regarding Debarment, Suspension
and Other Responsibility Matters; Drug-Free Workplace Requirements and Lobbying.''

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Working Group on Intellectual Property Rights of the White House Information Infrastructure Task Force (IITF)
is sponsoring a conference to bring together copyright owner and user interests to develop voluntary guidelines
for fair uses of copyrighted works by and in public libraries and schools. The first meeting of the conference was held
in Washington, DC, on September 21, 1994. Notice of that meeting and other details about the conference were published
at 59 FR 46823 on September 12, 1994. Three subcommittees were formed at the first meeting. Subsequent meetings for
those subcommittees have been scheduled. The meetings are open to the public, limited only by the seating availability
in the room.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Working Group on Intellectual Property Rights, chaired by Assistant Secretary of Commerce and Commissioner
of Patents and Trademarks Bruce A. Lehman, was established as part of the White House Information Infrastructure
Task Force. The Task Force, chaired by Secretary of Commerce Ronald H. Brown, was created to work with Congress and
the private sector to develop comprehensive telecommunications and information policies aimed at articulating
and implementing the Administration's vision for the National Information Infrastructure (NII).


The Working Group on Intellectual Property Rights issued ``Intellectual Property and the National Information
Infrastructure: A Preliminary Draft of the Report of the Working Group on Intellectual Property Rights'' in July
of 1994. The Preliminary Draft represented the Working Group's examination and analysis to date of the intellectual
property implications of the NII, and included the Group's draft findings and recommendations. In the Preliminary
Draft, the Working Group expressed concerns about the applicability of the library, educational use, and fair use
exemptions of the Copyright Act, as well as the voluntary guidelines, for libraries and schools in the NII environment.
The Working Group suggested that at least the guidelines for library and educational use of printed matter and music
that were voluntarily adopted by diverse parties and set out in the House and Conference Reports accompanying the
Copyright Act require modification or elaboration to deal with digital works and on-line services. The Conference
on Fair Use was established to facilitate that process.

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Education.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice postponing publication of section two of the combined application notice for fiscal year 1995. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Secretary postpones publication of section two of the Department's annual combined application notice (CAN)
for fiscal year (FY) 1995. The Secretary takes this action for reasons stated elsewhere in this notice. The postponement
is designed to make the CAN as useful as possible to the educational community and other parties interested in programs
administered by the Department. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On June 10, 1994 the Secretary published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 30190) the first section of the CAN for FY 1995. Included in that document were individual notices inviting applications
for new awards under 65 programs and competitions. These were direct grant and fellowship programs administered
mainly by the Office of Postsecondary Education and the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services.
Since June 10 a number of other programs have published application notices for new awards for FY 1995. 






In the document published on June 10, the Secretary announced the Department's intent to publish a second section
of the CAN for FY 1995 in September, 1994. However, legislation authorizing or reauthorizing many of the Department's
remaining programs has only recently been passed by the Congress. This legislation includes programs administered
by the Office of Bilingual Education and Minority Languages Affairs and the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education,
some programs of the Office of Educational Research and Improvement, and some programs of the Fund for the Improvement
of Postsecondary Education. 



These programs could not publish application notices in September without enacted legislation authorizing the
programs and, in some cases, without necessary implementing regulations or notices of funding priorities. Thus,
the Secretary believes it would be more helpful to the Department's customers to delay publication of the second section
of the CAN until a time when application notices for most of these programs can be published or, at least, listed with
an estimated date for publication. 


In addition to awards under programs affected by reauthorization, awards under some other programs and competitions
are to be governed by new regulations or funding priorities that have not yet been issued in final form. Still other
programs and competitions must delay publication of application notices for FY 1995 pending approval of application
forms by the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. 

The Secretary estimates that publication of section two of the CAN for FY 1995 will take place before the end of 
January 1995. That document will (1) include any individual application notices ready for publication at the time,
(2) reference all application notices for FY 1995 previously announced in the 

Federal Register

, including those contained in section one of the CAN, which was published on June 10, 1994, and (3) give estimated dates
for programs and competitions for which application notices are to be published at a later date. 

In the meantime, the Department will continue to publish individual application notices when they are ready.

Take notice that the following filings have been made with the Commission: 




1. NorAm Gas Transmission Co. 




[Docket No. CP94-267-001]





Take notice that on October 4, 1994, NorAm Gas Transmission Company (NGT), formerly Arkla Energy Resources Company,

application filed in Docket CP94-267-000 pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act for authorization
to replace and rearrange existing mainline pipeline, abandon minor storage and gas supply facilities, and make certain
mainline enhancements to its pipeline system in Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas, all as more fully set forth in the
application on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. 



NGT indicates that in its original application, it proposed to install two 2,250 h.p. slow speed reciprocal compressor

certain facilities. Transwestern states that the Amendment incorporates the corrected and revised attachments
to the original application for abandonment, all as more fully set forth in the amendment which is on file with the Commission
and open to public inspection. 



It is stated that in the process of analyzing Transwestern's system in response to the May 27, 1994, series of gathering
orders issued by the Commission and while preparing for further proceedings in Transwestern's refunctionalization
proceeding in Docket No. CP94-254-000, it was discovered that certain field facilities, including compressors,
plants, meters, dehydrators and miscellaneous associated facilities are no longer used and useful or are uneconomical
or otherwise unnecessary for continued operation of the pipeline. Therefore, Transwestern states that it filed
the original abandonment application on August 30, 1994. Transwestern determined that it would be most practical
and efficient to promptly lay the groundwork for the abandonment of said facilities and withdraw them from Transwestern's
refunctionalization proceeding where they had been previously included. Transwestern states that it felt that
this sequencing would avoid the necessity of needlessly determining the facilities primary function when they were,
except for the uneconomical Halley Plant, unused and unuseful. 



After filing the abandonment application, Transwestern states that it was discovered that there were several discrepancies
in the attachments to the application. Transwestern states that the discrepancies have now been corrected and are
the subject of its Amendment. 
Transwestern states that the following is a summary description of the changes made to the application's attachments:




a. 

Text.

 Only one page of text has been amended by the addition of the word ``approximately'' in the fourth line of the second
full paragraph of Section VII. 


b. 

Compression Facilities_Appendix 1. 



Appendix 1, which includes the detail on all of the compressors has been amended as follows: 



i. Summary Sheet. 



The Appendix 1 summary sheet has been amended in that the asterisks which had indicated which of the compressors had
also been included in the refunctionalization filing in Docket No. CP94-254-000 have been removed. The
asterisks have been removed because Transwestern states that it has determined that, in fact, knowing which of the
facilities in the abandonment filing are included in the refunctionalization filing is a meaningless exercise;
the original refunctionalization filing made on February 25, 1994 only included those facilities for which Transwestern
requested a changed functionalization. Therefore, multiple facilities which Transwestern included in the abandonment
proceeding were not included in the refunctionalization proceeding because no change in functionalization was
requested. Transwestern states that realistically, the primary function that a facility had when it was active is
irrelevant to a determination of whether it is in fact now used and useful. Transwestern states that it has concluded
that the asterisks have created more confusion than necessary and that the application for abandonment would be more
meaningful without them. 



The system numbers for the Reger Stuart No. 726, the A.R. King No. 721, the Kemnitz Nos. 864 and 884 have been corrected.




The line segment numbers have been corrected for the Hoeppner No. 854, Meier Cruise No. 813, A.R. King No. 721, W. Waha
No. 749 and the Pecos River No. 839 compressors. 



Additionally, it is stated that the original cost has been corrected for all of the compressors but the Reger Stuart
No. 726, the Meier Cruise No. 813, the W. Waha No. 749 and the Monument No. 811 compressors. These corrections have been
made due to the fact that the database from which the data was originally retrieved has been scrubbed in order to formulate
Appendixes A and B of the refunctionalization data response, a process that had not been performed when this abandonment
was originally filed. Finally, a cost total has been added to the table. 



ii. Individual Compressor Data Sheets. 



All of the compressor data sheets behind the summary sheet have been amended by the removal of line 4 which indicated
whether the compressor had been included in the refunctionalization proceeding. Additionally, the original cost
figures have been changed for all of the compressors except the Reger Stuart No. 726, the Meier Cruise No. 813, the W.
Waha No. 749 and the Monument No. 811 compressors. Finally, Page 14, line 7 has been amended so that on in service date
of 1969 is reflected. 



c. Plants_Appendix 2. 



i. Summary Sheet. 



The summary sheet in Appendix 2 has been amended to remove the asterisks for those plants included in the refunctionalization
filing. 



The original cost for all of the plants except the Huber Plant has been adjusted to reflect the refinement of the facilities
database as described above. In addition, the cost for the Bell Lake Plant has been revised because two compressors
and an extraneous piece of pipeline were included in the original number in error. Finally, a cost total for the plants
has been added to the summary sheet. 



ii. Individual Plant Data Sheets. 



Line 3 has been deleted on all of the individual plant data sheets to eliminate the cross reference to the refunctionalization
proceeding. The original cost figures have been corrected for each plant except the Huber plant. 



In addition, Transwestern states that its field personnel have compiled more detailed information for each of the
plants included in the abandonment proceeding with regard to estimates of salvage value, removal costs and reclamation
costs. Thus, the entries on lines 12, 13 and 14 on the individual plant data sheets have been amended to reflect a more
individualized estimate. Finally, the entries on the Walton, Keystone and Bell Lake Plants on line 14 have been amended
to reflect that more facilities than originally indicated are excepted from the abandonment filing.

d. Appendix 3_Meters, Dehydrators and Associated Facilities. 

Appendix 3 has been amended to remove the asterisks which had indicated that certain facilities had been included
in the refunctionalization filing. 
Corrections were made to 120 original cost figures, again due to the refinement of the facilities database in connection
with the data responses in Docket No. CP94-254-000. Sixteen line entries were deleted for facilities
which had been improperly included in the appendix, and ten facilities were added which had been improperly excluded
from the appendix. Finally, nine docket numbers contained typographical errors and were corrected. 
e. Exhibit Y_Accounting Treatment of Abandonment. 
As a result of the above corrections and amendments, the entries in Exhibit Y have also changed in Category 1 (Original
Cost of Facilities Proposed to be Abandoned); Category 2 (Cost of Removal); Category 3 (Salvage); Category 4 (Proposed
Entries to Account); Category 6 (Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes); and Category 7 (accrued Current Income Taxes).

5. Questar Pipeline Co. 



[Docket No. CP95-7-000] 



Take notice that on October 5, 1994, Questar Pipeline Company (Questar), 79 South State Street, Salt Lake City, Utah
84111, filed in Docket No. CP95-7-000 an application pursuant to Sections 7(b) and 7(c) of the Natural
Gas Act requesting authority to construct and operate new delivery point metering facilities, requesting an order
for permission and approval to abandon by sale certain transmission and associated facilities and to abandon by removal
certain metering facilities, and submitting a petition for a declaratory order finding that the facilities to be
abandoned by sale will be exempt from Commission jurisdiction under Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act, all as more
fully set forth in the application and petition which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.


Questar requests authority to undertake a number of adjustments and activities on its system which, collectively,
will respond to operating changes on its system which have taken place in the past few years. The proposals give recognition
to operating and functional realities on certain segments of the Questar system. 

Specifically, Questar proposes to construct and operate a new city-gate delivery point (the Little Mountain Gate
Station) within the confines of its existing Little Mountain Pressure Regulating Station. The facilities are to
be comprised of 6 12-inch turbine meter runs, six 20-inch and 24-inch valves, 100 feet of 20-inch and 24-inch yard and
station piping, and telecommunications and appurtenant facilities. The new gate station is designed so that current
operation and delivery service to Questar's local distribution company affiliate, Mountain Fuel Supply Company
(Mountain Fuel) is unchanged. Questar states that the proposed facilities will permit it to consolidate metering,
custody-transfer and pressure-regulating functions presently provided at the Little Mountain Pressure Regulating
Station and the Sunnyside Gas Station (Sunnyside). It is indicated that Sunnyside currently serves as one of Questar's
city-gate custody-transfer points to Mountain Fuel which serves the Wasatch Front area of northern Utah. Questar
asserts that the consolidation of metering, regulating, and operational control activities at Little Mountain
will streamline operations on this segment of Questar's transmission system. 

In conjunction with establishing the Little Mountain Station, Questar proposes to abandon by sale to Mountain Fuel
(a) approximately 5.9 miles (31,175 feet) of its existing 24-inch transmission Main Line No. 2 and approximately
5.9 miles (31,275 feet) of its existing 20-inch transmission Main Line No. 14, (b) non-measurement-related facilities
located at Sunnyside, (c) four intermediate delivery points located between Little Mountain and Sunnyside and (d)
related piping, metering and regulating facilities. In addition, Questar proposes to abandon by removal, valves,
metering, regulating and telemetry equipment, and appurtenant piping located at Sunnyside. Questar asserts that
the abandonment by sale is appropriate because, due to rapidly increasing residential development in the Emigration
Canyon (where the facilities to be abandoned are located), the subject facilities now function more like an extension
of Mountain Fuel's distribution system than an Questar Pipeline's transmission system. Once Questar installs the
Little Mountain Gate Station, the equipment proposed to be removed at Sunnyside will no longer be necessary. 

To consummate and complete the contemplated transfer to Mountain Fuel, Questar requests a declaratory order finding
that the facilities to be sold to and operated by Mountain Fuel, upon transfer and sale, will be local distribution
facilities and operations exempt from the Commission's jurisdiction under Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act. Questar
states that the vase majority of the subject facilities are now surrounded by residential housing and that the three
delivery taps downstream of the Little Mountain station are required by Mountain Fuel to provide exclusively local
distribution service to residential end-use customers. In addition, because of the residential expansion in the
area, Questar has reduced pipeline operating pressures in the vicinity such that the referenced sections of Main
Lines 2 and 14 should be viewed as performing a local distribution function. 

Questar states that the total gross plant investment associated with the facilities proposed to be abandoned (both
by sale and removal) is $1,735,822 with the book value being $1,025,157. The book value of the facilities to be transferred
to Mountain Fuel is $864,069. The cost of the metering facilities proposed to be constructed in approximately $671,000,
which would be financed from company funds on hand. 

Questar does not propose to modify any level of transportation service provided to Mountain Fuel or any other customer.
Nor does Questar propose any change in its authorized rates.

New Hampshire: Adequacy Determination of State/Tribal Municipal Solid Waste Permit Program 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Tentative Determination to Fully Approve the Adequacy of the State of New Hampshire's Municipal Solid Waste
Permitting Program, Public Hearing and Public Comment Period. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Section 4005(c)(1)(B) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended by the Hazardous and Solid
Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984, 42 U.S.C. 6945(c)(1)(B), requires states to develop and implement permit programs
to ensure that municipal solid waste landfills (MSWLFs), which may receive hazardous household waste or small quantity
generator hazardous waste will comply with the revised Federal MSWLF Criteria (40 CFR part 258). RCRA Section 4005(c)(1)(C),
42 U.S.C. 6945(c)(1)(C), requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to determine whether states have adequate
``permit'' programs for MSWLFs, but does not mandate issuance of a rule for such determinations. EPA has drafted and
is in the process of proposing a State/Tribal Implementation Rule (STIR) that will provide procedures by which EPA
will approve, or partially approve, State/Tribal landfill permit programs. The Agency intends to approve adequate
State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs as applications are submitted. Thus, these approvals are not dependent on final
promulgation of the STIR. Prior to promulgation of the STIR, adequacy determinations will be made based on the statutory
authorities and requirements. In addition, States/Tribes may use the draft STIR as an aid in interpreting these requirements.
The Agency believes that early approvals have an important benefit. Approved State/Tribe permit programs provide
for interaction between the State/Tribe and the owner/operator regarding site-specific permit conditions. Only
those owners/operators located in State/Tribes with approved permit programs can use the site-specific flexibilities
provided by 40 CFR part 258 to the extent the State/Tribal permit program allows such flexibility. EPA notes that,
regardless of the approval status of a State/Tribe and the permit status of any facility, the federal landfill criteria
shall apply to all permitted and unpermitted MSWLF facilities. 



The State of New Hampshire has applied for a determination of adequacy under Section 4005(c)(1)(C) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C.
6945(c)(1)(C). EPA Region I has reviewed New Hampshire's MSWLF permit program adequacy application and has made
a tentative determination that all portions of New Hampshire's MSWLF permit program are adequate to assure compliance
with the revised MSWLF Criteria. New Hampshire's application for program adequacy determination is available for
public review and comment at the places listed in the 

ADDRESSES 

section below during regular office hours. 

Although RCRA does not require EPA to hold a public hearing on a determination to approve any State/Tribe's MSWLF permit
program, the Region has tentatively scheduled a public hearing on this determination. If a sufficient number of persons
express interest in participating in a hearing by writing to the Region I Solid Waste Program or calling the contact
given below within 30 days of the date of publication of this notice, the Region will hold a hearing, in Concord, New
Hampshire, on the date given below in the 

DATES

 section. The Region will notify all persons who submit comments on this notice if it appears that there is sufficient
public interest to warrant a hearing. In addition, anyone who wishes to learn whether the hearing will be held may call
the person listed in the ``CONTACTS'' section below.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

A. Background 



On October 9, 1991, EPA promulgated revised Criteria for MSWLFs (40 CFR Part 258). Subtitle D of RCRA, as amended by
the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), requires states to develop permitting programs to ensure
that MSWLFs comply with the Federal Criteria under 40 CFR part 258. Subtitle D also requires in Section 4005(c)(1)(C),
42 U.S.C. 6945(c)(1)(C), that EPA determine the adequacy of state municipal solid waste landfill permit programs
to ensure that facilities comply with the revised Federal Criteria. To fulfill this requirement, the Agency has drafted
and is in the process of proposing a State/Tribal Implementation Rule (STIR). The rule will specify the requirements
which State/Tribal programs must satisfy to be determined adequate. 

The EPA intends to approve State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs prior to the promulgation of STIR. EPA interprets the
requirements for states or tribes to develop ``adequate'' programs for permits or other forms of prior approval and
conditions (for example, license to operate) to impose several minimum requirements. First, each State/Tribe must
have enforceable standards for new and existing MSWLFs that are technically comparable to EPA's revised MSWLF criteria.
Next, the State/Tribe must have the authority to issue a permit or other notice of prior approval and conditions to
all new and existing MSWLFs in its jurisdiction. The State/Tribe also must provide for public participation in permit
issuance and enforcement, as required in Section 7004(b) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6974(b). Finally, the State/Tribe must
show that it has sufficient compliance monitoring and enforcement authorities to take specific action against any
owner or operator that fails to comply with an approved MSWLF program. 

EPA Regions will determine whether a State/Tribe has submitted an ``adequate'' program based on the interpretation
outlined above. EPA plans to provide more specific criteria for this evaluation when it proposes the STIR. EPA expects
States/Tribes to meet all of these requirements for all elements of a MSWLF program before it gives full approval to
a MSWLF program. 



B. State of New Hampshire 



On July 7, 1993, EPA Region I received New Hampshire's final MSWLF Permit Program application for adequacy determination.
Region I reviewed the final application, submitted comments to New Hampshire, and requested additional information
about state program implementation. New Hampshire addressed EPA's comments, provided the requested additional
information, and submitted a revised final application for adequacy determination on August 30, 1994. Region I has
reviewed New Hampshire's revised application and has tentatively determined that all portions of New Hampshire's
MSWLF program meet all the requirements necessary to qualify for full program approval and ensures compliance with
the revised Federal Criteria. 

The public may submit written comments on EPA's tentative determination until November 16, 1994. Copies of New Hampshire's
application are available for inspection and copying at the location indicated in the 

ADDRESSES

 section of this notice. 

The State of New Hampshire's 

Solid Waste Rules 

reflect the dynamic nature of solid waste management by establishing minimum standards to protect human health and
the environment as well as performance-based standards. These requirements are in keeping with the Federal Criteria
for municipal solid waste disposal in that they specify a standard to be achieved and then allow flexibility to achieve
that standard in innovative ways. 

To ensure full compliance with the Federal Criteria, New Hampshire has revised its current MSWLF permitting requirements
by development of the 

Guidance Document for the State Permitting of Municipal Solid Waste Landfills Regulated Under Federal Rules (40
CFR Part 258) in New Hampshire.

 This guidance document has incorporated those requirements from the federal criteria not found in the State's existing
MSWLF program and are applicable to all existing MSWLFs and to all MSWLF permit applications. New Hampshire will implement
its MSWLF permit program through enforceable permit conditions. These new requirements occur in the following areas:


1. The adoption of the following definitions as required by the revised Federal Criteria, 40 CFR 258.2: active life,
active portion, director, household waste, industrial solid waste, owner, saturated zone, sludge, solid waste,
state, state director, and waste management unit boundary. 

2. Compliance with the new location restrictions of 40 CFR 258.10, 258.11. 258.12, 258.13, 258.14, 258.15, and 258.16,
which pertain to airport safety, floodplains, wetlands, fault areas, seismic impact zones, unstable areas and closure
of existing MSWLF units.

<PARENT> FR941017-2-00021 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

3. Compliance with the new operating criteria of 40 CFR 288.20, 258.21, 258.23, 258.24, 258.28, 258.29, which pertain
to excluding the receipt of hazardous waste, cover material requirements, explosive gases control, air criteria,
liquid restrictions, and record keeping requirements. 

4. Compliance with the design criteria of 40 CFR 258.40. 

5. Compliance with the ground-water monitoring and corrective action requirements of 40 CFR 258.53, 258.54, 258.55,
258.56, 258.57, and 258.58, which pertain to groundwater sampling and analysis requirements, detection monitoring,
assessment monitoring, assessment of corrective measures, selection of remedy, and implementation of the corrective
action program. 

6. Compliance with the closure and post-closure criteria of 258.60 and 258.61. 

7. Compliance with the financial assurance criteria of 40 CFR 258.70, 258.71, 258.72, 258.73, and 258.74, which pertain
to applicability and effective date, financial assurance for closure, financial assurance for post-closure care,
financial assurance for corrective action, and allowable mechanisms. 

New Hampshire's Department of Environmental Services requires all existing MSWLFs to have either an existing permit
or a temporary permit, both of which require compliance with the Federal Criteria in 40 CFR Part 258 pursuant to state
laws and regulations, found at New Hampshire Revised Statutes Annotated Chapter 149-M:11 and New Hampshire
Code of Administrative Rules Env-Wm 308.03. The State of New Hampshire is not asserting jurisdiction over Indian
land recognized by the United States government for the purpose of this notice. Tribes recognized by the United States
government are also required to comply with the terms and conditions found at 40 CFR Part 258. 

The State of New Hampshire is committed to implementing its MSWLF program in accordance with the principles of environmental
justice. The State has expressed this commitment in the narrative portion of its application. 

EPA will consider all public comments on its tentative determination received during the public comment period and
during any public hearing held. Issues raised by those comments may be the basis for a determination of inadequacy
for New Hampshire's program. EPA will make a final decision on approval of the State of New Hampshire's program and
will give notice of the final determination in the 

Federal Register

. The notice shall include a summary of the reasons for the final determination and a response to all significant comments.


Section 4005(a) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6945(a), provides that citizens may use the citizen suit provisions of Section
7002 of RCRA, 42 USC 6972, to enforce the Federal Criteria in 40 CFR part 258 independent of any State/Tribal enforcement
program. As EPA explained in the preamble to the final MSWLF criteria, EPA expects that any owner or operator complying
with provisions in a State/Tribal program approved by EPA should be considered to be in compliance with the Federal
Criteria. See, 56 FR 50978, 50995 (October 9, 1991).



Compliance With Executive Order 12866 



The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this notice from the requirements of Section 6 of Executive Order
12866. 



Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act 



Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this approval will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This notice,
therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis. 






Authority: 

This notice is issued under the authority of Section 4005 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 6946.

Federal Communications Commission




OMB Control No.:

 3060-0600


Title:

 Implementation of Section 309(j) of the Communications Act, Competitive Bidding, Second Report and Order and Second
Memorandum Opinion and Order_PP Docket No. 93-253.


Form Nos.:

 FCC Forms 175, 175-S 


Expiration Date:

 05/31/97


Estimated Annual Burden:

 100,925 total hours; .25-20 hours per response; 13,400 respondents.


Description:

 In the Second Memorandum Opinion and Order in PP Docket No. 93-253, the Commission modified and supplemented
several of its generic rules governing the auctioning of all licenses subject to competitive bidding. For example,
the Commission will permit applicants to participate in auctions where the applicant certifies that a request for
a waiver or declaratory ruling concerning the requirements of Section 310 is pending. The Commission modified its
collusion rules to permit bidders who have not filed Form 175 applications for any of the same licenses to engage in
discussions and enter into bidding consortia or joint bidding arrangements during the course of the auction. The
Commission established detailed standard affiliation rules for determining all size-based eligibility requirements.
The affiliation requirements are intended to prevent entities that do not meet the size standards from receiving
benefits targeted to smaller entities. To ensure that only legitimate designated entities are the beneficiaries
of special provisions, the Commission imposed stricter eligibility requirements on these entities. The Commission
requires that designated entities to substantiate their eligibility by describing how they satisfy the requirements
for eligibility.

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Commission has authorized IDB WorldCom Services, Inc. to provide direct packet switched data service between
the United States and Cuba in accordance with the provisions of the Cuban Democracy Act. This authorization will allow
IDB to help meet the large demand for direct telecommunications services between the United States and Cuba. Under
the guidelines established by the Department of State, IDB is required to submit reports indicating the numbers of
circuits activated by facility, on or before June 30 and December 31 of each year, and on the one-year anniversary of
this notification in the 

Federal Register

.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 






In the Matter of: IDB WORLDCOM SERVICES, INC._Application for authority to lease and operate facilities for the provision
of direct packet switched data service between the United States and Cuba.



[File No. I-T-C-94-440]



Order and Authorization




Adopted: September 29, 1994.




By the Chief, International Facilities Division: 1. The Commission has under consideration the above-captioned
application filed by IDB WorldCom Service, Inc. (``IDB'') requesting authority pursuant to Section 214 of the Communications
Act of 1934, as amended, to establish channels of communication between the United States and Cuba for the provision
of direct packet switched data service. The application was placed on the Commission's public notice and no comments
were received.

2. IDB proposes to provide international packet switched data service between the United States and Cuba via the INTELSAT
satellite located at 325
  E.L., using appropriately licensed existing earth station facilities. Specifically, IDB requests authority
to lease from Comsat and operate one 4 kHz analog SCPC circuit between an authorized earth station located in the United
States and the theoretical midpoint of the INTELSAT AOR satellite connecting with matching facilities provided
by INTERTEL S.A. (``INTERTEL'') of Cuba. IDB proposes to acquire and operate facilities to connect its operating
center in New York, New York, to the U.S. earth station. IDB states that it has already entered into an operating agreement
with INTERTEL for the establishment of direct packet data service between the United States and Cuba. Under the terms
of its agreement, INTERTEL and IDB have agreed to a 50/50 split of a $5.50 per kilosegment and $5.50 per hour accounting
rate for packet data traffic. IDB states this rate is consistent with U.S. policy guidelines.
 IDB states that it will initiate service within one year.





3. IDB states that the public interest would be served by a grant of its application because it will result in an expanded
choice of carriers offering telecommunications service between the United States and Cuba. IDB states such competition
will spur innovation and efficiency, lead to lower-priced, higher-quality service, and stimulate customer demand
and usage. Further, IDB states that the grant of its application will result in the expansion of direct telecommunications
service between the United States and Cuba.

4. In a letter dated July 22, 1993, the U.S. Department of State informed the Commission of the Executive Branch's general
policy guidelines for implementation of the telecommunications provisions of the Cuban Democracy Act, which provides
that ``telecommunication services between the United States and Cuba shall be permitted.''
 Among the policy guidelines are the following requirements: (1) the proposals must have the potential to be operational
within a year; (2) settlements must not be more favorable to Cuba than the current 50/50 split of the $1.20 per minute
accounting rate; (3) proposals must be limited to equipment and services necessary to deliver a signal to Cuba; (4)
proposals must utilize modes of communications already in place between the U.S. and Cuba; and (5) carriers shall
report the number of circuits activated by facility on June 30 and December 31 of each year and on the one-year anniversary
of the notification by the FCC in the 

Federal Register

.





5. The Commission recently granted the application of Sprint Communications Company, L.P. to provide packet data
services between the United States and Cuba pursuant to the same accounting rate as proposed by IDB.
 In particular, the Commission found that Sprint's application was consistent with the Executive Branch's general
guidelines set forth in the Department of State's letter dated July 22, 1993.





6. Upon consideration of IDB's application, we find that a grant of its application will serve the public interest
subject to the conditions set forth below. IDB's application is consistent with the Executive Branch's general guidelines
set forth in the Department of State's letter. IDB states that it will initiate service within one year, and expects
to initiate service shortly after all requisite regulatory approvals have been obtained. IDB's proposed use of INTELSAT
facilities and appropriately licensed existing earth station facilities satisfies the requirements that facilities
already be in existence and be limited to equipment and services necessary to deliver a signal to Cuba.

7. With respect to IDB's proposed 50/50 split of a $5.50 per kilosegment and $5.50 per hour accounting rate for packet
data traffic between the United States and Cuba, the Department of State indicated in a follow-up letter dated May
23, 1994 that it has no objection to our approval so long as the proposed rate does not exceed the 50/50 split of the $1.20
accounting rate required under the guidelines.
 We find that the proposed accounting rate is within the Department of State's guidelines because both the approximately
27.5$ per minute accounting rate for a typical dial packet data transmission, and the approximately 46$
per minute accounting rate for a typical dedicated packet data transmission
 is well below the $1.20 per minute accounting rate approved for voice services.






8. Accordingly, 

It is Ordered

 that application File No. I-T-C-94-440 

Is Granted

 and IDB WorldCom Services, Inc. is authorized to:

Hercules Food and Functional Products Co.; Filing of Petition to Change Process Description and Food Grade Specifications
for Pectin 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Drug Administration, HHS.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing that Hercules Food and Functional Products Co. has filed a petition
(GRASP 4G0411) proposing to change the current process description and food grade specifications for pectins. 

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (sec. 409(b)(5) (21 U.S.C. 348(b)(5))) and the regulations for affirmation
of GRAS status in  170.35 (21 CFR 170.35), notice is given that Hercules Food and Functional Products Co., 1313
North Market St., Wilmington, DE 19899-8740, has filed a petition (GRASP 4G0411) proposing to amend the current
process description and food grade specifications for pectin under 21 CFR 184.1588(a) and (b). The present regulation
incorporates by reference, Food Chemicals Codex, 3d Ed., 1981, p. 215. The petition requests a revision of the description
of pectins to harmonize it with the current Codex Alimentarius and a Council Directive of the European Union. The petition
also requests a revision of specifications consistent with the Food Chemicals Codex, 3d Supp. to the 3d Ed. A similar
proposal has been submitted to the Food Chemicals Codex for consideration. The description and the specification
would affirm the GRAS status of three additional types of pectin, namely, amidated high-methoxyl pectins; very low
methoxyl pectins; and calcium salt of pectins. The petition has been placed on display at the Dockets Management Branch
(address above) and it may be seen between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. 


Any petition that meets the requirements outlined in   170.30 (21 CFR 170.30) and 170.35 is filed by the
agency. There is no prefiling review of the adequacy of data to support a GRAS conclusion. Thus, the filing of a petition
for GRAS affirmation should not be interpreted as a preliminary indication of suitability for GRAS affirmation.

The potential environmental impact of this action is being reviewed. If the agency finds that an environmental impact
statement is not required and this petition results in a regulation, the notice of availability of the agency's finding
of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding will be published with the regulation in the 

Federal Register

 in accordance with 21 CFR 25.40(c). 
Interested persons may, on or before December 16, 1994, review the petition and/or file comments with the Dockets
Management Branch (address above). Two copies of any comment should be filed and should be identified with the docket
number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Comments should include any available information that
would be helpful in determining whether the proposed description and specification should be adopted for food grade
pectin. In addition, consistent with the regulations promulgated under the National Environmental Policy Act (40
CFR 1501.4(b)), the agency encourages public participation by review of and comment on the environmental assessment
submitted with the petition that is the subject of this notice. A copy of the petition (including the environmental
assessment) and received comments may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through
Friday.

<DOCTITLE>Privacy Act of 1974; Report of New Routine Use </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Social Security Administration (SSA), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Addition of a new routine use to seven systems of records. 


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In accordance with the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4) and (11)), we are issuing public notice of our intent to establish
a new routine use applicable to seven of SSA's systems of records. The proposed routine use would provide for disclosure
from the systems of records to law enforcement agencies and private security contractors when information is needed
to respond to, investigate, or prevent activities that jeopardize the security and safety of SSA customers, employees
or workplaces or that otherwise disrupt the operation of SSA facilities. Information would also be disclosed to assist
in the prosecution of persons charged with violating Federal or local law in connection with such activities. 



We invite public comment on this publication. 




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
 
I. Discussion of Proposed Routine Use 



A. Background 



We propose to add a routine use to the systems of records listed below. The proposed routine use is necessary to ensure
the security of SSA workplaces and the safety of SSA customers and employees. 

Occasionally SSA offices find it necessary to disclose information to law enforcement agencies and private security
contractors in order to ensure the security of the workplace and the safety of those in it. These incidents usually
involve: Physical violence; the use, attempted use or display of a weapon; malicious damage to SSA or employee property;
credible threats of physical violence against an employee, a customer or the premises; verbal abuse against an employee
or customer; and other activities that disrupt the operations of SSA offices. 



B. Disclosures to Law Enforcement Agencies and Private Security Contractors 



Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies and private security contractors have responsibility for preventing,
handling, monitoring, and investigating incidents that affect the safety and security of SSA customers, employees
and workplaces or otherwise disrupt SSA operations. Prosecution of persons involved in these activities for violation
of Federal or local laws may also be appropriate. SSA managers of most SSA leased facilities have to rely primarily
on local law enforcement authorities and private security contractors to meet the protective security needs of customers,
employees and workplaces. 

In order to protect individuals and premises and deal with incidents, law enforcement and private security personnel
need information from SSA systems of records. Although the Privacy Act permits disclosure without consent to protect
the health or safety of individuals (5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(8)), the conditions which must be met under this provision sometimes
preclude its application in follow-up investigations when there is no immediate emergency. Also, the requirement
under this exception that the individual must be notified of the disclosure could have potentially dangerous consequences
for SSA employees. They could be subjected to retaliation. The Privacy Act 
(5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(7)) also permits disclosure without consent to a law enforcement agency for a valid law enforcement
activity when an appropriate official of that agency submits a written request. However, this provision does not
permit disclosure without such a request and would not apply when SSA has a need to disclose on its own initiative. 

To enable SSA to disclose information in compliance with the Privacy Act in all situations that affect the safety and
security of SSA customers, employees or workplaces, we are proposing the following routine use to permit disclosure:







To Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies and private security contractors, as appropriate, information
necessary 

(a) To enable them to protect the safety of SSA employees and customers, the security of the SSA workplace and the operation
of SSA facilities, or 

(b) To assist investigations or prosecutions with respect to activities that affect such safety and security or activities
that disrupt the operation of SSA facilities. 





We are not republishing in their entirety the notices of the systems of records to which we are adding the new routine
use statement because of the large number of those systems of records and the costs of republishing the individual
notices of each one. Instead, we are republishing only the identification number and the name of each system, and the
volume, page number, and date of the 

Federal Register

 issue in which the systems notice was last published, either in a composite listing of systems of records or as an individual
system notice. 

The following systems notices were last published at 52 FR 12084, April 14, 1987, in a composite listing which added
a routine use: 




09-60-0005_Hearing Office File, HHS/SSA/OHA; 

09-60-0066_Claims Development Record, HHS/SSA/RO; and 

09-60-0078_Public Inquiry Correspondence File, HHS/SSA/RO. 




The following systems notices were published at 58 FR 35025, 
June 30, 1993, as individual notices: 





09-60-0058_Master Files of Social Security Number Holders, HHS/SSA/OSR; 

09-60-0089_Claims Folders System, HHS/SSA/OP; 

09-60-0090_Master Beneficiary Record, HHS/SSA/OSR; and 

09-60-0103_Supplemental Security Income Record, HHS/SSA/OSR. 



II. Compatibility of Proposed Routine Use 



We are proposing the changes discussed above in accordance with the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a(a)(7), (b)(3), and
(e)(11)) and our disclosure regulation (20 CFR part 401). 

The Privacy Act permits us to disclose information about individuals without their consents for a routine use, i.e.,
where the information will be used for a purpose that is compatible with the purpose for which we collected the information.
As here pertinent, our regulation implementing that statute states that a disclosure serves such a compatible purpose
when the disclosure is necessary to carry out SSA's programs. We believe that the disclosures contemplated under
this routine use meet the compatibility requirement for routine uses under the Privacy Act and the regulation. In
order for SSA to carry out its programs, it must ensure that its places of business are safe and secure for both customers
and employees, that premises and property are safe from theft and damages, that employees can perform their duties
without fear of intimidation or injury, and that SSA can prevent and appropriately deal with disruptions in the operation
of its facilities. In so far as disclosure to law enforcement agencies and private security contractors will help
to accomplish these objectives, the disclosures are an integral part of our program administration responsibilities.
Thus, the proposed disclosures meet the compatibility criterion discussed above because they are necessary for
program administration. 



III. Effect of the Proposal on Individual Rights 



Although disclosures will be made to law enforcement and/or private security personnel, SSA will follow all statutory
and regulatory requirements for disclosure. Therefore, we do not anticipate that the disclosures will have any unwarranted
effect on the privacy or other rights of individuals. 



IV. Other Changes 



No changes, other than the new routine use, are being made to the notices of systems of records in this publication.

<DOCTITLE>Availability of Revised Recovery Action Plan for the Recovery Implementation Program for Endangered Fish Species
in the Upper Colorado River Basin </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of document availability.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announces the availability of the revised Recovery Implementation Program
Recovery Action Plan (RIPRAP) dated September 8, 1994. The RIPRAP identifies specific actions and timeframes currently
believed to be necessary to recover the endangered fish in the most expeditious manner possible in the Upper Colorado
River Basin (Upper Basin). The REPRAP serves as a measure of accomplishment so that the Recovery Implementation Program
for Endangered Fish Species in the Upper Colorado River Basin (Recovery Program) can continue to serve as the reasonable
and prudent alternative to avoid the likelihood of jeopardy to the continued existence of the endangered fish for
projects undergoing section 7 consultations. A final rule designating critical habitat for the endangered fish
was published on March 24, 1994 (59 FR 13374). The Recovery Program also is intended to serve as the reasonable and prudent
alternative to avoid the likely destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat. Modifications were made
to the RIPRAP so that the Recovery Program can fulfill that intent. A notice of availability of the draft modifications
to the RIPRAP was published in 59 FR 31620, June 20, 1994. Public comment was considered and the modifications were
finalized by the Service in coordination with the Recovery Program's Management and Implementation committees.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Background 



Four native fish species that inhabit the Colorado River Basin are federally listed as endangered: the Colorado squawfish
(

Ptychocheilus lucius

), humpback chub (

Gila cypha

), bonytail (

Gila elegans

), and razorback sucker (

Xyrauchen texanus

). Each was once abundant in the Upper Basin; however, they have declined in numbers and now are threatened with extinction
from their natural habitat due to direct loss of habitat, changes in water flow and temperature regimes, blockage
of migration routes, and interactions with introduced (nonnative) fish species. 

In 1988, the Governors of Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming, the Secretary of the Interior, and the Administrator of the
Western Area Power Administration entered into a cooperative agreement to implement the Recovery Program. The purpose
of the Recovery Program is to recover the four endangered fish in the Upper Basin while providing for future water development
to proceed in compliance with the Endangered Species Act, Interstate Compacts, and State law. The Upper Basin is defined
as the Colorado River drainage upstream of Lake Powell, with the exception of the San Juan River drainage. 

The Recovery Program includes procedures for section 7 consultations. In 1992, the Service raised an issue with Recovery
Program participants as to whether progress toward recovery of the fish has been sufficient to allow for continued
issuance of favorable biological opinions. Discussions among Recovery Program participants resulted in an agreement,
finalized on October 15, 1993, that clarified how section 7 consultations would be conducted in the Upper Basin on
depletion impacts related to new projects and impacts associated with historic projects (existing projects requiring
a new Federal action), with the exception of the discharge by historic projects of pollutants such as trace elements,
heavy metals, and pesticides. The RIPRAP was developed by Recovery Program participants in support of the section
7 agreement using the best information available and the recovery goals established for the four endangered fish
species. It identifies specific actions and timeframes currently believed to be required to recover the endangered
fish in the most expeditious manner possible in the Upper Basin. The RIPRAP serves as a measure of accomplishment so
that the Recovery Program can continue to serve as the reasonable and prudent alternative to avoid the likelihood
of jeopardy to the continued existence of the endangered fish for projects undergoing section 7 consultation. The
Recovery Program also is intended to serve as the reasonable and prudent alternative which avoids the likely destruction
or adverse modification of critical habitat. The modifications in the revised RIPRAP are designed to fulfill such
intent. The modifications were not extensive and are primarily intended to provide further definition to actions
already identified in the RIPRAP and to provide increased certainty that the Recovery Program can continue to serve
as the reasonable and prudent alternative for projects subject to section 7 consultation. 



National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) 



A programmatic Environmental Assessment was completed on the Recovery Program in November 1987. The Environmental
Assessment provides an analysis and assessment of the impacts to the environment from Recovery Program implementation.
The October 1993 Agreement and RIPRAP, including the modifications, identify in more detail how the Recovery Program
will be carried out. Appropriate site-specific NEPA compliance will be conducted on specific actions identified
in the RIPRAP.

<DOCTITLE>General Records Schedule 20, Electronic Records; Request for Comments </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Archives and Records Administration, Office of Records Administration.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed records schedule; request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 As required by statute (44 U.S.C. 3303a(d)), the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) issues General
Records Schedules (GRS) to provide disposal authority for temporary records common to several or all agencies. NARA
has revised GRS 20, Electronic Records, by adding an item on electronic mail records, by moving selected items from
GRS 23 to GRS 20 to consolidate coverage of electronic records, and by updating several other items. General Records
Schedules, as well as schedules submitted by agencies, are subject to public review and comment before approval,
as required by 44 USC 3303a(a). Normally, NARA publishes notices of Federal agency requests for records disposition
authority (records schedules) that contain an identifying number and a brief description of the records to be covered
by the schedule. This allows interested parties to request copies of pending schedules and submit comments. Because
of the widespread interest in electronic records, however, NARA has chosen in this instance to publish the full text
of the schedule with revisions indicated. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 For the convenience of reviewers, the text of GRS 20 is provided in full in this notice, including items that are unchanged
from the current GRS 20 (items 2, 6, 7, and 9-12) or contain only editorial changes (items 1, 4, and 5). The title
of item 1 was amended to remove the reference to the locations where the files described by item 1 are maintained, and
the wording of the disposition instructions for items 4 and 5 was edited for consistency with other items. 



Comments will be accepted only on the items in GRS 20 that have been substantively changed or added, specifically,
items 3, 8, 13, 14, and 15. Also for the convenience of reviewers, the text of GRS 23 is being published although no comments
are being solicited. 



Introduction.

 Because the distinction between central data processing applications and end-user computer applications have
become blurred by the proliferation of local and wide area networks, and end-user applications have become more sophisticated
since they were added to GRS 23 in 1987, end-user applications have been moved to GRS 20. The introduction to GRS 20 is
revised to reflect its expanded coverage and explain some of the changes made to the schedule, as follows: 



General Records Schedule 20 



Electronic Records 



This schedule provides disposal authorization for certain electronic records and specified hard-copy (paper)
or microform records that are integrally related to the electronic records. 

This schedule applies to disposable electronic records created or received by Federal agencies including those
managed for agencies by contractors. It covers records created by computer operators, programmers, analysts, systems
administrators, and all personnel with access to a computer. Disposition authority is provided for certain master
files, including some that are components of database management systems, certain files created from master files
for specific purposes, and certain disposable electronic records produced by end users in office automation applications
(e.g., word processing files, electronic mail messages, calendars, spreadsheets, and databases developed on personal
computers in support of administrative functions). These disposition authorities apply to the categories of electronic
records described in GRS 20, regardless of the type of computer used to create or store these records. GRS 20 does not
cover all electronic records. Electronic records not covered by GRS 20 may not be destroyed unless authorized by a
Standard Form 115 that has been approved by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). 

Security backup copies of files as defined in item 8 of this schedule do not equate to system backups. System backups
are copies on off-line storage media of software and data stored on direct access storage devices in a computer system.
They are used to recreate a system or its data in case of unintentional loss from on-line storage. System backups are
merely mirror images of storage disks on which data and documents may be scattered randomly as they are on the disks
themselves. Therefore, system backups are not records and are suitable for safeguarding against the loss of records
only when the record copy is maintained elsewhere. 

Electronic mail records described in item 14 are documents which: (1) Are created or received on an electronic mail
system, and (2) meet the definition of Federal records. E-mail records must include the identity of the sender and
the recipient(s), and the date, and any other data deemed by the agency to be necessary to understand the contents or
to interpret the structure of the e-mail record. Receipt data that the agency determines is needed for complete and
accurate documentation must also be maintained with e-mail messages that are Federal records. 

The records covered by several items in this schedule are authorized for erasure or deletion when no longer needed.
NARA could not establish a more specific retention that would be appropriate in all applications. Each agency should,
when appropriate, determine a more specific disposition instruction, such as ``Delete after X update cycles'' or
``Delete when X years old,'' for inclusion in its records disposition directives or manual. NARA approval is not needed
to set retention periods for records in the GRS that are authorized for destruction when no longer needed. 

Items 2a and 1a (in part) of this schedule apply to hard-copy or microform records used in conjunction with electronic
files. Item 1 also covers printouts produced to test, use, and maintain master files. Items 10 and 11 of this schedule
should be applied to special purpose programs and documentation for disposable electronic records whatever the
medium in which such documentation and programs exist. 

This schedule has been revised to include electronically-generated records previously covered in General Records
Schedule 23, Records Common to Most Offices. The original numbering of the items in GRS 20 has been preserved. The items
moved from GRS 23 have been added at the end, except the item covering administrative databases that has been incorporated
into item 3. Electronic versions of records authorized for disposal in the remaining items in GRS 23, as for other records
in the GRS, may be deleted under the provisions of item 3 of GRS 20. 

See also 36 CFR part 1234 for NARA regulations on electronic records management.

Item 1.

 The title of item 1 was modified to remove the reference to central ADP facilities, ADP management, and ADP support
operations and clarify its applicability. The disposition of subitem 1c was modified to remove the phrase ``in accordance
with sound business practice and agency standard operating procedures'' for consistency with other GRS items. The
item was otherwise unchanged and now reads as follows: 




Item 1. 

Files/Records Relating to the Creation, Use, and Maintenance of Computer Systems, Applications, or Electronic
Records. 



a. Electronic files or records created solely to test system performance, as well as hard-copy printouts and related
documentation for the electronic files/records. 

Delete/destroy when no longer needed. 

b. Electronic files or records used to create or update a master file, including, but not limited to, work files, valid
transaction files, and intermediate input/output records. 

Delete after information has been transferred to the master file and verified. 

c. Electronic files and hard-copy printouts created to monitor system usage, including, but not limited to, log-in
files, password files, audit trail files, system usage files, and cost-back files used to assess charges for system
use. 

Delete/destroy when no longer needed. 






Item 2.

 Item 2 is unchanged from the current GRS which reads as follows:

 


Item 2. 

Input/Source Records.

 

a. Non-electronic documents or forms designed and used solely to create, update, or modify the records in an electronic
medium and not required for audit or legal purposes (such as need for signatures) and not previously scheduled for
permanent retention in a NARA-approved agency records schedule. 

Destroy after the information has been converted to an electronic medium and verified, or when no longer needed to
support the reconstruction of, or serve as the backup to, the master file, whichever is later. 

b. Electronic records, except as noted in item 2c, entered into the system during an update process, and not required
for audit and legal purposes. 

Delete when data have been entered into the master file or database and verified, or when no longer required to support
reconstruction of, or serve as backup to, a master file or database, whichever is later. 

c. Electronic records received from another agency and used as input/ source records by the receiving agency, EXCLUDING
records produced by another agency under the terms of an interagency agreement, or records created by another agency
in response to the specific information needs of the receiving agency. 

Delete when data have been entered into the master file or database and verified, or when no longer needed to support
reconstruction of, or serve as backup to, the master file or database, whichever is later. 






Item 3.

 Item 3 was modified to incorporate item 3 from GRS 23 covering administrative databases. The title was changed from
Master Files to Electronic Versions of Records Scheduled for Disposal. This will clarify the coverage of the item.
To further clarify the coverage to users of the GRS, the following note will be added to each page of the GRS indexes:
General Records Schedule 20, item 3, applies to electronic versions of records scheduled for disposal under items
in GRS 1-16, 18, 22, and 23, except for GRS 1, items 21, 22, 25f; GRS 12, item 3; and GRS 18, item 5. The new item reads
as follows: 




Item 3. 

Electronic Versions of Records Scheduled for Disposal.



a. Electronic versions of records that are scheduled for disposal under one or more items in GRS 1-16, 18, 22,
or 23; EXCLUDING those that replace or duplicate the following GRS items: GRS 1, items 21, 22, 25f; GRS 12, item 3; and
GRS 18, item 5. 

Delete after the expiration of the retention period authorized by the GRS or when no longer needed, whichever is later.


b. Electronic records that support administrative housekeeping functions when the records are derived from or replace
hard copy records authorized by NARA for destruction in an agency specific records schedule. 

(1) When hard copy records are retained to meet recordkeeping requirements. 

Delete information in the database when no longer needed. 

(2) When the electronic record replaces hard copy records. 

Delete after the expiration of the retention period authorized for the hard copy file, or when no longer needed, whichever
is later. 

(3) Hard copy printouts created for short-term administrative purposes. 

Destroy when no longer needed.






Item 4.

 The disposition instruction for item 4 was modified to remove the concluding phrase ``for current business'' for
consistency with other GRS items. The item is otherwise unchanged from the current GRS and now reads as follows:

 


Item 4.

 Data Files Consisting of Summarized Information. 



Records that contain summarized or aggregated information created by combining data elements or individual observations
from a single master file or database that is disposable under a GRS item or is authorized for deletion by a disposition
job approved by NARA after January 1, 1988, EXCLUDING data files that are: 

(a) Created as disclosure-free files to allow public access to the data; or

 The disposition instruction for item 5 was modified to remove the concluding phrase ``for current business'' for
consistency with other GRS items, and a cross-reference to item 12 was added. The item is otherwise unchanged from
the current GRS and now reads as follows:




Item 5. 

Records Consisting of Extracted Information.

 

Electronic files consisting solely of records extracted from a single master file or database that is disposable
under GRS 20 or approved for deletion by a NARA-approved disposition schedule, EXCLUDING extracts that are:

(b) Produced from a master file or database that is unscheduled, or that was scheduled as permanent but no longer exists
or can no longer be accessed; or 

(c) Produced by an extraction process which changes the informational content of the source master file or database;
which may not be destroyed before securing NARA approval. For print and technical reformat files see items 6 and 7 of
this schedule respectively. 

Delete when no longer needed. 









Note:

 See item 12 of this schedule for other extracted data.






Item 6.

 Item 6 is unchanged from the current GRS which reads as follows:

Delete when the identical records have been transferred to the National Archives and successfully copied, or when
replaced by a subsequent security backup file. 

b. File identical to records authorized for disposal in a NARA-approved records schedule. 

Delete when the identical records have been deleted, or when replaced by a subsequent security backup file. 




[

Note:

 This item does not cover system backups. See introduction to this schedule for further information on system backups.]







Item 9. 

Item 9 is unchanged from the current GRS which reads as follows: 




Item 9. 

Finding Aids (or Indexes). 

Electronic indexes, lists, registers, and other finding aids used only to provide access to records authorized for
destruction by the GRS or a NARA-approved SF 115, EXCLUDING records containing abstracts or other information that

Delete with related records or when no longer needed, whichever is later. 




Item 10. 

Item 10 is unchanged from the current GRS which reads as follows: 




Item 10. 

Special Purpose Programs. 

Application software necessary solely to use or maintain a master file or database authorized for disposal in a GRS
item or a NARA-approved records schedule, EXCLUDING special purpose software necessary to use or maintain any unscheduled
master file or database or any master file or database scheduled for transfer to the National Archives. 

Delete when related master file or database has been deleted. 




Item 11. 

Item 11 is unchanged from the current GRS which reads as follows: 




Item 11. 

Documentation. 

a. Data systems specifications, file specifications, codebooks, record layouts, user guides, output specifications,

Destroy or delete when superseded or obsolete, or upon authorized deletion of the related master file or database.


b. Computer center copies of records relating to system security, including records documenting periodic audits
or review and recertification of sensitive applications, disaster and continuity plans, and risk analysis, as described
in OMB Circular No. A-130. Destroy or delete when superseded or obsolete. 




[

Notes:

 (1) Documentation that relates to permanent or unscheduled master files and databases is not authorized for destruction
by the GRS. (2) See item 1a of this schedule for documentation relating to system testing.] 






Item 12. 

Item 12 is unchanged from the current GRS which reads as follows: 




Item 12. 

Downloaded and Copied Data. 



Derived data and data files that are copied, extracted, merged, and/or calculated from other data, when the original

Delete when no longer needed. 

c. Metadata or reference data, such as format, range or domain specifications, which is transferred from a host computer
or server to another computer for input, updating, or transaction processing operations. 

Delete from the receiving system when the input operation is completed.

 


[

Note:

 See item 5 of this schedule for other extracted data.] 






Item 13. 

Item 13 was extracted from GRS 23, item 2, which covered both word processing documents and electronic messages. Item
13 covers only word processing documents; messages will be covered in new item 14. The coverage of the item has been
expanded and clarified to include word processing documents that are copied to an electronic recordkeeping system.
This item will authorize the disposal of documents on the word processing system if they are copied to paper or another
electronic form for recordkeeping, or if they are already authorized for disposal by the GRS or a NARA-approved agency
records schedule. The revised item reads as follows: 




Item 13. 

Word Processing Files. 

Documents such as letters, memoranda, reports, handbooks, directives, and manuals recorded on electronic media
such as hard disks or floppy diskettes: 

a. When copied to paper, microform, or an electronic records system for recordkeeping purposes. 

Delete when no longer needed. 

b. When maintained in electronic format only on the word processing system or separate diskette, providing the records
have been authorized for destruction by the GRS or NARA-approved SF 115. 




Delete after the expiration of the retention period authorized by the GRS or a NARA-approved SF 115.




Item 14. 

Item 14 was extracted from current GRS 23, item 2. Because electronic mail has become so widespread, a separate item
for electronic mail messages is now needed. This item will authorize deletion of records on the electronic mail system
only when they have been copied to paper, microform, or another electronic system for recordkeeping purposes, or
when their retention period has expired as specified by a GRS or NARA-approved agency records schedule. The new item
reads as follows: 




Item 14. 

Electronic mail records. 

Senders' and recipients' copies of messages, regardless of length or substance, that meet the definition of Federal
records created using the electronic mail (e-mail) system and any attachments. 

a. Records, including transmission data and any receipt data that may be required, that have been converted to paper
or microform or copied to another electronic system for recordkeeping. Delete from the e-mail system when no longer
needed. 

b. Records maintained only on the e-mail system for recordkeeping, providing the records have been authorized for
destruction by the GRS or a NARA-approved SF 115. 

Delete from the e-mail system at the expiration of the retention period authorized by the GRS or NARA-approved SF 115.

Item 15. 

Item 15 was GRS 23, item 4. There are no changes in the text which reads: 




Item 15. 

Electronic Spreadsheets. 

Spreadsheets that are recorded on electronic media such as hard disks or floppy diskettes: 

a. When used to produce hard copy that is maintained in organized files. 

Delete when no longer needed to update or produce hard copy. 

b. When maintained only in electronic form. 

Delete after the expiration of the retention period authorized for the hard copy by the GRS or a NARA-approved SF 115.
If the electronic version replaces hard copy records with differing retention periods and agency software does not
readily permit selective deletion, delete after the longest retention period has expired. 




As noted above, General Records Schedule 23, Records Common to Most Offices Within Agencies, has been modified by
removal of items covering records created in electronic form which have been incorporated into GRS 20. GRS 23 will
now read as follows: 



General Records Schedule 23 



Records Common to Most Offices Within Agencies 



This schedule provides for the disposal of certain records common to most offices in Federal agencies. It covers administrative
subject files; facilitative records such as suspense files, tracking and control records, calendars, and indexes;
and transitory documents. This schedule does not apply to any materials that the agency has determined to be nonrecord
or to materials such as calendars or work schedules claimed as personal. 

Office Administrative Files described under item 1 are records retained by an originating office as its record of
initiation of an action, request, or response to requests for information. This item may be applied only to separate
administrative files containing such records as copies of documents submitted to other offices for action including
budget feeder documents, purchase orders, training requests. Item 1 may not be applied to files that also contain
program records, and it may not be applied by an office that receives and takes action on documents submitted by other
offices. 

Several items covering electronic records produced on stand-alone or networked personal computers (such as word
processing files, administrative databases, and spreadsheets) that were previously in this schedule have been
moved to General Records Schedule 20, Electronic Records. To preserve the previous numbering of the items in GRS 23,
the item numbers that have been moved have been reserved. The disposition of records described in this schedule that
are created in electronic form is governed by GRS 20, items 3, 13, 14, and 15. 

Item 1. Office Administrative Files. 

Records accumulated by individual offices that relate to the internal administration or housekeeping activities
of the office rather than the functions for which the office exists. In general, these records relate to the office
organization, staffing, procedures, and communications; the expenditure of funds, including budget records;
day-to-day administration of office personnel including training and travel; supplies and office services and
equipment requests and receipts; and the use of office space and utilities. They may also include copies of internal
activity and workload reports (including work progress, statistical, and narrative reports prepared in the office
and forwarded to higher levels) and other materials that do not serve as unique documentation of the programs of the
office. 

Destroy when 2 years old, or when no longer needed, whichever is sooner. 




[

Note: 

This schedule is not applicable to the record copies of organizational charts, functional statements, and related
records that document the essential organization, staffing, and procedures of the office, which must be scheduled
prior to disposition by submitting an SF 115 to NARA.] 




Items 2-4. Reserved. 

Item 5. 

Schedules of Daily Activities. 

Calendars, appointment books, schedules, logs, diaries, and other records documenting meetings, appointments,
telephone calls, trips, visits, and other activities by Federal employees while serving in an official capacity,
EXCLUDING materials determined to be personal. 

a. Records containing substantive information relating to official activities, the substance of which has not been
incorporated into official files, EXCLUDING records relating to the official activities of high government officials
(see note). 

Destroy or delete when 2 years old. 




[

Note: 

High level officials include the heads of departments and independent agencies; their deputies and assistants;
the heads of program offices and staff offices including assistant secretaries, administrators, and commissioners;
directors of offices, bureaus, or equivalent; principal regional officials; staff assistants to those aforementioned
officials, such as special assistants, confidential assistants, and administrative assistants; and career Federal
employees, political appointees, and officers of the Armed Forces serving in equivalent or comparable positions.
Unique substantive records relating to the activities of these individuals must be scheduled by submission of an
SF 115 to NARA. 




b. Records documenting routine activities containing no substantive information and records containing substantive
information, the substance of which has been incorporated into organized files. 

Destroy or delete when no longer needed. 




[

Note: 

GRS 20, item 3, authorizes deletion of electronic records described by subitems a and b of this item.] 




Item 6. 

Suspense Files. 

Documents arranged in chronological order as a reminder that an action is required on a given date or that a reply to
action is expected and, if not received, should be traced on a given date. 

a. A note or other reminder to take action. 

Destroy after action is taken. 

b. The file copy or an extra copy of an outgoing communication, filed by the date on which a reply is expected. 

Withdraw documents when reply is received. (1) If suspense copy is an extra copy, destroy immediately. (2) If suspense
copy is the file copy, incorporate it into the official files. 

Item 7. Transitory Files. 

Documents of short-term interest which have no documentary or evidential value and normally need not be kept more
than 90 days. Examples of transitory correspondence are shown below. 

a. Routine requests for information or publications and copies of replies which require no administrative action,
no policy decision, and no special compilation or research for reply. 

b. Originating office copies of letters of transmittal that do not add any information to that contained in the transmitted
material, and receiving office copy if filed separately from transmitted material. 

c. Quasi-official notices including memoranda and other records that do not serve as the basis of official actions,
such as notices of holidays or charity and welfare fund appeals, bond campaigns, and similar records. 

Destroy when 3 months old, or when no longer needed, whichever is sooner. 

Item 8. Tracking and Control Records. 

Logs, registers, and other records used to control or document the status of correspondence, reports, or other records
that are authorized for destruction by the GRS or a NARA-approved SF 115. 

Destroy or delete when no longer needed. 

Item 9. Finding Aids (or Indexes). 

Indexes, lists, registers, and other finding aids used only to provide access to records authorized for destruction
by the GRS or a NARA-approved SF 115, EXCLUDING records containing abstracts or other information that can be used
as an information source apart from the related records. 

Destroy or delete with the related records or sooner if no longer needed.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On August 5, 1994 (59 FR 40058), the Nuclear Regulatory Commission published for public comment a draft proposed policy
statement on the Agreement States Program. The draft policy statement establishes Agreement State program principles,
and describes the respective roles and responsibilities of the NRC and the States in the administration of this program,
which is authorized by Section 274 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended. Agreement States are States which have
assumed regulatory authority from NRC over the possession and use of certain radioactive materials. The draft document
is an ``umbrella'' policy statement which will serve as broad guidance in delineating the NRC's and the State's respective
responsibilities and expectations. The comment period for this draft policy statement expired on October 4, 1994.
The NRC has been requested to extend the comment period and has decided to grant the request. Therefore, the comment
period has been extended. The extended comment period now expires on December 19, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Philadelphia Electric Co., Public Service Electric & Gas Co., Delmarva Power & Light Co., and Atlantic City
Electric Co.; Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station, Units 2 and 3; Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant
Impact </DOCTITLE>





The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License Nos. DPR-44 and DPR-56, issued to Philadelphia Electric Company (the licensee), for operation
of the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station (PBAPS), Units 2 and 3, located in York County, Pennsylvania.



Environmental Assessment 



Identification of the Proposed Action 



This Environmental Assessment has been prepared to address the potential environmental issues related to the licensee's
application to amend the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station, Unit Nos. 2 and 3 operating licenses. The proposed action
would increase the licensed thermal power level of the reactors from the current limit of 3293 megawatts thermal (MWt)
to a revised limit of 3458 MWt. This request is in accordance with the generic boiling water reactor (BWR) power uprate
program established by the General Electric Company (GE) and approved by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(NRC) staff in a letter from W. Russell, NRC, to P. Marriotte, General Electric, dated September 30, 1991. 

The proposed action involves NRC issuance of a license amendment to uprate the authorized power level by changing
the Operating License, Appendices A (``Technical Specifications'') and B (``Environmental Technical Specifications'')
to the Operating License. The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's application for amendment dated
June 23, 1993, as supplemented by letters dated April 5, May 2, June 6, June 8, June 29, July 6 (two letters), July 7, July
20, July 28 (two letters), September 16 and September 30, 1994.



The Need for the Proposed Action 



The proposed action is needed to permit an increase in the licensed core thermal power from 3293 MWt to 3458 MWt and provide
the licensee with the flexibility to increase the potential electrical output of PBAPS, Units 2 and 3, providing additional
electrical power to the licensees' domestic and commercial service areas. 



Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action 



The ``Final Environmental Statement (FES) related to operation of Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station, Units 2 and
3'' was issued in April 1973. The licensee submitted General Electric (GE) Topical Report, NEDC-32183P, ``Power
Rerate Safety Analysis Report for Peach Bottom 2 & 3,'' Class III, dated May 1993, as Attachment 3 to the June 23,
1993 submittal. NEDC-32183P contains the safety analysis prepared by GE to support this license change request
and the implementation of power uprate at PBAPS Units 2 and 3. The analyses and evaluations supporting the proposed
license changes were completed using the guidelines in GE Topical Report NEDC-31897P-A, ``Generic Guidelines
for General Electric Boiling Water Reactor Power Uprate,'' Class III, dated May 1992, and NEDC-31984P, ``Generic
Evaluations of General Electric Boiling Water Reactor Power Update,'' Class III, dated July 1991. The staff reviewed
and approved these Topical Reports in the September 30, 1991 letter described above and in a letter from W. Russell,
NRC, to P. Marriotte, General Electric, dated July 31, 1992. 

The licensee provided information regarding the non-radiological environmental effects of the proposed action
in the June 23, application and supplemental information in the September 30, 1994 submittal. The licensee provided
information regarding the radiological environmental effects of the proposed action in NEDC-3183P and supplemental
information in the September 30, 1994 submittal. The staff has reviewed the potential radiological and non-radiological
effects of the proposed action on the environment as described below. 



Non-Radiological Environmental Assessment 



Power uprate will not change the method of generating electricity nor the method of handling any influents from nor
effluents to the environment. Therefore, no new or different types of environmental impacts are expected. 

The staff reviewed the non-radiological impact of operation at uprated power levels on influents from and effluents
to the Conowingo Pond. Peach Bottom has a once-through circulating water system and five mechanical draft cooling
towers for dissipating heat from the main turbine condensers. The cooling towers reject heat from the circulating
water prior to discharge back to the Conowingo Pond. The cooling towers are operated in accordance with the requirements
of the facility's National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, Permit No. PA0009733. The NPDES
permit includes a matrix which specifies the number of cooling towers that must be in operation as a function of total
station thermal power production, circulating water pumps and average inlet water temperature.

By letters dated February 24 and March 31, 1994, the licensee provided information to the Pennsylvania Department
of Environmental Resources (PA DER) regarding the impact of power uprate on cooling tower performance. In the February
24, 1994 letter, the licensee indicated that the uprated power levels would increase the temperature of the circulating
water leaving the main condensers by approximately one degree Fahrenheit. Operation at uprated power will cause
additional heat to be rejected to the circulating water through the main condensers. The additional heat rejection
would occur as a result of operation at slightly higher condenser pressures and discharge of circulating water from
the main condenser with slightly higher temperatures as described above. The licensee provided a revised cooling
tower matrix to the PA DER which addressed cooling tower operation at uprated power levels. The licensee noted that
the lowest 7-day moving river temperature average for which cooling tower operation is required dropped from 53
 F to 51
 F. In general, the effect of operation at uprated power would be to increase the duty cycle of the cooling towers.
By letter dated September 27, 1994, the PA DER recommended extension of the thermal variance (Section 316(a) of The
Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, P.L. 92-500, as amended) for the Peach Bottom Atomic
Power Station. The state concluded that an increase in the plant's rated power level will not change the relative abundance,
distribution and species composition of fish in the Conowingo Pond provided the station is operated in accordance
with the revised matrix. The PA DER indicated that the NPDES permit will be renewed in the near future to include the
revised matrix.

The operating speed and characteristics of the circulating pumps will not be changed for power uprate. Thus, the volumetric
flow rate and velocity of intake and outfall from the circulating water system would not be expected to change because
of operation at uprated power levels. As stated above, the temperature of the water discharged from the condensers
is expected to increase slightly; however, the licensee has determined that the increased heat load is within the
capacity of the existing cooling towers. The operating matrix for the cooling towers was revised to maintain the temperature
characteristics of the plant discharge plume equivalent to those of the existing plume. Because the flow rate, velocity
and temperature of the plume are all not expected to change, no change to the overall thermal plume is expected.

The licensee does inject sodium hypochlorite into the circulating water system to retard growth of microorganisms
with system components. The sodium hypochlorite injection rate is determined by the flow rate through the circulating
water system, which will not change as a result of operation at uprated power levels. The licensee indicated the increased
heat rejection rate from the cooling towers may lead to an increase in concentration of chemicals and contaminants
in the cooling tower. However, the licensee is required by the NPDES permit to sample for residual chlorine in the outfall
of the cooling towers on a daily basis and to maintain residual chlorine concentrations within the limits of the permit.
The concentrations of residual chlorine are not expected to exceed the existing permit limits. Based on the expected
minimal effect of uprated power operation on cooling tower chemical concentrations and the monitoring requirements
of the NPDES permit, the staff concludes the impact of any potential increase in cooling tower chemical effluent concentration
on the environment is not significant.

Effluent discharges from other systems were also considered. Effluent limits for systems such as roof drains and
yard drains, the auxiliary boiler and the sewage treatment plant are established in the NPDES permit. Discharges
from these systems are not changed by operation at uprated power. Thus, the impact on the environment from these systems
as a result of operation at uprated power levels is not significant.

Because the flow rate and velocity of influent to and effluent from the circulating water and service water systems
will remain unchanged by operation at uprated power levels, no increased entrainment of planktonic organisms and
or impingement of fish is expected. As part of the request to update the NPDES permit, the licensee submitted a report
of aquatic sampling that was performed in the Conowingo Pond in October and November 1993. The report was provided
to the NRC in the June 29, 1994 letter. The objective of the study was to ``determine the relative abundance and distribution
of fishes in Conowingo Pond, particularly the thermal effluent, and compare the results with the historic record.''
The report concluded that ``No obvious changes in the species abundance, except for the gizzard shad in recent years,
were observed between 1993 and the historic record. Changes in the abundance of a particular species has historically
been associated with year class strength. Strong year classes are associated with increased abundance of a species.''
Samples of the gizzard shad were generally stronger than the historic record for the various sample locations and
methods.

Operation at uprated power levels will not result in increased noise generation for the majority of plant equipment.
Some of this equipment, such as the main turbine and generator will operate at the same speed and thus will not contribute
to increased offsite noise. Other equipment, such as reactor feed pumps, will operate at increased speeds; however,
the majority of this type of equipment is located within plant structures and will not lead to increased offsite noise
levels. The impact of a potential increase in noise from the cooling towers was considered. As described previously,
operation of the cooling towers is controlled by the requirements of the NPDES permit. Operation of the facility at
uprated power levels is not expected to result in operation of more cooling towers than are operated under current
power limits. Thus the existing cooling tower noise levels would not be expected to change. However, the existing
cooling towers may be operated for an increased number of days per year. The licensee qualitatively estimated that
the cooling tower duty cycle would increase by a small amount (in terms of cooling tower-days per year). Thus, the current
cooling tower noise levels would exist for a slightly increased number of days per year and the environmental effect
of increased noise would be insignificant. 
 
The FES described the impact of plant operation on fogging in the vicinity of the facility. Fogging estimates were
made for a number of locations near the plant. The FES discussed that the increase in fogging due to plant operation
over the natural occurrence of fogging was expected to be minimal and not significant. The staff expects that operation
of the plant at uprated power levels will result in only a minimal increase in fogging over that discussed in the FES.
Thus, the impact of plant operation on local fogging, including operation at uprated power, remains insignificant.

 
Makeup water requirements are not expected to change significantly, if at all, due to operation at uprated power levels.
The circulating water system, service water systems and cooling towers are once-through systems and, as such, do
not have makeup requirements. The licensee indicated that operation of the reactor at slightly (< 30 psig) higher
operating pressures may lead to slightly higher valve packing leak rates. System leakage, however, is processed
through the liquid radwaste system and returned to the condensate storage tank for reuse. Based on the above considerations,
the staff concluded that the effect of makeup requirements at uprated power levels on the environment is not significant.

 


Radiological Environmental Assessment 
 


The licensee evaluated the impact of the proposed amendment to show that the applicable regulatory acceptance criteria
continue to be satisfied for the uprated power conditions. In conducting this evaluation, the licensee considered
the effect of the higher power level on source terms on-site and offsite doses, and control room habitability during
both normal operation and accident conditions. The licensee provided information regarding the radiological environmental
effects of the proposed action in NEDC-32183P and supplemental information in the September 30, 1994 submittal.
In Sections 8.1 and 8.2 of NEDC-32183P, the licensee discussed the potential effect of power uprate on liquid
and gaseous radioactive waste systems. Sections 8.3 and 8.4 discussed the potential effect of power uprate on radiation
sources in the reactor core during operation and post-operation, and radiation sources in the coolant resulted from
coolant activation products, activated corrosion products and fission products. Section 8.5 of the Topical Report
discussed the radiation levels during normal operation, normal post-operation, post-accident, and offsite doses
during normal operation. Finally, Section 9.2 of NEDC-32183P presented the results of calculated whole body
and thyroid doses at the uprated power and current authorized power conditions at the exclusion area boundary and
the low population zone that might result from the postulated design basis radiological accidents [i.e., loss-of-coolant-accident
(LOCA), main stream line break accident (MSLBA) outside containment, fuel handling accident (FHA) and control rod
drop accident (CRDA].
 
In Section 8.1 of NEDC-32183P, the licensee stated that there will be only a slight increase in the liquid radwaste
collection as a result of operation at higher power levels. The largest contributor to the liquid waste results from
the backwash of the condensate demineralizers. The power uprate will increase the flow rate through the condensate
demineralizers, with a subsequent reduction in the average time between backwashing. Additionally, neither the
floor drain collector subsystem, nor the waste collector subsystem is expected to experience a significant increase
in the total volume of liquid waste due to operation at the uprated condition. 
 
The licensee stated that while the activated corrosion products in liquid wastes are expected to increase proportionally
to the power uprate, the total volume of processed waste is not expected to increase appreciably since the only significant
increase in processed waste is due to the more frequent backwashes of condensate and reactor water cleanup (RWCU)
system demineralizers. The licensee noted that backwashing is normally initiated as a result of high differential
pressure rather than activity content and that this is expected to remain the case for operation under uprated power
conditions. Based on its analyses of the liquid radwaste system, the licensee has concluded the requirements of 10
CFR Part 20 and 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix I, will be met. Based on the above considerations, the staff concluded that the
effect on the environment of operation of the liquid radiological waste stream at uprated power levels is not significant.

 
The gaseous waste management systems, collect, control, process, store and dispose of gaseous radioactive waste
generated during normal operation and abnormal operational occurrences. The gaseous waste management systems
include the offgas system, standby gas treatment system (SGTS), and various building ventilation systems. The systems
are designed to meet the requirements of 10 CFR Part 20 and 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix I. 
 
In its power uprate submittal, the licensee has stated that the greatest contributor of radioactive gases are the
non-condensible radioactive gases from the main condenser, including activation gases (principally N-16,
O-19, and N-13) and radioactive noble gas parents. The increase in production of these gases is expected
to be approximately proportional to the core power increase. These non-condensible radioactive gases, along with
nonradioactive air due to in-leakage to the condenser, are continuously removed by the stream jet air ejector from
the main condensers, and discharge into the offgas system. The flow of these gases into the offgas system are included
with the flow of H

2

 and O

2

 from the recombiner which will also increase linearly with core power. Radioactive gases and H

2

 and O

2

 pass from the recombiner through an adsorber bed, holdup pipe, HEPA filters and exit the facility through the main
stack. Gaseous activity effluent release rates are monitored down stream of the adsorber bed and alarms are provided
in the control room. The licensee has stated that the operational increases in gases are not significant when compared
to the current total system flow. 
The design basis for the offgas system is for activity release rates of 100,000 microcuries per second based on a mixture
of activation and fission product gases and fuel leakage and a 30-minute holdup time. The system is designed to met
the requirements of 10 CFR Part 20 and 10 CFR part 50, appendix I. Performance of the system at uprated power levels is
expected to remain within the system design basis and, thus, to continue to meet the requirements of 10 CFR Part 20 and
10 CFR Part 50, Appendix I. 
 
The contribution of gases to the gaseous waste management system from building ventilation systems is not expected
to increase significantly with power uprate because 1) the amount of fission products released into the reactor coolant
depends on the number and nature of the fuel rod defects and is not dependent on reactor power, and 2) the concentration
of coolant activation products is expected to remain unchanged since the linear increase in the production of these
products will be offset by the linear increase in steaming rate. 
 
Based on its review of the gaseous waste management system, the staff concluded that the effect on the environment
of operating the gaseous radiological waste stream at uprated power is not significant.

The licensee has evaluated the effects of the power rerate on in-plant radiation levels in the Peach Bottom 2 and 3 facility
during normal conditions. The radiation levels during periods of normal operation and post-operation are expected
to increase by no more than the percentage increase in power level. However, because many areas of the plant were designed
for higher than expected radiation sources, the small increase in radiation levels expected due to power rerate will
not affect radiation zoning or shielding in the plant.

During periods of normal and post-operation conditions, individual worker exposures will be maintained within
acceptable limits by the existing ``as-low-as-reasonably-achievable'' (ALARA) program, which controls access
to radiation areas. The ALARA program at Peach Bottom has been instrumental in the lowering of annual collective doses
at the plant over the past several years. Since 1985, the three-year average dose at Peach Bottom 2 and 3 has decreased
by approximately 70 percent.

The licensee stated that the original accident radiological consequence analyses could not be exactly reconstituted
and, therefore, the reconstituted analyses were performed using methodology described in the updated final safety
analysis report (UFSAR) with the original licensing basis assumptions at 3528 MWt (102 percent of the uprated power
level). The licensee's reconstituted analyses indicate the calculated offsite radiological consequence doses
are within the dose reference values given in 10 CFR Part 100 and also meet the control room operator dose limit given
in 10 CFR 50, Appendix A, General Design Criteria (GDC) 19.

In the Peach Bottom operating license safety evaluation report issued in August 1972 (Safety Evaluation of the Peach
Bottom Atomic Power Station Units 2 & 3, Docket Nos: 50-277, 50-278'' issued by the Atomic Energy Commission,
dated August 11, 1972), the staff performed an independent radiological consequence analyses at 3440 MWt (105 percent
of current power level). The staff believes that, in general, offsite and control room operator doses will increase
proportionally to the increase in power level. Therefore, the staff did not recalculate the offsite and control room
operator doses resulting from a postulated design basis loss of coolant accident (which is the controlling design
basis accident (DBA)). Instead, the staff proportionally increased the doses based on power levels using the same
licensing basis assumptions used in 1972 and compared them with the licensee's reconstituted calculation (See Table
1 below). Neither the staff nor the licensee included radiation doses resulting from (1) main steam line isolation
valve leakages and (2) SGTS fission-product bypass during the reactor building pressure drawdown time following
a DBA, since they were not included in the original licensing basis assumptions.

Note 1

 Safety Evaluation for Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station Units 2 and 3 (August 1972)





Note 2

 Uprated based on power ratio




Based on a review of the licensee's major assumptions and methodology used in their reconstituted dose calculations
and the staff's original safety evaluation, the staff finds that the offsite radiological consequences and control
room operator doses at uprated 3528 MWt still remain below 10 CFR Part 100 dose reference values and GDC 19 dose limit
and the increase in radiological consequences is very minor.

It is expected that the increased energy requirements associated with operation at uprated power will require an
increase in the reload fuel enrichment and will result in increased burnup. The NRC previously evaluated the environmental
impacts associated with burnup values of up to 60,000 MWd/MT with fuel enrichments up to 5% 

235

U (published in the 

Federal Register

, 53 FR 6040 dated February 29, 1988). The staff concluded that the environmental impacts associated with Table S-3
of 10 CFR 51.51, ``Uranium Fuel Cycle Environmental Data,'' and Table S-4 of 10 CFR 51.52, ``Environmental Effects
of Transportation of Fuel and Waste,'' are conservative and bound the corresponding impacts for burnup levels of
up to 60,000 MWd/MtU and 

235

U enrichments up to 5 percent by weight. In the September 30, 1994 submittal, the licensee indicated that while fuel
burnup and enrichment levels may increase as a result of operation at uprated power, the burnup and enrichment will
remain within the 5% enrichment and 60,000 MWd/MT value previously evaluated by the staff. Based on the above cited
environmental assessment and the licensee's statements regarding expected burnup and enrichment values, the staff
concludes that the environmental effects of increased fuel cycle and transportation activity as a result of operation
at uprated power levels are not significant.

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's re-evaluation of the potential radiological and non-radiological environmental
impacts for the proposed action. On the basis of the review described above, the NRC staff finds that the radiological
and non-radiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed small increase in power are very small
and do not change the conclusion in the FES that the operation of Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station, Units 2 and 3, would
cause no significant adverse impact upon the quality of the human environment.
Accordingly, the Commission concludes that this proposed action would result in no significant radiological or
non-radiological environmental impact.


Alternatives to the Proposed Action


Since the Commission has concluded there is no measurable environmental impact associated with the proposed action,
any alternatives with equal or greater environmental impact need not be evaluated.
The principal alternative to the action would be to deny the request. Such action would not significantly reduce the
environmental impact of plant operation but would restrict operation of Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station, Units
2 and 3 to the currently licensed power level and prevent the facility from generating the additional 60 MWe that is
obtainable from the existing plant design.


Alternative Use of Resources


This action does not involve the use of any resources not previously considered in the ``Final Environmental Statement
related to the operation of Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station, Units 2 and 3,'' dated April 1973.


Agencies and Persons Consulted


The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's request and consulted with the Bureau of Radiation Protection, Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Resources, regarding the environmental impact of the proposed action. The State official
had no comments regarding NRC's proposed action.


Finding of No Significant Impact


Based upon the environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant
effect on the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental
impact statement for the proposed action.
For further details with respect to the proposed action, see the licensee's letter dated June 23, 1993, as supplemented
by letters dated April 5, May 2, June 6, June 8, June 29, July 6 (two letters), July 7, July 20, July 28 (two letters), September
16, 1994 and September 30, 1994, which are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room,
The Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room located at the
State Library of Pennsylvania, Government Publications Section, (REGIONAL DEPOSITORY) Education Building, Walnut
Street and Commonwealth Avenue, Box 1601, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania 17105.

Pertaining to the Emergency Response Data System Between the State of New Hampshire Office of Emergency Management
and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
I. Authority


The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the State of New Hampshire enter into this AGREEMENT under the authority
of Section 274i of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.

New Hampshire recognizes the Federal Government, primarily the NRC, as having the exclusive authority and responsibility
to regulate the radiological and national security aspects of the construction and operation of nuclear production
or utilization facilities, except for certain authority over air emissions granted to States by the Clean Air Act.



II. Background


A. The Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended, authorize the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (NRC) to license and regulate, among other activities, the manufacture, construction, and
operation of utilization facilities (nuclear power plants) in order to assure common defense and security and to
protect the public health and safety. Under these statutes, the NRC is the responsible agency regulating nuclear
power plant safety.

B. NRC believes that its mission to protect the public health and safety can be served by a policy of cooperation with
State governments and has formally adopted a policy statement on ``Cooperation with State at Commercial Nuclear
Power Plants and Other Nuclear Production or Utilization Facilities'' (54 FR 7530, February 22, 1989). The policy
statement provides that NRC will consider State proposals to enter into instruments of cooperation for certain programs
when these programs have provisions to ensure close cooperation with NRC. This agreement is intended to be consistent
with, and implement the provisions of the NRC's policy statement.

C. NRC fulfills its statutory mandate to regulate nuclear power plant safety by, among other things, responding to
emergencies at licensee's facilities and monitoring the status and adequacy of the licensee's responses to emergency
situations.

D. New Hampshire fulfills its statutory mandate to provide for preparedness, response, mitigation, and recovery
in the event of an accident at a nuclear power plant through the New Hampshire Radiological Emergency Response Plan.

A. This Agreement defines the way in which NRC and New Hampshire will cooperate in planning and maintaining the capability
to transfer reactor plant data via the Emergency Response Data System during emergencies at nuclear power plants
in the State of New Hampshire. 
B. It is understood by the NRC and the State of New Hampshire that ERDS data will only be transmitted by a licensee during
emergencies classified at the Alert level or above, during scheduled tests, or during exercises when available.
C. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to restrict or expand the statutory authority of NRC, the State of New Hampshire
or to affect or otherwise alter the terms of any agreement in effect under the authority of Section 274b of the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended; not is anything in this Agreement intended to restrict or expand the authority of the
State of New Hampshire on matters not within the scope of this Agreement.

D. Nothing in this Agreement confers upon the State or New Hampshire authority to (1) interpret or modify NRC regulations
and NRC requirements imposed on the licensee; (2) take enforcement actions; (3) issue confirmatory letters; (4)
amend, modify, or revoke a license issued by NRC; or (5) direct or recommend nuclear power plant employees to take or
not to take any action. Authority for all such actions is reserved exclusively to the NRC.


IV. NRC's General Responsibilities



Under this Agreement, NRC is responsible for maintaining the Emergency Response Data System (ERDS). ERDS is a system
designed to receive, store, and re-transmit data from in-plant data systems at nuclear power plants during emergencies.
The NRC will provide user access to ERDS data to one user terminal for the State of New Hampshire during emergencies
at nuclear power plants which have implemented an ERDS interface and for which any portion of the plant's 10 mile Emergency
Planning Zone (EPZ) lies within the State of New Hampshire. The NRC agrees to provide unique software already available
to NRC (not commercially available) that was developed under NRC contract for configuring an ERDS workstation.



V. New Hampshire's General Responsibilities



A. New Hampshire will, in cooperation with the NRC, establish a capability to receive ERDS data. To this end, New Hampshire
will provide the necessary computer hardware and commercially licensed software required for ERDS data transfer
to users.

B. New Hampshire agrees not to use ERDS to access data from nuclear power plants for which a portion of the 10 mile Emergency
Planning Zone does not fall within its State boundary. Clarification of ERDS data will be pursued through the NRC.



VI. Implementation



New Hampshire and the NRC agree to work in concert to assure that the following communications and information exchange
protocol regarding the NRC ERDS are followed.

A. New Hampshire and the NRC agree in good faith to make available to each other information within the intent and scope
of this Agreement.

B. NRC and New Hampshire agree to meet as necessary to exchange information on matters of common concern pertinent
to this Agreement. Unless otherwise agreed, such meetings will be held in the NRC Operations Center. The affected
utilities will be kept informed of pertinent information covered by this Agreement.

C. To preclude the premature public release of sensitive information, NRC and New Hampshire will protect sensitive
information to the extent permitted by the Federal Freedom of Information Act, the State Freedom of Information Act,
10 CFR 2.790, and other applicable authority.

D. NRC will conduct periodic tests of licensee ERDS data links. A copy of the test schedule will be provided to New Hampshire
by the NRC. New Hampshire may test its ability to access ERDS data during these scheduled tests, or may schedule independent
tests of the State link with the NRC. 

E. NRC will provide access to ERDS for emergency exercises with reactor units capable of transmitting exercise data
to ERDS. For exercises in which the NRC is not participating, New Hampshire will coordinate with NRC in advance to ensure
ERDS availability. NRC reserves the right to preempt ERDS use for any exercise in progress in the event of an actual
event at any licensed nuclear power plant.



VII. Contacts


A. The principal senior management contacts for this Agreement will be the Director, Incident Response Division,
Office for Analysis and Evaluation of Operational Data, and the Chief, Technological Hazard Section of the New Hampshire
Office of Emergency Management. These individuals may designate appropriate staff representatives for the purpose
of administering this Agreement.

B. Identification of these contacts is not intended to restrict communications between NRC and New Hampshire staff
members on technical and other day-to-day activities.

A. If disagreements arise about matters within the scope of this Agreement, NRC and New Hampshire will work together
to resolve these differences.


B. Resolution of differences between the State of New Hampshire and NRC staff over issues arising out of this Agreement
will be the initial responsibility of the NRC Incident Response Division management.

C. Differences which cannot be resolved in accordance with Sections VIII.A and VIII.B will be reviewed and resolved
by the Director, Office of Analysis and Evaluation of Operational Data.

D. The NRC's General Counsel has the final authority to provide legal interpretation of the Commission's regulations.


IX. Effective Date



This Agreement will take effect after it has been signed by both parties.



X. Duration


A formal review, not less than one (1) year after the effective date, will be performed by the NRC to evaluate implementation
of the Agreement and resolve any problems identified. This Agreement will be subject to periodic reviews and may be
amended or modified upon written agreement by both parties, and may be terminated upon 30 days written notice by either
party.



XI. Separability



If any provision(s) of this Agreement, or the application of any provision(s) to any person or circumstances is held
invalid, the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provisions to other persons or circumstances
will not be affected.

<USDEPT>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION</USDEPT>





Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the American Stock Exchange, Inc., Relating
to the Off-Site Storage of Customer Options Account Information


October 7, 1994.


Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on September 12, 1994, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III
below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice
to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.


I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


Currently, paragraph (b), ``Maintenance of Customer Records,'' of Amex Rule 922, ``Supervision of Accounts,''
requires that background and financial information of customers who have been approved for options transactions
be maintained at both the branch office servicing the customer's account and at the principal supervisory office
with jurisdiction over the branch office. Amex Rule 922(b) also requires that copies of account statements be maintained
at both the branch office supervising the accounts and at the principal supervisory office with jurisdiction over
the branch for the most recent six-month period. The Amex proposes to amend Exchange Rule 922(b) to provide that the
customer information and account statements currently maintained at the principal supervisory office may be maintained
at a location other than the principal supervisory office if the documents and information are readily accessible
and promptly retrievable.
The text of the proposal is available at the Office of the Secretary, Amex, and at the Commission.


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.


(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


(a) Purpose


Presently, the rules of all the options exchanges and the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'')
uniformly require that both the branch office servicing an options customer's account and the principal supervisory
office having jurisdiction over the branch office retain account statements and other financial and background
information for the account for supervisory purposes. With the advances in data storage and retrieval capability
available through optical disks, fax machines, microfiche and computer, coupled with the escalating costs of storing
records on-site, many member organizations prefer to store documents away from their principal supervisory offices.
In this connection, an increasing number of member organizations have asked and received permission from the self-regulatory
organizations (``SROs'') to store the required customer option account documents off-site so long as they are readily
accessible and promptly retrievable. In view of the number of requests received by the SROs to store customer options
information off-site, the Options Self-Regulatory Council (``OSRC'')
 has asked each of the options exchanges and the NASD to consider amending their rules to permit the principal supervisory
office to store customer account information off-site.




The Exchange believes that these off-site storage arrangements are consistent with the record retention requirement
rules, provided the documents are readily accessible and promptly retrievable. In this regard, the proposed rule
will not compromise the supervisory obligations of a member firm since the firm will still be required to maintain
customer option account documents and information at the branch office servicing the customer's account. To ensure
compliance with the provisions of the rule, the Amex states that it will periodically examine the document retrieval
capabilities of member firms using off-site document storage arrangements.


(b) Basis

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941017-2-00081 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941017-2-00054 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Amex believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and furthers
the objectives of Section 6(b)(5), in particular, in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts
and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons
engaged in facilitating transactions in securities and to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free
and open market and a national market system.



(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The Amex does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition.



(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others



No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



Within 35 days after the publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reason for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:

(a) By order approve such proposed rule change, or

(b) institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.



IV. Solicitation of Comments




Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC. Copies of such filing will also be available for
inspection and copying at the principal office of the above-mentioned self-regulatory organization. All submissions
should refer to the file number in the caption above and should be submitted by November 7, 1994.





For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change and Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated
Approval of Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 to the Proposed Rule Change by the American Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating to Exercise
Cut-Off Procedures for Expiring Equity Options</DOCTITLE>





October 7, 1994.




Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 on January 11, 1994, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and
Exchange Commission (``Commission'') a proposed rule change relating to the exercise procedures for expiring equity
option contracts. The proposal was published for comment in the 

Federal Register

 on February 18, 1994.
 No comments were received on the proposed rule change. The Amex filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposal on September 22,
1994, and Amendment No. 2 on October 5, 1994.
 This order approves the proposed rule change, as amended.











Currently, with regard to expiring equity options, Amex customers and member organizations
 are required to indicate their exercise decisions to clearing members no later than 5:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time
(``E.S.T.'') on the business day immediately prior to the expiration date of the options (``Exercise Cut-Off-Time'').
 This is the latest time by which an exercise instruction
 may be: (1) prepared by a clearing member for positions in its proprietary trading account; (2) accepted by a clearing
member from a non-clearing member; or (3) accepted by a member organization from any customer.
 The only exceptions to Rule 980 are: (1) to remedy mistakes made in good faith; (2) to take appropriate action as the
result of a failure to reconcile unmatched Exchange option transactions; and (3) where exceptional circumstances
relating to a customer's ability to communicate exercise instructions to a member organization (or a member organization's
ability to receive such exercise instructions) prior to the Exercise Cut-Off Time warrant such action.
 Member organizations are required to prepare a memorandum of every exercise instruction received from a customer
stating the time when such instruction was received. If a member organization receives an exercise instruction or
tenders an exercise notice to the OCC pursuant to one of the exceptions described above, the member organization must
maintain a memorandum setting forth the circumstances giving rise to the exception. If the member organization is
relying on either the first or third exception described above, it must promptly file a copy of the memorandum with
the Exchange.

<TEXT>
 

Presently, it is a violation of Rule 980 for clearing members to accept exercise instructions after the Exercise Cut-Off
Time, except in reliance on one of the above exceptions. Because exercise instructions are submitted to the clearing
members and then to the OCC by the clearing members, without having the audit trail pass directly through the Exchange,
it is difficult for the Exchange to surveil for violations of Rule 980.






In order to enhance the ability of the Exchange to surveil for violations of Rule 980 for expiring equity options, the
proposed rule change would alter the existing exercise instruction procedures by requiring that final exercise
decisions also be submitted to the Exchange. The clearing members would still be responsible for delivering exercise
notices to the OCC,
 however, the proposed rule change would allow the Exchange to accurately document when each exercise instruction
was received by a member organization or clearing member, or delivered by a clearing member to the OCC.
 The Exercise Cut-Off Time will still be 5:30 p.m. (E.S.T.) on the business day immediately prior to the expiration
date. Pursuant to the proposal, however, there will be two means of exercising an expiring equity option: (1) take
no action and allow exercise determinations to be made in accordance with OCC Rule 805;
 or (2) the member organization may submit a contrary exercise advice (

i.e.,

 a notice committing an option holder either to exercise an option that would not otherwise be exercised automatically
pursuant to OCC Rule 805, or not exercise an option that otherwise would be exercised automatically pursuant to OCC
Rule 805) (``Contrary Exercise Advice''). Contrary Exercise Advices would be submitted by a member organization
either: (1) at a place designated for that purpose by any national options exchange of which the member organization
is a member and where the option is listed; or (2) to the Exchange via the OCC in a format prescribed by the OCC.
 In those instances where OCC Rule 805 has been waived by the OCC,
 the proposal requires that a Contrary Exercise Advice be submitted prior to the Exercise Cut-Off Time by member organizations
wishing to exercise an options that would not have been automatically exercised had the exercise-by-exception procedure
been in effect, or not to exercise an option that would have been automatically exercised had the exercise-by-exception
procedure been in effect.
 The applicable underlying security price in such instances will be as described in OCC Rule 805(l), which will normally
be the last sale price in the primary market for the underlying security.












The proposal would also require member organizations that maintain proprietary or public customer account positions
in expiring options to be responsible for ensuring that final exercise decisions are indicated to the Exchange regarding
such positions.
 In addition, member organizations which have accepted the responsibility to indicate final exercise decisions
on behalf of another member organization or non-member firm shall take necessary steps to ensure that such decisions
are properly indicated.
 Member organizations may establish an internal processing cut-off time prior to 5:30 p.m. (E.S.T.) at which time
final exercise decisions from their customers will no longer be accepted by them for expiring options.








With certain minor modifications, the proposal maintains the current exceptions to Rule 980. The proposal, however,
adds language to Rule 980(b) to expressly state that the burden of establishing an exception to the Exercise Cut-Off
Time for a proprietary or customer account of a member organization rests solely on the member organization seeking
to rely on such exception.

<DOCNO> FR941017-2-00084 </DOCNO>

<TEXT>
 

In the event a member organization does not timely submit a Contrary Exercise Advice in accordance with the proposed
procedures, or does not timely submit a Contrary Exercise Advice pursuant to an exception, the responsible member
organization must prepare a written memorandum describing the surrounding circumstances
 and must file a copy of the memorandum with the Exchange's Market Surveillance Department no later than 12:00 p.m.
(E.S.T.) on the business day following that expiration.







Finally, the proposal makes clear that the requirements specified in the Rule 980 only apply to expiring equity options
listed on the Exchange.






The Commission believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder applicable to national securities exchanges, particularly, Section 6(b)(5) of the
Act.
 Specifically, the Commission believes the Exchange's proposal is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative
acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with
persons engaged in facilitating transactions in securities, and to protect investors and the public interest.





Although all options exchanges currently have a uniform 5:30 p.m. (E.S.T.) Exercise Cut-Off Time on Expiration Fridays
for expiring equity options, the OCC's rules permit the OCC to accept exercise notices for expiring equity options
from clearing firms until 12:00 a.m. (E.S.T.) on the expiration date (

i.e.

, the Saturday after an Expiration Friday). This additional time within which to receive exercise notices from clearing
members was provided to accommodate corrections of mistakes made in good faith, trade reconciliations, and certain
exceptional circumstances that affected a customer's ability to inform its brokerage firm or affected a firm's ability
to receive final exercise decisions before the Exercise Cut-Off Time. Nevertheless, there have been situations
where member organizations have either delayed making exercise decisions until after 5:30 p.m. (E.S.T.) on Expiration
Friday in anticipation of the release of material news concerning a particular underlying company, or having made
decisions prior to 5:30 p.m. (E.S.T.), changed these decisions based upon such material news.
 In this regard, the Commission believes that it is consistent with this approval for the Exchange to interpret its
rules to deem the submission of a Contrary Exercise Advice on the basis of material information released after the
Exercise Cut-Off Time as activity inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade.







The Commission believes that the proposed exercise procedures should enhance the Exchange's ability to surveil
for violations of Rule 980 by providing an enhanced audit trail for identifying late exercises. Specifically, every
time an exercise decision is made contrary to OCC Rule 805, a Contrary Exercise Advice must be filed with the Exchange,
in addition to the current procedure of submitting an exercise instruction to a clearing member as is currently required.
 Similarly, the proposal requires that documentation must be prepared and submitted to the proper options exchange
whenever a late exercise decision is made in reliance on one of the exceptions to Rule 980, with the burden of establishing
the existence of the exception on the party submitting the Contrary Exercise Advice. The proposed rule change, therefore,
should facilitate the Exchange's ability to monitor and enforce compliance with Rule 980. Accordingly, because
the proposed rule change significantly bolsters the Exchange's existing procedures regarding the exercise of expiring
equity options and helps to ensure compliance with their rules, the Commission believes that the proposal is consistent
with the Act.

<PARENT> FR941017-2-00055 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Even though the proposed rule change significantly improves the Exchange's audit trail with respect to late exercises,
the Commission believes that the Exchange should continue to examine ways of ensuring compliance with the Exercise
Cut-Off Time and the other requirements of Rule 980.
 Furthermore, the Commission also encourages the Exchange to review the permitted exceptions to Rule 980 and consider
ways of establishing parameters as to the extent of the exceptions.







The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 to the proposal prior to the thirtieth day after
the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the 

Federal Register

. Specifically, the Commission believes that Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 to the proposal, as discussed above, clarify the
application of the rule and may serve to minimize confusion and disputes between and among members and customers as
to the application of this rule. Additionally, the original proposal was noticed for the full comment period without
any comments being received by the Commission. Accordingly, the Commission believes that it is consistent with Section
6(b)(5) of the Act to approve Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 to the proposed rule change on an accelerated basis.

Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 to the
proposed rule change. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities
and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submissions, all subsequent
amendments, all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and
all written communications relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than
those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection
and copying at the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies
of such filings will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of the Amex. All submissions
should refer to File No. SR-Amex-94-01 and should be submitted by November 7, 1994.



It is therefore ordered

, Pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 
 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-Amex-94-01), as amended, is hereby approved.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by Boston Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating
to Its Specialist Performance Evaluation Program</DOCTITLE>



October 11, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on October 3, 1994, as subsequently amended on October 6, 1994,
 the Boston Stock Exchange, Inc. (``BSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''
or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which Items have been prepared by the
self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule
change from interested persons.





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The BSE seeks a twelve-month extension of its Specialist Performance Evaluation Program (``SPEP'').






II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



1. Purpose



The purpose of the proposed rule change is to incorporate certain objective measures into the Exchange's SPEP. The
evaluation program, using the BEACON system,
 looks at all incoming orders routed to a specialist for execution. A record of all action on these orders is accumulated
in a separate file, from which four calculations are run.

<DOCNO> FR941017-2-00087 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941017-2-00056 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Selection criteria for eligible orders include regular buy and sell market and marketable limit orders only. Orders
marked buy minus or sell plus are excluded, as are crosses and all orders with qualifiers (

e.g., 

market-on-close, stop, stop limit, all or none, etc.). The order entry date must equal the order execution date.
For each of the measures, including the Specialist Performance Evaluation Questionnaire (``SPEQ''), a ten-point
scale will be applied to a range of scores. Based on the raw score for each measure, the respective specialist will receive
an associated score between one and ten points, which will be weighted as indicated for each measure.
The first measure is Turnaround Time, which calculates the average number of seconds for all eligible orders, based
on the number of seconds between the receipt of a guaranteed market or marketable limit order (

i.e., 

for 1, 299 shares or less)
 in BEACON and the execution, partial execution, stopping or cancellation of the order. An order that is moved from
the auto-ex screen to the manual screen will accumulate time until executed, partially executed, stopped or canceled.
This calculation will not be in effect until the individual stock has opened on the primary market. Certain situations,
such as trading halts and periods where the BEACON system is off auto-ex floorwide, will result in blocks of time being
excluded from the calculation. A specialist who averaged a raw score of 25 seconds will receive 7 points since it falls
in the 21 to 25 second range. This calculation will comprise 15% of the overall evaluation program.






The second measure is Holding Orders Without Action, which measures the number of market and marketable limit orders
(all sizes included)
 that are held without action for greater than twenty-five (25) seconds. As in the Turnaround Time calculation, a stop,
cancellation, execution or partial execution stops the clock. The same exclusions which apply in the Turnaround
Time calculation also apply here.
 Thus if a specialist receives a total of 100 market and marketable limit orders and holds ten (10) of them for more than
25 seconds, his/her raw score of 10% would receive 9 points since it falls in the 6 to 10 percent range. This calculation
will comprise 15% of the overall evaluation program.







The third measure is Trading Between the Quote, which measures the number of market and marketable limit orders that
are executed between the best consolidated bid and offer where the spread is greater than 1/8th. Thus if a specialist
receives ten market and marketable limit orders where the spread between the best consolidated bid and offer is greater
than 1/8th, and such specialist executes five of the orders between the bid and offer, his/her raw score would be 50%
and would receive 9 points since it falls in the 46 to 50 percent range. This calculation will comprise 25% of the overall
evaluation program.

The fourth measure is Executions in Size Greater than BBO, which measures the number of market and marketable limit
orders which exceed ether BBO size and are executed in size larger than the BBO size. Thus if a specialist receives a
total of 10 market and marketable limit orders which exceed the BBO size and executes nine of the orders in size larger
than the BBO size, his/her raw score would be 90% and would receive 8 points since it falls in the 86 to 90 percent range.
This calculation will comprise 25% of the overall evaluation program.






In addition, several changes have been made to the questionnaire (SPEQ) in view of the adoption of the objective measures
which have made some questions obsolete. The minimum acceptance raw score for each question remains at 4.5. Thus if
a specialist receives a raw score of 4.5 for each question for a weighted raw score (based on the weights for each question
within the questionnaire) of 50.0052, he/she would receive 4 points since it falls in the 50 to 54 weighted raw score
range. The questionnaire will comprise 20% of the overall evaluation program.






Using the examples for each measure above, the following weighted point totals would result in an overall program
score of 7.45:






The rule has been amended to reflect that any specialist who is deficient
 in any one of the objective measures for two out of three consecutive review periods will be required to appear before
the Performance Improvement Action Committee to discuss ways of improving performance. If performance does not
improve in the subsequent period, the specialist will appear before the Market Performance Committee for appropriate
action, as described below.







Any specialist who falls below the threshold level for the overall evaluation program for two out of three consecutive
review periods will be required to appear before the Market Performance Committee and the Committee will take action
to address the deficient performance as provided for in Paragraph 2156.10-.60.
 A specialist who is ranked in the bottom ten percent of the overall evaluation program but who is above the threshold
level for the overall program will be subject to staff review to determine if there is sufficient reason to warrant
informing the Performance Improvement Action Committee of potential performance problems.





The following threshold scores have been set at which a specialist will be deemed to have adequately performed:





Overall Evaluation Score_at or above weighted score of 5.80
Turnaround Time_below 21.0 seconds (8 points)
Holding Orders Without Action_below 21.0% (7 points)
Trading Between the Quote_at or above 26.0% (5 points)
Executions in Size >BBO_at or above 76.0% (6 points)
Questionnaire_at or above weighted score of 50 (4 points)




Due to the subjectiveness of the questionnaire, a specialist who is deficient on the questionnaire alone will be subject
to review by Exchange staff to determine if there is sufficient reason to warrant informing the Performance Improvement
Action Committee of potential performance problems. However, a deficient score on the questionnaire may result
in performance improvement action where it lowers the overall program score below 5.80.

The Exchange requests an extension of the current pilot program for a twelve-month period to begin on January 1, 1995.
This twelve-month period will enable the Exchange to further evaluate the appropriateness of the measures and their
respective weights, as well as the effectiveness of the overall evaluation program.



2. Statutory Basis



The basis under the Act for the proposed rule change is Section 6(b)(5) in that the SPEP results weigh heavily in stock
allocation decisions and, as a result, specialists are encouraged to improve their market quality and administrative
duties, thereby promoting just and equitable principles of trade and aiding in the perfection of a free and open market
and a natural market system.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



No burden on competition is perceived by the adoption of the proposed rule change.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change and Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated
Approval of Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 to the Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. Relating
to Exercise Cut-Off Procedures for Expiring Equity Options</DOCTITLE>


October 7, 1994.



Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'').
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 on March 16, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') a proposed rule change relating to the exercise procedures for expiring
equity option contracts. The proposal was published for comment in the 

Federal Register

 on May 18, 1994.
 No comments were received on the proposed rule change. The CBOE filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposal on September 19,
1994, and Amendment No. 2 on October 5, 1994.
 This order approves the proposed rule change, as amended.










Currently, with regard to expiring equity options, CBOE customers and member organizations
 are required to indicate their exercise decisions to clearing members no later than 5:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time
(``E.S.T.'') on the business day immediately prior to the expiration date of the options (``Exercise Cut-Off Time'').
 This is the latest time at which an exercise instruction
 may be: (1) Prepared by a clearing member for positions in its proprietary trading account; (2) accepted by a clearing
member from a market maker or floor broker for positions in the market maker's account or the floor broker's error account;
or (3) accepted by a member organization from any customer for positions in the customer's account.
 The only exceptions to Rule 11.1 are: (1) To remedy mistakes or errors made in good faith; (2) to take appropriate action
as the result of a failure to reconcile unmatched Exchange transactions; and (3) where exceptional circumstances
relating to a customer's or member's ability to communicate exercise instructions to a member organization (or a
member organization's ability to receive such exercise instructions) prior to the Exercise Cut-Off Time warrant
such action.
 An exercise instruction memorandum must be prepared and time stamped for the exercise of all option contracts not
automatically exercised pursuant to OCC Rule 805.
 If a member organization receives an exercise instruction or tenders an exercise notice to the OCC pursuant to one
of the exceptions described above, the member organization must maintain a memorandum setting forth the circumstances
giving rise to the exception.












Presently, it is a violation of Rule 11.1 for clearing members to accept exercise instructions after the Exercise
Cut-Off Time, except in reliance on one of the above exceptions. Because exercise instructions are submitted to the
clearing members and then to the OCC by the clearing members, without having the audit trail pass directly through
the Exchange, it is difficult for the Exchange to surveil for violations of Rule 11.1.

In order to enhance the ability of the Exchange to surveil for violations of Rule 11.1 for expiring equity options,
the proposed rule change would alter the existing exercise instruction procedures by requiring that final exercise
decisions also be submitted to the Exchange. The clearing members would still be responsible for delivering exercise
notices to the OCC, however, the proposed rule change would allow the Exchange to accurately document when each exercise
instruction was received by a member organization or clearing member, or delivered by a clearing member to the OCC.
 The Exercise Cut-Off Time will still be 5:30 p.m. (E.S.T.) on the business day immediately prior to the expiration
date. Pursuant to the proposal, however, there will be two means of exercising an expiring equity option: (1) Take
no action and allow exercise determinations to be made in accordance with OCC Rule 805;
 or (2) the market maker, floor broker, or clearing member, as applicable, must submit a contrary exercise advice (

i.e., 

a notice committing an option holder either to exercise an option that would not otherwise be exercised automatically
pursuant to OCC Rule 805, or not exercise an option that otherwise would be exercised automatically pursuant to OCC
Rule 805) (``Contrary Exercise Advice''). Contrary Exercise Advice would be submitted by a market maker, floor broker,
or clearing member either: (1) In such form or manner prescribed by the Exchange to a place designated by the Exchange;
or (2) to the Exchange via the OCC in a format prescribed by the OCC.
 In those instances where OCC Rule 805 has been waived by the OCC,
 the proposal requires that a Contrary Exercise Advice be submitted prior to the Exercise Cut-Off Time by member organizations
wishing to exercise an option that would not have been automatically exercised had the exercise-by-exception procedures
been in place, or not to exercise an option that would have been automatically exercised had the exercise-by-exception
procedure been in place.
 The applicable underlying security price in such instances will normally be the last sale price in the primary market
for the underlying security.










The proposal would also require that members properly communicate to the Exchange final exercise decisions in respect
of positions for which they are responsible.
 Member organizations may establish an internal processing cut-off time prior to 5:30 p.m. (E.S.T) at which time final
exercise decisions from their customers will no longer be accepted by them for expiring options.






The proposal maintains the current exceptions to Rule 11.1. The proposal, however amends Rule 11.1(b) to provide
that the Exercise Cut-Off Time is the latest time at which an exercise instruction may be submitted by a market maker
or floor broker to (rather than accepted by) a clearing member. As a result of this change, the CBOE will interpret Rule
11.1(b) as placing the burden of establishing an exception to the Exercise Cut-Off Time solely on the member organization
seeking to rely on such exception.








In the event a member organization makes a final exercise decision after the Exercise Cut-Off Time in reliance on one
of the above exceptions, the responsible member organization must prepare a written memorandum describing the surrounding
circumstances and must promptly file a copy of the memorandum with the Exchange.





Furthermore, in order to highlight the seriousness of violating Rule 11.1, the proposed rule language would expressly
state that affecting an exercise decision in an expiring equity option on the basis of material information obtained
after the Exercise Cut-Off Time is considered to be activity inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade.





The proposal also provides that the failure of any member to follow the proposed procedures may be referred to the Exchange's
Business Conduct Committee and result in the assessment of a fine, which may include, but is not limited to, disgorgement
of potential economic gain obtained or loss avoided by the subject exercise, as determined by the Business Conduct
Committee.

Finally, the proposal makes clear that the requirements specified in the Rule 11.1 only apply to expiring equity options
listed on the Exchange.





The Commission believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder applicable to national securities exchanges, particularly, Section 6(b)(5) of the
Act.
 Specifically, the Commission believes the Exchange's proposal is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative
acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with
persons engaged in facilitating transactions in securities, and to protect investors and the public interest.




Although all options exchanges currently have a uniform 5:30 p.m. (E.S.T.) Exercise Cut-Off Time on Expiration Fridays
for expiring equity options, the OCC's rules permit the OCC to accept exercise notices for expiring equity options
from clearing firms until 12:00 a.m. (E.S.T.) on the expiration date (

i.e.

, the Saturday after an Expiration Friday). This additional time within which to receive exercise notices from clearing
members was provided to accommodate corrections of mistakes made in good faith, trade reconciliations, and certain
exceptional circumstances that affected a customer's ability to inform its brokerage firm or affected a firm's ability
to receive final exercise decisions before the Exercise Cut-Off Time. Nevertheless, there have been situations
where member organizations have either delayed making exercise decisions until after 5:30 p.m. (E.S.T.) on Expiration
Friday in anticipation of the release of material news concerning a particular underlying company, or having made
decisions prior to 5:30 p.m. (E.S.T.), changed these decisions based upon such material news.
 In this regard, the Commission believes that it is appropriate for the Exchange to make it clear in its rules that the
submission of a Contrary Exercise Advice on the basis of material information released after the Exercise Cut-Off
Time will be activity deemed inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade.






The Commission believes that the proposed exercise procedures should enhance the Exchange's ability to surveil
for violations of Rule 11.1 by providing an enhanced audit trail for identifying late exercises. Specifically, every
time an exercise decision is made contrary to OCC Rule 805, a Contrary Exercise Advice must be filed with the Exchange,
in addition to submitting an exercise instruction to a clearing member as is currently required.
 Similarly, the proposal requires that documentation must be prepared and submitted to the proper options exchange
whenever a late exercise decision is made in reliance on one of the exceptions to Rule 11.1, with the burden of establishing
the existence of the exception on the party submitting the Contrary Exercise Advice. The proposed rule change, therefore,
should facilitate the Exchange's ability to monitor and enforce compliance with Rule 11.1. Accordingly, because
the proposed rule change significantly bolsters the Exchange's existing procedures regarding the exercise of expiring
equity options and helps to ensure compliance with their rules, the Commission believes that the proposal is consistent
with the Act.






Even though the proposed rule change significantly improves the Exchange's audit trail with respect to late exercises,
the Commission believes that the Exchange should continue to examine ways of ensuring compliance with the Exercise
Cut-Off Time and the other requirements of Rule 11.1. In this regard, the Commission encourages the Exchange to review
the permitted exceptions to Rule 11.1 and consider ways of establishing parameters as to the extent of the exceptions.





The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 to the proposal prior to the thirtieth day after
the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the 

Federal Register

. Specifically, the Commission believes that Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 to the proposal, as discussed above, clarify the
application of the rule and may serve to minimize confusion and disputes between and among members and customers as
to the application of this rule. Additionally, the original proposal was noticed for the full comment period without
any comments being received by the Commission. Accordingly, the Commission believes that it is consistent with Section
6(b)(5) of the Act to approve Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 to the proposed rule change on an accelerated basis.
Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 to the
proposed rule change. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities
and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submissions, all subsequent
amendments, all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and
all written communications relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than
those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection
and copying at the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies
of such filings will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of the CBOE. All submissions
should refer to File No. SR-CBOE-94-06 and should be submitted by November 7, 1994.
It Is Therefore Ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-CBOE-94-06), as amended, is hereby approved.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change and Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated
Approval of Amendment Nos. 1, 2, and 3 to the Proposed Rule Change by the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating to Exercise
Cut-Off Procedures for Expiring Equity Options</DOCTITLE>



October 11, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``ACT''),
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 on March 23, 1994, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange
Commission (``Commission'') a proposed rule change relating to the exercise procedures for expiring equity option
contracts. The proposal was published for comment in the 

Federal Register

 on May 18, 1994.
 No comments were received on the proposed rule change. The NYSE filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposal on September 19,
1994, Amendment No. 2 on September 27, 1994, and Amendment No. 3 on October 7, 1994.
 This order approves the proposed rule change, as amended.










Currently, with regard to expiring equity options, NYSE customers and member organizations
 are required to indicate their exercise decisions to clearing members no later than 5:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time
(``E.S.T.'') on the business day immediately prior to the expiration date of the options (``Exercise Cut-Off Time'').
 This is the latest time by which an exercise instruction
 may be: (1) prepared by a clearing member for positions in its proprietary trading account; (2) accepted by a clearing
member from an options specialist or competitive options trader for positions is its account or from a floor broker
for positions in its error account; or (3) accepted by a member organization from any customer for positions in the
customer's account.
 The only exceptions to Rule 780 are: (1) to remedy mistakes or errors made in good faith (2) to take appropriate action
as the result of a failure to reconcile unmatched Exchange option transactions; and (3) where exceptional circumstances
relating to a customer's or member's ability to communicate exercise instructions to a member organization (or a
member organization's ability to receive such exercise instructions) prior to the Exercise Cut-Off Time warrant
such action.
 Member organizations are required to time stamp each exercise instruction at the time it is prepared.









Presently, it is a violation of Rule 780 for clearing members to accept instructions after the Exercise Cut-Off Time
except in reliance on one of the above exceptions. Because exercise instructions are submitted to the clearing members
and then to the OCC by the clearing members, without having the audit trail pass directly through the Exchange, it is
difficult for the Exchange to surveil for violations of Rule 780.






In order to enhance the ability of the Exchange to surveil for violations of Rule 780 for expiring equity option, the
proposed rule change would alter the existing exercise instruction procedures by requiring that final exercise
decisions also be submitted to the Exchange. The clearing members would still be responsible for delivering exercise
notices to the OCC,
 however, the proposed rule change would allow the Exchange to accurately document when each exercise instruction
was received by a member organization or clearing member, or delivered by a clearing member to the OCC.
 The Exercise Cut-Off Time will still be 5:30 p.m. (E.S.T.) on the business day immediately prior to the expiration
date. Pursuant to the proposal, however, there will be two means of exercising an expiring equity option: (1) take
no action and allow exercise determinations to be made in accordance with OCC Rule 805;
 or (2) the member organization may submit a contrary exercise advice (

i.e.

, a notice committing an option holder either to exercise an option that would not otherwise be exercised automatically
pursuant to OCC Rule 805, or not exercise an option that otherwise would be exercised automatically pursuant to OCC
Rule 805) (``Contrary Exercise Advice''). Contrary Exercise Advices would be submitted by a member organization
either: (1) at a place designated for that purpose by any national options exchange of which the member organization
is a member and where the option is listed; or (2) to the Exchange via the OCC in a format prescribed by the OCC.
 In those instances where OCC Rule 80-5 has been waived by the OCC,
 the proposal requires that a Contrary Exercise Advice be submitted prior to the Exercise Cut-Off Time by member organizations
wishing to exercise an option that would not be automatically exercised in the absence of such a waiver, or not to exercise
an option that would be automatically exercised in the absence of such a waiver.
 The applicable price of the underlying security in such instances shall be the last sale price in the primary market
for the underlying security, except as OCC Rule 805(l) otherwise provides.

<TEXT>
 

The proposal would also require member organizations that maintain proprietary or customer account positions in
expiring options to be responsible for ensuring that final exercise decisions are communicated to the Exchange regarding
such positions.
 In addition, member organizations which have accepted the responsibility to indicate final exercise decisions
on behalf of another member organization or non-member firm shall take reasonable steps to ensure that such decisions
are properly indicated to the Exchange. Member organizations may establish an internal processing cut-off time
prior to 5:30 p.m. (E.S.T.) at which time final exercise decisions from their customers will no longer be accepted
by them for expiring options.







With certain minor modifications, the proposal maintains the current exceptions to Rule 780. The proposal, however,
adds language to Rule 780(b) to expressly state that the burden of establishing an exception to the Exercise Cut-Off
Time rests solely on the member organization seeking to rely on such exception.

As proposed, each member organization shall prepare a memorandum of every final exercise decision for which a Contrary
Exercise Advice is required.
 In the event a member organization makes a final exercise decision after the Exercise Cut-Off Time in reliance on one
of the above exceptions, the responsible member organization must prepare a written memorandum describing the surrounding
circumstances and must file a copy of the memorandum with the Exchange's Market Surveillance Department not later
than 12:00 p.m. (E.S.T.) on the business day following that expiration.







The Commission believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder applicable to national securities exchanges, particularly, Section 6(b)(5) of the
Act.
 Specifically, the Commission believes the Exchange's proposal is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative
acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with

Friday in anticipation of the release of material news concerning a particular underlying company, or having made
decisions prior to 5:30 p.m. (E.S.T.), changed these decisions based upon such material news.
 In this regard, the Commission believes that it is consistent with this approval for the Exchange to interpret its
rules to deem the submission of a Contrary Exercise Advice on the basis of material information released after the
Exercise Cut-Off Time as activity inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade.







The Commission believes that the proposed exercise procedures should enhance the Exchange's ability to surveil

examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The PSE has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B), and
(C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



The Exchange is proposing to amend its Rule 6.24 in several respects. First, the Exchange is proposing to add a new Commentary
.04 to Rule 6.24 in order to incorporate a new exercise cut-off procedure for expiring equity options. Second, the
Exchange is proposing to add new commentary .05 to Rule 6.24 to address the responsibility for the submission of final
exercise decisions to the Exchange and to provide that member firms may establish internal processing cut-off times
prior to the Exercise Cut-Off Time (as defined herein).
 Third, the Exchange is proposing to add a new Commentary .06 to Rule 6.24 in order to address situations in which a member
submits or prepares an exercise instruction after the 5:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time (``E.S.T.'') exercise cut-off
time (``Exercise Cut-Off Time'') in an expiring equity option on the basis of material information that is released
after the Exercise Cut-Off Time.
 Finally, the Exchange proposes to modify subsection (b) of Rule 6.24 to clarify that the provisions of Rule 6.24 only
apply to non-cash settled equity option contracts.






More specifically, proposed Commentary .04 would provide that clearing members must follow the procedures of The
Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC'') when exercising expiring non-cash settled equity option contracts. It
also provides that members must follow certain procedures with respect to the exercising of non-cash settled equity
option contracts which would otherwise not be exercised, or the non-exercising of option contracts which otherwise
would be exercised, by operation of OCC Rule 805.

Pursuant to the proposal, there will be two means of exercising an expiring equity option: (1) Take no action and allow
exercise determinations to be made in accordance with OCC Rule 805; or (2) the market maker, floor broker, or clearing
member, as applicable, must submit a contrary exercise advice (i.e.

, a notice committing an option holder either to exercise an option that would not otherwise be exercised automatically
pursuant to OCC Rule 805, or not exercise an option that otherwise would be exercised automatically pursuant to OCC
Rule 805) (``Contrary Exercise Advice''). Contrary Exercise Advices would be submitted by a market maker, floor
broker, or clearing member either: (1) In such form or manner prescribed by the Exchange to a place designated by the
Exchange; or (2) to the Exchange via the OCC in a format prescribed by the OCC. The proposal also provides that subsequent
to the delivery of a Contrary Exercise Advice, should the market maker, floor broker, customer, or firm determine
to act other than as reflected on the original contrary Exercise Advice, an ``advice cancel'' must also be delivered
in such form or manner prescribed by the Exchange to a place designated by the Exchange no later than the Exercise Cut-Off
Time.

Subsection (c) to Commentary .04 would also be amended to provide that all of the procedures of Commentary .04 are in
full force and effect whether or not the OCC waives the exercise-by-exception provisions of OCC Rule 805.
 In the event of such waiver, the procedures of Commentary .04 shall be followed as if such provisions of OCC Rule 805
were in full force and effect.








Subsection (e) to Commentary .04 provides that the failure of any member to follow the procedures set forth in Commentary
.04 may be referred to the Ethics and Business Conduct Committee and result in the assessment of a fine, which may include,
but is not limited to, disgorgement of potential economic gain obtained or loss avoided by the subject exercise, as
determined by the Ethics and Business Conduct Committee.

Proposed Commentary .05 provides that members and member organizations shall properly communicate, in accordance
with Rule 6.24, final exercise decisions to the Exchange in respect of options positions for which they are responsible.
 Additionally, Commentary .05 also will provide that member organizations may establish an internal processing
cut-off time prior to the Exercise Cut-Off Time at which time final exercise decisions from their customers will no
longer be accepted by them for expiring options.






Finally, proposed Commentary .06 provides that if a member submits or prepares an exercise instruction after the
Exercise Cut-Off Time in any expiring option on the basis of material information that is released after the Exercise
Cut-Off Time, then such activity is inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade.





The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6 of the Act, in general, and furthers
the objectives of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act, in particular, in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative
acts and practices and to promote just and equitable principles of trade.


(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

<DOCNO> FR941017-2-00099 </DOCNO>

The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any inappropriate burden on competition.


(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others


Written comments on the proposed rule change were neither solicited nor received.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


The PSE has requested that the proposed rule change be given accelerated effectiveness pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)
of the Act.





The Commission believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder applicable to national securities exchanges, particularly, Section 6(b)(5) of the
Act.
 Specifically, the Commission believes the Exchange's proposal is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative
acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with
persons engaged in facilitating transactions in securities, and to protect investors and the public interest.




Although all options exchanges currently have a uniform 5:30 p.m. (e.s.t.) Exercise Cut-Off Time for expiring equity
options,
 the OCC's rules permit the OCC to accept exercise notices for expiring equity options from clearing firms until 12
a.m. (e.s.t.) on the expiration date (

i.e., 

the Saturday after an Expiration Friday). This additional time within which to receive exercise notices from clearing
members was provided to accommodate corrections of mistakes made in good faith, trade reconciliations, and certain
exceptional circumstances that affected a customer's ability to inform its brokerage firm or affected a firm's ability
to receive final exercise decisions before the Exercise Cut-Off Time. Because exercise instructions presently
are submitted to clearing members and then to the OCC by the clearing members, without having the audit trail pass directly
through the Exchange, it is difficult for the Exchange to surveil for violations of Rule 6.24.
 As a result, there have been situations where member organizations have either delayed making exercise decisions
until after 5:30 p.m. (e.s.t.) on Expiration Friday in anticipation of the release of material news concerning a particular
underlying company, or having made decisions prior to 5:30 p.m. (e.s.t.), changed these decisions based upon such
material news.
 The Commission, therefore, believes that it is appropriate for the Exchange to make it clear in its rules that the submission
of a Contrary Exercise Advice on the basis of material information released after the Exercise Cut-Off Time will be
actively deemed inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade.








The Commission believes that the proposed exercise procedures should enhance the Exchange's ability to surveil
for violations of Rule 6.24 by providing an enhanced audit trail for identifying late exercises. Specifically, every
time an exercise decision is made contrary to OCC Rule 805, a Contrary Exercise Advice must be filed with the Exchange,
 in addition to submitting an exercise instruction to a clearing member as is currently required.
 Similarly, the proposal requires that documentation must be prepared and submitted to the proper options exchange
whenever a late exercise decision is made in reliance on one of the exceptions to Rule 6.24, with the burden of establishing
the existence of the exception on the party submitting the Contrary Exercise Advice. The proposed rule change, therefore,
should facilitate the Exchange's ability to monitor and enforce compliance with Rule 6.24.
 Accordingly, because the proposed rule change significantly bolsters the Exchange's existing procedures regarding
the exercise of expiring equity options and helps to ensure compliance with their rules, the Commission believes
that the proposal is consistent with the Act.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941017-2-00100 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941017-2-00059 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Even though the proposed rule change significantly improves the Exchange's audit trail with respect to late exercises,
the Commission believes that the Exchange should continue to examine ways of ensuring compliance with the Exercise
Cut-Off Time and the other requirements of Rule 6.24. In this regard, the Commission encourages the Exchange to review
the permitted exceptions to Rule 6.24 and consider ways of establishing parameters as to the extent of the exceptions.






The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change, as amended, prior to the thirtieth day after
the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the 

Federal Register.

 Specifically, the Commission notes that the amended proposal is substantively similar to proposals submitted by
the other options exchanges, which are being approved concurrently with the PSE's proposed rule change.
 Additionally, each of the proposals submitted by the other exchanges was noticed for the full comment period without
any comments being received by the Commission. Finally, Amendment Nos. 1, 2, and 3 to the PSE proposal, as was the case
with the amendments to the proposals submitted by the other options exchanges, merely clarify the application of
the rules and may serve to minimize confusion and disputes between and among members and customers as to the application
of Rule 6.24, as amended. Accordingly, the Commission believes that it is consistent with section 6(b)(5) of the Act
to approve the proposed rule change, as amended, on an accelerated basis.





Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the proposed rule change,
as amended. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and
Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submissions, all subsequent amendments,
all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written
communications relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that
may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection
and copying at the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such
filings will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of the PSE. All submissions should
refer to File No. SR-PSE-94-12 and should be submitted by November 7, 1994.



It Is Therefore Ordered,

 Pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-PSE-94-12), as amended, is hereby approved.






For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc.
Relating to an Enhanced Parity Split for the Specialist in 3D Foreign Currency Options</DOCTITLE>



October 7, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on August 15, 1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which
Items have been prepared by the Phlx. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed
rule change from interested persons.



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The Phlx, pursuant to Rule 19b-4 of the Act, proposes to amend Exchange Rule 1014(h) in order to permit an enhanced
parity split for the specialist in the cash/spot foreign currency options (``FCOs'') on the German mark, commonly
referred to as 3D FCOs. The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, the Phlx, and
at the Commission.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the Phlx included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Phlx has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



The Commission approved the 3D FCOs for trading on March 8, 1994.
 The product is an Options Clearing Corporation issued, European-style
 option that will be listed, initially, in one-week and two-week expirations. As an inducement for the 3D FCO specialist
to make deep and liquid markets in this new options product, the Phlx has determined to provide the 3D FCO specialist
with an enhanced parity split in all 3D FCO trades.






Recently, the Commission approved two different enhanced parity split rules with respect to Phlx equity option specialists.
 The Phlx now proposes to amend Exchange Rule 1014(h) to adopt an enhanced parity split for the 3D FCO specialist. Specifically,
the 3D FCO specialist would be entitled to receive a 50% split of the first 500 contracts in any trade in which the 3D FCO
specialist and one or more crowd participants are on parity as defined in Rule 1014(h).




The Exchange represents that customers, as they are defined in Rule 1014(h), will not be disadvantaged by this rule.
The benefits accorded customers under subsection (i) of that rule will not change. Specifically, customer bids/offers
for under 100 contracts will have time priority over all other bids/offers. In that instance, the 3D FCO specialist
cannot be on parity with such customer so the enhanced split will not apply.

The purpose of the proposed enhanced parity split, according to the Phlx, is to encourage the 3D FCO specialist to make
deeper markets in order to attract order flow to the Exchange. At the end of the first year, the Foreign Currency Option
Committee (``Committee'') will conduct a review of the entitlement to the enhanced parity split and additional reviews
will be conducted by the Committee every six months thereafter.

The Exchange believes that the foregoing rule change proposal is consistent with Section 6 of the Act, in general,
and with Section 6(b)(5), in particular, in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade,
prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, facilitate transactions in securities, remove impediments
to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, as well as to protect investors and
the public interest.

(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others



No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



With 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:

(A) By order approve such proposed rule change, or
(B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. Copies of such filing will also be available for
inspection and copying at the principal office of the Phlx. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-Phlx-94-42
and should be submitted by November 7, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change by the Philadelphia
Stock Exchange, Inc., Regarding Amendments to PHLX Rule 1015 and Floor Procedure Advice A-11</DOCTITLE>


October 7, 1994.


Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on September 19, 1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PHLX'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I,
II and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing
this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.


I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


Paragraph (b), ``Trade or Fade'' of PHLX Rule 1015, ``Quotation Guarantees,'' provides that, for non-public customer
orders to buy (sell) at the displayed offer (bid), or portions of customer orders grater than the minimum size guarantee
in that option, the trading crowd must either: (1) Sell (buy) the number of contracts specified in the order; or (2)
change the displayed offer (bid) to reflect that the previous displayed offer (bid) is no longer available. PHLX Rule
1015(b) also states that when the disseminated market quote is revised, it shall be considered inconsistent with
just and equitable principles of trade for the trading crowd to immediately re-display the previously disseminated
market quote, unless such action is warranted by a change in market conditions. The PHLX proposes to amend Floor Procedure
Advice (``Advice'') A-11, ``Responsibility to Make Ten-Up Markets,'' to add the ``trade or fade'' language
of PHLX Rule 1015(b) to Advice A-11. In addition, the PHLX proposes to add the phrase ``in any options series on
the Exchange'' to PHLX Rule 1015(a) in order to clarify the rule.
The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, PHLX, and at the Commission.


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.


(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


The PHLX states that the purpose of the proposal is to amend Advice A-11 to correspond to PHLX Rule 1015. PHLX Rule
1015, which was amended recently,
 mirrors the text of Advice A-11 and also adds a trade or fade provision. Because Advice A-11 was also amended
recently,
 the text of Advice A-11 was in flux when new PHLX Rule 1015 was adopted, and, accordingly, did not contain the trade
or fade language approved therein. Otherwise, PHLX Rule 1015 tracks the text of Advice A-11 and was intended
to incorporate the procedures of Advice A-11 into a specific PHLX rule.





At this time, the text of Advice A-11 no longer mirrors PHLX Rule 1015. In order to rectify this, the PHLX proposes
to add two paragraphs to Advice A-11, which appears for advisory purposes in the PHLX's Floor Procedure Advice
Handbook. In addition, the PHLX proposes a minor amendment to PHLX Rule 1015 to add the phrase ``in any option series
on the Exchange,'' which appears in the first paragraph of Advice A-11. The PHLX also proposes to amend Advice
A-11 by labeling paragraph (a) as ``Quotation Guarantees.'' The PHLX states that PHLX Rule 1015(a) was adopted
without this particular phrase.
The PHLX believes that the proposal is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and, in particular, with
Section 6(b)(5), in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and
manipulative acts and practices, and to protect investors and the public interest by copying the text of the trade
or fade provisions in PHLX Rule 1015(b) to Advice A-11.

(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


The PHLX does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any inappropriate burden on competition.


(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others


No written comments were solicited or received.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


The foregoing rule change constitutes a stated policy, practice or interpretation with respect to the administration
of an existing PHLX rule. Specifically, the proposal modifies Advice A-11 by adding paragraph (b), ``Trade
or Fade,'' to make Advice A-11 consistent with PHLX Rule 1015. In addition, the proposal clarifies PHLX Rule
1015(a) by adding the phrase ``in any options series on the Exchange'' to the rule; the proposal also clarifies Advice
A-11 by adding the heading ``Quotation Guarantees'' to paragraph (a) of Advice A-11. Accordingly, the
proposal has become effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act and subparagraph (e) of Rule 19b-4
thereunder. At any time within 60 days of the filing of such proposed rule change, the Commission may summarily abrogate
such rule change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest,
for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.


IV. Solicitation of Comments


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. Copies of such filing will also be available for
inspection and copying at the principal office of the above-mentioned self-regulatory organization. All submissions
should refer to the file number in the caption above and should be submitted by November 7, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change and Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated
Approval of Amendment Nos. 1, 2, and 3 to the Proposed Rule Change by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating
to Exercise Cut-Off Procedures for Expiring Equity Options</DOCTITLE>


October 7, 1994.




Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 on December 20, 1993, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') a proposed rule change relating to the exercise procedures for expiring
equity option contracts. The proposal was published for comment in the 

Federal Register

 on February 18, 1994.
 No comments were received on the proposed rule change. The Phlx filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposal on July 12, 1994,
Amendment No. 2 on September 22, 1994, and Amendment No. 3 on October 5, 1994.
 This order approves the proposed rule change, as amended.










Currently, with regard to expiring equity options, Phlx customers and member organizations
 are required to indicate their exercise decisions to clearing members no later than 5:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time
(``E.S.T.'') on the business day immediately prior to the expiration date of the options (``Exercise Cut-Off Time'').
 This is the latest time by which an exercise instruction
 may be: (1) Prepared by a clearing member for positions in its proprietary trading account; (2) accepted by a clearing
member from a non-clearing member; or (3) accepted by a member organization from any customer.
 The only exceptions to Rule 1042 are: (1) To remedy mistakes made in good faith; (2) to take appropriate action as the
result of a failure to reconcile unmatched Exchange option transactions; (3) where exceptional circumstances relating
to a customer's ability to communicate exercise instructions to a member organization (or a member organization's
ability to receive such exercise instructions) prior to the Exercise Cut-Off Time warrant such action; and (4) with
respect to foreign currency options.
 Member organizations are required to prepare a memorandum of every exercise instruction received from a customer
stating the time when such instruction was received. If a member organization receives an exercise instruction or
tenders an exercise notice to the OCC pursuant to one of the first three exceptions described above, the member organization
must maintain a memorandum setting forth the circumstances giving rise to the exception. If the member organization
is relying on either the first or third exception described above, it must promptly file a copy of the memorandum with
the Exchange.

Currently under Rule 1042 it is a violation for clearing members to accept exercise instructions after the Exercise
Cut-Off Time, except in reliance on one of the above exceptions. Because exercise instructions are submitted to the
clearing members and then to the OCC by the clearing members, without having the audit trail pass directly through
the Exchange, it is difficult for the Exchange to surveil for violations of Rule 1042.






In order to enhance the ability of the Exchange to surveil for violations of Rule 1042 for expiring equity options,
the proposed rule change would alter the existing exercise instruction procedures by requiring that final exercise
decisions be submitted to the Exchange. The clearing members would still be responsible for delivering exercise
notices to the OCC,
 however, the proposed rule change would allow the Exchange to accurately document when each exercise instruction
was received by a member organization or clearing member, or delivered by a clearing member to the OCC.
 The Exercise Cut-Off Time will still be 5:30 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the business day immediately prior to the expiration
date. Pursuant to the proposal, however, there will be two means of exercising an expiring equity option: (1) Take
no action and allow exercise determinations to be made in accordance with OCC Rule 805;
 or (2) the member organization may submit a contrary exercise advice (

i.e.,

 a notice committing an option holder either to exercise an option that would not otherwise be exercised automatically
pursuant to OCC Rule 805, or not exercise an option that otherwise would be exercised automatically pursuant to OCC
Rule 805) (``Contrary Exercise Advice''). Contrary Exercise Advices would be submitted by a member organization
either: (1) At a place designated for that purpose by any national options exchange of which the member organization
is a member and where the option is listed; or (2) to the Exchange via the OCC in a format prescribed by the OCC.
 In those instances where OCC Rule 805 has been waived by the OCC,
 the proposal requires that a Contrary Exercise Advice be submitted prior to the Exercise Cut-Off Time by member organizations
wishing to exercise an options that would not have been automatically exercised had the exercise-by-exception procedure
been in place, or not to exercise an option that would have been automatically exercised had the exercise-by-exception
procedure been in place.
 The applicable underlying security price in such instances will be as described in OCC Rule 805(1), which will normally
be the last sale price in the primary market for the underlying security.














The proposal would also require member organizations that maintain proprietary or public customer positions in
expiring options to take necessary steps to ensure that final exercise decisions are properly indicated to the Exchange
regarding such positions.
 In addition, member organizations which have accepted the responsibility to indicate final exercise decisions
on behalf of another member organization or non-member firm shall take necessary steps to ensure that such decisions
are properly indicated in compliance with Rule 1042, as amended.
 Member organizations may establish an internal processing cut-off time prior to 5:30 p.m (E.S.T.) at which time final
exercise decisions from their customers will no longer be accepted by them for expiring options.

With certain minor modifications, the proposal maintains the current exceptions to Rule 1042. The proposal, however,
adds language to Rule 1042(b) to expressly state that the burden of establishing an exception to the Exercise Cut-Off
Time for a proprietary or customer account of a member organization rests solely on the member organization seeking
to rely on such exception.

In the event a member organization does not timely submit a Contrary Exercise Advice in accordance with the proposed
procedures, or does not timely submit a Contrary Exercise Advice pursuant to an exception, the responsible member
organization must prepare a written memorandum describing the surrounding circumstances
 and must file a copy of the memorandum with the Exchange's Market Surveillance Department no later than 12:00 p.m.
(E.S.T.) on the business day following that expiration.





Furthermore, in order to highlight the seriousness of violating Rule 1042, the proposed rule language would expressly
state that effecting an exercise decision in an expiring equity option on the basis of material information obtained
after the Exercise Cut-Off Time is considered to be activity inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade.

Finally, the proposal would state in the Commentaries to Rule 1042 that the requirements specified in the rule do not
apply to foreign currency options or index option products listed on the Exchange.






The Commission believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder applicable to national securities exchanges, particularly, Section 6(b)(5) of the
Act.
 Specifically, the Commission believes the Exchange's proposal is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative
acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with
persons engaged in facilitating transactions in securities, and to protect investors and the public interest.





Although all options exchanges currently have a uniform 5:30 p.m. (E.S.T.) Exercise Cut-Off Time on Expiration Fridays
for expiring equity options, the OCC's rules permit the OCC to accept exercise notices for expiring equity options
from clearing firms until 12:00 a.m. (E.S.T.) on the expiration date (

i.e.

, the Saturday after an Expiration Friday). This additional time within which to receive exercise notices from clearing
members was provided to accommodate corrections of mistakes made in good faith, trade reconciliations, and certain
exceptional circumstances that affected a customer's ability to inform its brokerage firm or affected a firm's ability
to receive final exercise decisions before the Exercise Cut-Off Time. Nevertheless, there have been situations
where member organizations have either delayed making exercise decisions until after 5:30 p.m. (E.S.T.) on Expiration
Friday in anticipation of the release of material news concerning a particular underlying company, or having made
decisions prior to 5:30 p.m. (E.S.T.), changed these decisions based upon such material news.
 In this regard, the Commission believes that it is appropriate for the Exchange to make it clear in its rules that the
submission of a Contrary Exercise Advice on the basis of material information released after the Exercise Cut-Off
Time will be activity deemed inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade.







The Commission believes that the proposed exercise procedures should enhance the Exchange's ability to surveil
for violations of Rule 1042 by providing an enhanced audit trail for identifying late exercises. Specifically, every
time an exercise decision is made contrary to OCC Rule 805, a Contrary Exercise Advice must be filed with the Exchange,
in addition to submitting an exercise instruction to a clearing member as is currently required.
 Similarly, the proposal requires that documentation must be prepared and submitted to the proper options exchange
whenever a late exercise decision is made in reliance on one of the exceptions to Rule 1042, with the burden of establishing
the existence of the exception on the party submitting the Contrary Exercise Advice. The proposed rule change, therefore,
should facilitate the Exchange's ability to monitor and enforce compliance with Rule 1042. Accordingly, because
the proposed rule change significantly bolsters the Exchange's existing procedures regarding the exercise of expiring
equity options and helps to ensure compliance with their rules, the Commission believes that the proposal is consistent
with the Act.







Even though the proposed rule change significantly improves the Exchange's audit trail with respect to late exercises,
the Commission believes that the Exchange should continue to examine ways of ensuring compliance with the Exercise
Cut-Off Time and the other requirements of Rule 1042.
 Furthermore, the Commission also encourages the Exchange to review the permitted exceptions to Rule 1042 and consider
ways of establishing parameters as to the extent of the exceptions.

The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment Nos. 1, 2, and 3 to the proposal prior to the thirtieth day after
the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the 

Federal Register

. Specifically, the Commission believes that Amendment Nos. 1, 2, and 3 to the proposal, as discussed above, clarify
the application of the rule and may serve to minimize confusion and disputes between and among members and customers
as to the application of this rule. Additionally, the original proposal was noticed for the full comment period without
any comments being received by the Commission. Accordingly, the Commission believes that it is consistent with Section
6(b)(5) of the Act to approve Amendment Nos. 1, 2, and 3 to the proposed rule change on an accelerated basis.
Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning Amendment Nos. 1, 2, and 3 to
the proposed rule change. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary,
Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submissions, all
subsequent amendments, all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission,
and all written communications relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other
than those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available
for inspection and copying at the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549.
Copies of such filings will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of the Phlx. All submissions
should refer to File No. SR-Phlx-93-37 and should be submitted by November 7, 1994.


It is therefore ordered, 

Pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-Phlx-93-37), as amended, is hereby approved.

<DOCTITLE>Chung Khiaw Bank, Ltd.; Notice of Application</DOCTITLE>



October 7, 1994.



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'').



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of application for exemption under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``Act'').







APPLICANT: 

Chung Khiaw Bank, Ltd. (``CKB'').




RELEVANT 1940 ACT SECTION: 

Exemption requested under section 6(c) from the provisions of section 17(f).



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: 

CKB seeks an order exempting (i) CKB, (ii) any management investment company registered under the Act other than an
investment company registered under section 7(d) of the Act (``Investment Company''), and (iii) any custodian for
such Investment Company, from the provisions of section 17(f) of the Act to the extent necessary to permit such Investment
Companies or their custodians, and CKB, as custodian or subcustodian, to maintain foreign securities, cash, and
cash equivalents with Chung Khiaw Bank (Malaysia) Bhd. (``CKB-Malaysia'').



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.




Applicant's Representations






1. CKB is a company organized and existing under the laws of Singapore, and regulated as a banking institution by the
Monetary Authority of Singapore. At December 31, 1993, it had shareholders' equity in the approximate amount of U.S.
$369,567,000.

2. CKB-Malaysia is a subsidiary of CKB. Until recently, CKB provided custody services for Investment Companies holding
Malaysian securities in its branches in Malaysia. A recently adopted Malaysian law requires banking institutions
operating in Malaysia to be locally incorporated. To comply with this legislation, CKB transferred substantially
all of the assets, liabilities, and personnel of its Malaysian branches to CKB-Malaysia. CKB-Malaysia is regulated
as a banking institution under Malaysian law by Bank Negara Malaysia, the Central Bank of Malaysia. As of June 1, 1994,
the shareholders' equity of CKB-Malaysia was approximately U.S. $100 million.








Applicant's Legal Conclusions








1. Section 17(f) requires every registered management investment company to place and maintain its securities and
similar investments in the custody of certain enumerated entities, including ``banks'' having at all times an aggregate
capital, surplus and undivided profits of at least $500,000. Section 2(a)(5) defines ``bank'' to include (i) A banking
institution organized under the laws of the United States, (ii) a member bank of the Federal Reserve System, and (iii)
any other banking institution or trust company, whether incorporated or not, doing business under the laws of any
state or of the United States, a substantial portion of the business of which consists of receiving deposits or exercising
fiduciary powers similar to those permitted to national banks under the authority of the Comptroller of the Currency,
and which is supervised and examined by state or federal authority having supervision over banks, and which is not
operated for the purpose of evading the provisions of the Act.



2. Rule 17f-5 provides that an Investment Company may place and maintain in the care of an ``eligible foreign
custodian'' the Investment Company's foreign securities, cash, and cash equivalents in amounts reasonably necessary
to effect the Investment Company's foreign securities transactions. The term ``eligible foreign custodian'' is
defined in rule 17f-5(c)(2) to include a foreign bank that is regulated as such by the government (or an agency
thereof) of the country where the bank is organized and that has shareholders' equity in excess of U.S. $200,000,000.



3. CKB meets the requirements for Eligible Foreign Custodian since it has shareholders' equity well in excess of U.S.
$200,000,000, is organized and existing under the laws of a country other than the United States (Singapore) and is
regulated as a bank under the laws of Singapore.





4. CKB-Malaysia also satisfies the requirements of rule 17f-5 insofar as it is a banking institution incorporated
or organized under the laws of a country other than the United States and is regulated as such by that country's government
or an agency thereof. CKB-Malaysia, with shareholder's equity of approximately $100 million, however, does not
meet the minimum shareholders' equity requirement of rule 17f-5.




5. CKB seeks an order under section 6(c) exempting (i) CKB, (ii) any Investment Company and (iii) any custodian for
such Investment Company from the provisions of section 17(f) of the Act to permit the deposit and custody of Foreign
Securities (as defined below), cash, and cash equivalents in Malaysia with CKB-Malaysia. ``Foreign Securities''
includes (i) Securities issued and sold primarily outside the United States by a foreign government, a national of
any foreign country, or a corporation or other organization incorporated or organized under the laws of any foreign
country and (ii) securities issued or guaranteed by the government of the United States or by any state or any political
subdivision thereof or by any agency thereof or by any entity organized under the laws of the United States or of any
state thereof which have been issued and sold primarily outside the United States. Foreign Securities, cash, and
cash equivalents are defined collectively as ``Assets.''


6. CKB represents that CKB-Malaysia is well-qualified to provide custodial services for Investment Company Assets.
As the successor to the business of CKB's Malaysia branches, CKB-Malaysia subsumed the personnel and functions of
those branches. CKB represents that, under the foreign custody arrangements proposed above, the protection afforded
the assets of Investment Companies held by CKB-Malaysia would not be diminished from the protection afforded by rule
17f-5 if the assets were held in the direct custody of CKB.






Applicant's Conditions






CKB agrees that the order of the Commission granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions:



1. The foreign custody arrangements proposed with respect to CKB-Malaysia will satisfy the requirements of rule
17f-5 in all respects other than with regard to the shareholders' equity of CKB-Malaysia.




2. Assets held in custody for U.S. management investment companies or their custodians will be maintained in CBK-Malaysia
only in accordance with an agreement (``Delegation Agreement'') required to remain in effect at all times during
which CKB-Malaysia fails to satisfy all the requirements of rule 17f-5 pursuant to which CKB would undertake
to provide specified custodial or subcustodial services and delegate to CKB-Malaysia such of CKB's duties and obligations
as would be necessary to permit CKB-Malaysia to hold in custody in Malaysia Assets of U.S. investment companies. The
Delegation Agreement among CKB, CKB-Malaysia, and a U.S. investment company or its custodian would further provide
that CKB's delegation of duties to CKB-Malaysia would not relieve CKB of any responsibility to a U.S. investment company
for which CKB serves as custodian or to a custodian for which CKB serves as a subcustodian for any loss due to such delegation,
except such loss as may result from political risk (e.g., exchange control restrictions, confiscation, expropriation,
nationalization, insurrection, civil strife, or armed hostilities) or other risks of loss (excluding bankruptcy
or insolvency of CKB-Malaysia) for which neither CKB nor CKB-Malaysia would be liable under rule 17f-5 (e.g.,
despite the exercise of reasonable care, acts of God, and the like).





3. CKB currently satisfies and will continue to satisfy the minimum shareholders' equity requirement set forth in
rule 17f-5(c)(2)(i).






For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority.

summary of application: 

Applicants seek an order permitting the deduction from the assets of the Separate Account of a mortality and expense
risk charge in connection with the offer and sale of certain variable annuity contracts offered by Jefferson-Pilot.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information: 

Following is a summary of the application; the complete application is available for a fee from the Commission's Public
Reference Branch.



Applicants' Representations



1. Jefferson-Pilot is a stock life insurance company. Jefferson-Pilot is the sponsor and depositor of the Separate
Account and will be the sponsor and depositor of one or more Other Separate Accounts that it may establish in the future.

2. The Separate Account, a separate account of Jefferson-Pilot, is registered under the 1940 Act as a unit investment
trust. The Separate Account currently is used to fund certain individual variable annuity contracts (``contracts''),
and will be used in the future to fund certain additional variable annuity contracts that are materially similar (``Other
Contracts''), offered by Jefferson Pilot (Collectively, ``Contracts''). The Separate Account has filed a registration
statement on Form N-4 to register the Contracts as securities under the Securities Act of 1933 (``1933 Act'').
Registration statements will be filed under the 1933 Act for any Other Contracts offered in the future by Jefferson-Pilot.

The Separate Account currently consists of nine sub-accounts (``Subaccounts''), of which eight are available under
the Contracts.
 Two of the available Subaccounts invest in shares of mutual funds (``JP Funds'') organized by Jefferson-Pilot Corporation
as diversified, open-end management investment companies registered under the 1940 Act and those shares are registered
as securities under the 1933 Act. The remaining six available Subaccounts invest solely in shares of a corresponding
portfolio of the Variable Insurance Products fund (``Trust'') or the Variable Insurance Products Fund II (``Trust
II'') (collectively, ``Trusts''). The Trusts are diversified, open-end management investment companies of the
series type that are registered under the 1940 Act and whose shares are registered under the 1933 Act. Jefferson-Pilot
may determine to create additional Subaccount(s) of the Separate Account to invest in any additional mutual fund(s)
that may now or in the future be available. Similarly, Subaccounts and/or funds may be combined or eliminated from
time-to-time.





3. JP Investment Management Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Jefferson-Pilot Corporation, is the investment
adviser for the JP funds. Fidelity Management & Research Company, a nonaffiliate, is the investment adviser
for the Trusts.

4. Investor Services, a wholly-owned subsidiary of JP Corporation, will be the principal underwriter of the Contracts
and may, in the future, act as principal underwriter for any other Contracts offered by Jefferson-Pilot. Investor
Services is registered as a broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and is a member of the National
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.

5. The Contracts are flexible premium variable annuity contracts offered to individuals in connection with either
nontax qualified plans or under plans qualified for federal income tax advantages under the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended. The Contracts include the Alpha Account Contract and the Alpha Flex Account Contract, each of
which permits premiums to vary in amount and frequency but require certain minimum initial premium payments and additional
payments. The Contracts further provide for accumulation for premium payments before retirement, and the receipt
of annuity payments after retirement, on a fixed basis, or on a variable basis, through use of the Separate Account.

The Contracts also provide a death benefit that is the greatest of: (1) Purchase payments made (less partial withdrawals
and any surrender and partial withdrawal transaction charges); (2) Accumulation Value at the end of the valuation
period; and (3) the ``step-up'' death benefit,
 plus purchase payments made, less withdrawals and any surrender or withdrawal charges taken since the last ``step-up''
death benefit anniversary. The ``basic'' death benefit is equal to the Accumulation Value, or to the sum of the purchase
payments made less partial withdrawals and any surrender and partial withdrawal transaction charges taken. The
death benefit in excess of the ``basic'' death benefit and the ``step-up'' death benefit, constitutes the ``step-up''
death benefit.




6. No sales charges are deducted from premium payments under the Contracts. However, a contingent deferred sales
charge (``CDSC'') will be assessed if the Contract is surrendered or partial withdrawals exceeding certain amounts
are taken during (i) The six-year period from the date purchase payments are received and accepted, with respect to
the Alpha Account Contract, and (ii) the eight-year period from the date purchase payments are received and accepted,
with respect to the Alpha Flex Account Contract. With respect to the Alpha Account Contract, the maximum CDSC imposed
is 6% of the amount withdrawn during the first two Contract years, scaled downward until the seventh Contract Year
when there will be no charge. With respect to the Alpha Flex Account Contract, the maximum CDSC imposed is 8% of the amount
withdrawn in the first Contract Year, scaled downward until the ninth Contract year, when there will be no charge.
After the first Contract year, a Contract owner may withdraw once each Contract year 10% of the Accumulation Value
as of the last Contract anniversary as well as purchase payments held beyond the applicable CDSC period, without the
assessment of a CDSC. In no event will the CDSC under either Contract exceed 9% of purchase payments.
Proceeds from the CDSC may not cover the expected costs of distributing the Contracts. Any shortfall will be recovered
from Jefferson-Pilot's general assets, which may include revenues from the mortality and expense risk charge deducted
from the Separate Account.
7. Various fees and expenses are deducted under the Contracts and the Separate Account. A charge may be deducted for
premium taxes when annuity payments begin or from purchase payments, as required by the particular jurisdiction.
Applicable premium taxes depend on the payor's then current place of residence and generally range from 0% to 5.0%
of purchase payments or the amount annuitized. Jefferson-Pilot represents that the amount that it will recover for
premium taxes will not be greater than the amount of premium taxes required to be paid.
8. The administrative charges to be assessed include (i) An Annual Contract Fee of $35 per Contract year during the
Accumulation Period only, and (ii) an Administrative Expense Fee equal to an annual rate of .15% of the assets of the
Separate Account during the Accumulation and the Annuity Periods. Jefferson-Pilot guarantees that it will not raise
these administrative charges for the duration of the Contracts. Jefferson-Pilot also represents that it does not
expect that the total revenues from the administrative charges will be greater than the total expected cost of administering
the Contracts, on average, excluding distribution costs, over the period that the Contracts are in force.
9. There will be a charge of $25 for each transfer after the first twelve transfers in each Contract year prior to the
Annuity Date and for each transfer after the first four transfers after the Annuity Date. Jefferson-Pilot does not
include periodic automatic transfers made under the Dollar Cost Averaging Program when calculating the free transfers
that may be made during the Accumulation Period. Jefferson-Pilot represents that it does not expect that the total
revenues from the excess transfer charge will be greater than the total expected cost of administering transfers,
on average, over the period that the Contracts are in force.
10. A daily charge equal to an annual rate of 1.25% of the value of the net assets in each Subaccount attributable to the
Contracts will be imposed to compensate Jefferson-Pilot for bearing certain mortality and expense risks it assumes
in offering and administering the Contracts and in operating the Separate Account. Of this amount, .65% is attributable
to mortality risks, and .60% is attributable to expense risks. The charge for mortality and expenses risks will be
assessed during the Accumulation Period and the Annuity Period. The aggregate charge is guaranteed by Jefferson-Pilot
not to increase for the duration of the Contracts. The charge may be a source of profit for Jefferson-Pilot, which will
be added to its general account assets and may be used for, among other things, the payment of distribution, sales and
other expenses. Jefferson-Pilot currently anticipates a profit from this charge.
11. Jefferson Pilot assumes certain mortality risks under the Contracts. The mortality risk arises from Jefferson-Pilot's
contractual obligation to make periodic annuity payments (determined in accordance with Jefferson-Pilot's annuity
tables, which are based on the 1983 Table of Individual Annuity Mortality and, for variable annuity options, on an
assumed investment rate of 31/2%, and other Contract provisions) regardless of how long all annuitants or any individual
annuitant lives. Contract owners thus are assured that neither annuitant's longevity nor an improvement in life
expectancy generally (which is greater than expected) will adversely effect annuity payments the payee will receive
under the Contracts. This eliminates the risk of outliving the funds accumulated for retirement. Mortality risk
also is assumed in connection with payment of the death benefit prior to the Annuity date because the death benefit
guarantee could exceed the Account Value. Also, Jefferson-Pilot assumes a mortality risk arising from the fact that
the Contract does not impose any surrender charge on the death benefits.
12. The expense risk assumed by Jefferson-Pilot is that its actual expenses in issuing and administering the Contracts
and operating the Separate Account will exceed the amount recovered through the administrative charges, which are
guaranteed not to increase for the life of the Contract.


Applicants' Legal Analysis


1. Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act authorizes the Commission, by order upon application, to conditionally or unconditionally
grant an exemption from any provision, rule or regulation of the 1940 Act to the extent that the exemption is necessary
or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and purposes fairly intended
by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act.

<PARENT> FR941017-2-00064 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

2. Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act prohibit a registered unit investment trust, its depositor or
principal underwriter, from selling periodic payment plan certificates unless the proceeds of all payments, other
than sales loads, are deposited with a qualified bank and held under arrangements which prohibit any payment to the
depositor or principal underwriter except a reasonable fee, as the Commission may prescribe, for performing bookkeeping
and other administrative duties normally performed by the bank itself.

3. Applicants request, under Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act, exemptions from Sections 26(a)(2) and 27(c)(2) to the extent
necessary to permit the deduction from the assets of the Separate Account of the charge for mortality and expense risks.
Applicants believe that the requested exemptions are necessary and appropriate in the public interest and consistent
with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act.

4. Applicants submit that the relief requested with respect to any Other Contracts funded by the Separate Account
or by any other separate account that is established by Jefferson-Pilot in the future to support materially similar
contracts to those offered by the Separate Account, is appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the
protection of investors and the purposes of the 1940 Act, and, thus, is consistent with the standards of Section 6(c)
of the 1940 Act. Without the requested relief for the Other Contracts, Applicants would have to repeatedly request
and obtain exemptive relief which would present no issues under the 1940 Act that have not already been addressed in
this Application. Eliminating redundant exemptive applications would reduce administrative expenses and maximize
the efficient use of resources, thus, promoting competitiveness in the variable annuity market. Applicants represents
that the delay and expense of repetitive exemptive applications would impair Jefferson-Pilot's ability to effectively
take advantage of business opportunities as they arise, would deny investors any benefit or additional protection,
and would disadvantage investors as a result of increased overhead costs. Applicants thus believe that the requested
exemption is appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes
fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act.

5. Applicants contend that Jefferson-Pilot is entitled to reasonable compensation for its assumption of mortality
and expense risks. Applicants represent that the mortality and expense risk charge is consistent with the protection
of investors because it is a reasonable and proper insurance charge. The charge is a reasonable charge to compensate
Jefferson-Pilot for the risks that: (a) Annuitants under the Contract will live longer individually or as a group
than has been anticipated in setting the annuity rates guaranteed in the Contracts; (b) the Account Value will be less
than the death benefit; and (c) administrative expenses will be greater than amounts derived from the administrative
charges.

6. Applicants represent that the 1.25% mortality and expense risk charge under the Contracts is within the range of
industry practice for comparable annuity products. This determination is based upon Applicants' analysis of publicly
available information about similar industry products, taking into consideration such factors as current charge
levels and benefits provided, the existence if expense charge guarantees and guaranteed annuity rates. Applicants
represent that Jefferson-Pilot undertakes to maintain at its home office, available to the Commission upon request,
a memorandum setting forth in detail the products analyzed, and the results of the analysis, in making the foregoing
determination.






7. Applicants acknowledge that, if a profit is realized from the mortality and expense risk charge, all or a portion
of such profit may be available to pay distribution expenses. Jefferson-Pilot has concluded that there is a reasonable
likelihood that the proposed distribution financing arrangements will benefit the Separate Account and the Contract
owners. The basis for that conclusion is set forth in a memorandum which will be maintained by Jefferson-Pilot at its
administrative offices and will be available to the Commission.

8. Applicants also represents that the Separate Account will invest only in open-end management investment companies
that undertake, in the event that such company should adopt a plan under Rule 12b-1 of the 1940 Act to finance distribution
expenses, to have a board of directors (or trustees), a majority of whom are not ``interested persons'' of the company,
formulate and approve any such plan.



Conclusion



For the reasons set forth above, Applicants represents that the exemptions requested are necessary and appropriate
in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy
and provisions of the 1940 Act. Accordingly, Applicants request relief from Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) to
the extent necessary to permit the assessment and deduction of the mortality and expense risk charge under the Contracts.

the redemption request, a complete redemption distribution totalling $65,585,130 was paid by applicant to the Yankee
Money Market Fund in complete liquidation of its interest. On February 22, 1993, the board of trustees of applicant
authorized the actions necessary to effect the termination of applicant as an investment company.

3. The expenses applicant incurred in connection with the liquidation included professional and custodial fees
and expenses totalling $30,750. Certain persons connected to applicant, including its investment adviser, agreed
to assume applicant's deferred unamortized organization expenses as of October 31, 1991. Because these persons
assumed the organizational expenses, applicant had no outstanding deferred organizational expenses upon liquidation.

4. Applicant has no debts or other liabilities that remain outstanding. Applicant is not a party to any litigation
or administrative proceeding.

5. Applicant is not now engaged, nor does it propose to engage, in any business activities other than those necessary
for the winding up of its affairs.




For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority.

Energy Initiatives, Inc., et al. (70-8369)


Energy Initiatives, Inc. (``EII''), One Upper Pond Road, Parsippany, New Jersey 07054, a nonutility subsidiary
of General Portfolios Corporation (``GPC''), a nonutility subsidiary of General Public Utilities Corporation
(``GPU''), and GPU, 100 Interpace Parkway, Parsippany, New Jersey 07054, a registered holding company, have filed
a post-effective amendment under Sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10 and 12(b) and Rules 45, 53 and 54 to their application-declaration
filed under Sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10, 12(b) and 13(b) of the Act and Rules 45, 51, 90 and 91 thereunder.
By order dated May 17, 1994 (HCAR No. 26053) (``May 1994 Order''), the following proposals were authorized: (i) for
EII (a) to acquire through December 31, 1995 all of the stock of North Canadian Power Inc. (``NCP''), a company engaged
exclusively in the business of owning or leasing and operating qualifying cogeneration facilities (``QFs''), as
defined in the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, as amended (``PURPA''), and developing other QFs and
electric wholesale generators (``EWGs''), as defined in Section 32 of the Act, for a total of $72 million (``Purchase
Price'') and (b) to enter into assumption agreements obligating EII to make payments up to $25 million; and, (ii) for
GPU (a) to make up to $72 million in capital contributions or loans to EII through December 31, 1995 to pay the Purchase
Price and (b) to assume certain guarantees associated with QFs and/or unconditionally guaranty EII's obligations
and to make additional capital contributions up to a maximum aggregate amount of $25 million; and, (iii) for EII to
issue, sell and renew through December 31, 2004 notes in an aggregate principal amount of $25 million, and for GPU to
unconditionally guaranty the notes and EII's other related obligations. The May 1994 Order reserved jurisdiction
over EII's proposals to (i) issue and sell $2.5 million of unsecured promissory notes to banks and accept guarantees
or supporting agreements from GPU, and (ii) provide services to the QF projects as managing general partner under
an exception to Section 13 under the Act.
It is stated that, on June 13, 1994, EII acquired the common stock of NCP pursuant to the May 1994 Order. At the closing,
GPU made a cash capital contribution to EII in order to fund the amount of the purchase price then being paid ($53,517,590).
The balance of the purchase price (approximately $20 million) remains deposited in escrow pending receipt of required
third party consents. Since the acquisition, EII and GPU have reached an agreement in principal on the terms and conditions
of a loan agreement (``Loan Agreement'') with a group of lenders for whom Citibank, N.A. would initially act as agent.
EII and GPU now request the authority to enter into the Loan Agreement and a support agreement (``Support Agreement'').
The Loan Agreement would permit borrowings by EII in an aggregate amount not to exceed $30 million. Notes issued under
the Loan Agreement would bear interest at either (i) the higher of Citibank, N.A.'s prime rate and the Federal Funds
Rate plus 50 basis points (``Alternative Base Rate''), or (ii) the interest rate per annum at which deposits in U.S.
dollars are offered by the principal office of the reference bank (initially, Citibank, N.A.) in London, England
to prime banks in the London interbank market, plus additional costs for reserves, if applicable (``Eurodollar Rate'')
plus 50 basis points.
Issuance of the Notes would be subject to certain conditions, and the Notes would be subject to acceleration under
certain circumstances. Borrowings bearing interest at the Alternate Base Rate would be prepayable at any time without
penalty. Borrowings bearing interest at the Eurodollar Rate would also be prepayable, subject to payment of certain
costs incurred by the lenders in connection with the prepayment.
EII would agree to pay the lenders under the Loan Agreement a facility fee of 37.5 basis points per annum and a one-time
commitment fee payable at the initial closing of five basis points.
EII and GPU also propose that the Loan Agreement will include a letter of credit (``L/C'') facility. Pursuant to this
facility, EII would be able to request any lender which is a party to the Loan Agreement to issue an L/C, in a maximum aggregate
face amount for all L/Cs outstanding of up to $15 million. The lender would, however, have the discretion not to issue
an L/C. The aggregate amount that EII could borrow under the Loan Agreement would be reduced by the face amount of the
outstanding L/Cs. Drawings on an L/C would initially bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate. If EII elects not to
immediately reimburse the issuing bank, the drawing would be treated as a borrowing under the Loan Agreement. EII
would be required to pay the issuing bank a letter of credit fee of .50% per annum on the face amount of the L/C.
The Loan Agreement would have an initial term of three years, subject to extension for one year in the sole discretion
of the lenders. Upon termination, EII would be permitted to repay any then outstanding loans over a two year period
in quarterly installments, but EII would not be permitted to re-borrow during such period.
To induce the lenders to enter into the Loan Agreement, GPU proposes to deliver to the lenders a Support Agreement.
Among other things, that agreement would provide that GPU would maintain 100% ownership of EII and would use its best
efforts to arrange for repayment of the Notes when they become due and payable.

Since substantially all of the NCP purchase price has heretofore been funded with a cash capital contribution from
GPU, EII now proposes to use the proceeds of the sale of the Notes from time to time in its general business activities,
and, in particular: (i) to fund preliminary project development and administrative activities in connection with
EII's investments in QFs and small power production facilities, and defined in PURPA, and EWGs and foreign utility
companies (``FUCOs''), as defined in Section 33 of the Act, as may be authorized in File No. 70-7727; (ii) to acquire
securities or other interests in QFs, EWGs or FUCOs, provided, however, that EII will not, without prior Commission
authorization, acquire (a) an interest in a QF (which is not also an LWG) or (b) except as may be permitted by Commission
rule, regulation or order, an indirect ownership interest in a FUCO (which is not also an EWG); and (iii) to reimburse
GPU for a portion of its funding of the NCP purchase price.



EUA Cogenex Corporation (70-8473) 



EUA Cogenex Corporation (``Cogenex''), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eastern Utilities Associates (``EUA''),
both at P.O. Box 2333, Boston, Massachusetts 02107, a registered holding company, has filed an application-declaration
under Sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10, 12(b) and 12(c) of the Act and Rules 43, 45, 46 and 54 thereunder.

Cogenex now requests authorization to form and acquire a subsidiary company for the purpose of acquiring certain
assets of a company engaged in related business activities and funding those activities. Specifically, authorization
is now sought for: (1) Cogenex to form and acquire a wholly-owned subsidiary to be named EUA Citizens Conservation
Services, Inc. (``CCS''); (2) for CCS to issue common stock to Cogenex; (3) for Cogenex to acquire such common stock
from CCS; (4) for Cogenex to make loans to CCS; (5) for CCS to issue notes to Cogenex to evidence such loans; (6) for CCS
to issue preferred stock; (7) for CCS to redeem such preferred stock pursuant to the terms thereof; (8) for CCS to acquire
certain assets of Citizens Conservation Corporation (``CCC''), a nonaffiliated,tax-exempt Massachusetts corporation;
and, (9) for CCS to assume certain liabilities from CCC.

It is stated that CCS will primarily specialize in energy services for residential multi-family housing. The services
will include energy audits, technical assistance to owners/residents regarding energy costs and end uses, assistance
with financing projects, and energy performance contracting similar to the services Cogenex currently provides
to its commercial and institutional customers. CCS will also contract directly with utilities to implement residential
low-income multi-family demand-side management programs and will provide program design consultation to utilities,
governments and private entities. 

The initial authorized capitalization of CCS shall be 200,000 shares of common stock, $.01 par value per share, and
7,500 shares of preferred stock, $.01 par value (``Preferred Stock'').

Cogenex requests authorization: for CCS to issue and for Cogenex to acquire 10,000 shares of CCS' common stock at a
purchase price of $100; and for CCS to issue to CCC 7,500 shares of the Preferred Stock. The Preferred Stock shall be
issued to CCC in exchange for, and Cogenex requests authority for: the transfer of certain assets of CCC to CCS, including
the rights to prospective business opportunities of CCC, and the rights to contracts to which CCC is a party, pursuant
to a memorandum of understanding between Cogenex and CCC dated September 2, 1994 (regarding the proposed acquisition
of certain of CCC's assets), and the goodwill associated with such assets (``Assets''); and CCC entering into a noncompete
and cooperation agreement with CCS. Cogenex also requests authority for CCS to assume the obligations of CCC with
respect to the Assets.

It is stated that the acquisition of the Assets will allow Cogenex to indirectly expand its customer base by, among
other things, entering into the public housing sector and will provide the public housing sector with the benefit
of Cogenex's experience and expertise in energy conservation and management. Cogenex anticipates a synergistic
relationship with CCS whereby CCS will provide a new outlet for the services and products of EUA Day and EUA NOVA (both
divisions of Cogenex) and for the engineering services of Cogenex.

The Preferred Stock shall be non-redeemable until January 1, 2002 or upon the seventh anniversary of the execution
of the definitive agreement (``Definitive Agreement'') between Cogenex, CCS and CCC (which shall fully set forth
the terms and conditions of CCS' acquisition of CCC's Assets), whichever is later. Upon such date, the Preferred Stock
may be redeemed at Cogenex's sole discretion at a redemption price equal to $100 per share plus then-accrued dividends,
if any, plus an additional amount, if any, determined in accordance with a specific formula. The Preferred Stock shall
be entitled to an annual dividend per share at a rate equal to 33% of the net income of CCS divided by 7,500. The Preferred
Stock dividends shall be paid annually when and as declared by the board of directors of CCS, but not later than June
30th of the calendar year in which they are to be paid. The first such year for which dividends shall be paid shall be the
year ending December 31, 1995. Dividends shall be noncumulative and shall be paid only from current earnings, if any.

Authorization is also requested: (i) for Cogenex to make loans to CCS in an aggregate amount not to exceed $5 million
outstanding at any one time for the purpose of funding the development of projects (``Development Loans''); (ii)
for CCS to issue notes to Cogenex for the Development Loans; (iii) for Cogenex to make loans to CCS in an aggregate amount
not to exceed $2.5 million outstanding at any one time for working capital purposes (``Working Capital Loans'');
and (ii) for CCS to issue notes to Cogenex for the Working Capital Loans. The aggregate amount outstanding at any one
time for the Development Loans and the Working Capital Loans combined shall not exceed $7.5 million.

Provision of credit shall be made at Cogenex's sole discretion and shall be provided upon such terms, conditions and
rates as is customarily provided to affiliates of Cogenex. The Development Loans, and the Working Capital Loans shall
(i) mature within twelve months of their issuance and be renewable from time to time (ii) be prepayable in whole or in
part without penalty and (iii) shall earn interest at a rate equal to the lesser of Cogenex's short-term borrowing
costs or the prime rate on the date of issuance. The source of this financing will be short-term borrowings by Cogenex
under the EUA system's existing bank lines of credit, internally generated cash, repayment of funds advanced to CCS,
proceeds of future long-term debt to be issued by Cogenex and/or purchases of stock, capital contributions, loans
and/or advances by EUA previously authorized, or to be authorized, by the Commission. CCS shall repay the Development
Loans and the Working Capital Loans from internally generated funds, permanent project financing and the issuance
of additional notes for Development Loans and Working Capital Loans, as authorized under this application-declaration.
CCS shall not incur any indebtedness in the form of permanent project financing, nor use the proceeds thereof for the
purpose of repaying Cogenex, without first obtaining Commission authorization.

Cogenex is currently restricted to earning less than 50% of its revenues from outside New England and New York (``50%
Restriction''). CCS' revenues will be subject to the 50% Restriction just like any other aspect of Cogenex's business
(other than revenues from qualifying cogeneration facility projects, as defined in the Public Utility Regulatory
Policies Act of 1978, as amended, and consulting revenues, which revenues are not included in the calculation for
the 50% Restriction); however, Cogenex states that revenues received by CCS through the service agreement it will
enter into with CCC will not be included in the calculation for the 50% Restriction.

Partially approved. The Greater Peoria Airport Authority requested reimbursement of the local share for the entire
Airport Improvement Program (AIP) grant which included funding for airfield signage and security fencing. The FAA
considers these items to be separate projects for PFC purposes. The project description in the PFC application is
limited to the runway 4/22 extension. Therefore, the FAA's approval is limited to the local share of the portion of
the AIP grant attributable to the runway 4/22 extension. 



Decision Date: 

September 8, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Environmental Impact Statement: Douglas County, KS</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The FHWA is issuing this notice to advise the public that a supplement to a Final Environmental Impact Statement will
be prepared for a segment of the South Lawrence Trafficway project in Douglas County, Kansas.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The FHWA, in cooperation with the Kansas Department of Transportation and Douglas County will prepare a supplement
to the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) for a segment of the highway project known as the South Lawrence
Trafficway (SLT). The original FEIS for the improvements (FHWA-KS-EIS-87-01-F) was
approved on January 4, 1990. If this segment is constructed, the project would be primarily on new location, and developed
initially as a two-lane road (ultimately as a four-lane roadway). The SLT Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement
(SEIS) corridor runs from U.S. 59 east to K-10 near 31st Street in south Lawrence. The remaining section of the
SLT is from I-70/Kansas Turnpike Authority (KTA) south and east to U.S. 59.



The SLT is intended to provide for projected traffic demands and to alleviate traffic congestion on the two primary
arterial streets in the south and west sections in the City of Lawrence and improve access to the University of Kansas
and Clinton Lake.

The location (preferred alternative) of the western portion of the South Lawrence Trafficway, from I-70/KTA
then south and east to U.S. 59, has been approved and construction is underway. However, new information regarding
the effects of the SLT on the cultural issues, spiritual sites, academic programs, and future development at Haskell
Indian Nations University (HINU) which were not evaluated in the SLT FEIS have been raised. This segment of the proposed
SLT facility, from U.S. 59 east to K-10, is now to be restudied to address concerns raised by HINU.

Alternatives under consideration include (1) constructing a two-lane (ultimately a four-lane) limited access
highway on the current preferred alternative; and (2) constructing a two-lane ((ultimately a four-lane) limited
access highway on an alternate alignment. Design variations of grade and alignment will be incorporated into and
studied with the various build alternatives.

Letters describing the proposed action and soliciting comments will be sent to appropriate Federal, State, and local
agencies. Letters will also be sent to the private organizations and citizens who have previously expressed or are
known to have interest in this proposal.

A public hearing will be held in Lawrence, Kansas, to provide opportunity for input into the SLT SEIS. Public notice
will be given for the time and place of the public hearing. The Draft SEIS will be available for public and governmental
agency review and comment prior to the public hearing. No formal scoping meeting will be held.

To ensure that the full range of issues related to this proposed action are addressed and all significant issues identified,
comments and suggestions are invited from all interested parties. Comments and questions concerning this proposed
action and the SLT SEIS should be directed to the FHWA, Douglas County, or the Kansas Department of Transportation
at the addresses provided above.

 Notice of calculation and interest. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice advises the public of an increase in the quarterly Internal Revenue Service interest rates used to calculate
interest on overdue accounts and refunds of Customs duties. For the quarter beginning October 1, 1994, the rates will
be 8 percent for overpayments and 9 percent for underpayments. This notice is published for the convenience of the
importing public and Customs personnel.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



Pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1505 and Treasury Decision 85-93, 
published in the 

Federal Register

 on May 29, 1985 (50 FR 21832), the interest rate paid on applicable overpayments or underpayments of Customs duties
shall be in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code rate established under 26 U.S.C. 6621 and 6622. Interest rates
are determined based on the short-term Federal rate. The interest rate that Treasury pays on overpayments will be
the short-term Federal rate plus two percentage points. The interest rate paid to the Treasury for underpayments
will be the short-term Federal rate plus three percentage points. The rates will be rounded to the nearest full percentage.


The interest rates are determined by the Internal Revenue Service on behalf of the Secretary of the Treasury based
on the average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the U.S. with remaining periods to maturity
of 3 years or less, and fluctuate quarterly. The rates effective for a quarter are determined during the first-month
period of the previous quarter. The rates of interest for the first quarter of fiscal year (FY) 1995 (the period of October
1-December 31, 1994) are increased to 8 percent for overpayments and 9 percent for underpayments. These rates
will remain in effect through December 31, 1994, and are subject to change for the second quarter of FY-1995 (the
period of January 1-March 31, 1995).

Monthly Median Cost of Funds Index 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of Thrift Supervision, Treasury. 

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice; request for comment. 



 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Since 1982, the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) or its predecessor, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB), has
collected data from savings associations for, and published, the Monthly Median Cost of Funds (MMCOF) index. This
index is available for adjusting the interest rate on adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs). 



The MMCOF has become less important to the mortgage lending industry since development of the Eleventh District Cost
of Funds Index and the One Year Treasury Bill Rate Index. At the same time, as the OTS-regulated portion of the thrift
industry has contracted, the MMCOF has been based on data from a significantly smaller number of institutions, representing
a smaller portion of mortgage loans. 

The OTS is currently evaluating the direct cost to the industry of supplying data for use in calculating the MMCOF and
the indirect cost to the industry of OTS committing resources used to calculate the MMCOF. The OTS is considering whether
it should: cease publishing the MMCOF; or modify the scope of the MMCOF to increase its usefulness or reduce the cost
to savings associations. 

Potential modifications include expanding the number of reporting institutions to include all OTS-regulated savings
associations or decreasing the reporting universe to a statistically valid sample of OTS-regulated institutions.


If the OTS were to cease publishing the MMCOF, section 402(e)(3) of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and
Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), requires the agency to designate acceptable substitute indices that could be used
for adjusting ARMs currently based on the MMCOF. After reviewing available indices, OTS found that the Quarterly
Average Cost of Funds Index (QCOFI) and the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Index appear to be acceptable substitute
indices. Both of these indices are readily available for adjusting ARMs and have demonstrated a strong correlation
over time to the MMCOF. If the agency determines to stop publishing the MMCOF, it anticipates providing a transition
period of one or two quarters before releasing the last MMCOF.

A. Purpose of the MMCOF 



The MMCOF is a monthly index published by the OTS that can be used to adjust the interest rate on ARMs. The FHLBB first
published the MMCOF in December, 1982. Before the MMCOF, the only national COF index available to savings associations
to adjust interest rates on ARMs was the semiannual cost of funds index the FHLBB introduced in 1979, when ARMs first
began to be used by the thrift industry to help manage interest-rate risks. Because this COF was only published semiannually,
many mortgagors would wait until the rate was published to make their refinancing decisions. The result was a semiannual
surge in the number of refinancings. 

The FHLBB and the savings and loan industry believed that creating a monthly cost of funds index, the MMCOF, would help
disperse throughout the calendar year the number of refinancings associated with both fixed rate mortgages and ARMs
that use COF indices. Since that time, other monthly indices have been developed and have become far more widely used
than the MMCOF. 



B. Current Usage of the MMCOF 



The Federal Housing Finance Board's (FHFB) 

Conventional Mortgage Interest Rate Survey

 (MIRS), indicates that the MMCOF is currently of minor importance to the mortgage lending industry. This survey showed
that instruments used to adjust the interest rate on ARMs included: 



1. Treasury bills with maturities of less than one year; 
2. One-year Treasury bills; 
3. Treasury notes/bonds with maturities greater than one year; 
4. Eleventh District Cost of Funds; 
5. Federal Housing Finance Board contract rate series on previously occupied homes; and 
6. Other cost of funds indices, including the MMCOF. 



According to the March 1994 MIRS, of ARMs closed in March 1994, 57.7 percent were adjusted by the one-year Treasury
constant maturity index, while 21.3 percent of the ARMs were tied to the Eleventh District COFI. Combined, these two
indices controlled 79.0% of the new ARM business. Only 1.8% of ARMs closed in March 1994 were adjusted with indices
included in the ``Other Cost of Funds Indexes,'' which includes mortgages adjusted with the MMCOF. When both fixed
rate mortgages and ARMs were considered, the ``Other Cost of Funds'' mortgages were less than one percent of all loans
closed. 
While the OTS has no data that explain why the MMCOF has been used by such a small percentage of the ARM market, it notes
that the universe of reporting institutions providing the data from which the MMCOF is calculated has declined dramatically
since its inception. In August 1989, the MMCOF was calculated from data reported by approximately 3,350 FHLBB-regulated,
Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation-insured institutions. The then relatively small universe of FHLBB-regulated,
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)-insured federal savings banks was not included in calculating the
MMCOF. Although these institutions were few in number, they then represented, and continue to represent, approximately
9-10% of the industry's assets. 
The number and aggregate assets of OTS-regulated, Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF)-insured institutions
declined rapidly after FIRREA, with the result that the MMCOF was being prepared from an increasingly smaller universe.
Only 1,614 institutions were reporting as of March 1994. This reporting universe includes only OTS-regulated, SAIF
members. It no longer includes approximately 221 FDIC-regulated, private sector SAIF-insured institutions.

The OTS estimates that it costs the industry approximately $400,000 per year to complete and file the MMCOF index data
electronically.

 The total annual cost to the agency to prepare and distribute the MMCOF, which OTS does not use for any supervisory or
regulatory purpose, is between $50,000 and $100,000. Accordingly, the OTS believes that the significant resource
costs it incurs in calculating and publishing the MMCOF and the relatively high data preparation cost to the industry
may outweigh the continued usefulness of the publication, at least in its current form. Therefore, OTS is reviewing:
(1) whether the usefulness of the MMCOF can be increased or the burden on the industry and OTS can be decreased through
modifying the scope of the MMCOF; or (2) whether OTS should stop publishing the MMCOF. 




D. Statutory Requirements 



Section 402(e)(3) of FIRREA requires the OTS to take such action as is necessary to assure that the indices prepared
by the FHLBB, including the MMCOF, immediately prior to the enactment of FIRREA and used to calculate the interest
rate on ARMs continue to be published. Under section 402(e)(4), the OTS may cease publication of an index if it substitutes
an index that is substantially similar to the index that is being deleted and if the Director of OTS determines, after
notice and opportunity for comment, that: 




1. the new index is based on data substantially similar to that of the original index; and 

2. the substitution of the new index will result in an interest rate substantially similar to the rate in effect at the
time the original index became unavailable. 




This statutory protection is designed to mitigate the potential impact of substantially modifying or stopping publication
of an index on outstanding mortgages. Currently, ARMs purchased by both the Federal National Mortgage Association
and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation contain ``adjustable rate note'' language discussing the index to
be used and what must occur if an index is no longer available. The standard language is: ``If the Index is no longer available,
the Note Holder will choose a new index which is based upon comparable information. The Note Holder will give me notice
of this choice.'' This means that the mortgage holder does not have to renegotiate with a borrower so long as the new
index selected is based upon comparable information and the borrower is notified of the change.

In determining whether to modify the MMCOF, OTS must therefore consider whether such a modified index would be based
on comparable data and provide comparable results. Similarly, in considering stopping publication of the MMCOF,
OTS must determine whether acceptable substitute indices are available. 



II. Potential Modifications to the MMCOF 



OTS has considered two potential modifications to the MMCOF and believes that neither would substantially affect
the information provided in the MMCOF or the results obtained by using it in adjusting ARMs. 



A. Use a Randomly Selected Sample of the Industry 



The OTS has considered computing the MMCOF using a randoml
