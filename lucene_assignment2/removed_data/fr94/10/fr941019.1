Proposed rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is proposing to amend its 
regulations to require power reactor licensees to: Assure that uncontrolled changes 
in reactivity, reactor coolant inventory, and loss of subcooled state in the reactor coolant 
system when subcooled conditions are normally being maintained, will not occur when 
the plant is in either a shutdown or low power condition; assure that containment 
integrity is maintained or can be reestablished in a timely manner as needed to prevent 
releases in excess of the current limits in the regulations when the plant is in either a 
shutdown or low power condition; establish controls in technical specifications 
limiting conditions for operation and surveillance requirements or plant procedures 
required by technical specifications administrative controls for equipment which the 
licensee identifies as necessary to perform their safety function when the plant is in a 
shutdown or low power condition; evaluate realistically the effect of fires stemming 
from activities conducted during cold shutdown or refueling conditions, determine 
whether such fires could realistically prevent accomplishment of the normal decay heat 
removal capability, and if so, either provide measures to prevent loss of normal decay 
heat removal or establish a contingency plan that would ensure that an alternate decay 
heat removal capability exists; and for licensees of PWRs only, provide 
instrumentation for monitoring water level in the RCS during midloop operation. The 
proposed amendments would provide substantial additional protection to public health 
and safety from the risk of a core-melt accident.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



Over the past several years, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) staff has 
become increasingly concerned about the safety of operations during the shutdown of 
nuclear power reactors. The loss of decay heat removal (DHR) during shutdown and 
refueling has been a continuing problem. In 1980, DHR was lost at the Davis-Besse 
plant when one residual heat removal (RHR) pump failed and the second pump was out 
of service. After reviewing the Davis-Besse event and studying the operating 
requirements that existed at the time of the event, the NRC issued Bulletin 80-42 and 
Generic Letter (GL) 80-43 calling for new technical specifications to ensure that one 
RHR system is operating and a second is available (i.e., operable) for most shutdown 
conditions. The Diablo Canyon event of April 10, 1987, highlighted the fact that 
midloop operation was a particularly sensitive condition with respect to operability of the 
residual heat removal pumps. In this event, the reactor coolant system was overdrained 
during midloop operation. The resulting low water level in the reactor vessel caused 
vortexing and air entrainment and loss of both residual heat removal pumps. After 
reviewing the event, the staff issued GL 88-17, recommending that licensees address 
numerous generic deficiencies to improve the reliability of the DHR capability. More 
recently, the incident investigation team's report on the loss of AC power at the Vogtle 
plant (NUREG-1410) emphasized the need for risk management of shutdown operations. 
Furthermore, discussions with foreign regulatory organizations (i.e., French and Swedish 
authorities) about their evaluations regarding shutdown risk have reinforced previous 
NRC staff findings that the core-damage probability (CDP) for shutdown operation can 
be a fairly substantial fraction of the total CDP. Because of these concerns regarding 
operational safety during shutdown, the NRC conducted a careful, detailed evaluation of 
safety during shutdown and low-power operations which is documented in NUREG-1449. 



Objective 



The NRC staff's comprehensive evaluation of shutdown and low-power 
operations, documented in NUREG-1449, included observations and inspections at a 
number of plants, analysis of operating experience, deterministic safety analysis, and 
insights from probabilistic risk assessments. It was observed that shutdown risks have 
been reduced at many plants through improvements to outage programs. However, the 
improvements have been unevenly and inconsistently applied across the industry. From 
this evaluation, the NRC has concluded that public health and safety have been 
adequately protected during the period that plants have been in shutdown and low power 
conditions; but that substantial safety improvements are possible and NRC requirements are warranted for the following
reasons: 

(1) A regulatory requirement would set minimum standards for all plants and would ensure that safety improvements
already made by industry will be applied consistently throughout the industry and will not be eroded in the future.


(2) A regulatory requirement would further reduce risk by improving safety in the 
areas of fire protection for all plants and midloop operation for PWRs. 

(3) Significant precursor events involving loss of DHR capability continue to occur 
despite efforts to resolve the problem. 

(4) Some controls, including regulatory controls, have been significantly lacking and have in the past allowed plants
to enter circumstances that would likely challenge safety functions with minimal mitigation equipment available
and containment integrity not established.

The NRC has identified possible regulatory actions to address these problems and 
subjected them to a regulatory analysis which also addresses the requirements for a 
backfit analysis under 10 CFR 50.109.
 These actions have been evaluated within the 
framework of the Commission's Safety Goal Policy, (51 FR 30028; August 21, 1986) to 
determine whether or not they would result in a substantial increase in the overall 
protection of the public health and safety. 





The NRC has observed that many shutdown operations may take place with the 
containment partially open. Therefore, cost-effective regulatory actions are appropriate 
to ensure substantial reduction in core-damage probability, and an improvement in the 
likelihood of containment isolation, when necessary. These actions would substantially 
increase the overall protection of public health and safety. 




Operating Experience 



The NRC staff reviewed operating experience at nuclear power plants to ensure 
that its evaluation encompassed the range of events encountered during shutdown and 
low-power operations including: licensee event reports (LERs), studies performed by the 
Office for Analysis and Evaluation of Operational Data (AEOD), and various inspection 
reports to determine the types of events that take place during refueling, cold and hot 
shutdown, and low-power operations. 

The NRC staff also reviewed events that occurred at foreign nuclear power plants 
using information found in the foreign events file maintained for AEOD at the Oak 
Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). The AEOD compilation included the types of 
events that applied to U.S. nuclear plants and those not found in a review of U.S. 
experience. 

In performing this review, the NRC staff found that the more significant events 
for pressurized-water reactors (PWRs) were the loss of residual heat removal, potential 
pressurization, and boron dilution events. The more important events for boiling-water 
reactors (BWRs) were the loss of coolant, the loss of cooling, and potential 
pressurization. Generally, the majority of important events involved human error and 
procedural errors. The NRC staff documented this review in NUREG-1449. In 
addition, the NRC staff selected 10 events from the AEOD review for further assessment 
as precursors to potential severe core-damage accidents. This assessment is fully 
documented in NUREG-1449.

Further, undesirable events continue to occur during shutdown operations. 
Recent operating experiences during shutdown include (1) entry into midloop operation with a degraded RHR pump at
a PWR on December 11, 1993, (2) the discovery of a large, undetected nitrogen gas bubble in the RCS during extended cold
shutdown at a PWR on December 17, 1993, (3) a hydrogen burn in an empty pressurizer caused by welding activities during
cold shutdown at a PWR on February 3, 1994, and (4) the loss of one train of RHR 2 days after shutdown due to outage activities
at a BWR on March 17, 1994. These recent events reinforce the previous assessment of shutdown operations documented
in NUREG-1449. 



Industry Work 



The industry has addressed outage planning and control with programs that 
include workshops, Institute of Nuclear Power Operations (INPO) inspections, Electric Power Research Institute
(EPRI) support, as well as enhanced training and procedures. One activity (a formal initiative proposed by the Nuclear
Management and Resources Council (NUMARC)) has produced for the utilities a set of guidelines to use for self-assessment
of shutdown operations (NUMARC 91-06).

2

 This high-level guidance addresses many, but not all, of the areas in outage planning that need improvement. Detailed
guidance on developing an outage planning program is outside the scope of the NUMARC effort. The NRC staff believes
that NUMARC 91-06 represents a significant and constructive step, effects of which have already been realized
by many utilities using the draft guidance in recent outages.

3

 For example, on the basis of its review of operating experience and pilot team inspections, the staff observed that
industry efforts and improvements have been made which should reduce risk in the shutdown and low-power operations
area. Some licensees were observed to have in-depth contingency planning for backup cooling; other licensees were
found to have well-planned and tightly conducted outages run by outage-experienced, operationally oriented personnel;
and other licensees had developed well-defined strategies and procedures for plant and 
hardware configurations, including fuel offload, midloop operation in PWRs, use of nozzle dams in PWRs, venting
in PWRs, electrical equipment, onsite sources of ac power, containment status and control, and such key instrumentation
as RCS temperature, reactor water level, and RCS pressure. Further, industry
s defense-in-depth concept for safety functions and outage strategy contained in NUMARC 91-06 have been recognized
as excellent self-improvements in the shutdown and low-power operations area. However, implementation of these
efforts and improvements has been unevenly 
and inconsistently applied, as observed at several site inspections conducted by the staff.

Safety Importance 



The NRC's staff's rationale for proposing the requirements described previously is that they will provide substantial
safety improvements, and the costs of implementation are justified in view of the benefits to be provided. This judgment
is based on a qualitative assessment supplemented by a quantitative analysis. The considerations that principally
support the proposed action are as follows: 

(1) The improvements reflect the NRC safety philosophy of ``defense in depth'' in that they address: (a) Prevention
of credible challenges to safety functions through improvements in operations and fire protection; and (b) mitigation
of challenges to redundant protection systems, through improved procedures, training, improved controls on plant
equipment and contingency plans. 

(2) Accident sequences during shutdown which are as rapid and severe as those that might occur during power operation
should be addressed with commensurate requirements. This is supported by the staff's engineering analysis of accidents
during shutdown conditions documented in NUREG-1449. 

(3) The improvements being proposed are aimed directly at problems that have been repeatedly observed in operating
experience, e.g., loss of decay heat removal, loss of ac power, loss of RCS inventory, fires, personnel errors, poor
procedures and poor planning, and lack of training. 

Only a very limited number of probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) studies 
covering shutdown conditions have been performed and those studies contain 
considerable uncertainty. The uncertainty is due largely to the predominant role played by operators and other licensee
staff in shutdown events and recovery from them. Human reliability is difficult to quantify, especially under unfamiliar
conditions which are often not covered in training or procedures. The collection of PRA studies discussed in NUREG-1449
gives some insight into the likely range of shutdown risks for the spectrum of current plants. The mean CDP for shutdown
events appears to be in the range of 6E- 
05 to 7E-06 per reactor-year. Although detailed uncertainty analysis is not available for most of the PRAs covering
shutdown conditions, some insight can be gained by examining the uncertainty analysis in NUREG-1150 where
the CDP uncertainty ranges (5th and 95th percentiles) are approximately one order of magnitude. From this limited
information, the staff concludes that a reasonable estimate of the range of CDP is 1E-04 to 1E-06 per reactor-year.


On the basis of the analysis of operating experience in NUREG-1449, including the accident sequence precursor
analysis, the NRC staff identified the following as dominant event sequences during shutdown: loss of all ac power,
loss of RCS inventory, and loss of reactor vessel level control in PWRs. These sequences have been modeled as part of
the regulatory analysis of proposed improvements in shutdown and low-power operations. Core-damage probabilities
for these sequences are point estimates built from best estimates of each step in the sequence. No uncertainty analysis
was performed 
because of the lack of reliable statistical data for shutdown conditions. However, a sensitivity study has been performed
to assess the effect of uncertain assumptions on the overall results of the analysis. The results of the sensitivity
study show that despite sensitivity to changes in PRA assumptions, the estimated changes in risk associated with
the proposed improvements remain significant even when inputs are changed significantly. 

The results of the analysis of the dominant event sequences indicate potential reductions in core-damage probability
of greater than 5E-05 per reactor-year for each PWR's improvement, and approximately 1E-05 per reactor-year
for improvement to BWRs. As previously stated, the staff recognizes that significant improvement in core-damage
probability has already been achieved through recent industry actions, however, the proposed rule would place a
regulatory ``footprint'' on outage safety and codify improvements made by industry to ensure that (1) reductions
in risk already achieved are not eroded in the future and (2) consistency and uniform achievement of the safety improvements
is realized throughout the industry. The proposed rule would also set minimum standards for all plants and further
reduce risk by improving safety in the areas of fire protection for shutdown decay heat removal and effective reactor
vessel water level instrumentation for PWRs in midloop operation.

Containment capability and releases of radioactivity for accident sequences during shutdown are also evaluated
as part of the regulatory analysis. From that work, the NRC has concluded that an intact containment will effectively
prevent early releases from shutdown accidents. Large, dry PWR containments should remain intact if closed before
being challenged. Severe core-damage accidents in open containments or in containments that fail are expected to
have offsite consequences similar to severe core-damage accidents initiating from power operations. Onsite consequences
within a few hundred meters of open or failed containments may be more severe at shutdown than at power. The potential
dose to the public for a severe core-damage accident without an effective containment was estimated to be 2E+06 person-rem
(2E+04 person-Sv). 



Basis for Commission Position 



The NRC proposes to resolve concerns regarding shutdown and low-power operations by rulemaking that would require
power reactor licensees to: 

(1) Assure that uncontrolled changes in reactivity, reactor coolant inventory, and loss of subcooled state in the
reactor coolant system when subcooled conditions are normally being maintained, will not occur when the plant is
in either a shutdown or low-power condition; 

(2) Assure that containment integrity is maintained or can be reestablished in a timely manner as needed to prevent
releases in excess of the guidelines of 10 CFR Part 100 when the plant is in either a shutdown or low-power condition;


(3) Identify that equipment necessary to make the reactor subcritical or critical in a controlled manner and maintain
it subcritical in a shutdown condition, and establish controls in either technical specifications limiting conditions
for operation and surveillance requirements in accordance with the requirements of 10 CFR 50.36(c)(2) and (3) or
plant procedures required by technical specifications administrative controls pursuant to 10 CFR 50.36(c)(5)
for that equipment such that they will ensure each safety function when the plant is in a shutdown or low power condition;


(4) Prior to (and throughout the shutdown refueling outage as necessary to accommodate unforeseen contingencies)
entering cold shutdown or a refueling condition, evaluate realistically available fire-protection features and
the outage plan for possible fires stemming from activities conducted during cold shutdown or refueling conditions,
determine whether such fires could realistically prevent accomplishment of the normal decay heat removal capability
during cold shutdown or refueling conditions, and if so, either take measures to prevent loss of normal decay heat
removal by such fires during cold shutdown or a refueling condition, or have a contingency plan in place that will ensure
an alternate decay heat removal capability exists and that will describe the general steps to connect the alternate
decay heat removal system to the reactor coolant system (RCS); and 

(5) For licensees of PWRs only, provide instrumentation for monitoring water level in the RCS during midloop operation.


The technical basis for the NRC's staff's position is derived from the NRC staff's comprehensive evaluation of shutdown
and low-power issues in NUREG-1449, ``Shutdown and Low-Power Operations at Nuclear Power Plants in the United
States.'' NUREG-1449 was published as a draft report for comment in February 1992. The comment period on the
draft NUREG-1449 ended on April 30, 1992, and a large number of comments were received from utilities and industry
organizations. The NRC staff addressed the comments in the final report (NUREG-1449) which was issued in September
1993. The principal findings from NUREG-1449 that support the NRC regulatory position in this proposed rule
are the following: 

(1) Accident sequences during shutdown can be as rapid and severe as those 
during power operations. 

(2) All PWR containments and BWR (boiling-water reactor) Mark III primary containments are capable of offering significant
protection if the containment is closed or can be closed quickly. However, analyses show that the steam and radiation
environment in the containment, which can result from an extended loss of DHR or LOCA, would make it difficult to close
the containment in many cases. BWR Mark I and II secondary containments offer less protection against an accident,
but this is offset by a significantly lower likelihood of core damage in BWRs than in PWRs. 

(3) Outage planning is crucial to safety during shutdown conditions since it establishes (a) if and when a licensee
will enter circumstances likely to challenge safety functions and (b) the level of mitigation equipment available.


(4) Using technical specifications to control the availability of safety-related equipment is appropriate because
(i) operators are trained and accustomed to operating the facility in accordance with approved procedures within
the clear limits set by technical specifications and (ii) technical specifications establish clear and enforceable
regulatory requirements.





(5) Although maintenance activities that can increase the potential for fire are performed during shutdown, current
NRC requirements in the area of fire protection do not apply to shutdown conditions.

(6) Operating experience continues to show that the ability to maintain control of RCS level in PWRs during draindown
and steady-state operation has been a problem. The principal contributor to events during some shutdown configurations
has been identified as poor quality and reliability of reactor vessel level instrumentation. This problem is most
significant during midloop operation, where a small variation in level can lead to a loss of DHR. PRAs have consistently
found a higher risk associated with midloop operation than with other operational states. 

The requirements being proposed by the NRC are aimed directly at problems that have been repeatedly observed in operating
experience, such as loss of decay heat removal, loss of ac power, loss of RCS inventory, fires, personnel errors, poor
procedures, poor planning, and poor training. The proposed requirements reflect the NRC safety philosophy of defense
in depth, in that they address: (1) prevention of credible challenges to safety functions through improvements in
operations, fire protection and water level instrumentation in PWRs and (2) mitigation of challenges to redundant
protection systems, through improved equipment controls. 

Equipment controls must be included in either technical specifications limiting conditions for operation and surveillance
requirements in accordance with the requirements of 10 CFR 50.36(c)(2) and (3), or plant procedures required by technical
specifications administrative controls pursuant to 10 CFR 50.36(c)(5). Requirements for specific equipment availability
using plant procedures would be established by the licensee in a way that provides maximum flexibility by: (1) permitting
the use of non-safety as well as safety equipment to provide safety functions; (2) permitting reduced decay heat levels
to be a factor in developing such mitigating strategies as the selection of protective features and determination
of when to put such protective features into service; and (3) allowing changes regarding the availability of equipment
during the outage to be made without prior NRC review and approval. This particular resolution path has not been evaluated
explicitly in the regulatory analysis; but the NRC believes that this approach to controlling mitigative equipment
can produce a safety benefit comparable to that for the LCO approach. 



Relationship to Existing Requirements 



Technical Specifications 



Section 50.67(c)(3)(iii) of the proposed rule may result in changes to plant-specific technical specifications
as well as to the standard technical specifications documented in NUREG-1430, NUREG-1431, NUREG-1432,
NUREG-1433, and NUREG-1434 (STS for Babcock & Wilcox plants, Westinghouse plants, Combustion Engineering
plants, General Electric BWR/4 plants, and General Electric BWR/6 plants, respectively). Section 50.67(c)(3)(iii)
of the proposed rule requires identified equipment controls during shutdown or low-power conditions to be established
in technical specifications or plant procedures required by technical specifications administrative controls
in support of specific safety functions, including such support functions as electric power. Section 50.67(c)(3)(ii)
states that the controls must reflect sufficient redundancy in systems, subsystems, components, and features to
ensure that, for the onsite electric power system in operation (assuming offsite power is not available), safety
functions can be accomplished, assuming a single failure. LCOs currently used at some plants do not cover all of the
safety functions recommended in the proposed rule. For some systems, under some conditions, standard technical
specifications, as well as current plant-specific technical specifications, lack the redundancy called for in
the proposed rule. 



Fire Protection 



The principal regulation covering fire protection is 10 CFR 50.48. It requires all plants to have a fire protection
plan that satisfies General Design Criterion (GDC) 3 of Appendix A to 10 CFR Part 50. Appendix R to 10 CFR Part 50 gives
specific requirements to be satisfied in complying with the regulation for plants licensed before 1979. Additionally,
guidance for satisfying the regulation is found in the branch technical positions referenced in the regulation.
However, this guidance was developed to ensure that the plant could be brought to a hot shutdown condition from power
operation during a fire and does not address the condition of being in a shutdown or refueling mode at the time of a fire.
Further, fire-protection criteria established by the regulations only require that at least one train of those systems
important for ensuring an adequate level of DHR during cold shutdown and refueling be capable of being restored to
service within 72 hours of a fire. In addition, NRC guidelines for performing a fire hazards analysis do not address
shutdown and refueling conditions, or the potential impact a fire may have on the capability to maintain shutdown
cooling. 

With the proposed requirements in the area of fire protection during cold shutdown or refueling conditions, it is
the Commission's intent to supplement current requirements for fire protection with additional requirements to
ensure that decay heat removal capability is not lost because of a fire during cold shutdown or refueling conditions.
If the evaluation required by the proposed rule shows that fires would prevent accomplishment of normal decay heat
removal capability, the licensee must either take measures to prevent the loss of normal decay heat removal by such
fires or have a contingency plan in place that will ensure that an alternate decay heat removal capability exists during
cold shutdown or a refueling condition. The contingency plan should describe the general steps to connect the alternate
decay heat removal system to the RCS. The NRC staff recognizes that this could be done by revising existing regulations
to include detailed supplemental requirements. However, the proposed requirements state that realistic fires
during cold shutdown and refueling conditions should be evaluated rather than the more conservative fires that are
analyzed under Appendix R. This realistic evaluation of available fire-protection features and the outage plan
for possible fires should serve as the basis for further appropriate action. Permanent hardware fixes need not be
employed as an option to reduce the risk of fire during cold shutdown and refueling conditions. On the contrary, if
the evaluation results in the conclusion that some changes must be made, the licensee should consider less onerous
options to reduce the risk of fire such as: (a) modifying or relocating the activities that might cause the fire; (b)
constructing temporary fire barriers; or (c) revising plant procedures. 



Instrumentation 



The NRC believes the proposed action regarding installation in a PWR of new reactor vessel water level instrumentation,
including an alarm, is a cost-justified substantial safety enhancement and the costs of implementation are justified
in the view of the substantial benefit that is provided.
 This action stems from a desire to eliminate losses of the RHR system due to air ingestion caused by operator error when
lowering water level to achieve a midloop condition. The additional level instrumentation would supplement the
improved level instrumentation adopted voluntarily by all affected licensees in response to GL 88-17, ``Loss
of Decay Heat Removal.''

Expected Achievement 



The NRC notes that, based on the available evidence, no undue public risk exists without the promulgation of the rule
for shutdown and low-power operations. The proposed rule would strengthen safety by preventing accidents and mitigating
accidents, and thereby reduce the likelihood of a core-damage accident and the offsite releases due to loss of a key
safety function during shutdown or low-power operations. Significant improvements have already been achieved
in this regard through the implementation of the NUMARC guidelines; however, the proposed rule would place a regulatory
``footprint'' on outage safety and codify improvements made by industry to ensure that (1) reductions in risk already
achieved are not eroded in the future and (2) consistency and uniform achievement of the safety improvements is realized
throughout the industry. The proposed rule would also set minimum standards for all plants and further reduce risk
by improving safety in the areas of fire protection for shutdown decay heat removal and effective reactor vessel water
level instrumentation for PWRs in midloop operation. Moreover, the overall risk may also be reduced by additional
improvements in severe accident management, given the assumption that core damage occurs, whether from an event
during an outage or during power operations. Therefore, the proposed rule should be viewed as being in the same accident
prevention context as the ATWS rule (10 CFR 50.62) and the station blackout rule (10 CFR 50.63) in that it recognizes,
as the other two rules recognize, multiple failure possibilities resulting from common cause effects that should
be addressed. 



Comments Requested 



Section 50.67(c)(3)(i) of the proposed rule calls for the identification of equipment necessary to (a) make the reactor
subcritical or critical in a controlled manner and maintain the reactor subcritical in a shutdown condition, (b)
maintain RCS inventory and capability to add makeup water to the reactor vessel, (c) remove decay heat from the reactor,
(d) monitor water level in the reactor vessel, and (e) maintain or reestablish containment integrity when the plant
is in a shutdown or low-power condition. Further, Section 50.67(c)(3)(ii) of the proposed rule requires licensees
to establish controls for the equipment identified such that they will perform their safety function when the plant
is in a shutdown or low power condition. The controls must reflect sufficient redundancy in systems, subsystems,
components, and features to ensure that, for the onsite electric power system in operation (assuming offsite power
is not available), safety functions can be accomplished, assuming a single failure, for all conditions except refueling
operations (with water level above the reactor in excess of a lower limit established in applicable technical specifications
or plant procedures). Section 50.67(c)(3)(iii) of the proposed rule specifies that the controls required by paragraph
(c)(3)(ii) be included in technical specifications limiting conditions for operation and surveillance requirements
in accordance with the requirements of 10 CFR 50.36(c)(2) and (3), or plant procedures required by technical specifications
administrative controls pursuant to 10 CFR 50.36(c)(5). The NRC would like to receive comments describing the possible
alternate methods for equipment controls. Additionally, the current regulatory analysis only addresses LCO and
SR changes within the technical specifications, and does not reflect the risk reduction already achieved by industry
through voluntary actions. The Commission requests information as to steps that licensees have already taken to
reduce risk during shutdown and low-power operations. Finally, the NRC would like to receive comments on the use of
probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) information and the calculation of the value of offsite dose (accident consequence)
in the cost/benefit analysis.

Criminal Penalties 



For purposes of section 223 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (AEA), the Commission proposes to issue the
proposed rule under one or more of sections 161b, 161i, or 161o of the AEA. Willful violations of the rule are subject
to criminal enforcement. 



Finding of No Significant Environmental Impact: Availability 



The Commission has determined under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, and the Commission's
regulations in Subpart A of 10 CFR Part 51, that this rule, if adopted, does not degrade the environment in any way. The
actions resulting from this rule, if adopted, would reduce the core damage frequency and risks during shutdown and
low-power operations. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there will be no significant impact on the environment
from this proposed rule. This discussion constitutes the environmental assessment and finding of no significant
impact for this proposed rule; a separate assessment has not been prepared. 



Paperwork Reduction Act Statement 



This proposed rule amends information collection requirements that are subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of
1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). The rule has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review and approval
of the information collection requirements. 

The public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 3160 hours per respondent,
including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the
data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate
or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to the Information
and Records Management Branch (T-6 F 33), U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555-0001,
and to the Desk Officer, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, NEOB-10202, (3150-0011), Office
of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503.

Regulatory Analysis 


The Commission has prepared a draft regulatory analysis

 for this proposed rule that examines the costs and benefits of the alternatives considered. This analysis is documented
in a report entitled, ``Regulatory Analysis in Accordance with 10 CFR 50.109: Requirements for Shutdown and Low-Power
Operations at Nuclear Power Plants,'' and is available for inspection in the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street,
N.W. (Lower Level), Washington, DC. Single copies of the analysis may be obtained from Kulin Desai, Division of Systems
Safety and Analysis, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC
20555-0001, Telephone: (301) 504-2835. 




The Commission requests public comments on the proposed rule, draft Regulatory Guide, ``Shutdown and Low-Power
Operations at Nuclear Power Plants,'' and the draft report documenting the regulatory analysis, entitled, ``Regulatory
Analysis in Accordance with 10 CFR 50.109: Requirements for Shutdown and Low-Power Operations at Nuclear Power Plants.''



Regulatory Flexibility Certification 


In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the Commission certifies that, if promulgated,
this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This proposed
rule would affect only the licensing and operation of nuclear power plants. The companies that own these plants do
not fall within the scope of the definition of ``small entities'' as given in the Regulatory Flexibility Act or the
Small Business Size Standards in regulations issued 
by the Small Business Administration at 13 CFR Part 121. 


Backfit Analysis 


As required by 10 CFR 50.109, a backfit analysis has been performed for the proposed rule. The backfit analysis on which
this determination is based is included in the report entitled, ``Regulatory Analysis in Accordance with 10 CFR 50.109:
Requirements for Shutdown and Low-Power Operations at Nuclear Power Plants,'' dated December 1993. The backfit
analysis approach emphasized a qualitative estimation supplemented by a quantitative analysis for bounding conditions
as reflected in the regulatory analysis. The backfit analysis and the regulatory analysis will be revised based on
comments received from the public. The Commission has determined, based on this analysis, that backfitting to comply
with the requirements of this proposed rule will 
provide a substantial increase in protection to public health and safety because it would: (1) reduce the frequency
of events caused by poor planning and control of activities during outages; (2) ensure availability of key safety
functions during shutdown and low-power operations at all plants; (3) ensure that a method of decay heat removal remains
viable in the event of a fire in any plant area during cold shutdown or refueling conditions; and (4) provide accurate
instrumentation for PWRs to use when draining the reactor coolant system to a midloop configuration to avoid air binding
and eventual loss of residual heat removal pumps. The Commission has further determined the cost of implementing
the new requirements is justified for PWRs in view of the increase in protection attributable to the proposed backfits
but plans to specifically reassess BWRs following consideration of comments on this proposed rulemaking.

Corporation).

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The FDIC is proposing to amend its risk-based capital 
guidelines for state nonmember banks. The proposal would revise 
and expand the set of conversion factors used to calculate the 
potential future exposure of derivative contracts and recognize 
effects of netting arrangements in the calculation of potential 
future exposure for derivative contracts subject to qualifying 
bilateral netting arrangements. 



The FDIC is proposing these amendments on the basis of 
proposed revisions to the Basle Accord announced on July 15, 
1994. The effect of the proposed amendments would be twofold. 
First, long-dated interest rate and exchange rate contracts would 
be subject to new higher conversion factors and new conversion 
factors would be set forth that specifically apply to derivative 
contracts related to equities, precious metals, and other 
commodities. Second, institutions would be permitted to 
recognize a reduction in potential future exposure for 
transactions subject to qualifying bilateral netting 
arrangements.

The international risk-based capital standards (the Basle 
Accord or Accord)
 set forth a framework for measuring capital 
adequacy under which risk-weighted assets are calculated by 
assigning assets and off-balance-sheet items to broad categories 
based primarily on their credit risk, that is, the risk that a 
loss will be incurred due to an obligor or counterparty default 
on a transaction.
 Off-balance-sheet transactions are 
incorporated into risk-weighted assets by converting each item 
into a credit equivalent amount which is then assigned to the 
appropriate credit risk category according to the identity of the 
obligor or counterparty, or if relevant, the guarantor or the 
nature of the collateral. 






The credit equivalent amount of an interest rate or exchange 
rate contract (rate contract) is determined by adding together 
the current replacement cost (current exposure) and an estimate 
of the possible increases in future replacement cost, in view of 
the volatility of the current exposure over the remaining life of 
the contract (potential future exposure, also referred to as the 
add-on). Each credit equivalent amount is then assigned to the 
appropriate risk category generally based on identity of the 
counterparty. The maximum risk weight applied to interest rate 
or exchange rate contracts is 50 percent.
 





A. Current Exposure 



A state nonmember bank that has a rate contract with a 
positive mark-to-market value has a current exposure or a 
possible loss equal to the mark-to-market value.
 For risk-based 
capital purposes, if the mark-to-market value is zero or 
negative, then there is no replacement cost associated with the 
contract and the current exposure is zero. The sum of current 
exposures for a defined set of contracts is sometimes referred to 
as the gross current exposure for that set of contracts. 





The Accord, as endorsed in 1988, provided that current 
exposure would be determined individually for every rate contract 
entered into by a banking organization. Generally, institutions 
were not permitted to offset, that is, net, positive and negative 
mark-to-market values of multiple rate contracts with a single 
counterparty
 to determine one current exposure relative to that 
counterparty. In April 1993 the BSC proposed a revision to the 
Accord, endorsed by the G-10 Governors in July 1994, that permits 
institutions to net positive and negative mark-to-market values 
of rate contracts subject to a qualifying, legally enforceable, 
bilateral netting arrangement. Under the revision to the Accord, 
institutions with qualifying netting arrangements could replace 
the gross current exposure of a set of contracts included in such 
an arrangement with a single net current exposure for purposes of 
calculating the credit equivalent amount for the included 
contracts. If the net market value is positive, then that market 
value equals the current exposure for the netting contract. If 
the net market value is zero or negative, then the current 
exposure is zero. 





On July 25, 1994, the FDIC issued a notice of proposed 
rulemaking to amend its risk-based capital guidelines in 
accordance with the BSC April 1993 proposal. 59 FR 37726, July 
25, 1994.
 Generally, under the proposal, a bilateral netting 
arrangement would be recognized for risk-based capital purposes 
only if the netting arrangement is legally enforceable. The bank 
would have to have a legal opinion(s) to this effect. That 
proposal is consistent with the final July 1994 change to the 
Accord. 





B. Potential Future Exposure 



The second part of the credit equivalent amount, potential 
future exposure, is an estimate of the additional exposure that 
may arise over the remaining life of the contract as a result of 
fluctuations in prices or rates. Such changes may increase the 
market value of the contract in the future and, therefore, 
increase the cost of replacing it if the counterparty 
subsequently defaults. 

The add-on for potential future exposure is estimated by 
multiplying the notional principal amount
 of the underlying 
contract by a credit conversion factor that is determined by the 
remaining maturity of the contract and the type of contract. The 
existing set of conversion factors used to calculate potential 
future exposure, referred to as the add-on matrix, is as follows: 







The conversion factors were determined through simulation 
studies that estimated the potential volatility of interest and 
exchange rates and analyzed the implications of movements in 
those rates for the replacement costs of various types of 
interest rate and exchange rate contracts. The simulation 
studies were conducted only on rate contracts, because at the 
time the Accord was being developed activity in the derivatives 
market was for the most part limited to these types of 
transactions. The analysis produced probability distributions of 
potential replacement costs over the remaining life of matched 
pairs of rate contracts.
 Potential future exposure was then 
defined in terms of confidence limits for these distributions. 
The conversion factors were intended to be a compromise between 
precision, on the one hand, and complexity and burden, on the 
other.

<DOCNO> FR941019-1-00017 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941019-1-00002 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The add-on for potential future exposure is calculated for 
all contracts, regardless of whether the market value is zero, 
positive, or negative, or whether the current exposure is 
calculated on a gross or net basis. The add-on will always be 
either a positive number or zero. The recent revision to the 
Accord to recognize netting for the calculation of current 
exposure does not affect the calculation of potential future 
exposure, which generally continues to be calculated on a gross 
basis. This means that an add-on for potential future exposure 
is calculated separately for each individual contract subject to 
the netting arrangement and then these individual future 
exposures are added together to arrive at a gross add-on for 
potential future exposure. For contracts subject to a qualifying 
bilateral netting arrangement in accordance with the newly 
adopted Accord changes, the gross add-on for potential future 
exposure would be added to the net current exposure to arrive at 
one credit equivalent amount for the contracts subject to the 
netting arrangement. 

The original Basle Accord noted that the credit conversion 
factors in the add-on matrix were provisional and would be 
subject to revision if volatility levels or market conditions 
changed. 



II. Basle Proposals for the Treatment of Potential Future 
Exposure 



Since the original Accord was adopted, the derivatives 
market has grown and broadened. The use of certain types of 
derivative instruments not specifically addressed in the Accord_
notably commodity, precious metal, and equity-linked 
transactions
_has become much more widespread. As a result of 
continued review of the method for calculating the add-on for 
potential future exposure, in July 1994 the BSC issued two 
proposals for public consultation.
 The first proposal would 
expand the matrix of add-on factors used to calculate potential 
future exposure to take into account innovations in the 
derivatives market. The second proposal would recognize 
reductions in the potential future exposure of derivative 
contracts that result from entering into bilateral netting 
arrangements. The second proposal is an extension of the recent 
revision to the Accord recognizing bilateral netting arrangements 
for purposes of calculating current exposure and would formally 
extend the recognition of netting arrangements to equity, 
precious metals and other commodity derivative contracts. The 
consultation period for these BSC proposals is scheduled to end 
on October 10, 1994. 






A. Expansion of Add-On Matrix 



A recently concluded BSC review of the add-on for potential 
future exposure indicated that the current add-on factors used to 
calculate the potential future exposure amount may produce 
insufficient capital for certain types of derivative instruments, 
in particular, long-dated interest rate contracts, commodity 
contracts, and equity-index contracts. The BSC review indicated 
that the current add-on factors do not adequately address the 
full range of contract structures and the timing of cash flows. 
The review also showed that the conversion factors many 
institutions are using to calculate potential future exposure for 
commodity, precious metal, and equity contracts could result in 
insufficient capital coverage in view of the volatility of the 
indices or prices on the underlying assets from which these 
contracts derive their value.

<TEXT>
 

The BSC concluded that it was not appropriate to address 
these problems with a significant departure from the existing 
methodology used in the Accord. The BSC decided that it would be 
appropriate to preserve the conversion factors existing in the 
Accord and add new conversion factors. Consequently, the revision 
proposed by the BSC retains the existing conversion factors for 
rate contracts but applies new higher conversion factors to such 
contracts with remaining maturities of five years and over.
 
The proposal also introduces conversion factors specifically 
applicable to commodity, precious metal, and equity contracts. 
The new conversion factors were determined on the basis of 
simulation studies that used the same general approach that 
generated the original add-on conversion factors.







The proposed matrix is set forth below:

Gold is included within the foreign exchange column because 
the price volatility of gold has been found to be comparable to 
the exchange rate volatility of major currencies. In addition, 
the BSC determined that gold's role as a financial asset 
distinguishes it from other precious metals. The proposed matrix 
is designed to accommodate the different structures of contracts, 
as well as the observed disparities in the volatilities of the 
associated indices or prices of the underlying assets. 

Two footnotes are attached to the matrix to address two 
particular contract structures. The first relates to contracts 
with multiple exchanges of principal. Since the level of 
potential future exposure rises generally in proportion to the 
number of remaining exchanges, the conversion factors are to be 
multiplied by the number of remaining payments (that is, 
exchanges of principal) in the contract. This treatment is 
intended to ensure that the full level of potential future 
exposure is adequately covered. The second footnote applies to 
equity contracts that automatically reset to zero each time a 
payment is made. The credit risk associated with these contracts 
is similar to that of a series of shorter contracts beginning and 
ending at each reset date. For this type of equity contract the 
remaining maturity is set equal to the time remaining until the 
next payment. 

While the capital charges resulting from the application of 
the new proposed conversion factors may not provide complete 
coverage for risks associated with any single contract, the BSC 
believes the factors will provide a reasonable level of 
prudential coverage for derivative contracts on a portfolio 
basis. Like the original matrix, the proposed expanded matrix is 
designed to provide a reasonable balance between precision, and 
complexity and burden. 



B. Recognition of the Effects of Netting 



The simulation studies used to generate the conversion 
factors for potential future exposure analyzed the implications 
of underlying rate and price movements on the current exposure of 
contracts without taking into account reductions in exposure that 
could result from legally enforceable netting arrangements. 
Thus, the conversion factors are most appropriately applied to 
non-netted contracts, and when applied to legally enforceable 
netted contracts, they could in some cases, overstate the 
potential future exposure. 

Comments provided during the consultative process of 
revising the Basle Accord to recognize qualifying bilateral 
netting arrangements and further research conducted by the BSC, 
have suggested that netting arrangements can reduce not only a 
banking organization's current exposure for the transactions 
subject to the netting arrangement, but also its potential future 
exposure for those transactions.






As a result, in July 1994 the BSC issued a proposal to 
incorporate into the calculation of the add-on for potential 
future exposure a method for recognizing the risk-reducing 
effects of qualifying netting arrangements. Under the proposal, 
institutions could recognize these effects only for transactions 
subject to legally enforceable bilateral netting arrangements 
that meet the requirements of netting for current exposure as set 
forth in the recent amendment to the Accord. 

Depending on market conditions and the characteristics of a 
bank's derivative portfolio, netting arrangements can have 
substantial effects on a bank's potential future exposure to 
multiple derivative contracts it has entered into with a single 
counterparty. Should the counterparty default at some future 
date, the bank's exposure would be limited to the net amount the 
counterparty owes on the date of default rather than the gross 
current exposure of the included contracts. By entering into a 
netting arrangement, a bank may reduce not only its current 
exposure, but also its future exposure as well. Nevertheless, 
while in many circumstances a netting arrangement can reduce the 
potential future exposure of a counterparty portfolio, this is 
not always the case.






The most important factors influencing whether a netting 
arrangement will have an effect on potential future exposure are 
the volatilities of the current exposure to the counterparty on 
both a gross and net basis.
 The volatilities of net current 
exposure and gross current exposure of the portfolio may not 
necessarily be the same. Volatility of gross current exposure is 
influenced primarily by the fluctuations of the market values of 
positively valued contracts. Volatility of net current exposure 
on the other hand, is influenced by the fluctuations of the 
market values of all contracts within the portfolio. In those 
cases where net current exposure has a tendency to fluctuate more 
over time than gross current exposure, a netting arrangement will 
not reduce the potential future exposure. However, in those 
situations where net current exposure has a tendency to fluctuate 
less over time than gross current exposure, a netting arrangement 
can reduce the potential future exposure. 





Net current exposure is likely to be less volatile relative 
to the volatility of gross current exposure when the portfolio of 
contracts as a whole is more diverse than the subset of 
positively valued contracts. When a netting arrangement is 
applied to a diversified portfolio and the positively valued 
contracts within the portfolio as a group are less diversified 
than the overall portfolio, then the effect of the netting 
arrangement will be to reduce the potential future exposure for 
the portfolio.

The BSC has studied and analyzed several alternatives for 
taking into account the effects of netting when calculating the 
capital charge for potential future exposure. In particular, the 
BSC reviewed one general method proposed by commenters to the 
April 1993 netting proposal. This method would reduce the amount 
of the add-on for potential future exposure by multiplying the 
calculated gross add-on by the ratio of the portfolio's net 
current exposure to gross current exposure (the net-to-gross 
ratio or NGR). The NGR is used as a proxy for the risk-reducing 
effects of the netting arrangement on the potential future 
exposure. The more diversified the portfolio, the lower the net 
current exposure tends to be relative to gross current exposure. 

The BSC incorporated this method into its proposal. 
However, given that there are portfolio-specific situations in 
which the NGR does not provide a good indication of these 
effects, the BSC proposal gives only partial weight to the 
effects of the NGR on the add-on for potential future exposure. 
The proposed method would average the amount of the add-on as 
currently calculated (A

gross

) and the same amount multiplied by the 
NGR to arrive at a reduced add-on (A

net

) for contracts subject to 
qualifying netting arrangements in accordance with the 
requirements set forth in the recently amended Accord. This 
formula is expressed as: 



A

net

 = .5(A

gross

 + (NGR * A

gross

)).

 

For example, a bank with a gross current exposure of 500,000, a 
net current exposure of 300,000, and a gross add-on for potential 
future exposure of 1,200,000, would have an NGR of .6 
(300,000/500,000) and would calculate A

net

 as follows: 



.5(1,200,000 + (.6 * 1,200,000)) 



A

net

 = 960,000



For banks with an NGR of 50 percent, the effect of this treatment 
would be to permit a reduction in the amount of the add-on by 25 
percent. The BSC believes that most dealer banks are likely to 
have an NGR in the vicinity of 50 percent. 


The BSC proposal does not specify whether the NGR should be 
calculated on a counterparty-by-counterparty basis or on an 
aggregate basis for all transactions subject to qualifying, 
legally enforceable netting arrangements. The proposal requests 
comment on whether the choice of method could bias the results 
and whether there is a significant difference in calculation 
burden between the two methods. 
The BSC proposal also acknowledges that simulations using 
bank's internal models for measuring credit risk exposure would 
most likely produce the most accurate determination of the effect 
of netting arrangements on potential future exposures. The 
proposal states that the use of such models would be considered 
at some future date. 



C. The FDIC Proposal 


In light of the BSC proposal, the FDIC believes that it is 
appropriate to seek comment on proposed revisions to the 
calculation of the add-on for potential future exposure for 
derivative contracts. Therefore, the FDIC is proposing to amend 
its risk-based capital guidelines for state nonmember banks to 
expand the matrix of conversion factors, and to permit 
institutions that make use of qualifying netting arrangements to 
recognize the effects of those netting arrangements in the 
calculation of the add-on for potential future exposure. The 
second part of the proposed amendment is contingent on the 
adoption of a final amendment to the FDIC's risk-based capital 
guidelines to recognize bilateral close-out netting arrangements 
and would formally extend this recognition to commodity, precious 
metals, and equity derivative contracts. 
With regard to the portion of the proposal to expand the 
conversion factor matrix, the FDIC is proposing the same 
conversion factors set forth in the BSC proposal. The FDIC 
agrees with the BSC that the existing conversion factors 
applicable to long-dated transactions do not provide sufficient 
capital for the risks associated with those types of contracts. 
The FDIC also agrees with the BSC that the conversion factors for 
foreign exchange transactions are significantly too low for 
commodity, precious metal, and equity contracts due to the 
volatility of the associated indices or the prices on the 
underlying assets.






The FDIC is proposing the same formula as the BSC proposal 
to calculate a reduction in the add-on for potential future 
exposure for contracts subject to qualifying netting contracts. 
The FDIC recognizes several advantages with this formula. First, 
the formula uses bank-specific information to calculate the NGR. 
The NGR is simple to calculate and uses readily available 
information. The FDIC believes the use of the averaging factor 
of 0.5 is an important aspect of the proposed formula because it 
means the add-on for potential future exposure can never be 
reduced to zero and banks will always hold some capital against 
derivative contracts, even in those instances where the net 
current exposure is zero. 
The FDIC is seeking comment on all aspects of this proposal. 
As mentioned earlier, the BSC proposal seeks comment on whether 
the NGR should be calculated on a counterparty-by-counterparty 
basis, or on a global basis for all contracts subject to 
qualifying bilateral netting arrangements. The FDIC's proposed 
regulatory language would require the calculation of a separate 
NGR for each counterparty with which it has a qualifying netting 
contract. However, the FDIC is also seeking comment as to which 
method of calculating the NGR would be most efficient and 
appropriate for institutions with numerous qualifying bilateral 
netting arrangements. With either calculation method the NGR 
would be applied separately to adjust the add-on for potential 
future exposure for each netting arrangement. The FDIC notes 
that some preliminary findings indicate that a global NGR may be 
less burdensome to apply since the same NGR would be used for 
each counterparty with a netting arrangement, but counterparty 
specific NGRs may provide a more accurate indication of the 
credit risk associated with each counterparty.

Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis 


The FDIC does not believe that adoption of this proposal 
would have a significant economic impact on a substantial number 
of small business entities (in this case, small banks), in accord 
with the spirit and purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 
U.S.C 601 et. seq.). In this regard, while some small banks with 
limited derivative portfolios may experience an increase in 
capital charges, for most banks the overall effect of the 
proposal will be to reduce regulatory burden and to reduce the 
capital charge for certain transactions. 


Paperwork Reduction Act 


The FDIC has determined that its proposed amendments, if 
adopted, would not increase the regulatory paperwork burden of 
state nonmember banks pursuant to the provisions of the paperwork 
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et. seq.). 


List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 325 


Bank deposit insurance, Banks, banking, Capital adequacy, 
Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Savings associations, 
State nonmember banks. 



For the reasons set forth in the preamble, the Board of 
Directors of the FDIC proposes to amend 12 CFR part 325 as

3. In Appendix A to part 325, section II.E.1., as that 
section was proposed to be revised at 59 FR 37726, July 25, 1994, 
is revised to read as follows: 


II. * * * 


E. * * * 

1. 

Credit Equivalent Amounts for Derivative Contracts. 

The 
credit equivalent amount of a derivative contract that is not 
subject to a qualifying bilateral netting contract in accordance 
with section II.E.3. of this appendix A is equal to the sum of 
(i) the current exposure (which is equal to the mark-to-market 
value,
 if positive, and is sometimes referred to as the 
replacement cost) of the contract and (ii) an estimate of the 
potential future credit exposure over the remaining life of the 
contract. 





The current exposure is determined by the mark-to-market 
value of the contract. If the mark-to-market value is positive, 
then the current exposure is equal to that mark-to-market value. 
If the mark-to-market value is zero or negative, then the current 
exposure is zero. 


The potential future credit exposure of a contract, 
including contracts with negative mark-to-market values, is 
estimated by multiplying the notional principal amount of the 
contract by one of the following credit conversion factors, as 
appropriate: 







No potential future exposure is calculated for single currency interest rate swaps in which payments are made based
upon two floating rate indices (so called floating/floating or basis swaps); the credit exposure on these contracts
is evaluated solely on the basis of their mark-to-market values. 


4. In Appendix A to part 325, section II.E.2, as that section was proposed to be revised at 59 FR 37726, July 25, 1994,
is revised to read as follows: 

II. * * *

2. 

Risk Weights and Avoidance of Double Counting. 

Once the credit equivalent amount for a derivative contract, or a group of derivative contracts, has been determined,
that amount is assigned to the risk category appropriate to the counterparty, or, if relevant, the guarantor or the
nature of any collateral. However, the maximum weight that will be applied to the credit equivalent amount of such
contracts is 50 percent. 

In certain cases, credit exposures arising from the derivative contracts covered by these guidelines may already
be reflected, in part, on the balance sheet. To avoid double counting such exposures in the assessment of capital adequacy
and, perhaps, assigning inappropriate risk weights, counterparty credit exposures arising from the types of instruments
covered by these guidelines may need to be excluded from balance sheet assets in calculating banks' risk-based capital
ratios. 

The FDIC notes that the conversion factors set forth in section II.E.1. of appendix A, which are based on observed volatilities
of the particular types of instruments, are subject to review and modification in light of changing volatilities
or market conditions. 

Examples of the calculation of credit equivalent amounts for these types of contracts are contained in table IV of
this appendix A. 

5. In Appendix A to part 325, section II.E.3, as that section was proposed to be added at 59 FR 37726, July 25, 1994, is
revised to read as follows: 

II. * * * 

E. * * * 

3. 

Netting. 

For purposes of this appendix A, netting refers to the offsetting of positive and negative mark-to-market values
when determining a current exposure to be used in the calculation of a credit equivalent amount. Any legally enforceable
form of bilateral netting (that is, netting with a single counterparty) of derivative contracts is recognized for
purposes of calculating the credit equivalent amount provided that: 



* * * * * 



(d) The bank maintains in its files documentation adequate to support the netting of derivative contracts, including
a copy of the bilateral netting contract and necessary legal opinions. 

A contract containing a walkaway clause is not eligible for netting for purposes of calculating the credit equivalent
amount.
 






By netting individual contracts for the purpose of calculating its credit equivalent amount, a bank represents that
it has met the requirements of this appendix A and all the appropriate documents are in the bank's files and available
for inspection by the FDIC. Upon determination by the FDIC that a bank's files are inadequate or that a netting contract
may not be legally enforceable under any one of the bodies of law described in paragraphs (b) (i) through (iii) of this
section, underlying individual contracts may be treated as though they were not subject to the netting contract.


The credit equivalent amount of derivative contracts that are subject to a qualifying bilateral netting contract
is calculated by adding (i) the net current exposure of the netting contract and (ii) the sum of the estimates of potential
future exposure for all individual contracts subject to the netting contract, adjusted to take into account the effects
of the netting contract. 

The net current exposure is the sum of all positive and negative mark-to-market values of the individual contracts
subject to the netting contract. If the net sum of the mark-to-market values is positive, then the net current exposure
is equal to that sum. If the net sum of the mark-to-market values is zero or negative, then the net current exposure is
zero.

The sum of the estimates of potential future exposure for 
all individual contracts subject to the netting contract (A

gross

), 
adjusted to reflect the effects of the netting contract (A

net

), is 
determined through application of a formula. The formula, which 
employs the ratio of the net current to the gross current 
exposure (NGR), is expressed as: 


A

net

 = .5(A

gross

 + (NGR * A

gross

)) 


Gross potential future exposure, or A

gross

, is calculated by 
summing the estimates of potential future exposure (determined in 
accordance with section II.E.1. of this appendix A) for each 
individual contract subject to the qualifying bilateral netting 
contract.
 The NGR is determined as the ratio of the net 
current exposure of the netting contract to the gross current 
exposure of the netting contract. The gross current exposure is 
the sum of the current exposures of all individual contracts 
subject to the netting contract calculated in accordance with 
section II.E.1. of this appendix A. The effect of this treatment 
is that A

net

 is the average of A

gross

 and A

gross

 adjusted by the NGR. 





6. In Appendix A to part 325, the chart in Table III and 
its heading, as that section was proposed to be amended at 59 FR 
37726, July 25, 1994, is revised to read as follows:

If contracts (1) through (5) above are subject to a qualifying bilateral netting contract, 

then the following applies: 



 



 

To recognize the effects of netting on potential future exposure, 

the following formula applies: 



A

net

 = .5 (A

gross

 + (NGR * A

gross

))



In the above example:



NGR = 0 (0/300,000)

A

net

 = .5 (2,050,000 + (0 * 2,050,000))

A

net

 = 1,025,000



Credit Equivalent Amount: 1,025,000 + 0 = 1,025,000 

If the net current exposure was a positive amount, for example, 
$200,000, the credit equivalent amount would be calculated as 
follows: 



NGR = .67 (200,000/300,000) 


A

net

 = .5(2,050,000 + (.67 * 2,050,000)) 
A

net

 = 1,711,750 



Credit Equivalent Amount: 1,711,750 + 200,000 = 1,911,750

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document revises an earlier supplemental proposed airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Canadair
Model CL-600-1A11, -2A12, and -2B16 series airplanes, that would have required a functional
check of the idle stop function of the engine throttle quadrant; repair or replacement, if necessary; and eventual
replacement of the engine throttle quadrant. That proposal was prompted by reports of unintentional engine shutdown
on certain of these airplanes due to problems associated with operation of the engine throttle quadrant. This action
further revises the proposed rule by adding a second type of test of the engine throttle quadrant to determine if the
throttle levers bypass the idle stop into the shut-off position. The actions specified by this proposed AD are intended
to ensure the proper operation of the throttle quadrant so as to prevent inadvertent shutdown of an engine while the
airplane is taxiing or in flight.

Discussion 



A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to add an airworthiness directive (AD),
applicable to certain Canadair Model CL-600-1A11, -2A12, and -2B16 series airplanes, was
published as a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in the 

Federal Register

 on June 28, 1994 (59 FR 33233). That supplemental NPRM would have required a functional check of the idle stop function
of the throttle quadrant; repair or replacement of the throttle quadrant if the check failed; and the eventual replacement
of the throttle quadrant with a new model. In addition, that supplemental NPRM expanded the applicability of the initially-issued
NPRM to include additional airplanes that were found to be subject to the addressed unsafe condition. 

That supplemental NPRM was prompted by reports of unintentional engine shutdown that occurred on Model CL-600-2A12
and -2B16 series airplanes when a throttle lever over-rode the idle stop during throttle retardation, due to
a quick, sharp pull on the throttle levers, and the throttle lever consequently moved directly to the shut-off position.
The proposed functional check (hereafter called ``the abrupt-movement check'') was intended to ensure that such
unintentional shutdowns of engines would not occur while the airplane is taxiing or in flight. The abrupt-movement
check procedures are described in Canadair Challenger Service Bulletins A600-0629 and A601-0410, both
dated November 1, 1993.

Subsequent to the issuance of that supplemental NPRM, the FAA became aware that a necessary requirement, which was
previously proposed in the initially-issued NPRM, was incorrectly omitted from the supplemental NPRM. The original
NPRM was published in the 

Federal Register

 on February 9, 1994, (59 FR 5966). That action would have required operators to test the engine throttle quadrant to
determine if the throttle levers bypass the idle stop into the shut-off position due to side loads on the throttle levers;
quadrants that failed the test (hereafter called ``the side-load test'') would be required to be modified or replaced.
Those actions would have been required to be accomplished in accordance with the instructions contained in Canadair
Alert Service Bulletin A600-0615, dated June 10, 1992 (for Model CL-600-1A11 series airplanes);
or Canadair Alert Service Bulletin A601-0374, Revision 1, dated September 30, 1992 (for Models CL-600-2A12
and CL-600-2B16 series airplanes). 

The FAA has determined that performance of this side-load test is necessary in order to adequately address the unsafe
condition presented by the problems identified with the operation of the engine throttle quadrant. 

Operators should note that the originally-issued NPRM would have required that throttle quadrants failing the side-load
test be modified in accordance with the Canadair service bulletins released in 1992 (referred to above). However,
in accordance with the recommendations of the Canadair service bulletins released in November 1993 (referred to
above), throttle quadrants that failed the abrupt-movement check would be replaced with a new unit. The FAA has determined
that it is not logical to require that the throttle quadrants be modified if they fail the side-load test and subsequently
be replaced by a new unit if they fail the abrupt-movement check. The FAA has determined, instead, that both the side-load
test and the abrupt-movement check must be performed, and units that fail either test must be replaced in accordance
with the Canadair service bulletins dated November 1993. (Units that pass the tests would be required eventually
to be replaced at a later time.) 
Additionally, the compliance time for the proposed eventual replacement of the engine throttle quadrant on all airplanes
was incorrectly expressed in the previous supplemental NPRM as ``1,200 flight hours.'' The compliance time for this
proposed requirement should have been specified as ``4,500 hours time-in-service.'' (The ``1,200'' figure actually
represented the number of landings that is approximately equivalent to 4,500 hours time-in-service for the majority
of the affected fleet.) 

This airplane model is manufactured in Canada and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the
provisions of  21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. 

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, this supplemental NPRM would require: 

1. A one-time test of the engine throttle quadrant to determine if side loads on the throttles will cause the throttle
levers to bypass the idle stop into the shut-off position, and replacement of the throttle quadrant if it fails this
test; 

2. A one-time functional check of the engine throttle quadrant to determine if a quick, sharp pull on the throttles
will cause the throttle levers to bypass the idle stop into the shut-off position, and replacement of the throttle
quadrant if it fails this functional check; and 

3. Replacement of the throttle quadrant as terminating action for the requirements of this AD. 

Additionally, paragraph (e) of this supplemental NPRM indicates the corrected compliance time of ``4,500 hours
time-in-service'' for replacement of the throttle quadrant. Expressing this compliance time in terms of ``hours
time-in-service'' makes it consistent with the compliance terms for the other requirements of this proposed AD.


Since certain of these changes expand the scope of the previously proposed rule, the FAA has determined that it is necessary
to reopen the comment period to provide additional opportunity for public comment. 



Cost Impact 



The FAA estimates that 150 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD. 

The proposed side-loads test of the engine throttle quadrant would take approximately 17 work hours per airplane
to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the
total cost impact of this proposed requirement on U.S. operators is estimated to be $140,250, or $935 per airplane.


The proposed abrupt-movement check of the idle stop function of the throttle quadrant would take approximately 1
work hour per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total
cost impact of the proposed functional check on U.S. operators is estimated to be $8,250, or $55 per airplane. 

The proposed installation of a modified throttle quadrant would take approximately 10 work hours per airplane to
accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Required parts would be provided by the manufacturer at no
cost to operators. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed installation on U.S. operators is
estimated to be $82,500, or $550 per airplane. 

Based on the figures discussed above, the total cost impact of this proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be
$231,000, or $1,540 per airplane. This total cost impact figure is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished
any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future
if this AD were not adopted. 



Regulatory Impact 



The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting

Safe Harbor for Forward-Looking Statements 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Securities and Exchange Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Concept Release and Notice of Hearing.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') is soliciting comment on current practices relating to
disclosure of forward-looking information. In particular, the Commission seeks comment on whether the safe harbor
provisions for forward-looking statements (set forth in Rule 175 under the Securities Act of 1933 (``Securities
Act''), Rule 3b-6 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act''), Rule 103A under the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935 and Rule 0-11 under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939) are effective in encouraging
disclosure of voluntary forward-looking information and protecting investors or, if not, should be revised and
if revised, how. The Commission also seeks comment on various changes to the existing safe harbor provisions that
have been suggested by certain commentators. Finally, the Commission is announcing that public hearings will be
held beginning February 13, 1995, to consider these issues.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Introduction



Forward-looking information

1

 occupies a vital role in the United States securities markets. Investors typically consider management's forward-looking
information important and useful in evaluating a company's economic prospects and consequently in making their
investment decisions.

2

 Analysts and other market participants report that they view consideration of management's own performance projections,


i.e.,

 earnings and revenues, to be critical to their own forecasts of a company's future performance. As such, forward-looking
information is often considered a critical component of investment recommendations made by broker-dealers, investment
advisers and other securities professionals.

3

 







A. Development of Safe Harbor



1. Wheat Commission



Until the early 1970s, the Commission prohibited disclosure of forward-looking information.

4

 This policy was based primarily on the Commission's perception that such information was inherently unreliable,
and that unsophisticated investors would place undue emphasis on the information in making investment decisions.

5

 






Acting on the recommendation of a number of securities analysts,

6

 the Commission formed a Disclosure Policy Group (the ``Wheat Commission'') to study a variety of disclosure issues,
including whether projections should be permitted or mandated in Commission filings.

<TEXT>
 

While the Wheat Commission's Report to the Commission, published in 1969, recognized that most investment decisions
are based essentially on estimates of future earnings, the Commission determined that the detriments to investors
associated with permitting forward-looking disclosure weighed against lifting the ban on disclosure of such information.
In the Wheat Commission's view, the heightened litigation exposure, updating requirements and risk of undue investor
reliance on this information outweighed any countervailing benefits.

7

 





2. Rulemaking Initiatives



The Commission continued to consider these issues and conducted hearings in 1972 to determine whether to lift the
ban and, instead, either mandate or permit disclosure of forward-looking information. The 1972 hearings involved
fifty-three witnesses and resulted in the submission of over 200 letters of comment. A significant number of those
letters were from issuers objecting to any suggestion that they be required to file forward-looking statements with
the Commission. Following those hearings, the Commission elected in 1973 not to require disclosure of forward-looking
information, but announced in a policy statement its intention to promulgate rules to permit voluntary disclosure
of projections and to protect those projections from civil antifraud liability.

8

 





In 1975, the Commission issued a series of proposals designed to implement the 1973 policy statement.

9

 Specifically, the proposals would have: 





1. Required the filing of a Form 8-K by any registrant that (a) had furnished a projection to any person, (b) had
reason to believe that its public projections no longer had a reasonable basis, (c) had determined to cease issuing
projections, or (d) wished to disassociate itself from a third person's projections; 

2. Amended Form 10-K to (a) require inclusion therein of all prior projections, together with actual and historical
results; (b) require inclusion of projections for future periods that had been previously filed with the Commission;
and (c) limit the filing of projections to those issuers with Exchange Act reporting histories and budgeting experience
and to those projections that satisfied the requirements of proposed safe harbor Rules 132 (a proposed predecessor
of Rule 175) and 3b-6; 

3. Created new Rules 132 and 3b-6, providing a safe harbor ``by defining circumstances under which a projection
would be deemed not to be an untrue or misleading statement of a material fact or a manipulative, deceptive, or fraudulent
device, contrivance, act or practice as those terms are used in the various liability provisions of the federal securities
laws''; and 

4. Required that all projection information contained in the text of Form 10-K (but not exhibits) be included
in the registrant's annual report to shareholders.

<TEXT>
 

In 1976, these proposed rules were withdrawn by the Commission in response to opposition from commenters.

11

 In withdrawing the proposals, the Commission stated its hope that forward-looking information and the need for a
safe harbor would be among those issues considered by the newly formed Advisory Committee on Corporate Disclosure.

12

 





3. Advisory Committee Report



The Advisory Committee on Corporate Disclosure was formed in 1976 to evaluate certain of the Division of Corporation
Finance's disclosure policies_among them the Division's policy on disclosure of forward-looking information.

13

 On November 3, 1977, the Advisory Committee submitted its report to the Commission.

14

 







In the course of its deliberations, the Advisory Committee had sought input from all interested persons on the costs
and benefits of forward-looking information.

15

 The Advisory Committee recommended in its report that the Commission act to encourage forward-looking disclosures,
and made several specific recommendations regarding the form and substance of proposed Commission action. 




First, in recognition that the Commission needed experience with projections disclosure in order to evaluate the
wisdom of establishing a regulatory framework for such disclosure, the Committee stated that its recommendations
were intended to encourage projections on an experimental basis. Such voluntary disclosure would enable the Commission
to assess both the usefulness of the information to investors, and the costs to issuers of providing that information.

16

 If forward-looking information disclosures ultimately were found to be beneficial to investors, the Committee
believed that market forces, rather than a Commission mandate, would operate effectively to compel issuers to make
such disclosures.

17

 





Second, the Committee recommended that the Commission adopt a safe harbor that would protect forward-looking statements
made in good faith and with a reasonable basis, regardless of whether those statements were included in documents
filed with the Commission. The Committee recommended that the burden be placed on the person seeking to establish
antifraud liability for the forward-looking statement to show a lack of good faith or reasonable basis.

18

 




Third, the Committee opined that a safe harbor should be available to all registrants, regardless of size and reporting
history. It also recommended that companies be required to publish cautionary language along with the projection,
to indicate clearly the nature of the projection and caution investors against ascribing undue weight thereto.

19

 The Committee believed that disclosure of assumptions should be encouraged, but not required.

20

 Further, the Committee concluded that companies should be encouraged, but not required, to compare actual results
with earlier projections and to explain any significant variance. 





While the Committee recommended that companies be reminded of their obligations to keep a published projection from
becoming misleading in light of subsequent events, it urged that no formal requirement to update projections be imposed.
In the Committee's view, companies should be permitted either to discontinue making projections or to resume such
projections after discontinuation, but should not do so without a reasonable basis. 
The Committee had a different view of mandatory disclosure and updating in connection with forward-looking information
disseminated during the Securities Act registration process. Specifically, the Committee expressed its opinion
that ``the Commission should require companies to include such current projections covering the current period
in their registration statements (updated as necessary) filed under the Securities Act.''

21

 




With respect to the type of information that should be disclosed, the Committee believed that companies should have
the flexibility to choose which items to disclose, but should not be permitted to disclose only ``favorable'' items.
Finally, the Committee recommended that the Commission permit third-party review of projections, provided that
the third-party reviewer's credentials, extent of review, and relationship with the issuer were disclosed.

22

 




4. Adoption of Safe Harbor Provision



In response to the Advisory Committee Report, the Commission announced in early 1978 that the Committee's recommended
safe harbor rule would receive formal Commission consideration, along with any alternatives the Commission deemed
appropriate.

23

 Later that year, the Commission issued for public comment two versions of a safe harbor rule for forward-looking information:
the Advisory Committee version, in the same form as the Committee had proposed, and another version formulated by
the Commission.

24

 





As set forth in the Commission's proposing release, the differences between the two proposals, as well as the questions
asked and comments requested, reflected the Commission's reservations with respect to certain aspects of the Advisory
Committee proposal. First, the Commission was particularly concerned that the burden of proving a lack of reasonable
basis, which the Committee recommended be imposed on the plaintiff, ``could be insurmountable.''

25

 The Commission therefore proposed an alternative rule that would have placed the burden on the defendant to prove
that a challenged projection was made in good faith and with a reasonable basis.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941019-1-00032 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941019-1-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

There were several other substantive differences between the two proposals. Unlike the Advisory Committee's proposal,
the Commission's alternative extended to third-party projections, while concomitantly restricting safe harbor
protection to financial projections and similar statements, limiting safe harbor protection to statements made
about reporting companies, and excluding statements about investment companies. Significantly, both proposed
safe harbor rules covered all oral and written forward-looking information, not just when contained in Commission
filings. Neither proposal specifically required inclusion of current projections in registration statements
filed under the Securities Act, and no mention was made in the release of the reasons for this omission. 

In response to the proposals, the Commission received approximately 90 letters of comment. A majority of commenters
expressed a belief that a rule incorporating aspects of both proposals would provide the best incentive for projection
disclosure.

26

 Although a few commenters expressed continuing reservations about the Commission's proposed shift in policy from
prohibiting to encouraging projection disclosure, virtually all agreed that a safe harbor rule was desirable and
necessary.

27

 Most commenters agreed that the safe harbor should be extended to statements made on behalf of the issuer (

i.e.

, by third party reviewers). 





Several commenters criticized other aspects of the Commission's alternative proposal, arguing that the burden
of proof for establishing that a projection did not have a reasonable basis or was not made in good faith should be imposed
on the plaintiff,

28

 and that the rule's coverage should be extended beyond revenues, earnings, and ``other financial items'' to encompass
management's plans and objectives.

29

 Commenters argued that the rule's protections should not be limited to companies with a reporting history.

30

 Commenters concurred in the proposal to forego conditioning the rule's availability on inclusion of the information
in Commission filings on the ground that such a condition could result in a loss of the safe harbor's protections based
on a technical or inadvertent filing delinquency. Comments on the propriety of projections by investment companies
were mixed.

31

 







In 1979, the Commission adopted a safe harbor provision that generally combined aspects of both proposals.

32

 Virtually identical safe harbor provisions were codified in Rule 175 under the Securities Act and Rule 3b-6
under the Exchange Act.

33

 These provisions offered safe harbor protection for specified forward-looking statements but only where made,
reaffirmed, or later published, in documents filed with the Commission. On this point, the Commission stated that
this ``filing'' requirement would provide investors with better access to the information and a more reliable framework
within which to evaluate the forward-looking statement, and would enable the Commission to maintain oversight of
the accuracy and completeness of the disclosure. 





Second, the final rule incorporated the Advisory Committee's recommendation of placing the burden of proof on the
plaintiff to show that the forward-looking information lacked a reasonable basis and was made otherwise than in good
faith. The Commission reasoned that the liberal discovery procedures available in the federal courts had permitted
plaintiffs to elicit the evidence necessary to sustain this burden. The Commission stated that it would monitor the
operation of the safe harbor rule to assure that it was not inconsistent with the pre-eminent statutory goal of investor
protection.

34

 




The safe harbor provision, as adopted, did not require the publication of assumptions underlying forward-looking
statements covered by the rule. In describing the basis for this decision, the Commission ``re-emphasize[d] its
position on the significance of assumption disclosures,'' explaining that: 




</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941019-1-00033 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941019-1-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Under certain circumstances the disclosure of underlying assumptions may be material to an understanding of the
projected results. The Commission also believes that the key assumptions underlying a forward-looking statement
are of such significance that their disclosure may be necessary in order for such statements to meet the reasonable
basis and good faith standards embodied in the rule. Because of the potential importance of assumptions to investor
understanding and in order to encourage their disclosure, the rule as adopted indicates specifically that disclosed
assumptions are also within its scope.

35






The Commission made explicit the availability of the safe harbor to third-party reviewers, both those retained by
the company and those making projections on behalf of management. Also, while not adding any requirement to update
projections, the Commission reiterated its earlier position that projections protected by the safe harbor must
be corrected when subsequent events or discoveries render them false or misleading. 

Finally, the Commission elected not to extend coverage of the rule to investment companies registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940. While not rejecting the possibility that projections could be valuable to shareholders of registered
investment companies, the Commission stated that ``the nature of information reported by investment companies
is sufficiently distinct to warrant separate consideration.''

36

 





The safe harbor provision has retained its essential elements, although the Commission has made several technical
modifications since its adoption.

37

 





B. Management's Discussion and Analysis Interpretative Release



Since 1979, the Commission has further refined its position on disclosure of forward-looking information, particularly
in the context of developing and interpreting the management's discussion and analysis (``MD&A'') requirements
applicable to the Form 10-K and other required filings, as codified in Regulation S-K Item 303.

38

 These contain a number of provisions that call for disclosure of prospective information.

39

 An instruction to Item 303(a) states that the MD&A ``shall focus specifically on material events and uncertainties
known to management that would cause reported financial information not to be necessarily indicative of [the] future
* * *.''

40

 In contrast to this required disclosure of ``presently known data which will impact upon future operating results,''
registrants are expressly encouraged, but not required, to supply forward-looking information.

41

 The Commission clarified the distinction between ``voluntary'' and ``mandatory'' forward-looking disclosure
in a 1989 interpretative release relating to MD&A: 







Both required disclosure regarding the future impact of presently known trends, events or uncertainties and optional
forward-looking information may involve some prediction or projection. The distinction between the two rests with
the nature of the prediction required. Required disclosure is based on currently known trends, events, and uncertainties
that are reasonably expected to have material effects, such as: a reduction in the registrant's product prices; erosion
in the registrant's market share; changes in insurance coverage; or the likely non-renewal of a material contract.
In contrast, optional forward-looking disclosure involves anticipating a future trend or event or anticipating
a less predictable impact of a known event, trend or uncertainty.

42






Thus, the Commission has distinguished between mandatory and voluntary forward-looking statements for disclosure
purposes. Moreover, in the context of transactions involving an issuer's or affiliate's purchase of the issuer's
shares, or a business combination, forward-looking information (including projections) may be required pursuant
to Rule 10b-5.

43

 





C. Qualitative Performance



There appears to be increasing interest, on the part of both registrants and users of their financial reports in the
investor and analyst communities, in enhanced disclosure of information that may affect corporate performance
but is not readily susceptible of measurement in traditional, quantitative terms.

44

 Among such qualitative informational items are workforce training and development, product and process quality
and customer satisfaction. A large registrant considers one such item_product quality_to be so important to its
profitability that it has chosen to make it a key determinant of executive compensation.

45

 Other companies are beginning to experiment with voluntary disclosure of the utilization of an intangible asset
termed ``intellectual capital,'' or employee knowledge.

46

 In this connection, another federal agency has urged more corporate disclosure of the use of measures of ``high performance
work practices and other nontraditional measures'' of corporate performance.

47

 








With respect to the interest of users in this type of ``soft,'' or nonquantitative, corporate information, a large
public pension fund factors labor-management relations and other aspects of human resource management into analyses
of portfolio company performance in connection with the fund's investment and voting decisions, based on research
indicating that workplace practices can be linked to corporate performance.

48

 Private pension fund fiduciaries are likely to follow this example, given the Department of Labor's recent issuance
of an interpretive bulletin urging such fiduciaries to monitor more closely portfolio companies' investment in
training and otherwise developing their workforce.

49

<DOCNO> FR941019-1-00034 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941019-1-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Notwithstanding this growing market interest in access to qualitative performance information, registrants have
expressed significant concern that disclosure of such information may expose them to greater litigation risk.

50

 To the extent that this type of ``soft'' information does not fall within the current safe harbor definition of ``forward-looking
statements,'' however, it would not receive the protection of Rule 175 or 3b-6. 






II. Judicial Approaches Toward Liability for Forward-Looking Statements




Contemporaneously with the evolution of the Commission's policy on disclosure of forward-looking information,
the federal courts have adopted a variety of approaches toward private antifraud claims arising from such disclosures.

51

 






A. Untrue Statement of Fact




</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941019-1-00035 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941019-1-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The courts first addressed the question of whether predictions or statements of opinion could ever be considered
to be ``facts'' which could be said to be false or misleading for purposes of liability under the securities laws. In


Marx

 v.

 Computer Sciences Corporation,

52

 the court found that while predictions could properly be characterized as facts, the failure of a prediction to prove
true was not in itself actionable. Instead, the court looked at the factual representations which it found were impliedly
made in connection with the prediction; namely that, at the time the prediction was made, it was believed by its proponent
and it had a valid basis.

53

 If a prediction was not believed when made or did not have a valid basis, it would constitute an untrue statement of fact
which could then be analyzed in accordance with the other necessary elements of the action:

54

 

i.e.,

 materiality, reliance, scienter, and causation. 








B. Materiality and Reliance



Some courts have disposed of cases involving forward-looking statements without reaching the issue of these implied
factual assertions by examining another element of the claim_materiality or, as described in some cases, reliance.
Most of these cases have been decided on the basis of the ``bespeaks caution'' doctrine,

55

 which has been described as follows:






The essence of the doctrine is that where an offering statement, such as a prospectus, accompanies statements of its
future forecasts, projections and expectations with adequate cautionary language, those statements are not actionable
as securities fraud.

56






Under the bespeaks caution doctrine, cautionary language, as a part of the ``total mix'' of information, may render
a predictive statement immaterial as a matter of law,

57

 or make it unreasonable for an investor to rely upon a predictive statement.

58

 Recently, some courts have warned, however, that cautionary language, in and of itself, is not necessarily sufficient.

59

 ``To suffice, the cautionary statements must be substantive and tailored to the specific future projections, estimates
or opinions in the prospectus which the plaintiffs challenge.''

60

 








Some courts have taken a more extreme position, determining that, even without cautionary language, some predictions
are not material. For example, referring to ``soft,'' ``puffing'' statements, upon which no reasonable investor
would rely, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit stated that, ``projections of future performance not worded
as guarantees are generally not actionable under the federal securities laws.''

61

 





III. Criticisms of the Commission's Safe Harbor



Some have suggested that companies that make voluntary disclosure of forward-looking information subject themselves
to a significantly increased risk of securities antifraud class actions.

62

 Recent surveys suggest that this threat of mass shareholder litigation, whether real or perceived, has had a chilling
effect on disclosure of forward-looking information.

63

 






Contrary to the Commission's original intent, the safe harbor is currently invoked on a very limited basis in a litigation
context.

64

 Some critics of the current safe harbor provisions cite, among other things, the following as weaknesses of the safe
harbor:




_the protections of the safe harbor are too narrow because they are limited to filed documents, resulting in selective
disclosure made outside Commission documents;

65

 _there is a great deal of confusion over the nature and scope of any duty to correct or update projections once
they are made;

67

 and 





 _the safe harbor language is silent as to when a company may be liable for statements made by third parties.




A. Suggested Underinclusiveness of Current Safe Harbor



Some critics argue that the current safe harbor is ineffective largely because it is too narrow, in that it only covers
statements made in documents filed with the Commission.

68

 They contend that, due to this underinclusiveness, the safe harbor provides no comfort in most situations involving
disclosure of forward-looking information. While acknowledging concern that the problem of selective disclosure
prompted the Commission to adopt such a limitation in 1979,

69

 these critics contend that this very limitation has created the unintended by-product of fostering such selective
disclosure. 






Many public companies complain that they face increasing analyst and institutional demands for immediate access
to predictive information. Some issuers argue that, solely to gain the benefits of the safe harbor through reaffirmation
of oral responses to recurring marketplace inquiries in Commission documents, they would be put to the impossible
task of memorializing every analyst discussion. Given the informal and often unpredictable nature of communications
between issuers and analysts, the provision in the safe harbor requiring Commission filing of forward-looking information
is viewed as both counterproductive and highly impractical. 



B. Judicial Application



Another complaint commonly raised is that the provisions of the existing safe harbor do not influence the standards
that courts apply in securities fraud cases. The safe harbor is infrequently raised by defendants, perhaps because
it compels judicial examination of reasonableness and good faith, which raise factual issues that often preclude
early, prediscovery dismissal. Thus, critics state that the safe harbor is ineffective in ensuring the quick and
inexpensive dismissal of frivolous private lawsuits. These critics argue that, unless the courts vigorously apply
a higher pleading threshold sufficient to sustain a motion to dismiss based on the allegations of a class-action complaint,
the mere threat of litigation will continue both to discourage management from making forward-looking disclosure
and cause those companies that nonetheless provide such disclosure to incur significant costs in defense of nonmeritorious
litigation. Those urging reform thus maintain that, in order for a safe harbor effectively to encourage forward-looking
disclosure, it must add protection over and above those afforded by judicial doctrines developed under what are characterized
as the ``housekeeping'' provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure_Rules 9(b) and 12(b)(6).

70

 





A related criticism is that courts are inconsistent in applying the safe harbor when it is implicated in the litigation.
The courts do not always refer to the safe harbor when it is implicated.

71

 One court refused to permit the use of the safe harbor because the earnings forecast in question had been presented
``as a fact certain rather than as a `projection' or `forward-looking statement.'''

72

 In this regard, commenters assert that the Commission should provide greater guidance to the judiciary with respect
to the appropriate application of the safe harbor.

C. Duty To Correct or Update 



A further criticism of the Commission's existing safe harbor is that the rule has created confusion over whether and
when there is a duty to correct or update projections once they are made. A recent article suggests that issuers are
often advised by their counsel to refrain from making forward-looking statements in Commission filings, or even
from speaking to analysts, because they fear that by doing so they will ``assume'' a duty to update their forward-looking
statements as and when the facts and circumstances surrounding their original statements change.

73

 Furthermore, the paucity of caselaw in this area has left issuers without comfort or certainty as to when and if there
is any duty to update or correct.

74

 Commentators have questioned how long a forward-looking statement will be considered current and how far in the future,
if at all, an issuer must continue to update.

75

 







D. Entanglement and Endorsement 



Another concern voiced by companies is whether to make forward-looking disclosures to securities analysts and institutional
investors, whether in the context of initial public offering ``roadshows'' or otherwise, and the corresponding
liability for any forward-looking statements included in the analysts' reports or statements. Companies complain
that a better balance must be struck between the incentives and disincentives of disclosure to analysts.

76

 The New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, and the National Association of Securities Dealers encourage
listed or quoted corporations to seek out formal and informal contact with analysts to facilitate the accurate pricing
of their securities.

77

 The Commission also encourages such communications as a complement to disclosure under the Exchange Act.

78

<DOCNO> FR941019-1-00038 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941019-1-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The foregoing regulatory incentives must be viewed in light of potential issuer liabilities. While courts appear
generally to impose no duty on a corporation to review or comment on analysts' reports, a corporation may become sufficiently
entangled with the analysts' statements, by reviewing or correcting drafts of reports or otherwise, so as to assume
a duty to correct or update the analyst's statements.

79

 Another risk arises from selective disclosures that may be characterized as tipping.

80

 As a result of these risks, frequently perceived to outweigh the benefits, some corporations have gone so far as to
announce that they will not speak to analysts about future earnings projections.

81

 







IV. Alternatives to Current Safe Harbor Provision 



The Commission generally is examining the current effectiveness of its safe harbors as codified in Rules 175 and 3b-6.
Some commentators and groups have submitted proposals to amend the safe harbor. The Commission is considering these
proposals and the issues that each proposal raises, as well as its own experience in interpreting and administering
the safe harbor. Where specific proposed regulatory text has been provided by these commentators or groups, that
text is attached in the appendix to this release.

82

 





A. ``Seasoned Issuer'' Proposal 



The ``Seasoned Issuer'' Proposal, suggested by the Association of Publicly Traded Companies (``APTC''), would
provide a safe harbor precluding private actions for oral and written forward-looking statements with respect to
securities quoted on the NASDAQ Stock Market or listed on a national securities exchange. It would apply only to secondary
trading transactions and would not modify the Commission's enforcement authority. The proposed safe harbor would
be available to issuers subject to the reporting requirements of sections 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act that have
timely filed all reports required to be filed within the six months prior to the making of the statement. The proposed
safe harbor would not be available to penny stock issuers. It also excludes issuers that had been convicted of securities
law violations or issuers that had been the subject of any securities related injunction within the previous five
years. 

The term ``forward-looking statement'' is defined in the proposed safe harbor to include any economic projection,
statement of management's plans and objectives for future operations, statement of future performance and assumptions
underlying the foregoing. 



B. Business Judgment Rule Proposal 



Commissioner Beese has proposed a safe harbor provision patterned after the state-law ``business judgment rule.''

83

 In the pattern of that rule, the safe harbor would establish a principle of judicial non-intervention. As such, the
safe harbor would protect directors and officers from judicial review of shareholder antifraud claims when forward-looking
statements are made unless a plaintiff can establish a conflict, a lack of good faith, or a failure of honest and reasonable
belief. 





The safe harbor would cover oral or written forward-looking information, whether or not made or reaffirmed in Commission
filings. Liability still could be imposed on directors or officers who make fraudulent statements, intentionally
misstate facts, or fail to disclose material information when required. 

To ensure that an officer or director was meeting his duties under the business judgment rule, a company would be encouraged
to keep a projection binder reflecting the data underlying the projections. In the event that a private lawsuit was
filed, the company would proffer the binder to the court. The burden then would shift to the plaintiffs to show why the
projections lacked a proper factual basis at the time they were made. If unable to meet this burden, the case would be
dismissed without any discovery.

84

 





C. ``Heightened Definition'' Proposal 



The ``Heightened Definition'' Proposal, put forth jointly by the Business Roundtable and the National Association
of Manufacturers, would apply to all forward-looking statements and reaffirmations thereof, by or on behalf of a
registrant or an outside reviewer retained by the registrant, whether or not filed with the Commission. The proposed
safe harbor would apply to the same information as is protected by the current safe harbor but would expressly extend
to both qualitative and quantitative statements of management's plans and objectives for future operations, including
plans for the development and delivery of new products or services. 

The provision would apply to all statements of reporting issuers that have timely filed their most recent annual report.
As provided under the existing rule, non-reporting issuers also could rely on the safe harbor, but only if the forward-looking
statement were made in a solicitation of interest document submitted under Securities Act Rule 254, in a registration
statement or Regulation A Offering Circular filed under the Securities Act, or in a registration statement filed
under the Exchange Act.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941019-1-00039 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941019-1-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Liability would be imposed only if a misstatement or omission is material, made or omitted with scienter, and, for
private plaintiffs, relied upon. Materiality would be defined as information that would significantly alter the
total mix of information available. Scienter would be defined as actual knowledge or intentional omission to state
a material fact. Reliance would be defined as actual knowledge of and actual reliance on the forward-looking statement
in connection with the purchase or sale of a security. Under the proposal, there would be no attribution to the issuer
of statements made by third parties unless the issuer expressly endorsed or approved of the statement. Finally, an
issuer would not have a duty to update a forward-looking statement unless it expressly undertook to do so at the time
the statement was made. 


D. ``Bespeaks Caution'' Proposal 


Professor John Coffee suggests a safe harbor that would codify a variant of the ``Bespeaks Caution'' doctrine_articulated
in terms of an investor's inability to rely in an action for fraud upon statements protected by the safe harbor. Under
this proposed safe harbor, which would be available to reporting companies (except penny-stock issuers), a forward-looking
statement would be protected so long as it were properly qualified and accompanied by ``clear and specific'' cautionary
language that explains in detail sufficient to inform a reasonable person of both the approximate level of risk associated
with that statement and the basis therefor. Forward-looking statements made, either orally or in writing, outside
the four corners of a Commission filing would be covered only if reaffirmed in a filed document or annual report made
publicly available within a reasonable period after the statement is first disseminated. The suggested safe harbor
would not require that the forward-looking statement have a ``reasonable basis'' (as under existing Rules 175 and
3b-6) because, according to Professor Coffee, this requirement often raises factual issues that cannot easily
be resolved at the pre-trial stage. 
Professor Coffee's approach also contemplates amendments to the incorporation-by-reference provisions of the
Securities Act registration forms

85

 that would exempt qualifying forward-looking statements made in Exchange Act filings from automatic incorporation
by reference in Securities Act filings, and therefore from potential liability under the antifraud provisions of
the Securities Act. Existing Rule 175 would remain available where registrants affirmatively seek inclusion of
Exchange Act filings in Securities Act registration statements. 





E. ``Fraudulent Intent'' Proposal 


Under the ``Fraudulent Intent'' proposal, submitted by Mr. William Freeman, a forward-looking statement would
be protected by the safe harbor unless it is shown that the statement was made recklessly or with an actual intent to
deceive. In order to demonstrate that a statement was made recklessly, a plaintiff would be required to demonstrate
that at the time the statement was made, the issuer was aware of facts that made it highly unlikely that the projection
could be achieved. 



F. ``Disimplication'' Theory



Professor Joseph A. Grundfest has suggested that, just as the courts have implied the existence of a private right
of action under Rule 10b-5, the Commission may disimply such a right of action by redefining the element of a private
Rule 10b-5 claim.

86

 For example, Professor Grundfest has suggested that if the Commission should decide that if ``projections deserve
greater protection than is now afforded by Rule 175, then Rule 10b-5 can be amended to require a showing of `knowing
securities fraud,' demonstrating `actual knowledge that the [projection] is false,' as a precondition for private
recovery in a Rule 10b-5 action complaining of a falsely optimistic projection.''

87

 





G. Reasonable Basis In Fact Proposal


The ``Reasonable Basis In Fact'' proposal, suggested by Jonathan Cuneo on behalf of the National Association of Securities
and Commercial Attorneys (``NASCAT'') protects forward-looking statements, whether written or oral and whether
or not filed with the Commission, unless it can be shown that the statement was made without a reasonable basis in fact,
was seriously undermined by existing facts, was not genuinely believed or was made other than in good faith.

<DOCNO> FR941019-1-00040 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941019-1-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The term ``forward-looking statement'' is defined to include any statement concerning future revenues, income,
earnings, capital expenditures, dividends, products, services or lines of business, capital structure or other
financial items, as well as management's plans or objectives for the future or the future economic performance of
the corporation. The term also includes statements or assumptions underlying or relating to the foregoing. 


H. ``Opt-In'' Proposal 


The ``Opt-In'' proposal, suggested by Harvey Pitt, Karl Groskaufmanis and Gilbey Strub, would require issuers to
make a formal election to ``opt in[to]'' a specified safe harbor disclosure regime.

88

 Issuers opting in would be required to make forward-looking disclosure for a minimum of four quarters. Before a company
may ``opt out'' of the safe harbor disclosure regime, it must provide notice 30 days before its next periodic report.
The notice must detail the reasons for opting out, and statements therein would not be protected by the safe harbor.
The company would be prohibited from opting back into the safe harbor disclosure regime for another year. 




In order to be protected, the statements must have an adequate basis in fact, be issued in good faith and be consistent
with any similar forward-looking information used contemporaneously by the issuer. For an issuer that has ``opted
in'' to the safe harbor disclosure regime, only the Commission would be permitted to bring suit for projections that
are made in bad faith or without a reasonable basis. 


V. Solicitation of Public Comment 


The Commission seeks comment on a number of issues. Commenters should discuss both the continuing effectiveness
of the current safe harbors in accomplishing the primary goal of encouraging broader dissemination of forward-looking
information to the investing public, and whether the Commission should consider any change to the current safe harbor.
Would one or more of the proposals outlined above, any combination thereof, or any other proposal commenters may wish
to identify, fulfill this goal more effectively without compromising investor protection? Do the concerns outlined
in Part III above, either individually or in the aggregate, warrant revisiting and/or revising the existing safe
harbor? Commenters should explain in detail all bases for their conclusion. 


A. Types of Information Covered by a Safe Harbor 


Assuming a safe harbor continues to be necessary or appropriate in the interests of the investing public, commenters
should discuss what types of information should be eligible for safe harbor coverage. 

Commenters supporting safe harbor coverage for forward-looking information should address the reasons justifying
a distinction between forward-looking and historical information (either purely retrospective or based on estimate
or opinion) with respect to the level of protection afforded to each. Does the fact that the person making the statements
has unique knowledge concerning the basis for forward-looking statements, support or undercut this distinction?
Commenters may wish to specify whether qualitative information, including but not limited to the type described
above in Part I, is relevant to investors such that its disclosure should be encouraged. If so, should such information
be included in the safe harbor? Should forward-looking information that is currently part of required audited financial
information (such as loan-loss reserves, pension liabilities or contingent environmental liabilities) be included?

89

 Are there certain types of forward-looking information that should be 

per se 

excluded from the safe harbor (

e.g., 

such as required audited information, or the ``known trends and uncertainties'' disclosure required by the MD&A)?





Should the safe harbor distinguish between oral and written statements, between statements filed with the Commission
and non-filed statements, or between Securities Act required statements and others? Should the Commission require
that any oral statement for which safe harbor coverage is sought be reduced to writing and filed with the Commission
at or around the time that statement is first disseminated? If not, commenters should describe the legal and/or practical
impediments, if any, to a contemporaneous filing requirement. Are there certain situations, 

i.e., 

an initial public offering, in which safe harbor protection should be limited to statements made in Commission filings?
Are commenters' views on these questions affected by the type of forward-looking information under consideration?
For example, do different types of forward-looking information imply different degrees of reliability, 

e.g., 

numerical financial projections as opposed to general statements of management's outlook? If so, should a broader
safe harbor provide protection for a narrower category of information than does Rule 175 currently, or would differing
safe harbors be warranted? 


B. Voluntary Disclosure 


Should the Commission continue its current general policy of voluntary disclosure of forward-looking information
or should some or all of such information, given its significance, be mandated? If left voluntary, should any such
information used in the offer or sale of securities by the issuer be required to be included in the prospectus? Would
this be an appropriate solution to the issue of selective disclosure of key soft information during road shows? If
not, commenters should explain this conclusion and discuss alternative approaches. 



C. Scope of the Safe Harbor 


Should the safe harbor be procedurally based or substantively based or both? For example, should the safe harbor be
available only if the forward-looking information is reviewed by the board Audit Committee, or some other board level
committee or committee of top management or an outside reviewer, or should the standard be a substantive one dependent
on the reasonableness or other criteria of the information itself, regardless of the review process, or both?

D. Eligibility for and Conditions To Use of Safe Harbor 


Should all issuers be eligible for the safe harbor or only certain issuers that satisfy specified conditions, such
as sufficient reporting history and/or public float to ensure a market following? What other conditions might be
appropriate? Should issuers be required to opt-in or opt-out of a safe harbor alone or in combination with the foregoing?
If so, what should the opt-in/opt-out conditions be? Should an issuer be required to specify that it is seeking the
protection of the safe harbor by making a public filing, or by stating with regard to each safe harbor-eligible statement
(where the issuer chooses the safe harbor's protection), that the statement is being made subject to the safe harbor,
or by otherwise providing a ``bespeaks caution'' or other cautionary language? How could this condition be met (or
policed) for oral statements or written statements made outside of Commission filings? Should the burden of proof
be shifted from the plaintiff to the defendant corporation, generally or with respect to certain types of disclosures,


i.e.

, written statements outside Commission filings, oral statements, etc.? Should shareholders be permitted, or required
to vote on the availability of any safe harbor? If so, should shareholders be permitted to approve or authorize more
extensive safe harbors than those that would otherwise be available at the election of the issuer? 
Should the safe harbor require disclosure of key assumptions because that information is uniquely within the control
of the issuer? If assumptions were required to be disclosed along with the forward-looking information, how would
this affect the judicial treatment of forward-looking cases? For example, if assumptions were required to be disclosed,
would it make it easier for courts to evaluate motions to dismiss cases on a procedural motion and/or impose sanctions
for the bringing of frivolous suits? Would this requirement be more or less effective coupled with any proposed litigation
reforms? 
Should the safe harbor be unavailable (or provide greater or absolute protection) if an insider, or specified insiders,
traded (or no insider, or specified insiders, traded) within a specified period where the insiders(s) avoided a loss
or made a gain (or failed to do so) based on the dissemination and subsequent correction of the forward-looking statement?



E. Elements of the Safe Harbor 


Commenters should outline and discuss each element of an effective safe harbor. In this connection, should the safe
harbor set forth a separate definition of materiality differing from that otherwise applicable under Commission
rules and case law? Should the safe harbor impose and/or specify parameters for a duty to update or correct? Should
the safe harbor require that a private plaintiff establish that he or she actually relied on forward-looking statements?
Should a new definition of scienter be included in the safe harbor, 

e.g.

, by eliminating recklessness as an element of proof? In answering this question, commenters should discuss separately
implied and express rights of action, as well as Commission and private actions. Should a safe harbor include judicially
developed concepts such as the ``business judgment rule,'' ``bespeaks caution'' doctrine and/or any other judicial
approaches discussed in the release? What treatment should the safe harbor give to information that the issuer does
not disclose that may be relevant to evaluating the forward-looking statement? 


F. Private Actions 


Should the safe harbor distinguish between Commission enforcement action and private actions? Should the answer
to the foregoing question depend on whether the underlying cause of action is express or implied? Would the Commission
be able to compensate through enhanced enforcement for any reduction in the number of private suits in this area resulting
from adoption of a particular safe harbor? How would any limitation on private actions, whether directly imposed
or incorporated in a safe harbor, affect the Commission's longstanding policy of promoting private actions for fraud
as a necessary supplement to Commission enforcement? 
Should private litigants be required to pursue any antifraud claims arising from statements covered by a safe harbor
in a nonjudicial forum_for example, through arbitration or some other form of alternate dispute resolution? Some
commentators have suggested that a safe harbor should be adopted that would permit private antifraud actions to proceed
only if the Commission first brings a successful enforcement action for fraud. Commenters are invited to address
the merits of this suggestion and means of its implementation. 


G. Issuer Duties Under the Safe Harbor 


Should an issuer be required to update any forward-looking information? If so, for how long? Should the answer turn
on whether disclosure is mandated by the Commission's disclosure requirements (

i.e.

, MD&A) or voluntary? Should an issuer be required to compare projections to actual results to provide information
as to the reliability of the projections? Should an issuer be required to disclose and/or to file assumptions or the
basis for a statement, as now required for issuers that elect to provide option grant values calculated under the option
pricing models?

90

 




Should the safe harbor require a registrant to correct forward-looking information rendered false or misleading
after its initial disclosure? Should this duty extend only to information filed with the Commission? 
Should a duty be imposed on issuers to update and/or correct forward-looking information disclosed by others? Should
the safe harbor expressly provide that there is no duty to update and/or correct statements made by others? Should
the safe harbor include a duty to update and/or correct statements only if the issuer becomes sufficiently ``entangled''
with the third party? If so, should the safe harbor delineate those acts or omissions that would support a finding of
entanglement? 


H. Registered Investment Companies 


Is the forward-looking information that might be disclosed by registered investment companies, 

i.e., 

projections of fund performance, inappropriate for the protection of the safe harbor because it is contingent on
the performance of the securities markets, and therefore subject to greater uncertainty and frequency of change?
Do any other characteristics of registered investment companies warrant separate treatment of their forward-looking
disclosure for purposes of the safe harbor or, more generally, should such disclosure by registered investment companies
be afforded any protection under a safe harbor? Comment also is specifically invited as to whether distinctions should
be made among different kinds of registered investment companies (

e.g., 

open-end and closed-end, unit investment trust and management) for the purpose of encouraging forward-looking
disclosure and providing safe harbor protection? In light of the fact that investment companies, unlike most other
public companies, are not currently required to file current reports (Form 8-K) or quarterly reports (Form
10-Q), commenters should address how projections or other forward-looking information by investment companies
would be revised or updated.

I. Multiple Safe Harbors 


Some suggest that if private actions were to be reduced or eliminated, some issuers would be willing to make additional
filings with the Commission, either in connection with current periodic reports or on a new disclosure form, and be
subjected to greater Commission oversight with lower thresholds for Commission enforcement actions and greater
restrictions on information that can be provided orally. Other issuers may find these protections unnecessary,
but would benefit from a safe harbor that simply made certain types of antifraud claims more difficult to prosecute
successfully. Would it be reasonable to provide for or make available different types of safe harbors tailored to
the particularized needs of differently situated issuers? Specifically, does the need for heightened protections
of statements to analysts, whether oral or written, vary with the size and/or reporting history of the issuer? Should
a different, more rigorous, safe harbor be made available to companies conducting an initial public offering, than
that made available to companies with reporting histories? For example, are smaller issuers potentially affected
differently than larger issuers so that different safe harbors should be available? Should the existing safe harbors
in the Trust Indenture Act and the Public Utility Holding Company Act also be modified and, if so, why? 


J. Possible Alternatives or Supplements to a Safe Harbor 


Commenters also may wish to discuss whether there are alternatives to a safe harbor that would accomplish the same
goal of promoting enhanced disclosure of forward-looking information. For example, are there reforms with regard
to the content and/or presentation of soft information_whether within or outside of Commission filings_that would
obviate the need for a safe harbor or the need to change the current safe harbor? Are there litigation reforms relating
more broadly to the scope of antifraud liability under the securities laws that would obviate the need for the safe
harbor? For example, could an issuer be presumed to have no liability for forward-looking statements otherwise eligible
for the safe harbor unless the named plaintiff or group of plaintiffs represents at least a minimum percentage (say
10%) of the affected shareholder class? To the extent that the current safe harbor is strengthened in favor of issuers,
should there be concomitant strengthening of other safeguards for investors? In this regard, commenters may wish
to discuss the practicality of accomplishing any such reforms, and the likelihood that any such reforms would succeed.
In lieu of or in addition to revising the existing safe harbor, should the Commission redefine one or more elements
of a private Rule 10b-5 claim (

e.g.

, scienter, materiality and reliance)? 


VI. Public Hearings 


The issues addressed in this release have attracted the interest of investors, registrants, analysts and other market
participants, as well as lawyers, accountants, federal legislators and academics. In view of this broad interest,
as well as the importance and complexity of these issues, the Commission intends to authorize public hearings to be
conducted after the close of the comment period. Among other matters, these hearings will explore the assumptions
underlying the different views expressed by these and other members of the public. Testimony from witnesses will
be elicited about the efficacy and potential effects of different safe harbor approaches, the costs and benefits
of each approach, the design of any safe harbor and issues that may be raised by the comment letters. After these hearings,
the Commission will determine whether to propose amendments to the rules regarding forward-looking information.

The hearings will begin at 10 a.m. on February 13, 1995 at 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549 room 1C30. The
agenda and format for the hearings, as well as the schedule of witnesses will be announced in a subsequent release to
be issued shortly before the hearings commence. 
Members of the public interested in testifying at the hearing should notify the Commission in writing of their intention
to appear no later than December 31, 1994. The written notification should include a brief summary of the individual's
intended testimony. Any person who does not wish to appear at the hearing may submit written testimony to be included
in the hearing record. Such written testimony should be received by the Commission no later than January 11, 1995.

All written notifications, testimony and comment letters should be addressed in triplicate to Jonathan Katz, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549 and should refer to the comment file number of this release [S7-29-94].
All written submissions and a transcript of the hearings will be made available for public inspection and copying
in the Commission's Public Reference Room. The hearings will be open to the public.

Appendix_Seasoned Issuer Proposal_Association of Publicly Traded Companies 



(a) A forward-looking statement made by or on behalf of an issuer, or an omission to state a fact necessary to make the
statement not misleading, shall not serve as the basis for a private action for damages under the Securities Act of
1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 if: 

(1) The forward-looking statement is made in connection with a listed equity security or Nasdaq security for which
transaction reports are required to be made on a mandatory real-time basis pursuant to an effective transaction reporting

Heightened Definition Proposal_Business Roundtable and National Association of Manufacturers 



Rule 3b-6. Liability for Certain Statements by Issuers. 



Preliminary Note 



The Commission has recognized for many years that investors make decisions about the purchase and sale of securities
with the future in mind. The market value of securities accordingly reflects the judgments of investors about the
future economic performance of an issuer. Notwithstanding the inherent uncertainty of all statements about the
future, investors regard forward-looking statements by issuers as an important source of relevant information.
Forward-looking statements therefore make an important contribution to the efficiency of the U.S. securities markets,
and the Commission wishes to encourage issuers to make such statements. At the same time, the Commission recognizes
that issuers have a justified concern about becoming involved in litigation arising out of such statements. As the
Supreme Court has observed, ``even a complaint which by objective standards may have very little success at trial
has a settlement value to the plaintiff out of any proportion to its prospect of success at trial so long as he may prevent
the suit from being resolved against him by dismissal or summary judgment. The very pendency of the lawsuit may frustrate
or delay normal business activity of the defendant which is totally unrelated to the lawsuit.'' 

Blue Chip Stamps v. 

Manor Drug Store, 421 U.S. 723, 740 (1975). 

In order to encourage the release by issuers of forward-looking information, the Commission has adopted this ``safe
harbor'' rule. The Commission encourages the courts to apply the rule so as to implement the Commission's intent,
i.e., to provide issuers with reasonable assurance regarding the standards that will govern their liability for
such information while at the same time assessing liability where an issuer's conduct falls outside the rule and is
otherwise actionable under the federal securities laws. 

(a) 

General Rule. 

A statement within the coverage of paragraph (b) below which is made or alleged to be made by or on behalf of an issuer
or by an outside reviewer retained by the issuer shall not serve as the basis of a violation of the Act unless (1) it relates
to a misstatement or omission that is material within the meaning of paragraph (f), (2) it is made or omitted with 

scienter 

within the meaning of paragraph (g) and (3) the person challenging the statement (other than the Commission) relied
on the statement within the meaning of paragraph (h). 

(b) 

Covered Statements. 

This rule applies to the following statements: 

(1) A forward-looking statement (as defined in paragraph (c) below), 

provided 

that: 

(i) At the time such statements are made or reaffirmed, either the issuer is subject to the reporting requirements
of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and has complied with the requirements of Rule 13a-1
or 15d-1 thereunder, if applicable, to file its most recent annual report on Form 1O-K, Form 1O-KSB,
Form 20-F, or Form 40-F; or, if the issuer is not subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a)
or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the statements are made in a registration statement filed under the
Securities Act of 1933, offering statement or solicitation of interest written document or broadcast script under
Regulation A, or pursuant to Section 12 (b) or (g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and 

(ii) The statements are not made by an issuer that is an investment company registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940; and 

(2) Information which relates to (i) the effects of changing prices on the business enterprise, presented voluntarily
or pursuant to Item 303 of Regulation S-K, or Regulation S-B, or Item 9 of Form 20-F, ``Management's
discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations,'' or Item 302 of Regulation S-K,
``Supplementary financial information,'' or Rule 
3-20(c) of Regulation S-X, or (ii) the value of proved oil and gas reserves (such as a standardized measure
of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves as set forth in paragraphs 30-34 of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 69) presented voluntarily or pursuant to Item 302 of Regulation
S-K. 

(c) 

Forward-Looking Statement. 

For the purpose of this rule, the term ``forward-looking statement'' shall mean and shall be limited to: 

(1) A statement containing a projection of revenues, income (loss), earnings (loss) per share, capital expenditures,
dividends, capital structure or other financial items; 

(2) A statement of management's plans and objectives for future operations, whether qualitative or quantitative,
including plans for the development and delivery of new products or services;

(3) A statement of future economic performance; or 

(4) Disclosed statements of the assumptions underlying or related to any of the statements described in paragraph
(c)(1), (2), or (3) above. 

(d) 

Third-Party Statements. 

A forward-looking statement shall be deemed not to have been made by or on behalf of an issuer for the purposes of paragraph
(a) if it is made by any person other than the issuer or outside reviewer retained by the issuer and the issuer has not
expressly and substantially contemporaneously endorsed or approved the statement. An issuer shall not be deemed
to have any obligation to correct or update any statement made by a third party. 

(e) 

Duty to Update. 

An issuer shall not be deemed to have any obligation to update a forward-looking statement made by it unless it has expressly
and substantially contemporaneously undertaken to update such statement. 

(f) 

Materiality. 

A forward-looking statement shall be deemed to be material only if it significantly alters the total mix of information
made available regarding an issuer or its securities. 

(g) 

Scienter. 

An issuer shall be deemed not to have acted with 

scienter 

with respect to a forward-looking statement unless the issuer had actual knowledge that the statement was false or
knowingly and intentionally omitted to state a fact for the purpose of rendering such statement misleading. Evidence
that (1) the issuer's officers, directors or employees traded contemporaneously in the issuer's securities or were
the beneficiaries of compensation awards (whether or not related to the value of the issuer's securities) or (2) information
tending to cast doubt on a statement's accuracy was in the possession of the issuer's employees below the level at which
reporting decisions are made (or at such level but prior to the time such information could reasonably be expected
to have been taken into account in making the statement), shall not in either case, or in both cases, in and of itself,
be sufficient to support a finding of actual knowledge that a statement is false or misleading. 

(h) 

Reliance. 

A forward-looking statement (or a statement derived therefrom) shall not be deemed to have been relied upon unless
a person claiming such reliance had actual knowledge of and actually relied on such statement in connection with the
purchase or sale of a security.

Fraudulent Intent Proposal_William Freeman, Esquire 



The following language would be substituted into paragraph (a) of Rules 175 and 3b-6 (new language in boldface

(a) A statement within the coverage of paragraph (b) of this section which is made by or on behalf of an issuer or by an
outside reviewer retained by an issuer shall be deemed not to be a fraudulent statement (as defined in paragraph (d)
of this section), unless it is shown that such statement was made or reaffirmed recklessly or with actual intent to
deceive. A forward looking statement will not be deemed to be made or reaffirmed recklessly unless it is shown that
the issuer was, or had to be, aware of facts that made it highly unlikely that the projection could be achieved.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking and notice of public 
hearing. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document contains proposed regulations relating to gasohol blending and the taxes on diesel fuel and compressed

natural gas. This document also proposes to remove obsolete 
excise tax regulations. The proposed regulations reflect and 
implement certain changes made by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 
(the Energy Act) and the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 
1993 (the 1993 Act). The proposed regulations relating to 
gasoline and diesel fuel affect certain blenders, enterers, 
industrial users, refiners, terminal operators, and 
throughputters. The proposed regulations relating to compressed natural gas affect persons that sell or buy compressed
natural 
gas for use as a fuel in a motor vehicle or motorboat. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Paperwork Reduction Act 


The collections of information contained in this notice of 
proposed rulemaking have been submitted to the Office of 
Management and Budget for review in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)). Comments on
the collections 
of information should be sent to the Office of Management and 
Budget, Attn: Desk Officer for the Department of the Treasury, 
Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Washington, DC 
20503, with copies to the Internal Revenue Service, Attn: IRS 
Reports Clearance Officer, PC:FP, Washington, DC 20224. 
The collections of information in this proposed regulation 
are in   48.4041-21 and 48.6427-10. This information is required 
by the IRS to verify compliance with sections 4041 and 6427 and 
will be used to determine whether an amount of tax, credit, or 
payment has been computed correctly. The likely respondents are businesses and other for-profit organizations,
including small 
businesses and organizations. 
Estimated total annual reporting burden: 10 hours. 
Estimated average annual burden per respondent: .1 hour. 
Estimated number of respondents: 100 
Estimated annual frequency of responses: On occasion. 



Explanation of Provisions 


Background 


Effective January 1, 1994, the 1993 Act amends section 4081 to impose the diesel fuel tax in the same manner as the gasoline
tax. Thus, tax is imposed on (1) the removal of gasoline and 
diesel fuel (collectively taxable fuel) from any refinery, (2) 
the removal of taxable fuel from any terminal, (3) the entry of 
taxable fuel into the United States for consumption, use, or 
warehousing, and (4) the sale of taxable fuel to an unregistered person unless there was a prior taxable removal, entry,
or sale 
of the taxable fuel. However, tax does not apply to any entry or removal of taxable fuel transferred in bulk to a refinery
or 
terminal if the persons involved (including the terminal 
operator) are registered by the IRS. 



Conforming Amendments to Gasoline Regulations 


On November 30, 1993, the IRS published in the 

Federal 
Register

 (58 FR 63069) temporary regulations under section 4081 
relating to the imposition of the diesel fuel excise tax for 
diesel fuel that is removed at a terminal rack, removed from a 
refinery, entered into the United States, or blended outside of 
the bulk/transfer terminal system. Those rules are similar to 
the rules relating to the removal, entry, or blending of gasoline under   48.4081-2 and 48.4081-3.

These proposed regulations generally consolidate the rules 
relating to gasoline and diesel fuel into a single set of rules 
applicable to all taxable fuel. 



Compressed Natural Gas 


Effective October 1, 1993, section 4041(a)(3) (added to the Internal Revenue Code by section 13241(e) of the 1993
Act) 
imposes a tax on compressed natural gas (CNG) that is sold for 
use or used as a fuel in a motor vehicle or motorboat. 
The proposed regulations provide rules relating to the 
imposition of, and liability for, the tax on CNG. These rules 
are similar to the regulations relating to taxes on special motor fuels imposed by section 4041. 



Gasohol; Tolerance Rule 


The gasoline tax rate is 18.4 cents per gallon (the regular rate). However, a reduction from the regular rate is allowed
for gasohol (a gasoline/alcohol mixture). Before January 1, 1993, 
section 4081(c) treated a mixture of gasoline and alcohol as 
gasohol only if at least 10 percent of the mixture was alcohol. The rate reduction under pre-1993 law was 5.4 cents per
gallon 
for gasohol containing ethanol and 6 cents per gallon for gasohol containing alcohol other than ethanol. This was
equivalent to a subsidy of 54 cents or 60 cents per gallon of alcohol used to 
produce gasohol. 
Section 48.4081-6(b)(2) provides a special rule for the 
application of the ``at least 10 percent'' requirement by allowing a tolerance for mixtures that contain less than
10 percent 
alcohol but at least 9.8 percent alcohol. Under the tolerance 
rule, a portion of the mixture equal to the number of gallons of alcohol in the mixture multiplied by 10 is considered
to be 
gasohol. Any excess liquid in the mixture is taxed at the 
regular rate. Absent the tolerance rule, pre-1993 law would have taxed the entire mixture at the regular rate.

<PARENT> FR941019-1-00005 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The tolerance rule accommodates operational problems associated with the blending of gasohol. For example, blenders
may fail to attain the required 10-percent alcohol level because the device used to meter the amount of gasoline or
alcohol added to a tank truck is imprecise or because the high-speed gasoline or alcohol pump used does not shut off
at the proper moment. Blenders cannot compensate for these errors by aiming for an alcohol content in excess of 10 percent
because Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rules do not authorize the sale of gasohol containing more than 10
percent alcohol. 

Effective January 1, 1993, section 1920 of the Energy Act amended section 4081(c) to allow a reduction from the regular
rate for mixtures containing at least 5.7 percent alcohol but less than 7.7 percent alcohol (5.7 percent gasohol)
and mixtures containing at least 7.7 percent alcohol but less than 10 percent alcohol (7.7 percent gasohol). The 5.4-
and 6-cents-per-gallon rate reductions were retained for mixtures containing at least 10 percent alcohol (10 percent
gasohol) and were prorated for 5.7 percent and 7.7 percent gasohol to maintain the subsidy level of 54 cents or 60 cents
per gallon, respectively, for ethanol or other alcohol that is mixed with gasoline. 

The proposed regulations continue the present tolerance rule for mixtures that contain less than 10 percent alcohol
but at least 9.8 percent alcohol. However, a similar rule is not extended to mixtures that contain less than 7.7 or 5.7
percent alcohol because blenders can compensate for any operational problems by aiming for an alcohol content above
7.7 or 5.7 percent without violating EPA rules. 



Gasohol; Blender Credit or Payment 



If a gasohol blender produces gasohol from gasoline that was taxed at the regular rate, section 6427(f) allows the
gasohol blender to obtain a partial credit or payment relating to that tax. The proposed regulations provide the conditions
under which a credit or payment under section 6427(f) will be allowed. 



Gasohol; ETBE 



The regulations under section 40 provide that alcohol used to produce ethyl tertiary butyl ether (ETBE) generally
is treated as 

alcohol

 for purposes of the alcohol fuels credit when the ETBE is mixed with gasoline. The proposed regulations provide a similar
rule with respect to alcohol used to produce ETBE for purposes of the reduced tax rates for gasohol. 

For example, a gasoline/ETBE mixture would qualify as 5.7 percent gasohol if the mixture contains 12.7 percent ETBE
and each gallon of ETBE is made from .45 gallon of alcohol. 



Reliance on These Proposed Regulations 



These regulations are being issued in proposed form to provide timely guidance to taxpayers and to allow interested
parties appropriate opportunity to provide comments before issuance of final regulations. Although final regulations
may include changes made, for example, in response to comments, taxpayers may rely on the proposed regulations until
final regulations are issued. For example, alcohol used to produce ETBE is treated as 

alcohol 

for purposes of the gasohol tax rates. 



Special Analyses 



It has been determined that this notice of proposed rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in
EO 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply
to these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f)
of the Internal Revenue Code, this notice of proposed rulemaking will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy
of the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on small business.

Comments and Public Hearing 



Before these proposed regulations are adopted as final 
regulations, consideration will be given to any written comments that are submitted timely (preferably a signed
original and eight copies) to the IRS. All comments will be available for public 
inspection and copying. 

A public hearing has been scheduled for Wednesday, January 
11, 1995, at 1 p.m. in the Auditorium, Internal Revenue Building, 1111 Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, DC. Because
of access 
restrictions, visitors will not be admitted beyond the building 
lobby more than 15 minutes before the hearing starts. 

The rules of  601.601(a)(3) apply to the hearing. 

Persons that have submitted written comments by December 19, 1994 and want to present oral comments at the hearing
must 
submit an outline of the topics to be discussed and the time to 
be devoted to each topic by December 21, 1994. 

A period of 10 minutes will be allotted to each person for 
making comments. 

An agenda showing the scheduling of the speakers will be 
prepared after the deadline for receiving outlines has passed. 
Copies of the agenda will be available free of charge at the 
hearing. 



Drafting Information 



The principal author of these regulations is Frank Boland, 
Office of Assistant Chief Counsel (Passthroughs and Special 
Industries). However, other personnel from the IRS and Treasury Department participated in their development.

(b) 

Bulk sales of CNG

_(1) 

In general. 

Tax is imposed on the sale of CNG that is not in connection with the delivery of the CNG into the fuel supply tank of the
propulsion engine of a motor vehicle or motorboat if, by the time of the sale_ 
(i) The buyer has given the seller a written statement stating that the entire quantity of the CNG covered by the statement
is for use as a fuel in a motor vehicle or motorboat; and 
(ii) The seller has given the buyer a written acknowledgement of receipt of the statement described in paragraph (b)(1)(i)
of this section. 

(2) 

Liability for tax. 

The seller of the CNG is liable for the tax imposed under paragraph (b) of this section. 

(c) 

Exemptions

_(1) 

In general. 

The taxes imposed under this section do not apply to a delivery or sale of CNG for a use described in  48.4082-4T(c)(1)
through (5)(A) or (6) through (11). However, if the person otherwise liable for tax under this section is the seller
of the CNG, the exemption under this section applies only if, by the time of sale, the seller has an unexpired certificate
(described in this section) from the buyer and has no reason to believe any information in the certificate is false.



(2) 

Certificate; in general. 

The certificate to be provided by a buyer of CNG is to consist of a statement that is signed under penalties of perjury
by a person with authority to bind the buyer, should be in substantially the same form as the model certificate provided
in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, and should contain all information necessary to complete the model certificate.
A new certificate must be given if any information in the current certificate changes. The certificate may be included
as part of any business records normally used to document a sale. The certificate expires on the earliest of the following
dates: 

(i) The date one year after the effective date of the certificate (which may be no earlier than the date it is signed).



(ii) The date a new certificate is provided to the seller. 


(iii) The date the seller is notified by the Internal Revenue Service or the buyer that the buyer's right to provide
a certificate has been withdrawn. 

(3) 

Withdrawal of right to provide certificate. 

The Internal Revenue Service may withdraw the right of a buyer of CNG to provide a certificate under this paragraph
(c) if the buyer uses CNG to which a certificate applies in a taxable use. The Internal Revenue Service may notify any
seller to whom the buyer has provided a certificate that the buyer's right to provide a certificate has been withdrawn.

(iii) 

Products derived from alcohol. Alcohol 

includes 
alcohol described in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this 
section that is chemically transformed in producing another 
product so that the alcohol is no longer present as a separate 
chemical in the other product, provided that there is no 
significant loss in the energy content of the alcohol. Thus, for example, alcohol described in paragraphs (b)(1)(i)
and (ii) of 
this section that is used to produce ethyl tertiary butyl ether 
(ETBE) in a chemical reaction in which there is no significant 
loss in the energy content of the alcohol is treated as 

alcohol 


when the ETBE is mixed with gasoline. 

(2) 

Gasohol

_(i) 

In general

. Gasohol is a mixture of 
gasoline and alcohol that is 10 percent gasohol, 7.7 percent 
gasohol, or 5.7 percent gasohol immediately after the mixture is blended. The determination of whether a particular
mixture is 10 percent gasohol, 7.7 percent gasohol, or 5.7 percent gasohol is 
made on a batch-by-batch basis. A batch of gasohol is a discrete mixture of gasoline and alcohol. If a batch is splash
blended, 
the contents of the batch typically correspond to a gasoline 
meter delivery ticket and an alcohol meter delivery ticket, each of which shows the number of gallons of liquid delivered
into the mixture. In such case, the volume of each component in a batch 
(without adjustment for temperature) ordinarily is determined by the number of metered gallons shown on the delivery
tickets for 
the gasoline and alcohol delivered. However, if a blender adds 
metered gallons of gasoline and alcohol to a tank already 
containing more than a minor amount of liquid (other than 
gasohol), the determination of whether a batch is gasohol and of its type will be made by taking into account the amount
of 
alcohol and non-alcohol fuel contained in the liquid already in 
the tank. Ordinarily, any amount in excess of 0.5 percent of the capacity of the tank will not be considered minor. 

(ii) 

10 percent gasohol

_(A) 

In general

. A batch of 
gasoline/alcohol mixture is 10 percent gasohol if it contains at least 10 percent alcohol by volume, without rounding.


(B) 

Batches containing less than 10 percent but at least 9.8 percent alcohol. 

If a batch of mixture contains less than 10 
percent alcohol but at least 9.8 percent alcohol, without 
rounding, a portion of the batch is considered to be 10 percent 
gasohol. That portion equals the number of gallons of alcohol 
in the batch multiplied by 10. Any remaining liquid in the 
mixture is 

excess liquid. 

If tax was imposed on the excess 
liquid at the gasohol production rate (as defined in paragraph 
(e)(1) of this section), the excess liquid in the batch is 
considered to be gasoline with respect to which there is a 
failure to blend into gasohol for purposes of paragraph (g) of 
this section. Excess liquid is considered to be removed before 
the removal of the gasohol portion. If tax was imposed on the 
excess liquid at the rate of tax described in section 4081(a), a credit or refund under section 6427(f) is not allowed
with 
respect to the excess liquid. 

(iii) 

7.7 percent gasohol

. A batch of gasoline/alcohol 
mixture is 7.7 percent gasohol if and only if it contains at 
least 7.7 percent, but less than 9.8 percent, alcohol by volume, without rounding. 

(iv) 

5.7 percent gasohol

. A batch of gasoline/alcohol 
mixture is 5.7 percent gasohol if and only if it contains at 
least 5.7 percent, but less than 7.7 percent, alcohol by volume, without rounding. 

(v) 

Examples

. This paragraph (b)(2) may be illustrated by 
the following examples. In these examples, a gasohol blender 
creates a gasoline/alcohol mixture by pumping a specified amount of gasoline into an empty tank. The blender then
splash blends a specified amount of alcohol into gasoline. 






Example 1. Mixtures containing exactly 10 percent alcohol. 

The applicable delivery tickets show that the mixture is made 
with 7200 metered gallons of gasoline and 800 metered gallons of alcohol. Accordingly, the mixture contains 10 percent
alcohol 
(as determined based on the delivery tickets provided to the 
blender) and qualifies as 10 percent gasohol. 



Example 2. Mixtures containing less than 10 percent alcohol but at least 9.8 percent alcohol. 

The applicable delivery 
tickets show that the mixture is made with 7205 metered gallons 
of gasoline and 795 metered gallons of alcohol. Because the 
mixture contains less than 10 percent alcohol, but more than 9.8 percent alcohol, (as determined based on the delivery
tickets 
provided to the blender), 7950 gallons of the mixture qualify as 10 percent gasohol. If tax was imposed on the gasoline
in the 
mixture at the gasohol production rate, the remaining 50 gallons of the mixture are treated as gasoline with respect
to which 
there was a failure to blend into gasohol for purposes of 
paragraph (g) of this section. If tax was imposed on the 
gasoline in the mixture at the rate of tax described in section 
4081(a), a credit or refund under section 6427(f) is allowed only with respect to 7155 gallons of gasoline. 



Example 3

. The applicable delivery tickets show that the 
mixture is made with 7550 metered gallons of gasoline and 450 
metered gallons of alcohol. Because the mixture contains only 
5.625 percent alcohol (as determined based on the delivery 
tickets provided to the blender), the mixture does not qualify as gasohol.

Failure to blend

_(i) 

Imposition of tax. 

Tax is imposed on the entry, removal, or sale of gasoline (including excess 
liquid described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section) with respect to which tax was imposed at a gasohol production
tax rate if_ 
(A) The gasoline was not blended into gasohol; or 
(B) The gasoline was blended into gasohol but the gasohol 
production tax rate applicable to the type of gasohol produced is greater than the rate of tax originally imposed on
the gasoline.


* * * * * 


(iii) 

Rate of tax. 

The rate of tax imposed on gasoline 
described in paragraph (g)(2)(i)(A) of this section is the 
difference between the rate of tax applicable to gasoline not 
described in this section and the rate of tax previously imposed on the gasoline. The rate of tax imposed on gasoline
described 
in paragraph (g)(2)(i)(B) of this section is the difference 
between the gasohol production tax rate applicable to the type of gasohol produced and the rate of tax previously imposed
on the 
gasoline. 
(iv) 

Example. 

The following example illustrates the rule of this paragraph (g)(2): 





Example. 

(i) A registered gasohol blender bought gasoline 
in connection with a removal described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section. Based on the blender's certification
(described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section) that the blender would produce 10 percent gasohol with the gasoline,
tax at the gasohol 
production tax rate applicable to 10 percent gasohol was imposed on the removal. 
(ii) The blender then produced a mixture by splash blending in a tank holding approximately 8000 gallons of mixture.
The 
applicable delivery tickets show that the mixture was blended by first pumping 7220 metered gallons of gasoline into
the empty tank, and then pumping 780 metered gallons of alcohol into the 
tank. Because the mixture contains 9.75 percent alcohol (as 
determined based on the delivery tickets provided to the blender) the entire mixture qualifies as 7.7 percent gasohol,
rather than 10 percent gasohol. 
(iii) Because the 7220 gallons of gasoline were taxed at the gasohol production tax rate applicable to 10 percent gasohol
but the gasoline was blended into 7.7 percent gasohol, a failure to 
blend has occurred with respect to the gasoline. As the person 
that bought the gasoline in connection with the taxable removal, the blender is liable for the tax imposed under paragraph

(g)(2)(i) of this section. The amount of tax imposed is the 
difference between_ 
(A) 7220 gallons times the gasohol production tax rate 
applicable to 7.7 percent gasohol; and 
(B) 7220 gallons times the gasohol production tax rate 
applicable to 10 percent gasohol. 
(iv) Because the gasohol does not contain exactly 7.7 
percent alcohol, the benefit of the gasohol production tax rate 
with respect to the alcohol is less than the amount of the 
alcohol mixture credit under section 40(b) (determined before the application of section 40(c). Accordingly, the
blender may be 
entitled to claim an alcohol mixture credit for the alcohol used in the gasohol. Under section 40(c), however, the
amount of the alcohol mixture credit must be reduced to take into account the 
benefit provided with respect to the alcohol by the gasohol 
production tax rate.

Effective date. 

This section is effective 
January 1, 1993.

Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans; Virginia: Definition of VOC and Emission Control
Areas




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA proposes to approve the State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the Commonwealth of Virginia on
November 4, 1992. The revision consists of amendments to Virginia's definition of the term volatile organic compound
(VOC) and administrative changes to Virginia's lists of emission control areas for VOC and oxides of nitrogen (NO

x

). Virginia's November 4, 1992, SIP revision submittal also contained an emission statement regulation. The portion
of Virginia's November 4, 1992, submittal pertaining to emission statements is the subject of a separate rulemaking
action.



In the final rules section of this 

Federal Register

, EPA is approving the Commonwealth's November 4, 1992, SIP revision as a direct final rule without prior proposal
because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial SIP revision and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed
rationale for the approval is set forth in the direct final rule and technical support document (TSD) prepared for
that rulemaking action. If no adverse comments are received in response to this proposed rule, no further activity
is contemplated in relation to this rule. If EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn
and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed rule. EPA will
not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do
so at this time.

Proposed Interim Approval of the Operating Permits Program; Wisconsin 




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed interim approval.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The EPA proposes interim approval of the Operating Permits Program submitted by the State of Wisconsin for the purpose
of complying with Federal requirements which mandate that States develop, and submit to EPA, programs for issuing
operating permits to all major stationary sources, and to certain other sources, with the exception of sources on
Indian lands.

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


I. Background and Purpose


A. Introduction


As required under title V of the Clean Air Act (Act) as amended (1990), EPA has promulgated rules which define the minimum
elements of an approvable State operating permits program and the corresponding standards and procedures by which
EPA will approve, oversee, and withdraw approval of State operating permits programs. See 57 FR 32250 (July 21, 1992).
These rules are codified at title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 70. Title V requires States to develop,
and submit to EPA, programs for issuing operating permits to all major stationary sources and to certain other sources.
The Act requires that States develop and submit these programs to EPA by November 15, 1993, and that EPA act to approve
or disapprove each program within 1 year after receiving the submittal. The EPA's program review occurs pursuant
to section 502 of the Act and the part 70 regulations, which together outline criteria for approval or disapproval.
Where a program substantially, but not fully, meets the requirements of part 70, EPA may grant the program interim
approval for a period of up to 2 years. If EPA has not fully approved a program by 2 years after the November 15, 1993 date,
or by the end of an interim program, it must establish and implement a Federal program.


II. Proposed Action and Implications


A. Analysis of State Submission


1. Support Materials


The Governor of Wisconsin submitted Wisconsin's title V Operating Permits Program on January 27, 1994. The EPA deemed
the submittal complete in a letter to the Governor dated March 24, 1994. The submittal contained all required elements
of 40 CFR 70.4, including a description of Wisconsin's operating permits program, permitting program documentation,
and the Attorney General's legal opinion that the laws of the State of Wisconsin provide adequate authority to carry
out all aspects of the program required by the Act.
The Governor's letter to EPA states that Wisconsin's operating permits program will cover all geographical areas
of Wisconsin, except for activities conducted by Indians on Indian reservation lands. Except for a brief reiteration
of this statement in the program description, there is no further discussion in the submittal of any basis under which
the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) might assert jurisdiction over sources on tribal lands.
Because WDNR has not demonstrated, consistent with applicable principles of Indian law and Federal Indian policies,
legal authority to regulate sources on tribal lands, the proposed interim approval of Wisconsin's operating permits
program will not extend to lands within the exterior boundaries of any Indian reservation in the State of Wisconsin.

1

 Title V sources located within the exterior boundaries of Indian reservations in Wisconsin will be subject to either
the Federal operating permits program, to be promulgated at 40 CFR part 71, or to a tribal operating permits program
approved pursuant to title V and the regulations that will be promulgated under section 301(d) of the Act. The section
301(d) regulations will authorize EPA to treat tribes in the same manner as States for appropriate Act provisions.

2








2. Regulations and Program Implementation


Wisconsin's operating permits program, including the operating permits program regulations (Chapters Natural
Resources (NR) 400, 406, 407, 409, 410, 436, 438, 439, 484, 490, and 494, Wisconsin Administrative Code) substantially
meet the requirements of 40 CFR part 70, including:   70.2 and 70.3 with respect to applicability;  70.5
with respect to application forms, completeness requirements, and criteria for defining insignificant activities;
  70.4, 70.5, and 70.6 with respect to permit content (including operational flexibility);   70.7
and 70.8 with respect to permit processing requirements (including minor permit modifications and public participation);
and  70.11 with respect to enforcement authority.
There are two references in Wisconsin's regulations which incorrectly cite the program's compliance certification
requirements. The reference in section NR 407.09(4)(a)3.c., Wisconsin Administrative Code (s.NR 407.09(4)(a)3.c.,
Wis. Adm. Code) to s.NR 439.03(7) is incorrect. The correct reference is s.NR 439.03(8). The reference in s.NR 439.03(1)(c),
Wis. Adm. Code, to s.NR 439.03(7) is incorrect. The correct reference is s.NR 439.03(8). WDNR is aware of these incorrect
citations and is planning to correct them.
For a detailed analysis of Wisconsin's program submittal, please refer to the Technical Support Document (TSD) for
this proposed action, which is available in the docket at the address noted above. The TSD shows that all operating
permits program requirements of title V of the Act, 40 CFR part 70, and relevant guidance were met by Wisconsin's submittal,
with the exception of those requirements described in subpart II.B. below.


3. Permit Fee Demonstration


Wisconsin's operating permits program fee schedule is established in section 144.399, Wisconsin Statutes (s. 144.399,
Wis. Stats.), and in Chapters NR 410 and 438, Wis. Adm. Code. Wisconsin's fee schedule is based on the presumptive minimum
program cost established in 40 CFR 70.9, and exceeds the presumptive minimum because the State charges fees for more
pollutants than those included in the 40 CFR 70.2 definition of ``regulated pollutant (for presumptive fee calculation)''.
In fiscal year 1995, WDNR estimates the dollar per ton fee to be $30.18 (assuming a 3% increase in the Consumer Price
Index). Using the presumptive minimum model, the presumptive cost of the program in fiscal year 1995 is $8,201,717.
WDNR's estimated fees for fiscal year 1995 is $8,435,612.
The EPA's approval of Wisconsin's fee schedule does not extend to fees collected pursuant to s.144.399(2)(am), Wis.
Stats. and s.NR 410.04(4), Wis. Adm. Code. These provisions allow WDNR to collect emissions fees from utilities with
affected units under section 404 of the Act during the years 1995 through 1999. 40 CFR 70.9(b)(4) provides that, for
1995 through 1999, no fee for purposes of title V shall be required to be paid with respect to emissions from any affected
unit under section 404 of the Act.


4. Provisions Implementing the Requirements of Other Titles of the Act




a. Authority for Section 112 Implementation


Wisconsin has demonstrated in its title V program submittal adequate legal authority to implement and enforce all
section 112 toxics requirements through the title V permit. This legal authority is contained in Wisconsin's enabling
legislation and in regulatory provisions that define ``applicable requirements'' and provide that the permit must
incorporate all applicable requirements. The EPA has determined that this legal authority is sufficient to allow
Wisconsin to issue permits to part 70 sources that assure compliance with all section 112 requirements. 
EPA is interpreting the above legal authority to mean that Wisconsin is able to carry out all section 112 activities
for part 70 sources. For further rationale on this interpretation, please refer to the TSD for this proposed action.


b. Implementation of Section 112(g) Upon Program Approval


As a condition of approval of the part 70 program, Wisconsin is required to implement section 112(g) of the Act from
the effective date of the part 70 program. Imposition of case-by-case determinations of Maximum Achievable Control
Technology or offsets under section 112(g) will require the use of a mechanism for establishing federally enforceable
restrictions on a source-specific basis. The EPA is proposing to approve Wisconsin's preconstruction permitting
program found in Chapters 406 and 408, Wis. Adm. Code, under the authority of title V and part 70 solely for the purpose
of implementing section 112(g) during the transition period between title V approval and adoption of a State rule
implementing EPA's section 112(g) regulations. The EPA believes this approval is necessary so that Wisconsin has
a mechanism in place to establish federally enforceable restrictions for section 112(g) purposes from the date of
part 70 approval. Although section 112(l) generally provides authority for approval of State air programs to implement
section 112(g), title V and section 112(g) provide authority for this limited approval because of the direct linkage
between the implementation of section 112(g) and title V. The scope of this approval is narrowly limited to section
112(g) and does not confer or imply approval for purposes of any other provision under the Act, for example, section
110. If Wisconsin does not wish to implement section 112(g) through its preconstruction permit program and can demonstrate
that an alternative means of implementing section 112(g) exists, EPA may, in the final action on Wisconsin's part
70 program, approve the alternative instead.
This approval is for an interim period only, until such time as the State adopts regulations consistent with any regulations
promulgated by EPA to implement section 112(g). Accordingly, EPA is proposing to limit the duration of this approval
to a reasonable time following promulgation of section 112(g) regulations so that Wisconsin, acting expeditiously,
will be able to adopt regulations consistent with the section 112(g) regulations. The EPA is proposing here to limit
the duration of this approval to 18 months following promulgation by EPA of section 112(g) regulations. Comment is
solicited on whether 18 months is an appropriate period, considering Wisconsin's procedures for adoption of regulations.


c. Program for Straight Delegation of Section 112 Standards


Requirements for operating permits program approval, specified in 40 CFR 70.4(b), also address section 112(l)(5)
requirements for approval of a program for delegation of section 112 standards as promulgated by EPA as they apply
to part 70 sources. Section 112(l)(5) requires that the State's program contain adequate authorities, adequate
resources for implementation, and an expeditious compliance schedule, which are also requirements under part 70.
Therefore, EPA is also proposing to grant approval under section 112(l)(5) and 40 CFR 63.91 of Wisconsin's program
for receiving delegation of section 112 standards that are unchanged from the Federal standards as promulgated.
Because Wisconsin has the authority under s.144.394(12), Wis. Stats., to include any conditions in an operating
permit that are applicable to a source under the Act (including section 112 requirements), EPA proposes to approve
the delegation of section 112 standards through automatic delegation. The details of this delegation mechanism
will be set forth in a Memorandum of Agreement between Wisconsin and EPA. This program applies to both existing and
future standards, but is limited to sources covered by the part 70 program.


d. Implementation of Title IV


Wisconsin's operating permits program contains adequate authority to issue permits which include the requirements
of the title IV Acid Rain Program. The WDNR also committed in the program submittal to adopting and submitting to EPA
by January 1, 1995, a program implementing the Acid Rain Program.


B. Options for Approval/Disapproval and Implications


The EPA is proposing to grant interim approval to the title V operating permits program submitted by the State of Wisconsin
on January 27, 1994. This interim approval of Wisconsin's operating permits program applies to all title V sources,
with the exception of sources on Indian lands and source categories described in the source category limited interim
approval below (following B.8.). Non-major stationary sources that may be required to obtain a title V operating
permit are currently exempted from the program under 40 CFR 70.3. Wisconsin's operating permits program for non-title
V sources has been submitted as a revision to Wisconsin's State Implementation Plan and is currently under EPA review.
If interim approval of Wisconsin's title V operating permits program is promulgated, the State must make the following
changes to receive full approval: 



1. Revise Wisconsin's operating permit program regulations to provide for criminal fines against any person who
knowingly makes any false material statement, representation, or certification in a permit application. This provision
is required by 40 CFR 70.11(a)(3)(iii). The June 21, 1993, memorandum included in the Attorney General's opinion
states that s.144.426(2)(a), Wis. Stats., does not penalize a person who knowingly submits false information because
the statutes do not require the submittal of accurate information to obtain a permit. However, the memorandum further
explains that WDNR has the authority to promulgate a rule requiring the submittal of accurate information. Section
NR 439.03(11), Wis. Adm. Code, provides that all reports required by an operating permit shall be truthful. However,
there is no regulatory provision which requires the application submittal itself to be truthful. 
2. Revise the following legislation and regulations to provide an application shield for ``new'' and ``modified
sources'' (as defined by ss.144.30(20s) and (20e), Wis. Stats.): s.144.391(1)(b), Wis. Stats.; s.144.3925(7),
Wis. Stats.; s.NR 407.06(2), Wis. Adm. Code; and s.NR 407.08, Wis. Adm. Code. Wisconsin's program does provide an
application shield for ``existing sources'' (as defined by s.144.30(13). 40 CFR 70.7(b) requires that the application
shield must apply to all part 70 sources which meet the application shield requirements.
3. Revise the following legislation and regulation to provide for operational flexibility for ``new'' and ``modified
sources'' (as defined by ss.144.30(20s) and (20e), Wis. Stats.): s.144.391(4m), Wis. Stats.; and s.NR 407.025,
Wis. Adm. Code. Wisconsin's program does provide for operational flexibility for ``existing sources'' (as defined
by s.144.30(13). 40 CFR 70.4(b)(12) requires that permit flexibility apply to all part 70 sources.
4. Revise the appropriate legislation and regulations to provide the authority to deny a renewal application for
a source that is not in compliance. 40 CFR 70.6(a)(6)(i) requires that any permit noncompliance is grounds for denial
of a permit renewal application. Section NR 407.09(1)(f)1., Wis. Adm. Code, states that the authority to deny a permit
renewal application for noncompliance is contingent upon the requirements in s.144.3925(6), Wis. Stats., which
do not currently provide for a denial in such a circumstance. Appendix P of Wisconsin's operating permits program
submittal includes draft statutory revisions that are intended to fix this deficiency. The draft revisions propose
to add this authority to s.144.396(3)(c), Wis. Stats. Regardless of the statutory placement of this authority, s.NR
407.09(1)(f)1., Wis. Adm. Code, must be revised if necessary to reference the correct statutory authority.
5. Revise ss.NR 407.14(1)(b), (c), (d), and (h), Wis. Adm. Code, to provide that if the conditions specified in these
provisions are met, WDNR is required to reopen a permit for cause. Under the State's current provisions, reopening
a permit under these circumstances is discretionary. 40 CFR 70.7(f)(1) establishes the conditions under which reopening
a permit for cause is mandatory. However, the conditions of ss.NR 407.14(1)(c) and (d), Wis. Adm. Code, are only mandatory
if they meet the 3 year requirement under 40 CFR 70.7(f)(1)(i), or are acid rain requirements under 40 CFR 70.7(f)(1)(ii).

6. Revise s.NR 407.05, Wis. Adm. Code, to include the duty to supplement or correct application provisions, as required
under 40 CFR 70.5(b).
7. Revise s.144.3935(1)(a), Wis. Stats., to provide WDNR the authority to issue operating permits to ``new'' and
``modified'' part 70 sources (as defined by ss.144.30(20s) and (20e), Wis. Stats.) that are not in compliance. 40
CFR 70.3(a) requires that the permitting agency must have authority to issue permits to all prt 70 sources. 

 

Revise s.NR 407.05(4)(h)2.c., Wis. Adm. Code, to provide that compliance plan application requirements for noncomplying
new and modified sources include a narrative description of how the sources will achieve compliance. 40 CFR 70.5(c)(8)(ii)(C)
requires this compliance plan application requirement for all part 70 sources that are not in compliance.
Revise s.NR 407.05(4)(h)3.c., Wis. Adm. Code, to provide for schedule of compliance application requirements for
noncomplying new and modified sources. 40 CFR 70.5(c)(8)(iii)(C) requires schedules of compliance in all noncomplying
part 70 source applications.
Revise s.NR 407.05(4)(h)4., Wis. Adm. Code, to provide for progress report application requirements for noncomplying
new and modified sources. 40 CFR 70.5(c)(8)(iv) requires progress report schedules in all noncomplying part 70 source
applications. 
Revise s.NR 407.09(4)(b), Wis. Adm. Code, to provide for schedule of compliance and progress report requirements
in permits issued to noncomplying new and modified sources. 40 CFR 70.6(c)(3) and (4) require schedule of compliance
and progress report requirements in all part 70 permits that are issued to noncomplying sources.
8. Revise ss.NR 407.03(1)(d), (g), (h), (o), (s), (sm), and (t), Wis. Adm. Code, to ensure that no part 70 sources are
exempted from the requirement to obtain an operating permit, as provided under 40 CFR 70.3. Section NR 407.03(1)(t)
potentially exempts certain part 70 sources, and ss.NR 407.03(1)(d), (g), (h), (o), (s), and (sm) do not provide for
adequate procedures to limit these sources' potential to emit. The 40 CFR 70.2 definition of ``major source'' considers
the potential to emit of a source in determining major source status. The Wisconsin permitting exemptions listed
above determine applicability based in part or totally on these sources' actual emissions or throughput, and the
provisions in s.NR 407.03(4) do not provide an enforceable mechanism for limiting these sources' potential emissions
to the actual emissions levels or throughput established in the exemptions.
WDNR has demonstrated that the additional exemptions provided for in s.NR 407.03 are acceptable because they do not
exempt part 70 sources from the operating permit program. These exemptions are further analyzed in the TSD for this
proposed action.
To be eligible for interim approval, 40 CFR 70.4(d)(3)(ii) requires that a program provide for adequate authority
to issue permits containing all applicable requirements to all title V sources. Due to the deficiencies outlined
in 7. and 8. above, EPA is proposing that Wisconsin's operating permit program be granted source category limited
interim approval. See 57 FR 32270 (July 21, 1992). Therefore, EPA is not proposing to include ``new'' and ``modified''
part 70 sources that are not in compliance (as defined by Wisconsin's operating permits program), and part 70 sources
covered by Chapter NR 407.03(1)(d), (g), (h), (o), (s), (sm), and (t) as part of the interim approval of Wisconsin's
program. The exclusion of these source categories from approval, however, does not affect Wisconsin's obligation
to fix these deficiencies in order to be eligible for full approval.
For the deficiency outlined in 7. above, EPA considers the legislative drafting oversight in the use of the term ``existing
source'' in a manner inconsistent with the definition of the term to be a compelling reason for granting source category
limited interim approval.
For the deficiency outlined in 8. above, EPA considers the lack of EPA guidance in developing prohibitory rules at
the time Wisconsin promulgated its operating permits regulations to be a compelling reason for granting source category
limited interim approval. For the deficiency with the s.NR 407.03(1)(t) exemption, EPA considers the additional
analysis provided by WDNR showing that the exemption could potentially exempt title V sources to be a compelling reason
for granting source category limited interim approval. At the time of Wisconsin's operating permits program submittal,
WDNR had determined that this exemption would not exclude any title V sources from the requirement to obtain an operating
permit. However, WDNR later determined that this exemption could exclude title V sources.
Wisconsin has not requested additional time for issuing initial operating permits, as the State intends to fix the
source category limited interim approval deficiencies in time to permit all sources within the 3 year phase-in period.
In addition, based on estimates provided by WDNR, EPA believes that only a small number of sources and a small amount
of emissions would be affected by source category limited interim approval. For example, WDNR estimates that only
2 or 3 sources per year will be affected by the noncomplying new and modified source deficiency. WDNR is also not aware
of any part 70 sources that would meet the s.NR 407.03(1)(t) exemption provisions. For further information, refer
to the TSD for this proposed action. EPA has determined that Wisconsin's operating permits program can issue permits
to a sufficient number of part 70 sources, and can do so on a schedule that substantially meets the requirements of part
70.
This interim approval, which may not be renewed, extends for a period of up to 2 years. During the interim approval period,
the State is protected from sanctions for failure to have a program, and EPA is not obligated to promulgate a Federal
permits program in the State. Permits issued under a program with interim approval have full standing with respect
to part 70, and the 1-year time period for submittal of permit applications by subject sources begins upon interim
approval, as does the 3-year time period for processing the initial permit applications.
As outlined in II.A.4.c. above, EPA is also proposing to grant approval under section 112(l)(5) and 40 CFR 63.91 of
the State's program for receiving delegation of section 112 standards that are unchanged from Federal standards
as promulgated. This program for delegations only applies to sources covered by the part 70 program.


III. Administrative Requirements


A. Request for Public Comments 


The EPA is requesting comments on all aspects of this proposed interim approval. Copies of the State's submittal and
other information relied upon for the proposed interim approval are contained in an informal docket maintained at
the EPA Regional Office. The docket is an organized and complete file of all the information submitted to, or otherwise
considered by, EPA in the development of this proposed interim approval. The principal purposes of the docket are:



(1) To allow interested parties a means to identify and locate documents so that they can effectively participate
in the approval process; and
(2) To serve as the record in case of judicial review. The EPA will consider any comments received by November 18, 1994.


B. Executive Order 12866


The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this action from Executive Order 12866 review.


C. Regulatory Flexibility Act


Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis
assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify
that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include
small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations
of less than 50,000. 
Operating permit program approvals under section 502 of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal operating permit program approval
does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected.
Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility
analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The Act forbids EPA
to base its actions concerning operating permit programs on such grounds.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Intent to Delete the Northwestern States Portland Cement Company (NWSPCC) Site, Mason City, Iowa from the
National Priorities List: Request for Comments. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Region VII announces its intent to delete the NWSPCC Site, Mason City,
Iowa from the National Priorities List (NPL) and requests public comment on this action. The NPL constitutes appendix
B of 40 CFR part 300 which is the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP), which the
EPA promulgated pursuant to section 105 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability
Act of 1980 (CERCLA), as amended. The reason this action is being taken is that Superfund Remedial Activities have
been completed and no further response is appropriate.

I. Introduction 
II. NPL Deletion Criteria 
III. Deletion Procedures 
IV. Basis for Intended Site Deletions 


I. Introduction 



The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Region VII announces its intent to delete the NWSPCC Site, Mason City,
Iowa, from the National Priorities List (NPL), which constitutes appendix B of the National Oil and Hazardous Substances
Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP), and requests comments on this proposed deletion. The EPA identifies sites that
appear to present a significant risk to public health, welfare, or the environment and maintains the NPL as the list
of those sites. Sites on the NPL may be the subject of remedial actions financed by the Hazardous Substance Response
Fund (Fund). Pursuant to  300.425(e)(3) of the National Contingency Plan (NCP), any site deleted from the NPL
remains eligible for Fund-financed remedial actions if conditions at the site warrant such action. 


The EPA will accept comments on this site for thirty days after the publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

. 


Section II of this notice explains the criteria for deleting sites from the NPL. Section III discusses the procedures
that the EPA is using for this action. Section IV discusses how the site meets the deletion criteria. 




II. NPL Deletion Criteria 




The NCP establishes the criteria that EPA uses to delete sites from the NPL. In accordance with 40 CFR 300.425(e), sites
may be deleted from the NPL where no further response is appropriate. In making this determination, EPA, in consultation
with the State, will consider whether any of the following criteria have been met: 


(i) That responsible parties or other persons have implemented all appropriate response actions required; or 

 
(ii) All appropriate Fund-financed responses under CERCLA have been implemented and no further response action
by responsible parties is appropriate; or 

(iii) The remedial investigation has shown that the release poses no significant threat to public health or the environment
and, therefore, taking of remedial measures is not appropriate. 


Section 300.425(e)(2) of the NCP requires State concurrence before deleting a site from the NPL. 



Deletion of sites from the NPL does not itself create, alter, or revoke any individuals rights or obligations. The
NPL is designed primarily for informational purposes and to assist Agency management. As is mentioned in Section
II of this document,  300.425(e)(3) of the NCP makes clear that deletion of a site from the NPL does not preclude
eligibility for future Fund-financed response actions. 




III. Deletion Procedures 




The EPA Region VII will accept and evaluate public comments before making the final decision to delete the site from
the NPL. The Agency believes that deletion procedures should focus on notice and comment at the local level. Comments
from the local 
community are likely to be the most pertinent to deletion decisions. The following procedures were used for the intended
deletion of the site. 


1. The EPA Region VII has recommended the deletion and prepared the relevant documents. 


2. The State of Iowa has concurred with the deletion decision. 


3. Concurrent with this National Notice of Intent to Delete a notice has been published in local and community newspapers
and has been distributed to appropriate federal, state, and local officials and other interested parties. This notice
announces a thirty (30) day public comment period on the deletion package, which starts November 3, 1994, and which
will conclude on December 5, 1994. 

4. The Region has made all relevant documents available in the Regional Office and local site information repository.



The comments received during the notice and comment period will be evaluated before the final decision to delete is
made. The Region will prepare a Responsiveness Summary, if necessary, which will address any comments received during
the public comment period.

A deletion will occur after the Regional Administrator places a notice in the 

Federal Register

. The NPL will reflect any deletions in the next final update. Public notices and copies of the Responsiveness Summary
will be made available to local residents by Region VII. 



IV. Basis for Intended Site Deletion 



The following summary provides the Agency's rationale for recommending deletion of the Northwestern States Portland
Cement Company Site, Mason City, Iowa, from the NPL. 

Northwestern States Portland Cement Company (NWSPCC), owns and operates a cement manufacturing facility on the
north side of Mason City, Iowa. The facility has been in operation since 1908. A byproduct of the cement manufacturing
process since 1969 is cement kiln dust (CKD). The West Quarry site (Site) is a quarry covering approximately 150 acres
to a depth of 40 feet of which approximately 110 acres were filled with CKD during the period of 1969-1985. 

A pH monitoring program of the water in the West Quarry was started in April of 1974 in response to a change in color of
the Quarry water. The Quarry water pH rose sharply following January 1976, increased to 11.8 in April 1976, and leveled
off at about 12.5 in 1980. The increase in pH is attributed to the breakdown of the natural buffering system which was
sustaining the Quarry water at a near-neutral pH. In response to Quarry dewatering initiated in 1987, current pH levels
are about 10.5. 

In 1979, two seeps emerged from the northeastern portion of the filled West Quarry. High pH water from the seeps flowed
overland to Calmus Creek. In 1984, the state initiated a study of Calmus Creek and found pH in the creek elevated 2.0
pH units downstream of the seep area. In April 1985, the state ordered NWSPCC to immediately cease discharge from the
seep area to Calmus Creek. NWSPCC was also ordered to cease kiln dust disposal in the Quarry and to conduct a hydrogeologic
investigation. 

In 1989, the state did a follow-up stream survey of Calmus Creek. The 1989 study concluded that there had been no improvement
in water quality since the 1984 study. Conclusions from the 1989 study suggested that runoff from the haul roads and
storage areas was contributing to the water quality degradation. 

In 1992, a Calmus Creek stream study was done to meet requirements of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
permit issued by Iowa Department of National Resources. The results of this study suggested water quality had improved
with pH dropping from 10.2 in earlier studies to 7.9. The study attributed this improvement to elimination of runoff
from the site and the installation of the groundwater extraction/treatment system installed in 1985. 

In 1987, EPA conducted a Site Inspection of the NWSPCC Site and, based on the findings of this investigation, the Site
was scored with the Hazard Ranking System (HRS) for possible inclusion on the National Priorities List (NPL). Based
on the site characterization completed under the direction of EPA, an HRS package for the Site resulted in a score of
57.80. This score was based on the impact to groundwater and direct human contact. The Site was proposed for the National
Priority List (NPL), in June of 1988 (53 FR 23988). The Site was added to the NPL in August of 1990 (55 FR 35501). 



The RI/FS field work and data collection activities began in August 1988 with the final report submitted in March 1990.
The investigation demonstrated that significant impact to groundwater outside the Site boundaries had not occurred.


The U. S. Public Health Service Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), conducted a draft Health
Assessment for the NWSPCC Site. They concluded that the Site is of potential health concern because of the potential
risk to human health resulting from possible exposure to hazardous substances at concentrations that may result
in adverse health effects. 

A final Record of Decision (ROD), was executed in June 1990 by the EPA with concurrence by IDNR. The selected response
action addressed the principal threats of surface water and groundwater contamination and the source of contamination_the
cement kiln dust. The selected remedy consisted of the following actions. 

 Dewatering of the Site which contained high pH water, acid-neutralization and discharge to Calmus Creek.


 Construction of a permanent drain system in the dewatered Site to collect precipitation runoff and groundwater
inflow to the quarry. 

 Placement of an engineered clay cap over the area of the Site filled with cement kiln dust to minimize infiltration
through the kiln dust. 

 Installation of bedrock dewatering wells to collect contaminated groundwater beneath the Site, prevent
migration of contaminated groundwater from the Site and maintain groundwater levels below the kiln dust. 

 Treatment of contaminated water to meet IDNR/NPDES discharge permit limits with discharge to Calmus Creek.


 Assurances that the dewatering system will be operated in perpetuity to maintain isolation of water from the
waste kiln dust and collect and treat any contaminated water which is generated. 

A Consent Decree was signed in June 1990 which outlined the performance criteria to be met by implementing the approved
remedial action alternative as well as the reporting and scheduling requirements of the remedial design and construction
activities. The final Remedial Design and Remedial Action Work Plans were completed in June 1992. 

The EPA in consultation with the State of Iowa, has determined that all fund-financed response activities under CERCLA
at the NWSPCC Site, Mason City, Iowa, have been completed and that no further response is necessary. Therefore, it
is proposed to delete the Site from the NPL.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Advance notice of proposed rulemaking. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of the Interior is initiating a biennial review of the regulations for assessing natural resource
damages resulting from a discharge of oil into navigable waters under the Clean Water Act or a release of a hazardous
substance under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. The regulations provide
procedures that Federal, State, and Indian tribe natural resource trustees may use to obtain compensation from potentially
responsible parties for injuries to natural resources. The regulations provide an administrative process for conducting
assessments as well as two types of technical procedures for the actual determination of injuries and damages. ``Type
A'' procedures are standard procedures for simplified assessments requiring minimal field observation in cases
of minor discharges or releases in certain environments. ``Type B'' procedures are site-specific procedures for
detailed assessments in other cases. This advance notice solicits comment on how the administrative process and
all but one of the type B procedures should be revised.

D. Legal Topics 
E. Restoration, Rehabilitation, Replacement, and/or Acquisition of Equivalent Resources 


I. Statutory Provisions 


This notice announces the commencement of a review of regulations for assessing natural resource damages under the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq.) (CERCLA)
and the Clean Water Act, as amended (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) (CWA). Under CERCLA, certain categories of potentially
responsible parties (PRPs) are liable for natural resource damages resulting from a release of a hazardous substance.
CERCLA sec. 107(a). Natural resource damages are monetary compensation for injury to, destruction of, or loss of
natural resources. CERCLA sec. 107(a)(4)(C). CWA creates similar liability for natural resource damages resulting
from discharges of oil into navigable waters. CWA sec. 311(f). 
Only designated natural resource trustees may recover natural resource damages. CWA recognizes the authority of
Federal and State officials to serve as natural resource trustees. CERCLA recognizes the authority of Federal and
State officials as well as Indian tribes to act as natural resource trustees. CERCLA defines ``State'' to include:

 

The District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the United States Virgin Islands,
the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas, and any other territory or possession over which the United States has
jurisdiction. CERCLA sec. 101(27).

 

Damages may be recovered for those natural resource injuries that are not fully remedied by response actions as well
as public economic values lost from the date of the discharge or release until the resources have fully recovered.
All sums recovered in compensation for natural resource injuries must be used to restore, rehabilitate, replace,
or acquire the equivalent of the injured natural resources. CERCLA sec. 107(f)(1). Trustee officials may also recover
the reasonable costs of assessing natural resource damages. 
CERCLA requires the promulgation of regulations for the assessment of natural resource damages resulting either
from a discharge of oil into navigable waters under CWA or from a release of a hazardous substance under CERCLA. CERCLA
sec. 301(c)(1). These regulations are to identify the ``best available'' procedures for assessing natural resource
damages. CERCLA sec. 301(c)(2). CERCLA requires that the natural resource damage assessment regulations include
two types of assessment procedures. ``Type A'' procedures are ``standard procedures for simplified assessments
requiring minimal field observation.'' CERCLA sec. 301(c)(2)(A). ``Type B'' procedures are ``alternative protocols
for conducting assessments in individual cases.'' CERCLA sec. 301(c)(2)(B). Assessments performed by Federal
and State trustee officials in accordance with the natural resource damage assessment regulations receive a rebuttable
presumption in court. CERCLA sec. 107(f)(2)(C). The promulgation of these regulations was delegated to the Department
of the Interior (the Department). E.O. 12316, as amended by E.O. 12580. 
The natural resource damage provisions of CWA were amended by the Oil Pollution Act (33 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.) (OPA).
The authority to sue for natural resource damages resulting from discharges of oil into navigable waters was extended
to not only Federal and State natural resource trustees but also Indian tribe and foreign natural resource trustees.
OPA also authorized the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to develop new natural resource
damage assessment regulations for discharges of oil into navigable waters. The Department is coordinating its rulemakings
with NOAA to ensure, to the maximum extent appropriate, that consistent processes are established for assessing
natural resource damages under CERCLA and OPA. 
OPA provides that any rule in effect under a law replaced by OPA will continue in effect until superseded. OPA sec. 6001(b).
In particular, Senate committee report language makes it clear that ``[t]he existing Interior Department rules
* * * may be used with a rebuttable presumption in the interim'' until NOAA promulgates new regulations.
S. Rep. No. 101-94, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. 15 (1990). Therefore, until NOAA promulgates its regulations, the
Department's regulations may be used to obtain a rebuttable presumption for natural resource damage assessments
under OPA. 
The Department's natural resource damage assessment regulations must be reviewed, and revised as appropriate,
every two years. CERCLA sec. 301(c)(3). The regulations provide an administrative process for conducting assessments
as well as technical type A and type B procedures for the actual determination of injuries and damages. The purpose
of this advance notice is to announce the beginning of the biennial review of the administrative process and all but
one of the type B procedures. 


II. Overview of the Department's Natural Resource Damage Assessment Regulations 


The Department has published various final rules for the assessment of natural resource damages: 51 FR 27674 (Aug.
1, 1986); 52 FR 9042 (March 20, 1987); 53 FR 5166 (Feb. 22, 1988); and 53 FR 9769 (March 25, 1988). These rulemakings are
codified in the Code of Federal Regulations at 43 CFR part 11. The Department also recently published a final rule revising
the administrative process and the type B procedures that has not yet been codified in the Code of Federal Regulations.
59 FR 14261 (March 25, 1994). 
The Department's natural resource damage assessment regulations provide an administrative process for conducting
assessments. The administrative process consists of four phases: The Preassessment Phase, the Assessment Plan
Phase, the Assessment Phase, and the Post-Assessment Phase. The regulations also provide technical type A and type
B procedures to be used during the Assessment Phase for the actual determination of injuries and damages. 
During this biennial review, the Department intends to examine all aspects of the Preassessment Phase, Assessment
Plan Phase, and Post-Assessment Phase, as well as all but one of the type B procedures available for use during the Assessment
Phase. The Department is providing the following brief summary of its existing regulations to assist commenters.
Commenters should consult 43 CFR part 11 and 59 FR 14261 to obtain more detailed information about the administrative
process and type B procedures. 


A. Preassessment Phase 


The Preassessment Phase covers the activities that precede the actual assessment. Upon detecting or receiving notification
of a discharge or release, trustee officials decide whether further assessment actions are warranted. The Department's
regulations provide a number of criteria to assist trustee officials in making this decision. The trustee officials'
decision is documented in the Preassessment Screen Determination. For more information on the Preassessment Phase,
see subpart B of 43 CFR part 11, as amended by 59 FR 14281. 


B. Assessment Plan Phase

If trustee officials decide during the Preassessment Phase that the criteria for continuing an assessment have been
met, they then enter the Assessment Plan Phase. The Assessment Plan Phase includes various notification and coordination
activities. The Department's regulations provide guidance on coordination among trustee officials, including
selection of a ``lead authorized official'' to act as an administrative point of contact. Trustee officials are also
required to notify the PRPs of their intent to perform an assessment. 
During the Assessment Plan Phase, trustee officials also prepare a written Assessment Plan describing the procedures,
type A, type B, or both, that will be used to determine injury and damages. The Assessment Plan is designed to focus and
organize the assessment, which helps ensure that only reasonable assessment costs are incurred. The Assessment
Plan is subject to public review and comment. For more information on the Assessment Plan Phase, see subpart C of 43
CFR part 11, as amended by 59 FR 14281-83. 


C. Assessment Phase 


During the Assessment Phase, the work described in the Assessment Plan is conducted. The work consists of three steps:
Injury Determination; Quantification; and Damage Determination. In Injury Determination, trustee officials
determine whether any natural resources have been injured and whether there is a pathway of exposure between the site
of the discharge or release and the injured resources. If trustee officials determine that resources have been injured
and that a pathway of exposure exists, they proceed to the Quantification step. 
During Quantification, trustee officials quantify the extent of the resource injuries by measuring the reduction
from baseline conditions. ``Baseline'' conditions are the conditions that would have existed had the discharge
or release not occurred. Resources perform functions for humans and for other resources, such as provision of a food
source, flood control, or provision of recreational opportunities. These functions are known as ``services.''
Reductions from baseline conditions can be measured by evaluating the change in the level of services provided by
the injured resources. 
Finally, in Damage Determination, trustee officials calculate the monetary compensation to be sought as damages
for the quantified natural resource injuries. The basic measure of damages is the cost of restoring, rehabilitating,
replacing, and/or acquiring the equivalent of the injured resources. The Department's regulations also allow for
an additional component of damages. Trustee officials have the discretion to assess damages for the economic value
of the services lost by the public from the date of the discharge or release until completion of restoration, rehabilitation,
replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources. 
This value is known as ``compensable value.'' 
When a type A procedure is utilized, trustee officials perform Injury Determination, Quantification, and Damage
Determination through the use of a standardized procedure involving minimal field work. The Department is developing
different type A procedures for different environments in stages. Only one type A procedure has been included in the
regulations to date. That type A procedure incorporates a computer model to perform Injury Determination, Quantification,
and Damage Determination for minor discharges or releases in coastal or marine environments. The computer model
is known as the Natural Resource Damage Assessment Model for Coastal and Marine Environments (NRDAM/CME). For more
information on use of a type A procedure during the Assessment Phase, see subpart D of 43 CFR part 11. There are two ongoing
rulemakings concerning type A procedures. The Department is revising the NRDAM/CME in compliance with a court order
and the statutory biennial review requirement. The Department is also developing a new type A computer model for use
in Great Lakes environments. Therefore, the Department does not intend to address the content of the type A procedures
during this review. 
When a type A procedure is not applicable, trustee officials use type B procedures instead of a type A procedure. In
some cases, trustee officials may also use type B procedures to supplement damages calculated through use of an applicable
type A procedure. When type B procedures are utilized, trustee officials perform Injury Determination, Quantification,
and Damage Determination through the use of site-specific studies. The Department's regulations divide natural
resources into five categories: surface water, ground water, air, geologic, and biological resources. Specific
definitions of injury are provided for each of these categories. The regulations provide guidance on the selection
of testing and sampling methodologies to determine whether an injury has occurred and whether a pathway of exposure
exists. The regulations also provide guidance on measuring the change in baseline conditions during Quantification.

During the Damage Determination step of an assessment incorporating type B procedures, trustee officials identify
and consider a reasonable number of possible alternatives for restoring, rehabilitating, replacing, and/or acquiring
the equivalent of the injured resources. Trustee officials select one of the possible alternatives based on several
factors. The trustee officials document their decisions in a Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan,
which is part of the overall Assessment Plan and, thus, subject to public review and comment. 
Once trustee officials have selected a restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition alternative,
they select one or more of the type B cost-estimating methodologies listed in the regulations. The selected methodologies
are used to estimate the cost of implementing the restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition
alternative. This estimated cost is the basic measure of damages. Trustee officials also have the discretion to include
compensable value in their damage claim. Compensable value is calculated by applying one or more of the type B economic
valuation methodologies listed in the regulations. For more information on use of type B procedures during the Assessment
Phase, see subpart E of 43 CFR part 11, as amended by 59 FR 14283-87. 


D. Post-Assessment Phase 


The Department's regulations cover the entire process that trustee officials need to follow if they file a lawsuit
and expect to obtain a rebuttable presumption. Trustee officials have the authority to settle their damage claims
at any time during the administrative process. However, if the trustee officials do not settle with the PRPs by the
end of the Assessment Phase, then trustee officials prepare a Report of Assessment detailing the results of the Assessment
Phase. Trustee officials present the Report of Assessment to the PRPs along with a demand for damages and assessment
costs. If a PRP does not agree to pay within 60 days, the trustee officials may file suit. Federal and State trustee officials
receive a rebuttable presumption of correctness for assessments performed in accordance with the Preassessment
Phase, Assessment Plan Phase, Assessment Phase, and Post-Assessment Phase procedures set forth in the regulations.

Once damages have been awarded or settlement has been reached, trustee officials establish an account for the recovered
damages and prepare a Restoration Plan for use of the funds. When type B procedures are used, the post-assessment Restoration
Plan is based on the restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition alternative selected in the
Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan during the Assessment Phase. For more information on the Post-Assessment
Phase, see subpart F of 43 CFR part 11, as amended by 59 FR 14287. 


III. Related Rulemakings 


There are several ongoing natural resource damage assessment rulemakings other than this biennial review. 

State of Ohio 

v. 

United States Department of the Interior (Ohio 

v. 

Interior

) remanded portions of the administrative process and the type B procedures. 880 F.2d 432 (D.C. Cir. 1989). On March
25, 1994, the Department published a final rule that addressed all but one aspect of the remand. 59 FR 14261. The March
25, 1994, final rule did not address the assessment of lost nonuse values. 
There are two potential types of compensable values associated with natural resource injuries: Lost use values and
lost nonuse values. Use values are derived through activities such as hiking or fishing. Nonuse values are not dependent
on use of a resource and include the value of knowing that the resource exists and knowing that a resource will be available
for future generations. The only method available for the express purpose of estimating lost nonuse values is the
contingent valuation methodology (CV). On May 4, 1994, the Department published a notice of proposed rulemaking
addressing CV as a type B procedure for estimating lost nonuse values. 59 FR 23097. The comment period on the notice
closed on October 7, 1994. 59 FR 32175 (June 22, 1994). The Department does not intend to address the assessment of lost
nonuse values during this review. 


State of Colorado 

v. 

United States Department of the Interior

 remanded the type A procedure for coastal and marine environments. 880 F.2d 481 (D.C. Cir. 1989). The Department intends
to publish a proposed rule to revise the NRDAM/CME later this month. 
The Department has begun the development of an additional type A procedure for use in Great Lakes environments. This
type A procedure uses a computer model known as the Natural Resource Damage Assessment Model for Great Lakes Environments
(NRDAM/GLE). The Department published a proposed rule on August 8, 1994. 59 FR 40319. The Department does not intend
to address the content of the type A procedures during this biennial review.

Also, on January 7, 1994, NOAA published a proposed rule for assessing natural resource damages resulting from oil
discharges into navigable waters under OPA. 59 FR 1062. The comment period on NOAA's proposed rule closed on October
7, 1994. 59 FR 32148 (June 22, 1994). 



IV. Potential Topics for Review 



During this rulemaking, the Department will be considering ways of revising the administrative process and the type
B procedures to reflect both experience to date in the use of the regulations as well as scientific and technical advances.
The Department solicits comment on all aspects of the administrative process and the type B procedures, other than
the assessment of lost nonuse values. Based on the comments received and its own analysis, the Department will develop
a proposed rule to revise the regulations. 

The Department has already received numerous comments on the administrative process and type B procedures over the
last few years. One source of comments has been State briefings on use of the regulations. The Department has provided
these briefings to State trustee officials at their request. Another source of comments has been telephone calls
from individuals requesting technical assistance in the application of the regulations to particular cases. Also,
in the course of revising the regulations to comply with 

Ohio 

v. 

Interior,

 the Department received numerous comments that were beyond the scope of that rulemaking. As indicated during the


Ohio 

v. 

Interior 

rulemaking, the Department has included a discussion of all of those comments in this notice. See 59 FR 14266. 

The following discussion is intended neither as an exhaustive treatment of all possible topics for review nor as a
definitive indication of the Department's position. Instead, the discussion is simply provided as an aid in generating
further information and analysis. Commenters are encouraged to provide comments not only on the topics discussed
in this notice but also on any other topics relating to the administrative process or type B procedures that they deem
appropriate. 

During this biennial review, the Department will also examine the relationship between its CERCLA damage assessment
regulations and the OPA damage assessment regulations being developed by NOAA. The Department will consider ways
of clarifying the applicability of its regulations versus NOAA's regulations. In this regard, the Department solicits
comment on what provisions, if any, its regulations should continue to make for assessing damages from oil discharges.
The Department will also coordinate with NOAA to ensure the greatest consistency appropriate between the two sets
of regulations. The Department has noted in the following discussion certain areas where NOAA has proposed an approach
that differs from that currently taken in the Department's regulations. The Department solicits comment on whether
the Department's regulations should be revised to follow the approach proposed by NOAA in areas of difference. 



A. Administrative Process 



1. Streamlining 



One frequent comment has been that the Department's regulations are ``too wordy'' and ``not in plain English.'' Many
commenters have indicated that the administrative process is too complicated and needs to be streamlined. NOAA's
proposed OPA rule provides for an ``Expedited Damage Assessment'' based on ``limited, focused studies in order to
facilitate restoration as soon as possible.'' 59 FR 1177. 

Given the wide variety of activities involved in assessing damages, the number of legal, scientific, and economic
issues involved in damage assessments, and the broad range of possible types of natural resource damage cases, a certain
level of intricacy is unavoidable in the regulations. However, the administrative process and type B procedures
were designed to provide trustee officials with the flexibility to tailor the scope and level of detail of an assessment
to meet the needs of the particular case. Trustee officials choose from a menu of available type B procedures, using
only those procedures and assessing only those injuries and losses that they deem appropriate and adjusting the level
of documentation accordingly. The regulations allow both for the performance of a limited number of short-term studies
in a simple case involving the release of a single substance affecting a single resource, as well as the performance
of numerous, long-term studies in a complex case of a release of multiple substances affecting multiple resources.


Nevertheless, the Department aims to make the regulations as clear and straightforward as possible. Therefore,
the Department solicits comment on specific aspects of the administrative process that commenters consider unduly
burdensome or complicated. 



2. Preassessment Phase 



Several commenters requested additional guidance on the conduct of preassessment activities. NOAA has developed
a draft guidance document on preassessment activities under OPA. See 59 FR 1065. 

The Department's regulations already contain some guidance on preassessment activities. See 43 CFR   11.20-11.25.
The Department notes that developing guidance requires balancing increased predictability against reduced flexibility
to respond to the unique features of the broad range of potential natural resource damage cases. Thus, there is a limit
to the level of specificity that can be appropriately provided in the regulations. With this in mind, the Department
solicits comment on specific aspects of the Preassessment Phase that warrant additional guidance. The Department
also solicits comment on whether the guidance should be incorporated in the regulations or in a separate guidance
document. 

Some commenters questioned whether a preassessment screen should be required when a type A procedure is used. During
the preassessment screen, trustee officials determine whether the discharge or release is covered by CWA or CERCLA
and whether they have a reasonable probability of making a successful claim before expending efforts to carry out
a damage assessment. See 43 CFR 11.23(b). This determination appears to be relevant regardless of the substantive
assessment methods ultimately used. Moreover, the determination whether to use a type A procedure, type B procedures,
or both is not made until the Assessment Plan Phase, which follows the performance of the preassessment screen. See
43 CFR 11.33. The Department solicits comment on ways to reduce the burden of the preassessment screen while at the
same time ensuring that trustee officials adequately consider the appropriateness of pursuing a damage claim before
proceeding with either a type A procedure, type B procedures, or both. 



3. Coordination With Other Agencies 



A number of commenters requested additional guidance on coordination among trustee agencies and between trustee
agencies and response agencies. Commenters raised questions about the lead authorized official. Some commenters
sought clarification of the role of the lead authorized official. Others requested a prohibition against the designation
of a trustee official who is also a PRP as lead authorized official. 

Suggestions for improved coordination between trustee and response activities included: restricting the time
allowed to conduct an assessment in order to avoid potential conflicts with settlement negotiations between response
agencies and PRPs; requiring trustee officials to participate in the remedial planning process; requiring response
agencies to coordinate with trustee officials; and authorizing the On-Scene Coordinator to contact just one Federal
trustee agency and one State trustee agency and requiring that the contacted trustee agencies notify all other trustee
agencies. 

The Department's regulations already provide some guidance on trustee coordination. See 43 CFR 11.32(a)(1). The
regulations also include discussions of coordination with response agencies. 43 CFR 11.23(f) and 11.31(a)(3).
The Department intends to take a close look at these coordination provisions during the biennial review. The Department
encourages commenters to provide suggestions on ways of improving coordination among trustee agencies and between
trustee and response activities. 

NOAA's proposed OPA rule includes a model memorandum of understanding designed to facilitate trustee coordination.
See 59 FR 1185. Several States have been working to ensure better interagency coordination. Also, as part of the recent
National Performance Review designed to streamline government operations, the Department developed a number of
recommendations concerning the improvement of trustee coordination for natural resource damage assessments.
The Department intends to examine these efforts to see what lessons can be learned. 



4. Public and PRP Participation 



Several commenters voiced opinions about the opportunity for public and PRP participation in the assessment process.
Some commenters thought that additional opportunities for public input were necessary while others stated that
the existing opportunities for public participation were excessive. Several commenters thought that the Department
should encourage earlier involvement of PRPs in assessments to avoid duplication of effort. NOAA's proposed OPA
rule includes a model memorandum of understanding for trustee officials and PRPs to use when conducting joint assessments.
59 FR 1187. 

With regard to public participation, the Department's regulations require that the public be given an opportunity
to review and comment on the Assessment Plan, including the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan, as
well as the post-assessment Restoration Plan. See 43 CFR 11.32(c), 11.81(d)(2), and 11.93(a), as amended by 59 FR
14283, and 14287.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941019-1-00065 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941019-1-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

With regard to PRP participation, the Department's regulations require that trustee officials provide PRPs with
a Notice of Intent to Perform an Assessment before beginning an assessment and invite the participation of the PRPs.
See 43 CFR 11.32(a)(2), as amended by 59 FR 14282. Trustee officials are also required to make the Assessment Plan available
to PRPs for review and comment. See 43 CFR 11.32(c). Finally, trustee officials are authorized to allow PRPs to perform
assessment work. See 43 CFR 11.32(d). 

Determining the appropriate level of public and PRP participation in the natural resource damage assessment process
requires balancing the interests of the public, the PRPs, and the trustee officials. The Department solicits comment
on whether the regulations strike the appropriate balance and, if not, how the regulations could be revised to strike
a more appropriate balance. 



5. Optional Nature of Regulations 




The Department's regulations are not mandatory but must be followed in order to obtain a rebuttable presumption.
43 CFR 11.10. Some commenters have questioned the decision to make the regulations optional. For example, one commenter
suggested that Federal trustee agencies be required to use the regulations unless all affected trustees agree otherwise.
The Department solicits additional comment on whether to require trustee officials to use the regulations when they
pursue a claim for natural resource damages under CERCLA. 



6. Settlement Procedures 



Several commenters have requested that the regulations address settlement procedures. For example, when trustee
officials use type B procedures, they must develop a preliminary estimate of damages to help scope the range of work
appropriate during the Assessment Phase. See 43 CFR 11.35(a), as amended by 59 FR 14282. Some commenters have suggested
that trustee officials be encouraged to use the preliminary estimate of damages to initiate settlement discussions.
Other commenters have suggested that trustee officials be encouraged to perform separate assessments for each affected
resource to facilitate settlement. NOAA's proposed OPA rule includes guidance on settlement procedures. 59 FR 1171.


The Department strongly supports and encourages the use of the regulations as a framework for negotiated resolutions
of natural resource damage claims. The Department is concerned that establishment of specific settlement procedures
in the regulations might unduly restrict the flexibility of negotiating parties. However, the Department solicits
comment on the need for and possible nature of settlement guidance. 



7. Assessment Plan 



There have been several comments about the Assessment Plan. The regulations require trustee officials to develop
a quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) plan that satisfies the requirements listed in guidance developed
by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), if that guidance is applicable. See 43 CFR 11.31(c)(2), as amended
by 59 FR 14281. Some commenters thought that the reference to EPA guidance was inappropriate. 


The Department notes that EPA's QA/QC guidance is a well-established standard. Moreover, the Department's regulations
provide that EPA guidance need only be followed if applicable. The Department solicits comment on specific areas
of concern with EPA's QA/QC guidance. 

Some commenters questioned whether the requirement that the Assessment Plan include information on sampling size,
design, and location and estimated recovery period was necessary. One commenter stated that the Assessment Plan
should include a summary of the nature and extent of contamination to ensure that the approach used to assess damages
is commensurate with the potential impact on resources. 

The purpose of the Assessment Plan is to provide the public with a description of, and to organize, the work that will
be performed during the Assessment Phase. Inclusion of information about sampling size, design, and location and
estimated recovery periods seems appropriate to fulfill that purpose. On the other hand, since a natural resource
damage assessment focuses on the actual injuries to resources rather than the level of chemical present, inclusion
of information about the nature and extent of contamination may not be essential. However, the Department solicits
additional comment on the appropriate scope and level of detail of the Assessment Plan. 

Several commenters stated that the Department should take precautions to ensure that trustee officials do not undertake
basic research when performing damage assessments. These commenters suggested that the Department provide a list
of sources of existing scientific data and prohibit trustee officials from performing new research unless there
are no existing data regarding the effect of the particular substance on the particular natural resources involved.


The Department agrees that trustee officials should not undertake unnecessary basic research and one of the purposes
of requiring a publicly available Assessment Plan is to protect against such research. A master list of existing data
sources across the full range of potentially affected resources would be costly and time-consuming to compile, virtually
impossible to keep up to date, and might also stifle development of new approaches. However, the Department solicits
comment on alternative ways of guarding against the performance of unnecessary basic research. 



8. Post-Assessment Phase 



Several commenters sought additional guidance on post-assessment activities. The Department's regulations already
provide some guidance on post-assessment activities. See 43 CFR 11.90-11.93, as amended by 59 FR 14287. The
Department notes that developing guidance requires balancing increased predictability against reduced flexibility
to respond to the unique features of the broad range of potential natural resource damage cases. Thus, there is a limit
to the level of specificity that can be appropriately provided in the regulations. With this in mind, the Department
solicits comment on specific aspects of the Post-assessment Phase that warrant additional guidance. The Department
also solicits comment on whether the guidance should be incorporated in the regulations or in a separate guidance
document. 

Commenters have sought additional clarification of the requirements related to the establishment of a restoration
account for recovered damages. One commenter thought that the regulations should require trustee officials to hold
any collected damages in interest-bearing accounts. Other commenters have asked whether joint damage recoveries
by co-trustee agencies can be placed in a single restoration account. Trustee officials' authority to open various
forms of accounts is determined by applicable Federal, State, and tribal fiscal law. Therefore, although nothing
in the Department's regulations prevents trustee officials from placing damage recoveries in an interest-bearing
account, the regulations do not require trustee officials to do so. Instead, the regulations provide that when trustee
officials do not have the authority to place damage recoveries in an interest-bearing account, they should adjust
their damage claim to account for inflation. 43 CFR 11.92(b), as amended by 59 FR 14287. Also, the regulations neither
prohibit nor require the opening of joint accounts. The Department solicits comment on whether additional clarification
of the appropriate form of restoration accounts should be provided. 



9. Assessment Costs 



Many commenters sought additional clarification on the scope of recoverable assessment costs. CERCLA provides
that trustee officials may only recover ``reasonable'' assessment costs. CERCLA sec. 107(f)(1). The Department's
regulations include a definition of ``reasonable cost.'' See 43 CFR 11.14(ee). Among other things, this definition
requires that the anticipated cost of the assessment be expected to be less than the anticipated damage amount. Some
commenters have stated that this definition should be revised so that the reasonableness of assessment costs is determined
by comparing the cost of each component of the assessment to the anticipated damages to be determined by that component.
NOAA's proposed OPA rule defines ``reasonable cost of an assessment'' as those costs incurred in performing an assessment
in accordance with the OPA rule. 59 FR 1169. The Department solicits comment on whether any revision of its definition
of ``reasonable cost'' is appropriate. 




</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941019-1-00066 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941019-1-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Department's regulations provide that trustee officials may recover the ``reasonable and necessary'' costs
of an assessment. See 43 CFR 11.15(a)(3)(ii), as amended by 59 FR 14281. Some commenters have questioned whether this
provision would require trustee officials to demonstrate not only that their assessment costs were reasonable but
also that they were necessary. These commenters noted that CERCLA merely requires trustee officials to demonstrate
that their assessment costs were reasonable. 
The reference to ``necessary'' assessment costs was not intended to require trustee officials to make an additional
demonstration beyond that required by CERCLA. Therefore, the Department is considering deleting the reference
to ``necessary'' assessment costs. 
The Department's regulations provide examples of recoverable assessment costs. See 43 CFR 11.15(a)(3)(ii), as
amended by 59 FR 14281. Some commenters have suggested that the regulations be amended to include a list of specific
practices that would render assessment costs unreasonable. The Department questions whether addition of such a
list would be workable or necessary. 
Several commenters questioned whether attorneys' fees were recoverable assessment costs. The Department believes
that trustee officials will generally need the assistance of an interdisciplinary team of experts when performing
natural resource damage assessments. The regulations do not restrict recoverable assessment costs to the expenses
of particular types of professionals. The Department's regulations provide that recoverable assessment costs
are ``limited to those costs incurred or anticipated by the authorized official for, and specifically allocable
to, site-specific efforts taken in the assessment of damages.'' 43 CFR 11.60(d)(2). Therefore, if attorneys are
involved in work specifically allocable to an assessment, the resulting attorneys' fees are recoverable as assessment
costs under the regulations. The Department solicits comment on whether additional guidance on the recoverability
of attorneys' fees is warranted. 



B. Injury 


Some commenters have indicated that the injury definitions contained in the Department's regulations should be
relaxed. Several commenters thought that trustee officials should be allowed to document injury by measuring the
mere presence of the oil or hazardous substance in a natural resource. Other commenters have felt that the Department
should allow injury to be documented through a risk analysis. 
On the other hand, some commenters have advocated the development of more restrictive injury definitions. Several
commenters have contended that trustee officials should be required to link the specific substance found in a natural
resource to that of the discharge or release in question. Other commenters have suggested that injuries should be
limited to lost public uses of the natural resources. 
The regulations establish acceptance criteria for the development of biological injury definitions. 43 CFR 11.62(f)(2).
Some commenters have stated that these criteria should be applied not only when a new injury definition is developed
but also each time trustee officials document incident-specific injuries under existing injury definitions. Others
felt that the acceptance criteria should be applied to each hazardous substance for which a particular biological
injury definition was to apply. 
NOAA has proposed standards for determining injury under OPA that differ from those in the Department's regulations.
See 59 FR 1178-1180. 
The Department intends to carefully examine the type B standards and methods for determining injury during this review.
The Department encourages commenters to provide suggestions on injury determination and quantification. 



C. Economics 


1. Compensable Value 


Several commenters sought clarification on the economic values that are included in compensable value. Some commenters
questioned when lost economic rent constitutes a compensable value. The Department's regulations provide that
compensable value includes ``any economic rent accruing to a private party because the Federal or State agency or
Indian tribe does not charge a fee or price for the use of the resources.'' 43 CFR 11.83(c)(1), as amended by 59 FR 14286.
The Department's regulations also provide that compensable value includes changes in consumer surplus. Some commenters
requested clarification of what constituted consumer surplus. The Department solicits comment on whether the regulations
should provide additional guidance on the assessment of damages for lost economic rent and consumer surplus. 
A couple of commenters stated that compensable value should include not only the value of services lost to humans but
also the value of services lost to other resources as a result of the injuries. Under the Department's regulations,
trustee officials may consider not only the reduction in services to humans but also the reduction in services to other
resources when selecting appropriate restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition measures
and estimating their costs. However, compensable value may be calculated only for the resource services lost to the
public pending completion of restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources.
See 43 CFR 11.83(c)(1), as amended by 59 FR 14286. The Department notes that compensable value does account indirectly
for certain services lost to other resources. For example, compensable value for lost fishing opportunities may
reflect the results of food web losses. If commenters think that additional values should be included in compensable
value, they should specify the values of interest, explain the legal basis for including such values, and provide
specific suggestions on how those values should be measured. 
The Department's regulations provide that in assessments where the scope of economic analysis is at the State level,
only the compensable value to the State should be counted. 43 CFR 11.84(h)(3), as amended by 59 FR 14287. Several commenters
suggested that this provision be revised to allow State trustee officials to assess and recover compensable value
for all individuals, not just those within the State. The Department solicits comment on the appropriate scope of
economic analysis for all trustee officials. 


2. Guidance on Methodologies 


There were numerous requests for additional guidance on implementation of the cost-estimating and valuation methodologies
listed in the regulations. With regard to cost-estimating methodologies, some commenters have stated that the guidance
provided on the incorporation of uncertainty into cost estimates is inadequate. See 43 CFR  11.84(d), as amended
by 59 FR 14286-87. Other commenters requested additional guidance on selection and use of cost-estimating
methodologies. 
With regard to valuation methodologies, commenters raised concerns about the possibility of double counting if
a hedonic pricing methodology is used. One commenter noted that the regulations state, ``When regional travel cost
models exist, they may be used if appropriate.'' 43 CFR 11.83(c)(2)(iv), as amended by 59 FR 14286. This commenter
stated that this statement incorrectly implied that regional cost models were more appropriate than other models.
Another commenter stated that use of the travel cost methodology should not be allowed because the results of a travel
cost model can be skewed by the actions of one unusually avid traveler. 
The Department solicits comment on the need for and possible content of guidance on implementation of cost-estimating
methodologies. The Department also solicits comment on the need for and possible content of guidance on implementation
of methodologies for valuing lost use values. Commenters should restrict their remarks to the calculation of lost
use values, because, as noted above, the Department is addressing the estimation of lost nonuse values in a separate
rulemaking. See 59 FR 23097. 


3. Willingness to Accept 


Several commenters suggested that trustee officials be allowed to calculate compensable value by estimating the
minimum amount of money an individual would require once an injury occurred in order to be as well off as before the injury
occurred (willingness to accept). The Department agrees that, since natural resources are held in trust for the public,
willingness to accept is the correct theoretical measure of compensable value. However, because of the practical
difficulties entailed in reliably measuring willingness to accept, the Department's regulations require the use
of methodologies that measure the amount of money an individual would be willing to pay to prevent a natural resource
injury (willingness to pay). 43 CFR 11.83(c)(2), as amended by 59 FR 14286. The Department solicits comment on whether
reliable methods exist for measuring willingness to accept. The Department also solicits comment on the conditions
under which willingness to accept rather than willingness to pay would, in theory, result in significantly different
estimates of compensable value. 


4. Discount Rate 


The Department's regulations provide that trustee officials should discount the value of future costs and losses
using the discount rate specified in the Office of Management and Budget Circular A-94 (OMB Circular A-94),
dated March 27, 1972, which was ten percent. 43 CFR 11.84(e)(2). OMB Circular A-94 has been revised. The current
version, dated October 29, 1992, indicates that the discount rate for public investment is 7 percent.

The Department is soliciting comment on whether use of a seven percent discount rate (the current value in Circular
A-94) is appropriate or whether trustee officials should be allowed to use a different discount rate. A possible
alternative discount rate for future public losses of natural resources is the consumer rate of time preference,
which is the rate of interest at which an individual would be indifferent between consuming goods now and postponing
consumption to a later date. Interest rates on investments with little or no default risk, such as U.S. Treasury bonds,
provide an estimate of the consumer rate of time preference. The Department solicits comment on whether trustee officials
should be allowed to use a discount rate based on the U.S. Treasury borrowing rate on marketable securities with maturities
comparable to the period over which future losses will occur. Such an approach would be consistent with that proposed
by NOAA under OPA. See 59 FR 1184. Information on U.S. Treasury borrowing rates on marketable securities is provided
in Appendix C of OMB Circular A-94. 



5. Cost-Effectiveness 


The Department's regulations define ``cost-effectiveness'' to mean that ``when two or more activities provide
the same or a similar level of benefits, the least costly activity providing that level of benefits will be selected.''
43 CFR  11.14(j). Commenters have expressed confusion over the difference between cost effectiveness and
maximization of net benefits. Consideration of cost effectiveness involves comparing activities that provide
the same or a similar level of benefits. In contrast, consideration of net benefits can be used to compare activities
that provide substantially different levels of benefits. 
Another commenter stated that the definition of ``cost-effectiveness'' should be changed to delete the reference
to ``similar'' levels of benefits, in order to ensure full restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition
of equivalent resources. 
Use of the phrase ``same or similar'' was not intended to force trustee officials into using methods that produce lower
benefits. Instead, the term merely reflects the fact that in the damage assessment context trustee officials will
often be comparing methods that do not produce exactly the same benefits. 
The Department solicits comment on whether additional clarification is warranted. 



D. Legal Topics 


1. Judicial Review 


One significant area of discussion has been judicial review of damage assessments. CERCLA provides that any determination
or assessment of damages performed ``in accordance with'' the natural resource damage assessment regulations ``shall
have the force and effect of a rebuttable presumption on behalf of the trustee.'' CERCLA sec. 107(f)(2)(C). This provision
is incorporated into the Department's regulations without further clarification. See 43 CFR  11.91(c). Commenters
have asked the Department to define the term ``rebuttable presumption'' and clarify when and to which aspects of the
assessment the rebuttable presumption applies. Some commenters have questioned whether the phrase ``in accordance
with'' the regulations allows trustee officials to obtain a rebuttable presumption for any portion of an assessment
that complies with the regulations or whether it restricts the rebuttable presumption to those assessments that
follow all portions of the regulations. 
The Department's regulations provide both an administrative process for development and review of documentation
as well as a range of alternative methodologies for the actual determination of injuries and damages. The Department
believes that in order to obtain a rebuttable presumption, a trustee official must follow the entire administrative
process set forth in the regulations. If the trustee official has followed the administrative process, the rebuttable
presumption attaches to those components of the damage claim that were calculated through the appropriate use of
any of the methodologies described in the regulations. However, trustee officials are not required to use all of the
listed methodologies in order to obtain a rebuttable presumption. The Department solicits comment on this interpretation
and on whether additional clarification of the effect of the rebuttable presumption is warranted. 
There have been comments about whether judicial review of an assessment should be limited to an administrative record.
Under NOAA's proposed OPA rule, judicial review of assessment costs and estimated costs of restoration, rehabilitation,
replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources would be conducted on an administrative record. 59 FR 1185.
The Department solicits comment on whether a similar provision should be included in its regulations. The Department
also solicits comment on whether judicial review of compensable value should be conducted on an administrative record.



2. Effect of Amendments 


Commenters have expressed confusion over the applicability of amendments of the natural resource damage assessment
regulations to ongoing damage assessments that were started before the amendments became effective. The Department
solicits comment on whether it should clarify that trustee officials are entitled to a rebuttable presumption so
long as their assessments are in accordance with the regulations as they were in effect at the time that the assessments
began. 


3. Limits of Liability

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941019-1-00068 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941019-1-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Some commenters have sought clarification of various statutory limitations on liability, including the ceilings
set forth in section 107(c) of CERCLA and the provision in section 107(f)(1) that excludes natural resource damages
if those damages and the release that caused those damages occurred wholly before the enactment of CERCLA. The Department's
regulations incorporate the statutory limitations on liability but do not provide any clarification of those limitations.
43 CFR 11.15(b) and 11.24(b)(1). The Department will consider the development of additional guidance if commenters
identify specific areas of concern. 



4. Double Recovery 


Some commenters have sought clarification of the prohibition against ``double recovery'' of damages contained
in section 107(f)(1) of CERCLA. The Department's regulations incorporate this prohibition. 43 CFR   11.15(d)
and 11.84(c). Double recovery refers to the recovery of two or more damage amounts to restore, rehabilitate, replace,
and/or acquire the equivalent of the same injured resource or lost service or to compensate for the same lost public
value. The Department will consider the development of additional guidance if commenters identify specific areas
of concern. 



5. Threatened Releases and Discharges 


Another area of discussion has been the recovery of natural resource damages caused by the threat of a release or discharge.
Section 107(a)(4) of CERCLA refers to liability for ``a release or a threatened release.'' However, section 107(a)(4)(C)
refers to damages for injury to, destruction of, or loss of natural resources ``resulting from such a release.'' Also,
section 301(c) of CERCLA authorizes the Department to develop regulations for assessment of ``damages for injury
to, destruction of, or loss of natural resources resulting from a release of oil or a hazardous substance.'' 
The Department's regulations address only damages resulting from an actual release or discharge. NOAA's proposed
rule, relying on section 1002(a) of OPA, would allow for the assessment of diminished use of a resource resulting from
the threat of a discharge. 59 FR 1169. The Department solicits comment on whether CERCLA allows for recovery of damages
resulting from a threatened release and whether the Department's regulations should be revised to allow for the assessment
of damages resulting from a threatened release or discharge. The Department also solicits examples of the types of
damages that might be assessed in the case of a threatened discharge or release. 



6. Archaeological and Cultural Resources 


Several commenters have questioned whether CERCLA authorizes the recovery of damages for injury of archaeological
and cultural resources. The Department believes that ``archaeological'' and ``cultural'' resources do not constitute
``natural resources'' as defined by CERCLA. However, the Department's regulations do permit trustee officials
to include the loss of archaeological and cultural services provided by a natural resource in a natural resource damage
assessment. 


7. Unused Damage Awards 


Some commenters have suggested that the statutory requirement that damages be spent to restore, rehabilitate, replace,
and/or acquire the equivalent of the injured resources dictates that any sums not used in this manner be returned to
the PRPs. The Department's regulations provide that collected damages may only be used to fund actions described
in the Restoration Plan and do not address the disposition of any ``excess'' funds. See 43 CFR 11.92(c). 
The Department notes that CERCLA requires all collected damages to be spent on restoration, rehabilitation, replacement,
and/or acquisition of equivalent resources, which includes mitigation of the public loss of services during the
recovery period. Therefore, all funds should be used for restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition
of equivalent resources. 



8. NEPA 


Several commenters sought clarification of whether the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) applies to assessments
or restorations performed in accordance with the regulations. The Department does not anticipate addressing the
applicability of NEPA in the damage assessment regulations. However, the Department believes that the information
needed for the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan should fulfill the requirements of NEPA, with equivalent
opportunities for public input. Thus if NEPA were applicable to an assessment or restoration activity, the Department
believes that appropriate and timely information would be available. 



9. Consideration of Benefits 


Some commenters stated that the Department's regulations should be revised to require trustee officials to offset
any damages resulting from the discharge or release with any benefits produced by the discharge or release. The Department
solicits additional comment. 



10. Tribal Trustees 


A number of commenters have sought to ensure that the interests of tribal entities are adequately addressed in the
Department's regulations. A number of commenters expressed concern over the treatment of tribal values, including
the values associated with tribal cultural resources. As noted above, the Department believes that ``cultural''
resources, including tribal cultural resources, do not constitute ``natural resources'' as defined by CERCLA.
However, the Department's regulations do permit trustee officials to include the loss of cultural services provided
by a natural resource in a natural resource damage assessment. 
Other commenters suggested that the Department's fiduciary responsibility to Indian tribes extends to financing
natural resource damage assessments involving tribal resources. Although the Department exercises a fiduciary
responsibility as trustee for Indian resources, the Department believes that discussion of funding mechanisms
for damage assessment activities conducted by Indian tribes is not appropriate for this rulemaking, except as addressed
in the law and regulation regarding the liability of PRPs and use of recovered sums. 
One commenter stated that CERCLA grants a rebuttable presumption to assessments performed by tribal trustee officials.
This commenter stated that when CERCLA was amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA), Congress
intended to grant tribes the same authority as States in the area of natural resource trustee activities. The commenter
further noted that under established case law concerning the Federal government's fiduciary responsibility to
tribes, any ambiguity in the statute concerning tribes' right to the rebuttable presumption must be construed in
favor of the tribes. 
The Department notes that the regulations were revised in 1988 to reflect the SARA amendment to CERCLA granting a rebuttable
presumption to natural resource damage assessments performed by State trustee officials. See 43 CFR 11.91(c). At
that time and in subsequent 

Federal Register

 notices, the Department has taken the position that SARA did not extend the rebuttable presumption to assessments
performed by tribal trustee officials and that granting a rebuttable presumption to tribes will require a legislative
change. 



E. Restoration, Rehabilitation, Replacement, and/or Acquisition of Equivalent Resources 



1. Types of Alternatives 


Some commenters have suggested that the regulations should encourage trustee officials to select restoration and
rehabilitation alternatives rather than replacement or acquisition alternatives. The Department's regulations
do not indicate a preference for any particular type of restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, or acquisition
alternative. The Department solicits comment on whether it has the authority, and whether it is appropriate, to develop
and require adherence to a priority system for selecting a restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition
alternative. 
The Department's regulations provide that Federal trustee officials may not select an alternative that requires
acquisition of land for Federal management, unless restoration, rehabilitation and replacement are not possible.
43 CFR 11.82(e), as amended by 59 FR 14285. Some commenters supported this restriction and requested that it be extended
to State and tribal natural resource trustees. Other commenters thought that the restriction should be eliminated
altogether. The Department is interested in comments on this issue. 
Some commenters stated that the regulations should clearly authorize trustee officials to choose a natural recovery
alternative when selecting a restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition alternative. The
Department believes that the regulations already authorize trustee officials to select a natural recovery alternative
when appropriate. The Department's regulations explicitly require trustee officials to consider a ``No Action-Natural
Recovery'' alternative. 43 CFR 11.82(c)(2), as amended by 59 FR 14284. 



2. Guidance on Selection of an Alternative 


Several commenters have requested guidance on selection of a restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or
acquisition alternative. In particular, some commenters thought that the Department should provide guidance on
how trustee officials could maximize the opportunities for natural recovery. 
The Department's regulations already provide some guidance on the selection of a restoration, rehabilitation,
replacement, and/or acquisition alternative. See 43 CFR 11.82, as amended by 59 FR 14284-85. The Department's
regulations require trustee officials to evaluate a reasonable number of restoration, rehabilitation, replacement,
and/or acquisition alternatives, including natural recovery. The Department's regulations also provide a number
of factors that trustee officials must consider when selecting an alternative. NOAA's proposed OPA rule includes
a similar list of factors and contains guidance on determining when to select an alternative that relies on natural
recovery. 59 FR 1181. NOAA has developed a draft guidance document on restoration activities. 59 FR 1065. 
The Department notes that developing guidance requires balancing increased predictability against reduced flexibility
to respond to the unique features of the broad range of potential natural resource damage cases. Thus, there is a limit
to the level of specificity that can be appropriately provided in the regulations. With this in mind, the Department
solicits comment on specific aspects of the selection process that warrant additional guidance. The Department
solicits comment on whether the guidance should be incorporated in the regulations or in a separate guidance document.
The Department also intends to consider the appropriateness of offering guidance on available restoration and rehabilitation
techniques and would appreciate information on appropriate case studies demonstrating successful application
of restoration and rehabilitation measures.

Under the Department's regulations, one of the factors that trustee officials must consider when selecting a restoration,
rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition alternative is the relationship between estimated costs and
estimated benefits. 43 CFR 11.82(d)(2), as amended by 59 FR 14285. Total damages will depend on the sum of compensable
value and restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition costs. Often there will be tradeoffs between
compensable value and restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition costs. For example, a fast-paced
restoratio
