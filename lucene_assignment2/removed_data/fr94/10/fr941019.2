Availability of Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are advising the public that the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has prepared an environmental assessment
and a finding of no significant impact for the shipment of an unlicensed veterinary biological product for field testing.
A risk analysis, which forms the basis for the environmental assessment, has led us to conclude that shipment of the
unlicensed veterinary biological product for field testing will not have a significant impact on the quality of the
human environment. Based on our finding of no significant impact, we have determined that an environmental impact
statement need not be prepared.



 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A veterinary biological product regulated under the Virus-Serum Toxin Act (21 U.S.C. 151 

et seq

.) must be shown to be pure, safe, potent, and efficacious before a veterinary biological product license may be issued.
A field test is generally necessary to satisfy prelicensing requirements for veterinary biological products. In
order to ship an unlicensed product for the purpose of conducting a proposed field test, a person must receive authorization
from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). 



In determining whether to authorize shipment for field testing of the unlicensed veterinary biological product
referenced in this notice, APHIS conducted a risk analysis to assess the product's potential effects on the safety
of animals, public health, and the environment. Based on that risk analysis, APHIS has prepared an environmental
assessment. APHIS has concluded that shipment of the unlicensed veterinary biological product for field testing
will not significantly affect the quality of the human environment. Based on this finding of no significant impact,
we have determined that there is no need to prepare an environmental impact statement. 


An environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact have been prepared for the shipment of the following
unlicensed veterinary biological product for field testing: 








The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact have been prepared in accordance with: (1) The
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA)(42 U.S.C. 4321 

et seq

.), (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA 
(40 CFR parts 1500-1508), (3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA (7 CFR 
part 1b), and (4) APHIS Guidelines Implementing NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384, August 28, 1979, and 44 FR 51272-51274,
August 31, 1979).

<DOCTITLE>Chicago Mercantile Exchange Proposed Transfer of Spot for Futures Rule Amendments </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rule amendments of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to restrict the transfer of spot commodities
for futures contracts for the Eurodollar futures contract.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (``CME'') has submitted proposed rule amendments and other materials which would
limit the permissibility of the transfer of spot commodities for futures contracts, also known as exchange for physical
transactions, for the Eurodollar futures contract.

1

 Acting pursuant to the authority delegated by Commission Regulation 140.96, the Division of Trading and Markets
has determined to publish the CME proposal for public comment. The Division believes that publication of the CME proposal
is in the public interest and will assist the Commission in considering the views of interested persons.





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

I. Description of Proposed Rules and Rule Amendments 



By a letter dated September 12, 1994, the CME submitted proposed rule amendments pursuant to Section 5a(a)(12)(A)
of the Commodity Exchange Act (``Act'') and Commission Regulation 1.41(b). The proposed amendments would limit
the permissibility of exchange for physical (``EFP'') transactions for the Eurodollar futures contract. 

Under the proposal, EFP transactions would no longer be permitted for any contract month beyond the second listed
quarterly month in the March quarterly cycle.

2

 Such EFP transactions would continue to be permitted for those months not extending beyond the second listed quarterly
month in the March quarterly cycle. 





Pursuant to the proposal's implementation plan, the amendments would be made effective for all applicable contract
months. Thus, under the proposal, the rule amendments would be implemented to apply to existing as well as newly listed
contract months. 

According to the CME, the proposal is intended to support liquidity and price-discovery in deferred months of the
Eurodollar futures contract. In this respect, it appears that the proposal at least partially represents a response
to efforts to develop a new method for trading U.S. Treasury securities versus Eurodollar futures contracts (i.e.,
``TED spreads''). This approach involves acquiring both legs of the spread position in a single transaction. 



II. Request for Comments 



The Commission requests comments on any aspect of the CME's proposed rule amendments that members of the public believe
may raise issues under the Act or Commission regulations. 

Copies of the proposed rule amendments and related materials are available for inspection at the Office of the Secretariat,
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 2033 K Street NW., Washington, DC 20581. Copies also may be obtained through
the Office of the Secretariat at the above address or by telephoning (202) 254-6314. Some materials may be subject
to confidential treatment pursuant to 17 CFR 145.5 or 145.9. 

Any person interested in submitting written data, views, or arguments on the proposed rule amendments should send
such comments to Jean A. Webb, Secretary, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 2033 K Street NW., Washington, DC
20581, by the specified date.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.





The Department of Defense has submitted to OMB for clearance, the following proposal for collection of information
under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35).






Title, Applicable Form, and OMB Control Number: 

Home Health Care Demonstration, Inpatient Costs vs. Home Health Care Costs; DD Form 2534; OMB Control Number 0704-0265.

Responses Per Respondent: 

2.



Annual Responses: 

6,000.



Average Burden Per Response: 

30 minutes.



Annual Burden Hours: 

3,000



Needs and Uses: 

Congress mandated (FY 1988 DoD Appropriations Act, Section 8071) that CHAMPUS continue the Home Health Care (HHC)
Demonstration. The purpose of this demonstration is to provide beneficiaries with an alternative to hospitalization
and to identify the most cost-effective means for health care coverage to be provided by the government. The collection
instrument requests specific data on impatient costs versus home health care costs. This data is used by Home Health
Care Managers in determining which is more cost-effective. The Act also authorized an expansion of the Home Health
Care Demonstration that permits OCHAMPUS to broaden the criteria for accepting patients, and to include all CHAMPUS
beneficiaries_military retirees and their family members, as well as active duty family members. The Home Health
Care_Case Management Demonstration represents that expansion. Data collected under the demonstration will assist
in developing a coordinated plan of care that meets patients' needs at less cost to the government.



Affected Public: 

Individuals or households, Businesses or other for-profit.



Frequency: 

On occasion and Semiannually.



Respondent's Obligation: 

Required to obtain or retain a benefit.



OMB Desk Officer:

<USDEPT>DELAWARE RIVER BASIN COMMISSION</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Notice of Commission Meeting and Public Hearing </DOCTITLE>



Notice is hereby given that the Delaware River Basin Commission will hold a public hearing on Wednesday, October 26,
1994. The hearing will be part of the Commission's regular business meeting which is open to the public and scheduled
to begin at 1:00 p.m. in the Goddard Conference Room of the Commission's offices at 25 State Police Drive, West Trenton,
New Jersey. The hearing on proposed amendments to the Basin Regulations_Water Supply Charges will be held at 3:00
p.m. 

An informal conference among the Commissioners and staff will be open for public observation at 10:30 a.m. at the same
location and will include a presentation on New Jersey's management of the Potomac-Raritan-Magothy Aquifer and
a status report on the Upper Delaware ice diversion project. 

The subjects of the hearing will be as follows: 



Proposed Amendments to Comprehensive Plan and Basin Regulations_Water Supply Charges


Notice was given in the August 5, 1994 

Federal Register

, Vol. 59, No. 150 p. 39991, that the Commission would hold a public hearing on October 26, 1994 to receive comments on
proposed amendments to its Comprehensive Plan and Basin Regulations_Water Supply Charges concerning the transfer
of Certificates of Entitlement. Holders of Certificates of Entitlement are exempted from the payment of water charges
until such certificates are transferred. The amendments would (1) define ``transfer''; (2) delete two categories
of exemptions from the existing general rule that terminates Certificates of Entitlement upon transfer and (3) revise
a third such category. Commission regulations require upon transfer, the termination of Certificates of Entitlement
which permit the withdrawal of water from the basin without charge. The U.S. Court of Appeals has confirmed the Commission's
power under its Compact to terminate Certificates of Entitlement when a transfer has occurred. The court also ruled
that the Commission's interpretation of its existing regulation that limited the extent to which certain transfers
were exempt from termination was not consistent with the specific wording of the regulations. Pursuant to the court
ruling, the Commission proposes to amend its Basin Regulations_Water Supply Charges, so that transfer exceptions
are consistent with existing Commission policy to terminate Certificates of Entitlement when a transfer of ownership
and/or control of a water using facility occurs. The amendments inter alia define a transfer to include the sale of
corporate stock. They also delete existing exceptions to the transfer rule for corporate merger transactions and
certain transactions under the Internal Revenue Code. 



Current Expense and Capital Budgets. 

A proposed current expense budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1995, in the aggregate amount of $3,326,500
and a capital budget for the same period in the amount of $1,937,500 in revenue and $1,481,500 in expenditures. Copies
of the current expense and capital budget are available from the Commission on request by contacting Richard C. Gore.




A Proposal to Adopt the 1994-1995 Water Resources Program. 

A proposal that the 1994-1995 Water Resources Program and the activities, programs, initiatives, concerns,
projections and proposals identified and set forth therein be accepted and adopted, in accordance with the requirements
of Section 13.2 of the Delaware River Basin Compact.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Pursuant to 10 CFR 600.15, The U.S. DOE announces that it plans to conduct a technically competitive solicitation
for basic research experiments in high energy density studies at the National Laser's User's Facility (NLUF) located
at the University of Rochester Laboratory for Laser Energetics (UR/LLE). Grant Solicitation No. DE-PS03-95SF20539.
Universities or other higher education institutions, private sector not-for-profit organizations, or other entities
are invited to submit grant applications. The total amount of funding expected to be available for the Fiscal Year
1995 (FY95) program cycle is $450,000. Multiple awards are anticipated.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Interested parties can obtain a 31/2
'
' computer floppy disk of the solicitation document by submitting a written request; specify WordPerfect
5.0 for DOS or Microsoft Word 5.0 for Macintosh. The solicitation document contains all the information relative
to this action for prospective applicants. The solicitation is targeted for release in October 1994. The actual work
to be accomplished will be determined by the experiments and diagnostic techniques that are selected for award.




Proposed experiments and diagnostic techniques will be evaluated through scientific peer review against predetermined,
published and available criteria. Final selection will be made by the DOE. It is anticipated that multiple grants
will be awarded within available funding. The unique resources of the NLUF are available to scientists for state-of-the-art
experiments primarily in the area of inertial fusion and related plasma physics. Other areas such as spectroscopy
of high ionized atoms, laboratory astrophysics, fundamental physics, materials science, and biology and chemistry
will be considered on a secondary basis.

The LLE was established in 1970 to investigate the interaction of high power lasers with matter. Available at the LLE
for NLUF researchers is the upgraded OMEGA LASER, A 30 Kj uv, 24-beam laser system (at 0.35um) suitable for direct-drive
ICC implosions, and the Glass Development Laser (GDL), a 250 billion watt, single beam prototype for the variety of
experiments including laser-plasma interactions and atomic spectroscopy. The NLUF program for FY95 is to concentrate
on experiments than can be done with the OMEGA laser at the University of Rochester and development of diagnostic techniques
suitable for the upgraded OMEGA system. Measurements of the laser coupling, laser-plasma interactions, core temperature,
and core density are needed to determine the characteristics of the target implosions. Diagnostic techniques could
include either new instrumentation, development of analysis tools, or development of targets that are applicable
for 30 kJ direct-drive implosions. Additional technical information about the facilities and potential collaboration
at NLUF can be obtained from: Dr. James Knauer, Manager, National Laser User's Facility, University of Rochester/LLE,

 Notice of Noncompetitive Financial Assistance Award.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Energy, Richland Operations Office, announces that pursuant to Paragraph C of 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i),
it intends to issue a noncompetitive grant award to the State of Washington Department of Community, Trade, and Economic
Development. The award is planned for an initial three (3) year project cycle, consisting of three (3) separately
funded one (1) year budget periods. The initial budget is estimated at $1,100,000.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:







Grant Award Number:

 DE-FG06-94RL12995.



Scope of Project:

 The proposed financial assistance award is a grant Washington State to fund an Environmental Technology Partnership
Initiative. The partnership will establish a cooperative approach to: (1) Private sector participation in cleanup
activities at Hanford and other sites, and (2) contributing to local sustainable economic development. The partnership
between DOE and the State of Washington will be designed to accomplish these goals through the application of advanced
technology. The State and DOE will create or designate a non-profit entity to act as a facilitator between governmental
agencies and private partners. This entity will establish connections to academic institutions, industry, and
other research institutions to encourage the development, exchange, and commercialization of environmental technologies.
DOE has determined that award on a noncompetitive basis is appropriate because the recipient is a unit of government
and the activities to be supported are related to the performance of governmental functions within the jurisdiction
of that unit, thereby precluding DOE provision of support of another entity. It has been determined that a grant instrument
is appropriate since the Department of Energy anticipates limited direct involvement with the program.

I. Statutory Authority and Background 



Under Section 1605(b) of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct; Pub. L. 102-486), the Secretary of Energy with
the Energy Information Administration, and in consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), is
required to establish a voluntary reporting system and database on emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), reductions
of these gases, and carbon fixation. DOE is required to publish, after public comment, guidelines setting procedures
for the accurate voluntary reporting of information on: (1) Greenhouse gas emissions on an annual basis for the baseline
period 1987 through 1990, and for subsequent calendar years; (2) annual reductions of greenhouse gases and carbon
fixation achieved through any measure; and (3) reductions in greenhouse gas emissions achieved voluntarily, or
as a result of plant or facility closings, or as a result of State or Federal requirements. 

The guidelines and supporting materials finalized today will assist those who wish to participate in determining
or developing information capable of being reported. The reporting forms and database system required under Section
1605(b) are to be developed by EIA and must be consistent with the guidelines. 

Draft guidelines and supporting materials were made available for public comment on June 1, 1994 (59 FR 28345); that
notice discusses the draft guidelines. A public hearing on the draft guidelines was held on June 29, 1994. The draft
supporting document for the agricultural sector was made available June 30, 1994 (59 FR 33733). Comments were provided
by individuals and associations representing: public interest environmental and land use groups; investor-owned
and publicly-owned utilities; independent power producers; oil production and use; coal production and use; motor
vehicle manufacturing and use; chemical manufacturing; and academic, commercial, and public interest forestry
interests. 



II. Discussion of Final Guidelines and Comments Received 



A. Organization of the Final Guidelines and Supporting Materials 



In response to comments, the final guidelines and supporting materials have been re-organized from that presented
in the draft. The coverage of each sector-specific supporting Part, however, is the same as that contained in the parallel
Part of the draft documents. The final guidelines and supporting documents, DOE/PO-0028, are organized in
three volumes: 




Volume 1_General Guidelines 

Volume 2_Sector-Specific Issues and Reporting Methodologies Supporting the General Guidelines 



Part 1_Electricity Supply Sector

Part 3_Industrial Sector 


Volume 3_Sector-Specific Issues and Reporting Methodologies Supporting the General Guidelines 


Part 4_Transportation Sector 
Part 5_Forestry Sector 
Part 6_Agricultural Sector 



The material provided in the draft supporting document, Part 7, dealing with Global Warming Potentials, has been
revised as discussed below, and now appears as Appendix E to each supporting volume. 


B. Purpose of the Guidelines and Design Principles 


The final guidelines and supporting materials have been developed to reflect the goal of maximizing participation
without compromising the usefulness of the data voluntarily submitted. Commenters on the draft guidelines generally
supported the appropriateness of this goal, although some did not agree on how to strike a balance between maximizing
participation and establishing a meaningful data reporting system. The flexibility provided by the draft guidelines,
which takes into account the reporter's ability to use existing information and select appropriate quantification
methods, was supported by many commenters as necessary to encourage participation. 
However, some comments from environmental public interest groups and forestry public interest groups urged that
the final guidelines include requirements for verification of emissions reductions and carbon sequestration data.
These commenters believe that the flexibility provided by the program made data verification essential to the credibility
of the information entered into the database. Many of these comments acknowledged that the statute directed neither
DOE nor reporters to obtain verification of data reported, but suggested that third party verification could provide
users of the database with better assurances of its accuracy. 
Some of these commenters indicated that, in the alternative, the program should direct reporters to indicate the
basis for the data submitted based on a categorization system, and that the database should be designed to allow sorting
of data on the basis of this categorization. For example, a report would indicate that data was based on measurement,
estimation, or use of default tables, and whether emissions reductions project reports were accompanied by historic
or entity-wide emissions data. A database user would be able to retrieve reported data on the basis of these categories.

In order to provide the flexibility necessary to encourage reporting, the guidelines do not provide prescriptive
features such as verification. Rather, the guidelines indicate that a reporter will be asked to categorize the data
submitted. This categorization will include third party verification as well as whether the data was measured or
estimated. Segregation of data by categories will be possible. 
DOE believes the approach of requesting the identification of data derivation, and of any data verification performed,
accommodates both the need to maximize participation by providing flexibility, and the need to create a useful and
accessible database. 


C. Changes to Draft Guidelines for Final Guidelines 


After reviewing the comments received, DOE revised several provisions of the draft general guidelines and some provisions
of the sector-specific supporting documents. The changes to the draft guidelines include: the addition of gases
to the list of those reportable under the program, with delayed implementation for some of those gases not covered
in the draft guidelines; a limitation on reporting project activities to those that achieved new emission reductions
or carbon sequestration beginning with January 1, 1991; revision of the discussions about distinctions between
primary and secondary effects, and between direct and indirect emissions; and guidance on amending a previous year's
report.

A discussion of responses to significant comments on issues in the draft general guidelines appears below. Significant
changes as a result of comments received on the sector-specific documents are discussed below by sector document.



1. Gases Covered 


The legislation does not define ``greenhouse gases.'' The draft guidelines covered emissions of carbon dioxide,
methane, nitrous oxide, as well as many of the halogenated substances. The final guidelines add two halogenated substances,
halon 1211 and halon 2402, to the list of gases and substances covered. In addition, DOE announces the delayed addition
of three greenhouse gases, nitrogen oxides, nonmethane hydrocarbons, and carbon monoxide, to the reporting program
starting with the third reporting cycle of the program which is expected in 1997. 


a. Additional Gases to be Covered_Conventional Pollutants 


Comments on the gases and substances covered by the draft guidelines supported expansion of the program to a more comprehensive
list of greenhouse gases, especially some conventional, or ``criteria,'' pollutants regulated under the Clean
Air Act for which emissions data is collected by EPA and State agencies under various air quality programs. These gases
are nitrogen oxides, nonmethane hydrocarbons, and carbon monoxide. Although these gases are not direct greenhouse
gases, they contribute to the formation of carbon dioxide and/or tropospheric ozone. 
The international scientific community has been unable to quantify the differential radiative activity of these
gases, and thus has not provided an index of the climate change effects of these gases relative to carbon dioxide. Because
emissions data reported under the program will be reported in units of weight, and not reduced by any common index of
comparative radiative effects, it is unnecessary to exclude gases from the program solely on the basis that a quantification
of comparative effects is not available. 
DOE agrees that a more comprehensive 1605(b) reporting program should cover these indirect gases, and has expanded
the gases covered by the voluntary reporting program to include nitrogen oxides, nonmethane hydrocarbons, and carbon
monoxide. However, for the reasons discussed below, DOE is delaying the programmatic acceptance of voluntarily
reported data on emissions and emissions reductions of these gases for a period of two years. Thus, reports of data
related to these gases will first be accepted by EIA during the third reporting cycle of the program, 

i.e.

 with reports filed in 1997. These reports may include the results of activities beginning January 1, 1991, as well
as historic emissions data on these gases for the period 1987 to 1990.

<TEXT>
 

The primary reason for delaying the addition of these gases is to aid in the efficient administration of this new program.
Neither DOE nor EIA has sufficient experience in voluntary reporting to predict the volume of participation in this
program or the difficulties that may arise in its implementation. EIA expects that experience gained in the first
two years of the program will enhance its ability to smoothly accommodate this expansion of the reporting program.


b. Additional Gases to be Covered_Halogenated Substances


Comments were also received on the list of halogenated substances for which emissions and reductions will be reportable.
In response to these comments, the final guidelines add two halogenated substances, halon 1211 and halon 2402, to
the list of reportable gases. Given the limited amount of reporting anticipated on these substances, initial coverage
of the program includes these gases.
As explained in the June 1994 notice of availability for the draft guidelines, the inclusion of some halogenated substances
in the voluntary reporting program is based on the language of Section 1605(b)(1)(B), referring to the reportability
of reductions in greenhouse gas emissions achieved through ``chlorofluorocarbon capture and replacement.'' Without
this language, DOE might have limited the voluntary reporting program to those gases covered by the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change, thus excluding the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other halogenated substances,
including the two halons now covered, from the reporting program.
One comment noted that the draft guidelines' failure to list halon 1211 and halon 2402 as reportable gases was inconsistent
with the listing of halon 1301. The draft guidelines and supporting materials listed only those halogenated substances
for which the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) had published an index of global warming potential
(GWP) relative to carbon dioxide. While there are internationally accepted indices of stratospheric ozone depletion
potential for halogenated and bromide substances in addition to those listed in the draft guidelines and supporting
documents, the IPCC published a GWP for halon 1301, but not for any other halon.
Based on stratospheric ozone depletion characteristics, the halogenated substances are covered by an international
agreement, the Montreal Protocol on Substances Depleting the Stratospheric Ozone, and under U.S. law are regulated
under Title VI of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. These gases are greenhouse gases, although they also have the
antagonistic characteristic of destroying tropospheric ozone, which tends to indirectly produce global cooling.
These antagonistic effects complicate the analysis of their impact on the global climate, and have divided the scientific
community over whether the net effect of some of these gases will be global warming or cooling.
This division in the scientific community has made it difficult to determine the quantitative global warming potential
of these gases. Because emissions data reported under the program will be reported in units of weight, and not reduced
to a standard measure by application of a common index of comparative radiative effects, and to be consistent with
the decision discussed above on conventional pollutants, halon 1211 and halon 2401 are added to the list of gases for
which emissions may be reported under the program. Based on the limited amount of activity in production and use of
these substances, and on the similarity in emissions of these substances to other halogenated substances, DOE has
determined that there is no administrative need to delay acceptance of submissions on these gases.


2. Limitation on Vintage of Reportable Projects


The General Guidelines include a new section, discussing the limitation on reporting projects which resulted in
a reduction in emissions, but on which activity commenced before 1991. The final guidelines permit reporting as projects
only new (post-1990) emissions reductions and carbon sequestration. Pre-1991 emissions reductions will be reflected
in emissions reporting only. Thus, the results of all emission reduction activities which are first achieved in 1991
are reportable as projects, even if the activity commenced before 1991. For example, in the case of an ongoing demand
side management program, emissions changes arising from energy savings through appliance replacement in 1991 can
be reported as project results, but the effects of appliance replacements before 1991 are not reportable as emissions
reduction projects. Rather, these effects are subsumed in emissions reporting for the baseline period of 1987 through
1990.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941019-2-00026 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941019-2-00020 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The draft guidelines had no comparable discussion. Some commenters maintained that a time limitation on reportable
emissions reduction projects was necessary, particularly because under the guidelines reporters may separately
report emissions and emissions reductions. These comments indicated that the statutory language of section 1605(b)(1)(A)(i)
providing for 1987 through 1990 as baseline years for emissions reporting implied that emissions reductions reporting
under section 1605(b)(1)(B) was limited to reductions occurring after 1990. Reductions occurring before 1991 would
be reportable only for their effect on emissions reported for the baseline years, rather than separately as emissions
reductions projects.
Since the statutory language on reporting emissions reductions is not explicitly tied to any specific year or years,
and the years 1987 through 1990 are referred to as the baseline period, DOE is persuaded that goals of the reporting
program are best served by limiting reports of emission reduction projects to new emissions reductions after 1990.
Many emission reduction projects have multi-year or multi-decade lives; without a time limitation, the database
would include the emissions reductions results of older activities more appropriately reflected within emissions
reporting rather than highlighted separately as emissions reduction projects.


3. Direct and Indirect Emissions


The reporting program covers activities which directly or indirectly result in greenhouse gas emissions or emissions
reductions. DOE has revised the text of the General Guidelines to clarify the distinction between direct and indirect
emissions in order to assist reporters in identifying the distinction.
Some commenters supported limiting the program to submissions of data on direct emissions, and to activities that
directly produce or reduce emissions, in order to provide clarity in the program's database. Other comments supported
the draft's inclusion of activities that indirectly impact greenhouse gas emissions, based on the statutory listing
in Section 1605(b)(1)(B) of activities which indirectly affect, or may indirectly affect, emissions or reductions.
Additionally, many comments evidenced confusion over the draft's discussion of direct and indirect emissions.
DOE agrees that the statutory listing of activities which indirectly affect emissions, as well as activities that
directly affect emissions, supports the inclusion of both direct and indirect emissions in the reporting program.
DOE also agrees that these concepts are potentially confusing. To assist reporters in identifying direct and indirect
emissions, DOE has revised the text of the General Guidelines. It is apparent from many of the comments that this confusion
was largely created by intertwining the concepts of primary and secondary effects of an activity with the concepts
of resulting direct and indirect emissions.
In response, DOE has eliminated the distinction between primary and secondary effects of a project, leaving a single
concept of ``effects''.


4. Primary and Secondary Effects


Based on comments expressing confusion over the concepts and the draft guidance for the inclusion of both primary
and secondary effects in project analysis, the final guidelines have eliminated the distinction. While the concepts
are still presented in Section GG-5.9, the reporter is urged to consider and report the known and quantifiable
``effects'' of a project without regard to whether they are primary or secondary. To provide additional clarity,
the final guidelines also present examples of different types of effects.

5. Amending a Previous Year's Report 



The final guidelines add a provision which allows reporters to amend any previous year's report. The program will,
for example, accept reports based on estimated and default data, which will be identified as such by the reporter.
(See discussion at II.B., above.) Where a reporter subsequently develops better data, for example through field
measurements or utility-specific emissions factors, the original report may be modified based on information developed
using the later-acquired data. The amended report will include the reason for the revision and a comparison of the
amended report's changes to the original report. 

The primary reason for adding this provision is to encourage reporters to develop their own activity-specific data,
without discouraging reporting based on less-specific estimation or default data. 



6. Radiative Forcing of Greenhouse Gases 



The language of Section 1605(b)(1) provides that the reporting guidelines are ``to establish procedures for taking
into account the differential radiative activity and atmospheric lifetimes of each greenhouse gas.'' The draft
guidelines and the supporting materials included as Part 7, ``Global Warming Potentials'' (GWPs), describing the
GWP index developed by the IPCC as a simple method for representing the relative effects on climate resulting from
a unit mass of a greenhouse gas. 

Comments unanimously supported DOE's decision to require that emissions data be reported only in units of greenhouse
gases emitted, and not to require reporters to convert these data to the effects of the gases reported relative to carbon
dioxide. The final guidelines continue to direct that reported data will be in units of gas emitted. Commenters expressed
concerns that (1) the concept of GWPs was too complex to be useful to most reporters in developing GHG mitigation options;
(2) the discussion in draft Part 7 of the scientific basis of GWPs was flawed; and (3) use of scientific work not yet formally
adopted by the IPCC was inappropriate. 

In response to comments, draft Part 7 has been substantially condensed and appears as Appendix E in the two supporting
volumes. The expansion of draft Part 7 to clarify fully the many complex and evolving scientific issues was deemed
outside the scope of the voluntary reporting program. A brief discussion of the concept, together with a chart of the
latest quantitative GWP index developed by the international scientific community, is provided in the Appendix.
The reader/user is referred to other sources for additional information. 

DOE agrees that the scientific concepts involved in GWPs, such as time horizons, carbon cycle models, and integration
time scales, may not be clearly understood by many in the general reporting population. The ongoing improvements
in our understanding of the complex global climate system and analytic models developed are evidenced, as discussed
in the Notice of Inquiry preceding the draft guidelines, by the 1992 revision of the 1990 IPCC report on GWPs. Further,
revisions to the 1992 report have been approved by an IPCC subsidiary body, Working Group I, and will be published later
this year. It is from this anticipated publication that the GWPs provided in the draft and final guidelines are taken.


The IPCC, an international body charged with reaching international consensus on the complex scientific matters
in climate change, is supported by the United States. IPCC work will ultimately be a factor in both domestic and international
analyses on climate change mitigation options. It would thus be imprudent for the DOE reporting guidelines to address
differential radiative forcing in a manner inconsistent with the IPCC. The 1994 revisions to the IPCC GWP index have
been approved by Working Group I and are expected to be formally accepted by the full IPCC soon after publication of
the final guidelines. DOE is using this material in advance of its formal acceptance for administrative ease. 



7. Editorial and Minor Revisions 



In response to various comments, editorial revisions were made throughout the General Guidelines and the supporting
documents as follows. 

Case studies and examples. Case studies and examples are provided for the purpose of illustrating the process of project
analysis in light of a reporter's purpose and sector-specific circumstances and conditions. Some commenters suggested
that some of the case studies and examples provided were unrealistic, that they suggest a greater reporting burden
for reporters in some sectors than in others, or that they appear to require the use of certain approaches and methods
for some activities. 

To address these comments, the following text has been added to all case study and example presentations: 



Note:

 This example illustrates only one approach in analyzing a project; your analysis, methods, and calculations will
vary depending on your particular circumstances, the geographic location of the project, and other factors.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941019-2-00028 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941019-2-00020 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Examples are intended to provide, in an educational manner, illustrations of various approaches to project and emissions
analysis permitted within the guidelines. They are not intended to imply any additional directions or restrictions
on reporting over and above that provided by the Guidelines. The case studies and examples do, however, suggest to
potential reporters different ways in which existing data and resources may be used to develop a report. The illustrated
cases thus differ in detail based on the stated purpose of the hypothetical reporter for reporting, and the individual
circumstances surrounding the project and the reporter. Consistent with the goal of maximum participation in the
program, the flexibility of the reporting program is not bound by any particular case study or example discussion
on any issue. 



Subjective Terminology 



Comments were made that the use in the guidelines and the supporting materials of certain descriptive terms, relative
to a reporter's decisions regarding the data developed and reported, were inappropriate within a voluntary program.
The program's flexibility allows reporters to select among various approaches in developing a report. These selections
do not encompass comparative value of the reporter's activities. No value judgments are intended by the use of subjective
terms in any description of the reporter's choice of approaches. Accordingly, the final guidelines and supporting
materials have been revised to minimize use of these terms, and to better reflect that judgments on the quality of the
data reported are to be made by the reporter and database user, and not by the reporting program. Where these terms remain
in the guidelines and supporting documents, they are intended to reflect differing perspectives of both reporters
and database users on choices permitted by the reporting program. 



D. Changes to Draft Sector-Specific Supporting Documents for Final Sector-Specific Documents 



Comments were received on all draft sector specific supporting documents. Revisions to the draft guidelines in response
to comments on less significant technical, mathematical, or editorial errors in the draft sector specific supporting
documents are not individually discussed in this notice, but were considered and addressed where appropriate. 

Most comments fall into several categories of issues, including those that have been addressed in the final General
Guidelines and discussed above in section II.C. of this notice. These categories include: failure to discuss all
emissions reduction or carbon sequestration activities applicable to the sector; criticism of the case studies'
use of unrealistic circumstances; the accuracy, completeness, and degree of conservativeness of default tables;
and the lack of balance among sector documents indicating differing reporting burdens. 

The program is expressly intended to provide reporters with the flexibility to report on the achievements of all emissions
reduction and carbon sequestration activities. The failure of the draft guidelines and supporting materials to
discuss or list any particular activity does not indicate that its achievements are not reportable under the 1605(b)
program. 

In response to comments, the final supporting documents add discussions of some additional emissions reduction
and carbon sequestration approaches, and provide more emphasis to some of the approaches discussed in the draft.
Nevertheless, the guidelines and supporting documents are not intended to provide an exclusive list of all activities
that may be reported. The guidelines could not, for example, provide identification and quantification of achievements
from the novel, innovative actions for which the information sharing function of the voluntary reporting program
is paramount. 

As discussed above in C.7., the guidelines and supporting documents use case studies and examples to illustrate the
application of concepts and varied approaches to project analysis and reporting. Reporters are not bound by the particulars
of any presentation. Rather, the guidelines provide reporters the flexibility needed to adapt project analysis
approaches to particular circumstances, including the type of project, the availability of necessary data, and
the purpose for reporting. 

Thus, while revisions have been made in many case studies and examples throughout the documents in response to comments
regarding realism, these study examples are not intended to be exhaustive of the range of appropriate approaches
that reporters may develop and use to determine the data to report under this program. 

Significant comments were received on the accuracy, completeness, and degree of conservativeness of the default
tables provided in the supporting documents. Based on DOE's technical judgment on individual comments, errors have
been corrected. Responses to these comments on specific sector default tables appear below in the discussion of the
relevant sector. 

In keeping with the flexibility of the program, reporters are encouraged to use and develop data specific to the project
being reported to accommodate their individual circumstances. The continued inclusion of default tables is, however,
in keeping with the goal of maximum participation, where the wide disparity among potential reporting populations
supports the need to provide some ``lookup'' tables for use at the discretion of the reporter.

<TEXT>
 

Default tables, by their nature, may provide an easy way for reporters to estimate the quantity of certain factors
they may need in order to report. By virtue of their ease of use, these tables cannot accommodate all variables involved;
rather, they are based on judgments on appropriate methodologies and available data. In some fields of endeavor,
there is no apparent consensus on methodologies and the quality and quantity of data needed either to develop default
tables or to definitively judge their conservativeness. The default tables provided are, in DOE's judgment, generally
conservative.

Some commenters asked that DOE add default tables covering additional data quantification areas. While DOE agrees
that the addition of tables in these documents could be helpful to reporters, their development did not warrant a delay
in issuing the final guidelines and supporting documents. In many instances, measurement and other methodologies
are in their relative infancy. DOE expects that data and methodologies will evolve as national and international
interest continue in the areas of greenhouse gas emissions reduction and carbon sequestration. Since reporters
are permitted to develop their own data and submit it to the voluntary reporting program, the program itself may aid
in the development of methodologies and the accumulation of data to advance knowledge in these areas. DOE acknowledges
that sector-specific documents appear to differ greatly in the detail with which applicable concepts and approaches
are discussed. This distinction was especially noted in comments on the Electricity Supply Sector, Residential
and Commercial Buildings Sector, Industrial Sector and Forestry Sector documents, expressing concern that the
differences may indicate a higher reporting burden for these sectors.

The differences in focus and depth are based primarily on the breadth of technical knowledge of each sector's greenhouse
gas and emissions reduction or carbon sequestration features, including the knowledge held by each sector's population
and the degree to which reporters will have or can develop sufficient data necessary for a report. These differences
in focus and depth do not direct any additional or supplementary requirements for these sectors. Minimum reporting
requirements, set forth in section GG-6 of the final General Guidelines, are identical for all reporters and
projects, regardless of sector.



1. Electricity Supply



In addition to the revisions discussed above, in response to comments on the draft Electricity Supply Sector document,
the final Electricity Supply Sector document includes more prominent mention of: (1) The possible use of Integrated
Resource Planning data and data development methods; (2) the role of least-cost or other dispatching modes; (3) the
role of hydroelectric power in renewable energy; and (4) emissions reduction projects in electrotechnologies.
The discussion of relevant electrotechnologies has been augmented in the Industrial and Transportation Sector
documents as well.

Comments were received on requiring reporters in this sector to use certain existing Federal or State requirements,
or other existing protocols in developing reporting data. One example of a Federal protocol is the EPA's Conservation
and Verification Protocol, 40 CFR Part 73, which is used in the acid rain program under title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments
of 1990 to determine the distribution of bonus sulfur dioxide allowances based on electricity conservation programs.
Another example under the Federal acid rain program is EPA regulations providing for monitoring or estimating and
reporting carbon dioxide emissions from certain boilers. Many States also have protocols dealing with estimating
energy savings from demand side management (DSM) programs.

While activities in this sector are characterized by an extensive array of measurement and estimation methodologies
and protocols, many of which are mentioned in the guidelines and supporting documents, DOE does not require their
use for the reporting program. Consistent with the flexibility of the program, reporters may choose to use appropriate
protocols and data developed for other reasons, including compliance with Federal and State requirements.

Significant revisions to some of the examples for this sector were made in response to comments that the scenarios
and quantification specifics provided were unrealistic. In addition to these revisions, the language of the caveat
discussed in section II.C.7., above, has been added to the presentation of all examples for the purpose of indicating
that the example is meant to illustrate concepts, not to prescribe the use of specific approaches.

2. Residential and Commercial Buildings



Comments on the supporting document for the Residential and Commercial Buildings Sector reflect similar concerns
to those raised on the Electricity Supply Sector document. In response to comments, DOE has added discussions of electrotechnologies
specific to this sector and identified additional conservation techniques. DOE has clarified that the ability to
report the results of an activity is not dependent on whether that technology or technique is mentioned in the guidelines
or supporting documents.

Activities in this sector are characterized by an array of measurement and estimation methodologies, some of which
are mentioned in the document. Comments were received on requiring reporters to use specific protocols available
for this sector. For the same reasons as discussed in section D.1., above, the guidelines do not prescribe the use of
specific methodologies or protocols for measurement or estimation.



3. Industrial



In response to comments, DOE has modified discussions on the appropriate consideration of the obsolescence of equipment
in determining the reference case for reportable projects. Biomass emissions factors have been clarified, and the
distinction between temporary and permanent fuel switching has been eliminated.

Similar to other sector-specific documents, the final Industrial Sector supporting document has expanded discussions
of electrotechnologies specific to this sector and identified additional conservation techniques. The ability
to report the results of an activity is not dependent on whether a technology or technique is mentioned in the guidelines
or supporting documents.



4. Transportation



In addition to the general revisions discussed above, DOE has expanded the discussion on electric vehicles in the
Transportation Sector supporting document. Activities in the transportation sector are characterized by an extensive
array of measurement and estimation methodologies, some of which are mentioned in the document. The use of some of
these methodologies is required under various Federal regulatory and funding programs, such as those which regulate
vehicle air pollutant emissions or award highway construction funds. For the reasons discussed above, reporters
are not limited to using these protocols.



5. Forestry



Comments on the Forestry Sector document related to its apparent emphasis on carbon sequestration activity from
new or replacement forestation, together with a corresponding lack of emphasis on forest preservation, forest management,
and urban forestry. The varying treatment of types of carbon sequestration activity is not meant to imply a preference
by DOE, or by the reporting program, for any particular type of forestry activity. It is, rather, based primarily on
the state of the knowledge in these areas of forest carbon sequestration. Similar to other sector documents, reporting
is not limited to the activities discussed.

Comments on the limited tree species and associated reference cases provided for standard forestry projects suggested
that the table be expanded to include additional species. These data were developed with the assistance of U.S. Forest
Service staff, and the tables are based on the availability of sufficient information to generalize carbon sequestration
effects of certain activities. While such information is available for the major commercial species which are addressed
in the tables, DOE believes that there is insufficient information available to develop adequate default tables
on other species or reference cases. For additional species and reference cases, as well as for other forestry activities,
the reporter will need to develop specific project data.

Other commenters stated that field measurements for projects in this sector were particularly essential to assure
the accuracy of the data submitted. Consistent with the flexibility necessary to encourage reporting in this and
all other sectors, the guidelines do not provide prescriptive features such as requiring field measurements. Rather,
the guidelines indicate that a reporter will be asked to categorize the data submitted, including whether it is based
on measurement.



6. Agricultural



Comments received on the draft document for the Agricultural Sector were indicative of the complexity of the sector,
and its unique characteristic of including reportable activities that contribute both to greenhouse gas emissions
and to carbon sequestration.



</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941019-2-00031 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941019-2-00020 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Comments were received on the failure to include any discussion of certain emissions reduction or carbon sequestration
approaches specifically applicable to the agricultural sector. In response to these comments, additional text
has been added on windbreaks and shelterbelts, changes to grazing land, and the production of biomass for fuel. The
failure of the document to address other agricultural activities which affect greenhouse gases or carbon sequestration
is not intended to preclude data submissions on those activities, including energy efficiency improvements. 



7. Adjusted Electricity Emissions Factors by State 



Substantial and detailed comment was received on the draft Appendix C, ``Adjusted Electricity Emissions by State,''
which appeared in all draft sector supporting documents. After consideration of the comments received, Appendix
C has been revised to employ a simpler methodology and the inclusion of nonutility generation emissions. A summary
of the methodology used for the table appears together with the table in Appendix C. The published data on fuel use and
technologies used are identified. 

In response to comments that the draft failed to include nonutility generation, emissions factors for nonutility
generation have been added, together with weighted combined emissions factors for utility and nonutility generation.
Where the reporter utilizing the table knows whether the power is utility or nonutility generated, the appropriate
factor should be used. The combined factor is intended for use when the reporter is unable to make this identification.


In keeping with the flexibility of the program, reporters are encouraged to use emissions factors specifically applicable
to the project being reported. Where a utility-specific factor is available, for example, it will incorporate actual
fuel mix and dispatching modes which are not differentiated within a State factor provided in Appendix C. The inclusion
of revised Appendix C is in keeping with the programmatic goal of maximum participation, by providing a method for
estimating emissions and reductions when other data are not easily available. 



III. Administrative Requirements 



A. Regulatory Review 



DOE has determined that this is not a significant regulatory action because it does not meet the criteria which define
such actions under Executive Order 12866, 58 FR 51735, and is therefore not subject to regulatory review. Accordingly,
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has informed DOE that no clearance of the guidelines and supporting materials
is required.

B. Issues Under the Paperwork Reduction Act 



The provisions of section 1605(b) direct EIA to develop the reporting forms and database for the reporting program,
consistent with the guidelines issued today. Separate administrative requirements apply to the development of
EIA reporting forms. 

Any information collection requirements proposed for the voluntary reporting program are subject to the Paperwork
Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

, and will be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review and approval of paperwork requirements. EIA
anticipates the availability of draft reporting forms for public comment within 30 days. A notice on the availability
of the draft reporting forms will appear in the 

Federal Register

<DOCTITLE>National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation; Motion to Vacate</DOCTITLE>


October 13, 1994.


Take notice that on October 6, 1994, National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation (National Fuel), 10 Lafayette Square, Buffalo,
New York 14203, filed in Docket No. CP94-693-000 a ``Notice of Withdrawal of Pleading'' seeking to withdraw
its ``Request for Authorization Under the Notice Procedures of  157.205'' which was filed August 1, 1994, in
Docket No. CP94-693-000 (prior notice filing). National Fuel states that its Notice of Withdrawal is
filed in compliance with Condition C of the Commission's Order on Rehearing issued in Docket Nos. CP94-112-001
and CP88-94-009 on September 1, 1994 (68 FERC  61,278).
National Fuel's prior notice filing involved a request for authorization to construct and operate a new point of delivery
in the town of Grand Island, Erie County, New York to provide service to an existing customer, National fuel Gas Distribution
Corporation (Distribution), under National Fuel's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP83-4-000.
The prior notice filing was noticed August 4, 1994, and no protests were filed during the notice period which expired
September 19, 1994.
In its prior notice filing, National Fuel noted that it had previously applied for approval under Section 7(c) of the
Natural Gas Act for the acquisition and construction of certain facilities, including the delivery point described
in the prior notice filing. National Fuel explained that it had received conditional approval of the proposal by order
issued June 1, 1994, in Docket Nos. CP94-112-000 and CP88-94-008 (67 FERC  61,270 (1994)).
National Fuel stated that it was unable to commence acquisition and construction because it could not satisfy all
the conditions included in the June 1 order and therefore it had filed for rehearing of the June 1 order. National Fuel
asserted that it urgently needed to commence construction of the Grand Island station in order to have the station
in operation by November 1.
National Fuel has now accepted the certificate issued in Docket No. CP94-112-000, et al., in the June 1
order, as amended by the Commission's September 1, 1994, order on rehearing. However, Paragraph (C) of the order on
rehearing provided that before National fuel may begin construction of the facilities authorized in Docket No. CP94-112-000,
it must withdraw its prior notice request filed in Docket No. CP94-693-000.
The Commission will treat National Fuel's Notice of Withdrawal as a motion to vacate the authorization granted pursuant
to   157.205 and 157.212 in Docket No. CP94-693-000.
Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said motion to vacate should on or before November
3, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest
in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211)
and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered
by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding.
Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion
to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. All persons who have hereto filed need not file again.

Take notice that on October 5, 1994, Questar Pipeline Company (Questar), 79 South State Street, Salt Lake City, Utah

station and appurtenant facilities under the blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82-491-000,
all as more fully set forth in the request on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.

Questar proposes to abandon and remove their Debenham District Regulator Station (Debenham DRS) and appurtenant
facilities located in Summit County, Utah. The Debanham DRS was previously utilized to deliver natural gas to Mountain
Fuel Supply Company (Mountain Fuel), an affiliate of Questar. Mountain Fuel has installed and is currently operating
a new intermediate high-pressure (IHP) distribution line adjacent to the Debenham DRS, to serve a new residential
subdivision and additionally receives natural gas through Questar's DRS WA0388, located west of the Debenham DRS,
to serve its remaining customers. Questar states that the Debanham DRS consists of two 3/4-inch taps, approximately
105 feet of 3/4-inch pipeline, a can-type regulator set and appurtenant facilities. Questar further states that
the total investment associated with the DRS facilities proposed to be abandoned is $788.

Any person or the Commission's staff may, within 45 days after the Commission has issued this notice, file pursuant
to Rule 214 of the Commission's Procedural Rules (18 CFR 385.214) a motion to intervene or notice of intervention and
pursuant to  157.205 of the Regulations under the NGA (18 CFR 157.205) a protest to the request. If no protest
is filed within the allowed time, the proposed activity shall be deemed to be authorized effective the day after the
time allowed for filing a protest. If a protest is filed and not withdrawn within 30 days after the time allowed for filing
a protest, the instant request shall be treated as an application for authorization pursuant to Section 7 of the NGA.

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Issuance of Decisions and Orders During the Week of August 29 Through September 2, 1994 </DOCTITLE>




During the week of August 29 through September 2, 1994 the decisions and orders summarized below were issued with respect
to applications for relief filed with the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the Department of Energy. The following
summary also contains a list of submissions that were dismissed by the Office of Hearings and Appeals. 


Whistleblower Proceeding 




Helen Gaidine Oglesbee, 9/2/94, LWA-0006

 


Helen Gaidine Oglesbee (Oglesbee) filed a request for a hearing on February 28, 1994 under the Department of Energy's
Contractor Employee Protection Program, 10 CFR part 708. Oglesbee had been and is currently an employee of Westinghouse
Hanford Company (WHC). She alleged that she made health and safety complaints to her immediate supervisor from December
1990 to August 1991, and that beginning in October or November 1991, she elevated these concerns to higher management
officials at WHC. Oglesbee maintained that WHC took the following reprisals against her: Failing to respond to her
health-related issues and denying her access to reports and analyses of those issues; removing her designation as
``lead'' secretary; issuing her a performance improvement plan; transferring her involuntarily to another WHC
office; issuing her a performance expectations letter; issuing her written reprimands, and delaying promotions
to Level IV Secretary and to permanent Plant Engineer. The DOE's Office of Contractor Employee Protection investigated
the complaint and found that no reprisals had been taken against Oglesbee that would entitle her to relief under part
708. Oglesbee requested a hearing before the OHA, reasserting her claim that reprisals were taken against her for
raising health and safety concerns. The Hearing Officer in the OHA determined that with regard to certain of the allegations
raised, Oglesbee failed to meet her burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that she made substantial
and specific disclosures concerning health and safety to WHC. In those instances where Oglesbee made protected disclosures
under part 708 followed closely in time by adverse personnel actions, the Hearing Officer found that WHC had proven
by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same actions absent Oglesbee's disclosures, or that
Oglesbee had already been provided an adequate remedy for the actions taken against her. Accordingly, the Hearing
Officer concluded that Oglesbee failed to establish the existence of any violations of the DOE Contractor Employee
Protection Program for which relief was warranted under  708.10. 


Refund Applications 


Enron Corporation/Dow Hydrocarbons and Resources, Inc., 8/29/94, RF340-172 




Dow Hydrocarbons and Resources, Inc. (Dow) submitted an application for refund in the Enron Corporation refund proceeding.
The DOE determined that Dow used Enron propane as a feedstock to produce certain olefins, primarily ethylene, and
therefore was entitled to a refund under the presumption of injury for end-users of Enron products. The total refund
granted to Dow, including interest, is $409,726.

Estate Of Midway Airlines 9/1/94 RF272-92455




The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning the Application for Refund of a claimant in the subpart V crude oil overcharge
refund proceeding. The Application for Refund was based on purchases of petroleum products the applicant used in
its jet airliners. The DOE determined that the applicant had waived its right to receive money from the Crude Oil Subpart
V Special Refund Proceeding. Accordingly, the Application for Refund was denied. 




Koppers Company, Inc., et al., 9/1/94 RC272-241, et al.


 

The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning Applications for Refund submitted in the Subpart V crude oil refund
proceeding by Koppers Company, Inc. and eight of its subsidiaries. All nine of these Applications were previously
granted. All of the applicants, however, were subsequently found to have been affiliated with Kaiser Sand & Gravel
(Kaiser) on August 7, 1986. Kaiser had filed in the Surface Transporters Stripper Well proceeding, and in doing so,
Kaiser had executed a waiver and release waiving its rights and the rights of all its affiliates on August 7, 1986, to
receive a crude oil overcharge refund. Accordingly, this Decision rescinded the original refunds granted to the
nine applicants.




Texaco Inc./Inter City Texaco, 8/30/94 RR321-139




The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting a Motion for Resconsideration filed on behalf of Inter City Texaco in the
Texaco Inc. special refund proceeding. The DOE had previously rescinded a refund granted erroneously to Inter City
(Case Nos. RF321-16561 and RF321-19481). Inter City had been granted a refund based on a schedule of purchases
provided by Texaco, but the OHA later discovered that Inter City was supplied indirectly for the entire price control
period. Inter City then filed a motion for reconsideration estimating its gallonage based on contemporaneous records
referring to gallonage purchases from its supplier, Kenny Larson Oil. We therefore found that Inter City satisfied
all the requirements necessary to obtain a refund in the Texaco proceeding and accordingly, Inter City's Motion for
Reconsideration was granted.




Texaco Inc./Kenny Larson Oil Company, 8/29/94 RF321-20034




Kenneth Larson filed an Application for Refund on behalf of Kenny Larson Oil Company (Larson) requesting a refund
based on purchases of Texaco petroleum products. The DOE approved the application but, because Larson was in default
in its obligations pursuant to a consent order, determined that the refund should be used to fund the firm's escrow
account. Accordingly, the DOE issued a Decision and Order granting the Application and ordering that the refund amount
be transferred from the Texaco Inc. escrow account to the Kenny Larson Oil Company escrow account.

Appeals


Pioneer Press, 09/09/94, LFA-4066



Pioneer Press filed an Appeal from a determination issued to it on June 20, 1994, by the Chief of the FOI and Privacy Acts
Branch of the Reference and Information Management Division (Chief) of the Department of Energy (DOE). In that determination,
the Chief stated that the DOE did not find any documents responsive to the appellant's information request under the
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). In considering the Appeal, the DOE confirmed that the Chief followed procedures
which were reasonably calculated to uncover the requested information, and had therefore undertaken an adequate
search. Accordingly, the DOE denied the Pioneer Press request.

<DOCTITLE>Dimethipin; Request for Comment on Petition To Revoke Certain Feed Additive Regulation </DOCTITLE>




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice; receipt and availability of petition.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document announces the receipt of, and solicits comment on, a petition proposing the revocation of the section
409 feed additive regulation established under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) for dimethipin on
cottonseed hulls. This notice sets forth the basis for the petitioner's proposal and provides opportunity for public
comment.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


I. Introduction


 Statutory Framework


Section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) (21 U.S.C. 346a) authorizes establishment of tolerances
and exemptions from tolerances for the residues of pesticides in or on raw agricultural commodities (RAC's), and
section 409 of the act authorizes promulgation of food additive regulations for pesticide residues in processed
foods (21 U.S.C. 346(a), 348). 
Under section 408 of the act, EPA establishes tolerances, or exemptions from tolerances when appropriate, for pesticide
residues in raw agricultural commodities. Food additive regulations setting maximum permissible levels of pesticide
residues in processed foods are established under section 402 of the act. Section 409 food/feed additive regulations
are required, however, only for certain pesticide residues in processed food. Under section 409(a)(2) of the FFDCA,
no section 409 food/feed additive regulation is required if any pesticide residues in a processed food resulting
from use on a RAC has been removed to the extent possible by good manufacturing practices and is below the tolerance
for that pesticide in or on that RAC. This exemption in section 402(a)(2) is commonly referred to as the ``flow-through''
provision because it allows the section 408 raw food tolerance to flow through to processed food. Thus, a section 409
food additive regulation is only necessary to prevent foods from being deemed adulterated when despite the use of
good manufacturing practices the concentration of the pesticide residues in a processed food is greater than the
tolerance prescribed for the raw agricultural commodity, or if the processed food itself is treated or comes in contact
with a pesticide. Monitoring and enforcement are carried out by the Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and
the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).
The establishment of a food additive regulation under section 409 requires a finding that use of the pesticide will
be ``safe'' (21 U.S.C. 348(c)(3)). Section 409 also contains the ``Delaney Clause,'' which specifically provides
that, with limited exceptions, no additive may be approved if it has been found to induce cancer in man or animals (21
U.S.C. 348(c)(5)).
In setting both section 408 tolerances and section 409 food/feed additive regulations, EPA reviews residue chemistry
and toxicology data. To be acceptable, tolerances must be both high enough to cover residues likely to be left when
the pesticide is used in accordance with its labeling and low enough to protect the public health. With respect to section
408 tolerances, EPA determines the highest levels of residues that might be present in a raw agricultural commodity
based on controlled field trials conducted under the conditions allowed by the product's labeling that are expected
to yield maximum residues. Generally, EPA's policy concerning whether a section 409 food additive regulation is
needed depends on whether there is a possibility that the processing of a raw agricultural commodity containing pesticide
residues would result in residues in the processed food at a level greater than the raw food tolerance.


II. Petition


Uniroyal Chemical Co. has submitted a petition requesting the revocation of the feed additive regulation established
under section 409 of the FFDCA for dimethipin on cottonseed hulls. The following provides background information
and sets forth the basis for the petitioner's request.
The section 408 tolerance for dimethipin on cottonseed is established at 0.5 part per million (ppm) (40 CFR 180.406).
The section 409 feed additive regulation on cottonseed hulls has been established at 0.7 ppm (40 CFR 186.2050). In
a peer review of dimethipin, dated January 5, 1990, EPA classified dimethipin as a Group C (possible human) carcinogen.
Dimethipin is the active ingredient in Harvade harvest growth regulants registered by Uniroyal. Uniroyal claims
that since Harvade is applied to cotton 7 to 14 days before anticipated harvest, a high percentage of the chemical is
deposited on the cotton leaf which subsequently abscises and drops to the soil surface.
Uniroyal Chemical is requesting revocation of the section 409 feed additive regulation for cottonseed hulls because,
they claim, that it is not needed and that revoking it will avoid any inconsistency with the Delaney Clause in section
409 of the FFDCA. According to Uniroyal, concentration of dimethipin in cottonseed hulls does not exceed the section
408 tolerance for cottonseed. 
To support the assertion that there is no concentration in the processed commodity, the Petitioner references a processing
study [MRID No. 42920902], which was submitted as a requirement of reregistration of dimethipin. Uniroyal claims
that this work demonstrates that dimethipin residues do not concentrate in cottonseed hulls (a processed commodity)
when compared with those in ginned cottonseed (a raw agricultural commodity) (MRID No. 42467001 and 42920901). The
study results are summarized below.
In this new processed fraction study, maturing cotton was treated with an exaggerated (2X) rate, resulting in an average
cottonseed residue of 0.563 ppm. Values for cottonseed hulls averaged 0.451 ppm. Only one out of four of the individual
sample concentration factors (values for which are -41%, -30%, -5%, and +7%) suggest a small possibility of concentration.
The mean factor of -17% indicates a net dilution of nearly one-sixth in generating cottonseed hulls from raw cottonseed.
Uniroyal declares that since the 2X rate produced no residue in hulls higher than 0.53 ppm, treatment at the full labeled
1X rate will not have a reasonable probability of producing residues in cottonseed hulls higher than the RAC tolerance
of 0.5 ppm. 
Uniroyal submitted a critique of two previous studies addressing the magnitude of dimethipin residues in cottonseed
and processed fractions. Uniroyal claims that the new study is better documented and more representative of real-world
conditions. In light of new data, the Petitioner urges EPA to reconsider whether a section 409 feed additive regulation
is necessary for dimethipin in cottonseed hulls.
Pursuant to 40 CFR 177.125 and 177.30, EPA may issue an order ruling on the petition or may issue a proposal in response
to the petition and seek further comment. If EPA issues an order in response to the petition, any person adversely affected
by the order may file written objections and a request for a hearing on those objections with EPA on or before the 30th
day after the date of publication of the order (40 CFR 178.20).

substances or non-radioactive hazardous substances to the Site. The price per pound cost for non-radioactive hazardous
substances is $1.9798857. The price per pound for radioactive hazardous substances is $3.9597714. Settlement amounts
are calculated by multiplying these per pound costs by the number of pounds of hazardous substances a party sent to
the Site (Base Amount), adding a premium payment of either 30% or 130% of the Base Amount, as specified by each Respondent
PRP in the AOC, and adding a $200 administrative fee. For parties paying a 30% premium, there is an exception to the covenant
not to sue if total response costs at the Site exceed $10,000,000. For parties paying a 130% premium, there is an exception
to the covenant not to sue if total response costs at the Site exceed $20,000,000. 

For a period of thirty (30) days from the date of this publication, the public may submit comments to EPA relating to
the proposed 

de minimus 

settlement. 

A copy of the proposed AOC may be obtained from Louise Gunderson (8HWM-ER), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,

Commercial Mobile Radio Services; California State Petition To Retain Regulatory Authority Over Intrastate Cellular
Service Rates





<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Communications Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule; order waiving certain pleading rules and denying deferral of filing dates, and dismissing a request
for issuance of public notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The amendments to the Communications Act in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 preempted state rate and
entry regulation of commercial mobile radio services. States were given the opportunity to file petitions for the
authority to continue regulating these intrastate rates. Under Commission rules, this proceeding contemplates
only the filing of comments and replies on the state's petition. This Order waives the prohibition on additional pleadings
found in  20.13(a)(5) of the Commission's Rules and permits additional pleadings to be filed, pursuant to the
terms of  1.45 of the Commission's Rules. The Order also denies a motion filed by Cellular Resellers Association,
Inc., Cellular Service, Inc. and ComTech Mobile Telephone Company to defer filing dates for the filing of replies
for reasons of efficient administration and docket management. This Order also dismisses as moot a Request for Issuance
of a public notice filed by National Cellular Resellers Association.






</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 





Order Waiving Certain Pleading Rules and Denying Deferral of Filing Dates


In the Matter of: Petition of People of the State of California and the Public Utilities Commission of the State of California
to Retain Regulatory Authority Over Intrastate Cellular Service Rates.








Adopted:

 October 7, 1994; 


Released: 

October 7, 1994




By the Chief, Private Radio Bureau:

1. The Commission's rule governing the filing of pleadings in this proceeding contemplates only the filing of comments
and replies on the state's petition to retain authority over intrastate cellular rates. It thus excludes Section
1.45,
 which governs the general filing periods for motions, from the procedural rules which may apply.
 This proceeding, however, raises confidentiality issues that have generated the filing of several motions and requests.

2. We believe that equity requires that we permit interested parties to file nonfrivolous pleadings on confidentiality
and related issues. We thus waive the prohibition of  20.13 on additional pleadings, and permit necessary additional
pleadings to be filed pursuant to the terms of  1.45 of the Commission's Rules.


3. We have also received a Motion to Defer Filing Dates.
 Movants ask that we defer the filing of replies, due October 19, 1994, to either (1) two weeks after opposing parties
file any supplemental comments based on the disclosure of confidential information or (2) two weeks after the Commission
issues a decision denying access to such confidential information. Movants contend that if additional information
is disclosed, this will require supplemental pleadings that will duplicate the October 19 replies and ``needlessly
expand the number of pleadings (and the time involved) for consideration by the Commission.''
 They argue that a grant of the Motion will expedite review by permitting the filing of a consolidated reply. They add
that if additional disclosure is not made, and the Commission moves quickly in reaching that decision, the proposed
procedure will result in only minimal delay.








4. We deny the Motion. As we explained in a recent order granting the parties a 15-day extension to file replies, the
Commission must meet a one-year statutory deadline for ruling on the state's petition and deciding any reconsideration.
We stressed that, ``The Commission is faced with stringent statutory deadlines in a complex and massive proceeding.''
 Although we agree with Movants that disclosure of additional information may require that we permit the parties to
supplement their comments, we cannot now predict whether such additional disclosure will be necessary. We believe
that efficient administration and docket management requires adherence to the October 19, 1994 deadline for filing
replies in this proceeding. For the foregoing reasons, we do not believe that good cause has been shown for the requested
deferral.





5. Pursuant to  0.331 of the Commission's Rules,
 the provisions of  20.13(a)(5) are waived to the extent indicated herein, the Motion to Defer Filing Dates filed
by Cellular Resellers Association, Inc., Cellular Service, Inc., and ComTech Mobile Telephone Company is denied,
and PR Docket No. 94-105 Notice of Ex Parte Contact and Request for Issuance of a Public Notice is dismissed as
moot to the extent indicated herein.

 Readvertisement.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This is a readvertisement of a notice which originally appeared in the 

Federal Register

 on August 16, 1994 (FR 59 42061-42062). Two changes are incorporated: The date for receipt of proposals has been
extended and Item 8 under ``The role of the successful corporate partner * * *'' has been modified.
The complete, revised text reads as follows: 




The National Cancer Institute (NCI) seeks a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company that can effectively pursue
the scientific and commercial generation and development of a panel of monoclonal antibodies against an epidermal
growth factor (EGF)-related peptide, cripto-1 (CR-1). The project is of scientific importance because CR-1
is a protein that exhibits structural homology to the EGF/transforming growth factor 

a

 (TGF

a

) gene family peptides. As such, CR-1 might function as a growth factor or growth inhibitor. Therefore, CR-1
may be important as an autocrine or paracrine modulator in such processes as tumor cell growth, wound repair, neovascularization,
and inflammation. 


NCI has successfully isolated and cloned the gene that encodes CR-1, an EGF-related peptide growth factor that
does not function through the EGF receptor. The NCI has also obtained a rabbit anti-peptide polyclonal antibody that
can detect the expression of CR-1 in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded human tissue sections. CR-1
has been shown to be preferentially and differentially expressed in several different human premalignant lesions
and cancers. The selected sponsor will purify a recombinant CR-1 protein and use this material as an immunogen
to generate anti-CR-1 monoclonal antibodies for use in the diagnosis and prognosis of human cancers.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The NCI is seeking a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company which, after obtaining a license in accordance with
the requirements of the regulations governing the transfer of Government-developed agents (37 CFR part 404), can
purify a recombinant CR-1 protein for which patents are pending or have been issued and to utilize this purified
recombinant CR-1 protein as an immunogen to generate a panel of mouse monoclonal antibodies. The immunoreactive
CR-1 protein has been detected by immunoperoxidase staining using a rabbit anti-peptide polyclonal CR-1
antibody in a majority of human colon cancers, breast cancers, gastric cancers and pancreatic cancers. Little or
no staining was detected in surrounding, noninvolved colon, breast or gastric epithelial cells. In addition, a majority
of premalignant colonic adenomas, breast ductal carcinomas 

in situ

 and gastric intestinal metaplasia express immunoreactive CR-1. 



A recombinant CR-1 protein has been generated using a yeast expression vector in 

Pichia pastoris 

and a partially purified protein obtained. This protein as well as synthetic, refolded peptides that correspond
to the EGF-like domain in CR-1 are mitogenic for human breast cancer cells yet fail to bind to the EGF receptor
or other type I receptor tyrosine kinases. Expression of CR-1 antisense mRNA using a recombinant, replication
defective retroviral expression vector in colon cancer cells that expresses CR-1 inhibits the growth of these
cells 

in vivo 

in nude mice. In order to utilize the diagnostic and therapeutic potentials of CR-1, it will be necessary to purify
a significant amount of the recombinant CR-1 protein to more fully define its biological properties and to identify
the receptor through which it functions. In addition, mouse monoclonal antibodies against the purified CR-1
recombinant protein will expedite screening studies for CR-1 expression in other human premalignant lesions
and cancers and should exhibit more specificity and sensitivity for the detection of CR-1 in tissues by immunocytochemistry
(ICC) or in tissue extracts or serum samples by ELISA. 

The role of the National Cancer Institute, the Division of Cancer Biology, Diagnosis and Centers includes: 

1. NCI will provide expression vectors that encode CR-1 and can be used to produce CR-1 in 

E. coli.

 

2. NCI will provide expression vectors that encode CR-1 in yeast 

Pichia pastoris 

containing several milligrams of recombinant CR-1 protein. 

3. NCI will provide a rabbit polyclonal anti-CR-1 antibody for monitoring CR-1 recovery during the purification
from the yeast conditioned medium. 

4. NCI will assay the purified recombinant CR-1 protein for bioactivity. 

5. NCI will screen anti-CR-1 monoclonal antibodies for reactivity by Western blot analysis against native
CR-1 protein from CR-1 positive human embryonal carcinoma or colon carcinoma cells.

The role of the successful corporate partner will include: 

1. Obtain background license in appropriate fields of use to the relevant Government patent rights. 

2. Purify to homogeneity 30-50 milligrams of CR-1 from 

Pichia pastoris

 conditioned medium. 

3. Provide the purified recombinant CR-1 protein. 

4. Utilize the purified recombinant CR-1 protein to generate mouse anti-CR-1 monoclonal antibodies.


5. Screen anti-CR-1 monoclonal antibodies for specificity, reactivity, and sensitivity toward recombinant
CR-1 protein. 

6. Ascertain whether monoclonal anti-CR-1 antibodies can detect native CR-1 protein in CR-1 positive
human colorectal or embryonal carcinoma cells by radioimmunoprecipitation analysis and by ELISA. 

7. Determine whether anti-CR-1 antibodies can be used for ICC on formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded tissues
known for CR-1 expression. 

8. Provide funds to support associated CRADA-related research expenses including supplies, reagents, travel,
and training. 
Criteria for choosing the collaborating company will include: 

1. Ability to obtain background license to relevant patent rights. 

2. Experience in producing and purifying recombinant proteins, particularly growth factors or cytokines. 

3. Experience in generating and screening monoclonal antibodies. 

4. Willingness to cooperate with the NCI in the collection and evaluation of data. 

5. Willingness to cost share in laboratory studies. 

6. An agreement to be bound by the DHHS rules involving the use of human and animal subjects, and human tissue. 

7. Provisions for equitable distribution of patent rights to any inventions. Generally the rights of ownership are
retained by the organization which is the employer of the inventor, with (1) an irrevocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free
license to the Government (when a company employee is the sole inventor) or (2) an exclusive or nonexclusive license
to the company on terms that are appropriate (when the Government employee is the sole inventor).

Designating a Segment of the Klamath River a Component of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Interior.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Pursuant to the authority granted the Secretary of the Interior by section 2 of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (82 Stat.
906, 16 U.S.C. 1273), and upon proper application of the Governor of the State of Oregon, an 11-mile segment of the Klamath
River is hereby designated as a State-administered component of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. This
action is based on the designation of the river by the State of Oregon and the protection offered this river and its immediate
environment by and pursuant to applicable State laws and regulations.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On April 22, 1993, Oregon Governor Barbara Roberts petitioned the Secretary of the Interior to add a segment of the
Klamath River to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. (See 

Federal Register 

of March 4, 1994, page 10423.) Section 2(a)(ii) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act allows a governor to request that rivers
already protected in a State System be included in the National System. In her application, Governor Roberts requested
that the 11-mile reach of the Klamath River from the J.C. Boyle Powerhouse (river mile 220.3) downstream to the Oregon-California
border (river mile 209.3) be protected as a wild and scenic river. Pursuant to section 2(a)(ii), the river will be managed
by the State of Oregon at no cost to the Federal Government except for those lands currently managed by the Bureau of
Land Management (BLM).


For a State-managed river to be eligible for the National System, three conditions must be met: (1) The river must be
free-flowing and possess at least one ``outstandingly remarkable'' natural, cultural or recreational value, (2)
the river must be part of a State system; and (3) the State must have effective mechanisms in place to protect the outstandingly
remarkable values.
The responsibility for making determinations of eligibility has been delegated to the National Park Service (NPS).
The NPS Pacific Northwest Region conducted a study and environmental assessment with the BLM acting as a cooperating
agency. In February of 1994, the NPS released the Draft Klamath Wild & Scenic River Eligibility Report and Environmental
Assessment for public review and comment. A period for public comment on the report was provided from March 4, 1994,
to April 28, 1994. The draft report was finalized based on comments received. On August 12 the NPS published in the 

Federal Register 

a notice that it had found that designation would not result in impacts significantly affecting the quality of the
environment and invited public comment through September 9. The notice also announced that the river under consideration
had been found eligible for the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System and the State of Oregon had met the criteria for
designation.
This action is taken following public involvement and consultation with the Departments of Agriculture, Army, Energy
and Transportation; the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission; all Department of the Interior agencies; the National
Marine Fisheries Service; the States of Oregon and California; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; and all
other Federal agencies that might have an interest.
Based on the recommendations of the NPS and a review of all relevant documents, I have determined that the 11-mile stretch
of the Klamath River should be designated as a State-administered component of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers
System, as provided for in section 2(a)(ii) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. Notice is hereby given that effective
upon this date, the segment of the Klamath River from the J.C. Boyle Powerhouse to the Oregon-California border is
approved for inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System as a National Scenic River.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Pursuant to section 226 of the Reclamation Reform Act of 1982 (96 Stat. 1273) and 43 CFR 426.20 of the rules and regulations
published in 52 FR 11954, Apr. 13, 1987, Reclamation will publish notice of proposed or amendatory contract actions
for any contract for the delivery of project water for authorized uses in newspapers of general circulation in the
affected area at least 60 days prior to contract execution. Pursuant to the ``Final Revised Public Participation
Procedures'' for water resource-related contract negotiations, published in 47 FR 7763, Feb. 22, 1982, a tabulation
is provided of all proposed contractual actions in each of the five Reclamation regions. Each proposed action is,
or is expected to be, in some stage of the contract negotiation process in 1994. When contract negotiations are completed,
and prior to execution, each proposed contract form must be approved by the Secretary of the Interior, or pursuant
to delegated or redelegated authority, the Commissioner of Reclamation or one of the regional directors. In some
instances, congressional review and approval of a report, water rate, or other terms and conditions of the contract
may be involved. 



Public participation in and receipt of comments on contract proposals will be facilitated by adherence to the following
procedures: 

1. Only persons authorized to act on behalf of the contracting entities may negotiate the terms and conditions of a
specific contract proposal. 

2. Advance notice of meetings or hearings will be furnished to those parties that have made a timely written request
for such notice to the appropriate regional or project office of Reclamation. 

3. Written correspondence regarding proposed contracts may be made available to the general public pursuant to the
terms and procedures of the Freedom of Information Act (80 Stat. 383), as amended. 

4. Written comments on a proposed contract or contract action must be submitted to the appropriate regional officials
at the locations and within the time limits set forth in the advance public notices. 

5. All written comments received and testimony presented at any public hearings will be reviewed and summarized by
the appropriate regional office for use by the contract approving authority. 

6. Copies of specific proposed contracts may be obtained from the appropriate regional director or his designated
public contact as they become available for review and comment. 

7. In the event modifications are made in the form of a proposed contract, the appropriate regional director shall

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Availability of a Draft Environmental Assessment Addressing Genetic Management Options for the Florida
Panther for Review and Comment</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of document availability and public comment period.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announces the availability for public review of a draft Environmental
Assessment addressing genetic management options for the Florida panther, 

Felis concolor coryi. 

A single population estimated to number 30 to 50 adults represents the sole known remaining population in the wild.
This population utilizes approximately 2-3 million acres of habitat on public and privately owned lands in
south Florida. Existing data indicate that the Florida panther will likely to extinct without actions to restore
genetic health to the population. The Environmental Assessment examines four genetic management alternatives
for the panther. The preferred alternative involves a strategy to restore lost gene flow to the panther from a western


Felis concolor 

population. Copies of the draft Environmental Assessment can be obtained by making requests to the address below.
This notice is being furnished under provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act Regulations (40 CFR 1501.7)
to obtain comments from other agencies and the public on the draft Environmental Assessment. Following an appropriate
public comment and review process, the Service intends to evaluate all comments received and select an intended course
of action by December 31, 1994.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 


Background



Restoring endangered or threatened animals or plants to the point where they are again secure, self-sustaining members
of their ecosystems is a primary goals of the Service's endangered species program. The Service will consider all
information presented during the public comment period prior to finalizing and implementing a specific genetic
management strategy for the Florida panther.

The Florida panther is one of the most endangered large mammals in the world. The biological circumstances of geographic
isolation, habitat loss, population reductions, and associated inbreeding have resulted in significant loss of
genetic variability and health of the population. The genetic variability and health of the Florida population must
be restored for the tax on to survive even with adequate habitat preservation and other enhancement measures.

The Florida panther formerly occupied a range comprising much of the southeastern United States. This range was contiguous
with other populations of North American cougars (

Felis concolor 

spp.). The panther is presently restricted to a small relict population in southern Florida numbering 30 to 50 adults.
This population utilizes approximately 2-3 million acres of habitat on public and privately owned lands.

Population declines and associated inbreeding in the Florida panther have resulted in significant losses in genetic
variability and viability. The population exhibits multiple physiological abnormalities that are likely a consequence
of recent close inbreeding. High incidences of maladaptive traits which include reproductive and medical abnormalities
have been observed. Significant among these are: Cryptorchidism (50+% of male population at times), abnormal sperm
(average 93.5% per ejaculate), and atrial septal defects (5 individuals). Furthermore, the Florida panther has
suffered from numerous health problems and infectious diseases that many be a consequence of a defective immune system.

The goal will be to develop and implement a management strategy to restore and maintain the historic genetic character
of the of Florida panther. The objectives will be to reduce the occurrence of inbreeding and restore genetic variability
and vitality of offspring produced and recruited as breeders into a healthier, ore resilient panther population
and to resume the evolutionary adaptive potential by restoring levels of genetic diversity in the Florida population
to levels comparable of other 

Felis concolor 

subspecies in western North America. The identification and implementation of actions needed to accomplish this
goal will be guided by the analysis and evaluation of various alternatives that may be available.



 Public Comments Solicited



The Service solicits written comments on the draft Environmental Assessment. All comments received by the date specified
above will be considered prior to finalizing the Assessment.



Authority



The authority for this action is Section 4(f) of the Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. 1533(f).

<DOCTITLE>Availability of an Environmental Assessment and Receipt of an Application for an Incidental Take Permit for Timbering
Harvesting Activities in Monroe County, AL </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.


 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Ms. Sara N. Bradley (Applicant) is seeking an incidental take permit from the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service),
pursuant to Section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended. The permit would authorize
the take of the Red Hills salamander 

Phaeognathus hubrichti, 

a threatened species, in Monroe County, Alabama, for a period of 2 years. The proposed taking is incidental to a planned
timber harvest on an 80-acre tract of land owned by the Applicant. The tract is located in the eastern 1/2 of the southwest
1/4 of Section 9, Townships 8 North, Range 8 East, Monroe County, Alabama. 





The Service also announces the availability of an environmental assessment (EA) and habitat conservation plan (HCP)
for the incidental take application. Copies of the EA or HCP may be obtained by making a request to the Regional Office
address below. This notice also advises the public that the Service 
has made a preliminary determination that issuing the incidental take permit is not a major Federal action significantly
affecting the quality of the human environment within the meaning of Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969, as amended. The Finding of No Significant Impact is 
based on information contained in the EA and HCP. The final determination will be made no sooner than 30 days from the

date of this notice. This notice is provided pursuant to 
Section 10(c) of the Act and National Environmental Policy Act Regulations (40 CFR 1506.6).

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Red Hills salamander is a plethodontid salamander and the sole member of its genus. Its range is confined to a small
area of southern Alabama. Portions of the Applicant's lands in the Red Hills physiographic province of south-central
Alabama are occupied by this species. The applicant owns 80 acres of timberland within the Red Hills salamander's
historic range in Monroe County. The Applicant's HCP identifies a 15-acre preserve area characterized as having
steep slopes (

>

30 percent), within the Tallahatta and/or Hatchetigbee geologic formations, have moist loamy topsoils, and forested
with naturally occurring mixed hardwood/pine and pine/hardwood trees. Previous status surveys for the species
indicate this to be optimal habitat, with burrow density as high as 5 per 100 square meters. Timber harvesting in the
adjacent streamside management zones, encompassing 16 acres of the property, will be restricted to removal of approximately
20 percent of the canopy coverage. These areas are considered marginal habitat for the Red Hills salamander. On the
remainder of the site (49 acres), normal timber harvesting will be conducted and will result in approximately 40 percent
of the canopy coverage. 



Take incidental to the applicant's harvest plan is expected to occur in the marginally suitable areas, through the
physical crushing of burrows (and thus individuals) from timber felling and removal of large pine trees. Incidental
take of this nature is expected in approximately 5 acres of marginally suitable habitat. Mitigation and minimization
measures identified in the HCP include the preservation of 15 acres of optimal habitat, restrictions of cutting in
marginally suitable areas, restrictions of the use of chemical pesticides and herbicides within and in a 50-foot
buffer of optimum habitat, and training and education of logging personnel. 

The EA considers the environmental consequences of three alternatives, including acceptance of the HCP as submitted,
no action, or the HCP modified for a different mitigation strategy.

<DOCTITLE>General Management Plan; Kaloko Honokohau National Historical Park; Notice of Availability of Final Environmental
Impact Statement </DOCTITLE>





Summary:

 Pursuant to section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, Public Law 91-190, the National
Park Service has prepared a final environmental impact statement (FEIS) on the general management plan (GMP) for
Kaloko-Honokohau National Historical Park, Hawaii County, Hawaii. The general management plan calls for the development
of access and visitor use facilities at the park. Facilities proposed in the park are limited to those essential for
the protection of resources, provision of visitor services, and perpetuation of the Hawaiian culture. They are confined
to areas already disturbed, known not to contain cultural or natural resources, and located away from the coast. Developments
are to be designed to blend in with the historical and open character of the park's landscape. Moreover, they are to
be located so as to not interfere with the traditional Hawaiian activities taking place in the park. 

The draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) was released for public review in October 1992, and the public comment
period closed December 11, 1992. Both the DEIS and the FEIS evaluate the same proposal and three alternatives, and
information in the FEIS is essentially unchanged from the DEIS. The alternatives consist of no action, limited facility
development (minimum requirements), and maximization of vehicle access with more emphasis on recreational use.
The FEIS contains written responses to substantive comments made on the DEIS, as well as minor modifications and clarifications
to the text as appropriate in response to those comments. 



Supplementary Information:

 The no action period on the GMP/FEIS will extend for 30 days after EPA publishes a notice of its availability in the 

Federal Register

. Requests for information on, or copies of the final document should be directed to the Superintendent, Kaloko-Honokohau
National Historical Park, 73-4786 Kanalani Street,

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background



The subject antidumping investigations are being instituted as a result of affirmative preliminary determinations
by the Department of Commerce that imports of certain carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings from France, India, Israel,
Malaysia, the Republic of Korea, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and Venezuela are being sold in the United States at
less than fair value within the meaning of section 733 of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1673b). The Commission instituted the subject
countervailing duty investigations on May 31, 1994 (59 F.R. 37054, July 20, 1994). Both investigations were requested
in a petition filed on February 28, 1994, by the U.S. Fittings Group, Washington, DC, an ad hoc trade association consisting
of five domestic firms: Hackney, Inc., Dallas, TX; Ladish Co., Inc., Cudahy, WI; Mills Iron Works, Inc., Gardena,
CA; Steel Forgings, Inc., Shreveport, LA; and Tube Forgings of America, Inc., Portland, OR. 



Participation in the Investigations and Public Service List 



Any person having already filed an entry of appearance in the countervailing duty investigations is considered a
party in the antidumping investigations. Any other persons wishing to participate in the investigations as parties
must file an entry of appearance with the Secretary to the Commission, as provided in section 201.11 of the Commission's
rules, not later than twenty-one (21) days after publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

. The Secretary will prepare a public service list containing the names and addresses of all persons, or their representatives,
who are parties to the investigations upon the expiration of the period for filing entries of appearance. 




Limited Disclosure of Business Proprietary Information (BPI) Under an Administrative Protective Order (APO) and
BPI Service List



Pursuant to section 207.7(a) of the Commission's rules, the Secretary will make BPI gathered in these final investigations
available to authorized applicants under the APO issued in the investigations, provided that the application is
made not later than twenty-one (21) days after the publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

. A separate service list will be maintained by the Secretary for those parties authorized to receive BPI under the
APO. 



Staff Report

<DOCTITLE>Certain Cased Pencils From Thailand</DOCTITLE>



Determination



On the basis of the record
 developed in the subject investigation, the Commission determines, pursuant to section 735(b) of the Tariff Act
of 1930 (19 U.S.C.  1673d(b)) (the Act), that an industry in the United States is not materially injured or threatened
with material injury, and the establishment of an industry in the United States is not materially retarded, by reason
of imports from Thailand of certain cased pencils,
 provided for in subheading 9609.10.00 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, that have been found
by the Department of Commerce to be sold in the United States at less than fair value (LTFV).






Background



The Commission instituted this investigation effective June 16, 1994, following a preliminary determination by
the Department of Commerce that imports of certain cased pencils from Thailand were being sold at LTFV within the meaning
of section 733(b) of the Act (19 U.S.C.  1673b(b)). Notice of the institution of the Commission's investigation
and of a public hearing to be held in connection therewith was given by posting copies of the notice in the Office of the
Secretary, U.S. International Trade Commission, Washington, DC, and by publishing the notice in the 

Federal Register

 of July 7, 1994 (59 FR 34865). The hearing was held in Washington, DC, on August 25, 1994, and all persons who requested
the opportunity were permitted to appear in person or by counsel.

The Commission transmitted its determination in this investigation to the Secretary of Commerce on October 13, 1994.
The views of the Commission are contained in USITC Publication 2816 (October 1994), entitled ``Certain Cased Pencils

<DOCTITLE>Donald J. and Carol N. McGrady_Continuance in Control </DOCTITLE>
Exemption_Caldwell County Railroad Company 



Donald J. and Carol N. McGrady (petitioners) have filed a notice of exemption to continue in control of Caldwell County
Railroad Company (CCR), upon CCR becoming a class III rail carrier.
 





CCR, a noncarrier, has concurrently filed a notice of exemption in Finance Docket No. 32584, 

Caldwell County Railroad Company_Lease, Operation, and Acquisition Exemption_Norfolk Southern Railway Company

, to lease, operate, and possibly acquire in the future
 approximately 22.7 miles of rail line currently leased by the Carolina & Northwestern Railroad, Inc., and owned
by the Norfolk Southern Railway Company. 





Petitioners also control a nonconnecting class III rail carrier, Southeast Shortlines, Inc., d/b/a Thermal Belt
Railway (SES), that operates approximately 16.4 miles of railroad in southwestern North Carolina. 

Petitioners state that: (1) The properties operated by SES and CCR do not connect with each other; (2) the continuance
in control is not a part of a series of anticipated transactions that would connect the railroads with each other or
any railroad in their corporate family; and (3) the transaction does not involve a class I carrier. Therefore, the
transaction is exempt from the prior approval requirements of 49 U.S.C. 11343. 

See 

49 CFR 1180.2(d)(2). 

As a condition to use of this exemption, any employees affected by the transaction will be protected by the conditions
set forth in 

New York Dock Ry._Control_Brooklyn Eastern Dist., 

360 I.C.C. 60 (1979). 

Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke
will not automatically stay the transaction. Pleadings must be filed with the Commission and served on: Robert A.
Wimbish, Rea, Cross & Auchincloss, Suite 420, 1920 N Street, N.W., Washington, DC 20036.

summary:

 The Department of Justice (Department) and the Federal Trade Commission (Commission) have drafted proposed new
Antitrust Enforcement Guidelines for International Operations. The Guidelines, when adopted in final form by the
Department and the Commission, will state the antitrust enforcement policy of the Department and the Commission
with respect to the international aspects of business operations. The Department's 1988 Antitrust Guidelines for
International Operations will be withdrawn when these draft Guidelines are adopted in final form. Portions of the
1988 guidelines will also be superseded by the Department's proposed Antitrust Guidelines for the Licensing and
Acquisition of Intellectual Property, which recently have been published for public comment in the 

Federal Register

. See 59 FR 41,339 (Aug. 11, 1994). [Comments on these draft Antitrust Enforcement Guidelines for International Operations
should be submitted in writing within 60 days of their publication.]



 




 </SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information:

 These proposed Guidelines were drafted to state the current views of the Department and the Commission on antitrust
enforcement policy with respect to international business operations. The Guidelines are not intended to create
or recognize any legally enforceable right in any person. They are not intended to affect the admissibility of evidence
or in any other way necessarily to affect the course or conduct of any present or future litigation. Moreover, changes
in the relevant statutory framework, legal precedent, and methods of internal Department and Commission analysis
may occur over time, and these changes will not always be simultaneously reflected in amendments to the Guidelines.
Parties seeking to know the Department's or the Commission's specific enforcement intentions should consider using
the Department's Business Review Procedure, see 28 CFR 50.6 (1993), or the Commission's Advisory Opinion procedure.
See 16 C.F.R.   1.1-1.4 (1993).

Antitrust Enforcement Guidelines for International Operations 1994



1. Introduction



For more than a century, the U.S. antitrust laws have stood as the ultimate protector of the competitive process that
underlies our free market economy. Through this process, society as a whole benefits from the best possible allocation
of resources, which in turn maximizes consumer choice and maintains competitive prices.

Although the federal antitrust laws have always applied to foreign commerce, that application is particularly important
today. Throughout the world, the importance of antitrust law as a means to ensure open and free markets, protect consumers,
and prevent conduct that impedes competition is becoming more apparent. The Department of Justice (``the Department'')
and the Federal Trade Commission (``the Commission'' or ``FTC'') (when referred to collectively, ``the Agencies''),
as the federal agencies charged with the responsibility of enforcing the antitrust laws, thus have made enforcement
of the antitrust laws with respect to international operations a top priority. In furtherance of this priority, the
Agencies have revised and updated the Department's 1988 Antitrust Enforcement Guidelines for International Operations,
which are hereby withdrawn.

The 1994 Antitrust Enforcement Guidelines for International Operations (hereinafter ``Guidelines'') are intended
to provide antitrust guidance to businesses engaged in international operations on questions that relate specifically
to the Agencies' international enforcement policy.
 They do not, therefore, provide a complete statement of the Agencies' general enforcement policies. The topics covered
include the Agencies' subject matter jurisdiction over conduct and entities outside the United States and the considerations,
issues, policies, and processes that govern their decision to exercise that jurisdiction; comity; mutual assistance
in international antitrust enforcement; and the effects of foreign governmental involvement on the antitrust liability
of private entities. In addition, the Guidelines discuss the relationship between antitrust and international
trade initiatives. Finally, to illustrate how these principles may operate in certain contexts, the Guidelines
include a number of examples. 





As is the case with all guidelines, users should rely on qualified counsel to assist them in evaluating the antitrust
risk associated with any contemplated transaction or activity. No set of guidelines can possibly indicate how the
Agencies will assess the particular facts of every case. Persons seeking more specific advance statements of enforcement
intentions with respect to the matters treated in these Guidelines should use the Department's Business Review procedure,
the Commission's Advisory Opinion procedure, or one of the more specific procedures described below for particular
types of transactions. 



2. Antitrust Laws Enforced by the Agencies



Foreign commerce cases can involve almost any provision of the antitrust laws.
 The Agencies do not discriminate in the enforcement of the antitrust laws on the basis of the nationality of the parties.
Once jurisdictional requirements and considerations of international comity have been considered and satisfied,
the same substantive rules apply to all. 





The following is a brief summary of the laws enforced by the Agencies that are likely to have the greatest significance
for international transactions. 



2.1 Sherman Act



Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.  1, sets forth the basic antitrust prohibition against contracts, combinations,
and conspiracies in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States or with foreign nations. Section 2 of the
Act, 15 U.S.C.  2, prohibits monopolization, attempts to monopolize, and conspiracies to monopolize any part
of trade or commerce among the several States or with foreign nations. Section 6a of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.  6a,
defines the jurisdictional reach of the Act with respect to non-import foreign commerce.

<TEXT>
 

Violations of the Sherman Act may be prosecuted as civil or criminal offenses. Conduct that the Department prosecutes
criminally is limited to traditional 

per se 

offenses of the law, which typically involve price-fixing, customer allocation, bid-rigging or other cartel activities
that would also be violations of the law in many countries. Criminal violations of the Act are punishable by fines and
imprisonment. The Sherman Act provides that corporate defendants may be fined up to $10 million, other defendants
may be fined up to $350,000, and individuals may be sentenced to up to 3 years' imprisonment.
 The Department has sole responsibility for the criminal enforcement of the Sherman Act. In a civil proceeding, the
Department may obtain injunctive relief against prohibited practices. It may also obtain treble damages if the U.S.
government is the purchaser of affected goods or services.
 Private plaintiffs may also obtain injunctive and treble damage relief for violations of the Sherman Act. Before
the Commission conduct that violates the Sherman Act may be challenged pursuant to the Commission's power under Section
5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, described below.






2.2 Clayton Act


The Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C.  12 

et seq., 

expands on the general prohibitions of the Sherman Act and addresses anticompetitive problems in their incipiency.
 Section 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C.  18, prohibits any merger or acquisition of stock or assets ``where in
any line of commerce or in any activity affecting commerce in any section of the country, the effect of such acquisition
may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly.''
 Section 15 of the Clayton Act empowers the Attorney General, and Section 13(b) of the FTC Act empowers the Commission,
to seek a court order enjoining consummation of a merger that would violate Section 7. In addition, the Commission
may seek a cease and desist order in an administrative proceeding against a merger under either Section 11 of the Clayton
Act or Section 5 of the FTC Act, or both. Private parties may also seek injunctive relief under 15 U.S.C.  26.






Section 3 of the Clayton Act prohibits any person engaged in commerce from conditioning the lease or sale of goods or
commodities upon the purchaser's agreement not to use the products of a competitor, if the effect may be substantially
to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce.
 In evaluating transactions, the trend of recent authority is to use the same analysis employed in the evaluation of
tying under Sherman Act Section 1 to assess a defendant's liability under Section 3 of the Clayton Act.

<TEXT>
 

Section 2 of the Clayton Act, known as the Robinson-Patman Act,
 prohibits price discrimination in certain circumstances. Historically, the Commission has enforced this provision.




2.3 Federal Trade Commission Act


Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (``FTC Act'') declares unlawful ``unfair methods of competition in
or affecting commerce, and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.''
 Pursuant to its authority over unfair methods of competition, the Commission may take administrative action against
conduct that violates the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act, as well as anticompetitive practices that do not fall within
the scope of the Sherman or Clayton Acts. The Commission may also seek injunctive relief in federal court against any
such conduct under Section 13(b) of the FTC Act. Although enforcement at the Commission relating to international
deceptive practices has become increasingly important over time, these Guidelines are limited to the Commission's
antitrust authority under the unfair methods of competition language of Section 5.




2.4 Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976


Title II of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (``HSR Act''), 15 U.S.C.  18a, provides
the Department and the Commission with several procedural devices to facilitate enforcement of the antitrust laws
with respect to anticompetitive mergers and acquisitions.
 The HSR Act requires persons engaged in commerce or in any activity affecting commerce to notify the Agencies of proposed
mergers or acquisitions that would exceed statutory size-of-party and size-of-transaction thresholds,
 to provide certain information relating to reportable transactions, and to wait for a prescribed period_15 days
for cash tender offers and 30 days for all other transactions_before consummating the transaction.
 The Agency may, before the end of the waiting period, request additional information concerning a transaction (make
a ``Second Request'') and thereby extend the waiting period beyond the initial one prescribed, to a specified number
of days after the receipt of the material required by the Second Request_10 days for cash tender offers and 20 days for
all other transactions.








The HSR Act and the FTC rules implementing the HSR Act
 exempt from the premerger notification requirements certain international transactions (typically those having
little nexus to U.S. commerce) that otherwise meet the statutory thresholds.
 Failure to comply with the HSR Act is punishable by court-imposed civil penalties of up to $10,000 for each day a violation
continues. The court may also order injunctive relief to remedy a failure substantially to comply with the HSR Act.
Businesses may seek an interpretation of their obligations under the HSR Act from the Commission.







2.5 National Cooperative Research and Production Act


The National Cooperative Research and Production Act (``NCRPA''), 15 U.S.C.   4301-06, clarifies
the substantive application of the U.S. antitrust laws to joint research and development activities and joint production
activities. Originally drafted to encourage research and development by providing a special antitrust regime for
research and development (``R&D'') joint ventures, the NCRPA requires U.S. courts to judge the competitive
effects of a challenged joint R&D or joint production venture, or a combination of the two, in properly defined
relevant markets and under a rule-of-reason standard. The statute specifies that the conduct ``shall be judged on
the basis of its reasonableness, taking into account all relevant factors affecting competition, including, but
not limited to, effects on competition in properly defined, relevant research, development, product, process,
and service markets.'' 15 U.S.C.  4302. This approach is consistent with the Agencies' general analysis of
joint ventures.





The NCRPA also establishes a voluntary procedure pursuant to which the Attorney General and the FTC may be notified
of a joint R&D or production venture. The statute limits the monetary relief that may be obtained in private civil
suits against the participants in a notified venture to actual rather than treble damages, if the challenged conduct
is within the scope of the notification. With respect to joint production ventures, the National Cooperative Production
Amendments of 1993, Pub. L. No. 103-42, 107 Stat. 117, 119, provide that the benefits of the limitation on recoverable
damages for claims resulting from conduct within the scope of a notification are not available unless (1) the principal
facilities for the production are located within the United States or its territories, and (2) ``each person who controls
any party to such venture (including such party itself) is a United States person, or a foreign person from a country
whose law accords antitrust treatment no less favorable to United States persons than to such country's domestic
persons with respect to participation in joint ventures for production.'' 15 U.S.C.  4306(2) (Supp. 1993).


2.6 Webb-Pomerene Act


The Webb-Pomerene Act, 15 U.S.C.   61-65, provides a limited antitrust exemption for the formation
and operation of associations of otherwise competing businesses to engage in collective export sales. The exemption
applies only to the export of ``goods, wares, or merchandise.''
 It does not apply to conduct that has an anticompetitive effect in the United States or that injures domestic competitors
of the members of an export association. Nor does it provide any immunity from prosecution under foreign antitrust
laws.
 Associations seeking an exemption under the Webb-Pomerene Act must file their articles of agreement and annual reports
with the Commission, but pre-formation approval from the Commission is not required.





2.7 Export Trading Company Act of 1982


The Export Trading Company Act of 1982 (the ``ETC Act''), Pub. L. No. 97-290, 96 Stat. 1234, is designed to increase
U.S. exports of goods and services. It addresses that goal in several ways. First, in Title II, it encourages more efficient
provision of export trade services to U.S. producers and suppliers by reducing restrictions on trade financing provided
by financial institutions.
 Second, in Title III, it reduces uncertainty concerning the application of the U.S. antitrust laws to export trade
through the creation of a procedure by which persons engaged in U.S. export trade may obtain an export trade certificate
of review (``ETCR'').
 Third, in Title IV, it clarifies the jurisdictional rules applicable to non-import cases brought under the Sherman
Act and the FTC Act.
 The Title III certificates are discussed briefly here; the jurisdictional rules are treated below in Section 3.1.






Export trade certificates of review are issued by the Secretary of Commerce with the concurrence of the Attorney General.
Persons named in the ETCR obtain limited immunity from suit under both state and federal antitrust laws for activities
that are specified in the certificate and that comply with the terms of the certificate. To obtain an ETCR, an applicant
must show that proposed export conduct will:
(1) Result in neither a substantial lessening of competition or restraint of trade within the United States nor a substantial
restraint of the export trade of any competitor of the applicant;
(2) Not unreasonably enhance, stabilize, or depress prices in the United States of the class of goods or services covered
by the application;

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941019-2-00120 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941019-2-00080 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(3) Not constitute unfair methods of competition against competitors engaged in the export of the class of goods or
services exported by the applicant; and
(4) Not include any act that may reasonably be expected to result in the sale for consumption or resale in the United
States of such goods or services.





Congress intended that these standards ``encompass the full range of the antitrust laws,'' as defined in the ETC Act.





Although an ETCR provides significant protection under the antitrust laws, it has certain limitations. First, conduct
that falls outside the scope of a certificate remains fully subject to private and governmental enforcement actions.
Second, an ETCR that is obtained by fraud is void from the outset and thus offers no protection under the antitrust laws.
Third, any person that has been injured by certified conduct may recover actual (though not treble) damages if that
conduct is found to violate any of the statutory criteria described above. In any such action, certified conduct enjoys
a presumption of legality, and the prevailing party is entitled to recover costs and attorneys' fees.
 Fourth, an ETCR does not constitute, explicitly or implicitly, an endorsement or opinion by the Secretary of Commerce
or by the Attorney General concerning the legality of such business plans under the laws of any foreign country.




The Secretary of Commerce may revoke or modify an ETCR if the Secretary or the Attorney General determines that the
applicant's export activities have ceased to comply with the statutory criteria for obtaining a certificate. The
Attorney General may also bring suit under Section 15 of the Clayton Act to enjoin conduct that threatens ``a clear
and irreparable harm to the national interest,''
 even if the conduct has been pre-approved as part of an ETCR.




The Commerce Department, in consultation with the Department, has issued guidelines setting forth the standards
used in reviewing ETCR applications.
 The 

ETC Guidelines

 contain several examples illustrating application of the certification standards to specific export trade conduct,
including the use of vertical and horizontal restraints and technology licensing arrangements. In addition, the
Commerce Department's 

Export Trading Company Guidebook


 provides information on the functions and advantages of establishing or using an export trading company, including
factors to consider in applying for a certificate of review. The Commerce Department's Office of Export Trading Company
Affairs provides advice and information on the formation of export trading companies and facilitates contacts between
producers of exportable goods and services and firms offering export trade services.





2.8 Related Legislation
2.81 Wilson Tariff Act


The Wilson Tariff Act, 15 U.S.C.   8-11, prohibits ``every combination, conspiracy, trust, agreement,
or contract'' made by or between two or more persons or corporations, either of whom is engaged in importing any article
from a foreign country into the United States, where the agreement is intended to restrain trade or increase the market
price in any part of the United States of the imported articles, or of ``any manufacture into which such imported article
enters or is intended to enter.'' Violation of the Act is a misdemeanor, punishable by a maximum fine of $5,000 or one
year in prison. The Act also provides for seizure of the imported articles.





2.82 Antidumping Act of 1916


The Revenue Act of 1916, better known as the Antidumping Act, 15 U.S.C.   71-74, is not an antitrust
statute, but its subject matter is closely related to the antitrust rules regarding predation. It is a trade statute
that creates a private claim against importers who sell goods into the United States at prices substantially below
the prices charged for the same goods in their home market. In order to state a claim, a plaintiff must show both that
such lower prices were commonly and systematically charged, and that the importer had the specific intent to injure
or destroy an industry in the United States, or to prevent the establishment of an industry. Dumping cases are more
commonly brought using the administrative procedures of the Tariff Act of 1930, discussed below.


2.83 Tariff Act of 1930


A comprehensive discussion of the trade remedies available under the Tariff Act is beyond the scope of these Guidelines.
However, because antitrust questions sometimes arise in the context of trade actions, it is appropriate to describe
these laws briefly.


2.831 Countervailing Duties


Pursuant to Title VII.A of the Tariff Act,
 U.S. manufacturers, producers, wholesalers, unions and trade associations may petition for the imposition of offsetting
duties on subsidized foreign imports.
 The Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration (``ITA'') must make a determination that the foreign
government in question is subsidizing the imports, and in most cases the International Trade Commission (``ITC'')
must determine that a domestic industry is materially injured or threatened with material injury by reason of these
imports.





2.832 Antidumping Duties

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941019-2-00121 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941019-2-00080 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Pursuant to Title VII.B of the Tariff Act,

34

 parties designated in the statute may petition for antidumping duties, which must be imposed on foreign merchandise
that is being, or is likely to be, sold in the United States at ``less than fair value'' (``LTFV''), if the U.S. industry
is materially injured or threatened with material injury by imports of the foreign merchandise. The ITA makes the
LTFV determination, and the ITC is responsible for the injury decision.





2.833 Section 337 



Section 337 of the Tariff Act, 19 U.S.C. 1337, prohibits ``unfair methods of competition and unfair acts in the importation
of articles into the United States,'' if the effect is to destroy or substantially injure a U.S. industry, or where
the acts relate to importation of articles infringing U.S. patents, copyrights, trademarks, or registered mask
works.

35

 Complaints are filed with ITC. The principal remedies under Section 337 are an exclusion order directing that any
offending goods be excluded from entry into the United States, and a cease and desist order directed toward any offending
U.S. firms and individuals.

36

 The ITC is required to give the Agencies an opportunity to comment before making a final determination.

37

 In addition, the Department participates in the interagency group that prepares recommendations for the President
to approve, disapprove, or allow to take effect the import relief proposed by the ITC. 







2.84 Trade Act of 1974 

2.841 Section 201 



Section 201 of this Act, 19 U.S.C. 2251 

et seq.,

 provides that American businesses claiming serious injury due to significant increases in imports may petition
the ITC for relief or modification under the so-called ``escape clause.'' If the ITC makes a determination that ``an
article is being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause of serious
injury, or the threat thereof, to the domestic industry producing an article like or directly competitive with the
imported article,'' and formulates its recommendation for appropriate relief, the Department participates in
the interagency committee that conducts the investigations and advises the President whether to adopt, modify,
or reject the import relief recommended by the ITC. 



2.842 Section 301 



Section 301 of this Act, 19 U.S.C. 2411, provides that the U.S. Trade Representative (``USTR''), subject to the specific
direction, if any, of the President, may take action, including restricting imports, to enforce rights of the United
States under any trade agreement, to address acts inconsistent with the international legal rights of the United
States, or to respond to unjustifiable, unreasonable or discriminatory practices of foreign governments that burden
or restrict U.S. commerce. Interested parties may initiate such actions through petitions to the USTR, or the USTR
may itself initiate proceedings.

38

 Of particular interest to antitrust enforcement is Section 301(d)(3)(B)(III), which includes among the ``unreasonable''
practices of foreign governments that might justify a proceeding the ``toleration by a foreign government of systematic
anticompetitive activities by private firms or among enterprises in the foreign country that have the effect of restricting
* * * access of United States goods [or services] to purchasing by such firms.''

39

 The Department participates in the interagency committee that makes recommendations to the President on what actions,
if any, should be taken. 






2.9 Relevant International Agreements 



To further the twin goals of promoting enforcement cooperation between the United States and foreign governments
and of reducing any tensions that may arise in particular proceedings, the Agencies have developed close bilateral
relationships with antitrust and competition policy officials of many different countries. In some instances,
understandings have been reached with respect to notifications, consultations, and cooperation in antitrust matters.
In other instances, more general rules endorsed by multilateral organizations such as the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (``OECD'') provide the basis for the Agencies' cooperative policies. Finally, even
in the absence of specific or general international understandings or recommendations, the Agencies often seek
cooperation with foreign authorities. 



2.91 Bilateral Cooperation Agreements 



Formal written bilateral arrangements exist between the United States and the Federal Republic of Germany, Australia,
and Canada.

40

 International antitrust cooperation can also occur through mutual legal assistance treaties (``MLATs''), which
are treaties of general application pursuant to which the United States and a foreign country agree to assist one another
in criminal law enforcement matters. MLATs currently are in force with nearly 20 foreign countries, and many more
are in the process of ratification or negotiation. However, only the MLAT with Canada has been used to date to cover
antitrust offenses.

41

 The Agencies also hold regular consultations with the antitrust officials of Canada, the European Commission, and
Japan, and have close, informal ties with the antitrust authorities of many other countries. Since 1990, they have
cooperated closely with countries in the process of establishing competition agencies, assisted by funding provided
by the Agency for International Development. 






During the week of October 3, 1994, Congress passed H.R. 4781, the International Antitrust Enforcement Assistance
Act of 1994, see n.95 

infra,

 which authorizes the Agencies to enter into antitrust mutual assistance agreements in accordance with the legislation.




2.92 International Guidelines and Recommendations 



The Agencies have agreed with respect to member countries of the OECD to consider the legitimate interests of other
nations in accordance with relevant OECD recommendations.

42

 Under the terms of a 1986 recommendation, the United States agency with responsibility for a particular case notifies
a member country whenever an antitrust enforcement action may affect important interests of that country or its nationals.

43

 Examples of potentially notifiable actions include requests for documents located outside the United States, attempts
to obtain information from potential witnesses located outside the United States, and cases or investigations with
significant foreign conduct or involvement of foreign persons.

3. Threshold International Enforcement Issues



3.1 Jurisdiction



Just as the acts of U.S. citizens in a foreign nation ordinarily are subject to the law of the country in which they occur,
the acts of foreign citizens in the United States ordinarily are subject to U.S. law. The reach of the U.S. antitrust
laws is not limited, however, to conduct and transactions that occur within the boundaries of the United States. Anticompetitive
conduct that affects U.S. domestic or foreign commerce may violate the U.S. antitrust laws regardless of where such
conduct occurs or the nationality of the parties involved. In a world in which economic transactions observe no boundaries,
international recognition of the ``effects doctrine'' of jurisdiction has become widespread.







3.11 Jurisdiction Over Conduct Involving Import Commerce



With respect to foreign import commerce, the Supreme Court has recently in 

Hartford Fire Insurance Co. v. California

 that `'the Sherman Act applies to foreign conduct that was meant to produce and did in fact produce some substantial
effect in the United States.''
 Imports intended for sale in the United States by definition affect the U.S. domestic market directly, and will, therefore,
almost invariably satisfy the intent part of the 

Hartford

 test. Whether they in fact produce the requisite substantial effects will depend on the facts of each case.





Illustrative Example A46





Situation:

 A, B, C, and D, are foreign companies that produce a product in various foreign countries. None has any U.S. production,
nor any U.S. subsidiaries. They organize a cartel for the purpose of raising the price for the product in question.
Collectively, the cartel members make substantial sales into the United States, both in absolute terms and relative
to total U.S. consumption.







Discussion:

 These facts present the straightforward case of cartel participants selling products directly into the United States.
In this situation, the transaction is unambiguously an import into the U.S. market, and the sale is not complete until
the goods reach the United States. Thus, U.S. jurisdiction is clear under the general principles of antitrust law
expressed most recently in 

Hartford Fire

. The facts presented here demonstrate actual and intended participation in U.S. commerce.

3.12 Jurisdiction Over Mergers and Acquisitions Subject to Section 7 of the Clayton Act



The general jurisdictional reach of Section 7 is co-extensive with the reach of the Sherman Act, as a result of the 1980
amendment of the Clayton Act extending it to all matters affecting commerce, which includes trade or commerce with
foreign nations.
 Thus, the Agencies would apply the same principles regarding their foreign commerce jurisdiction to Clayton Section
7 cases as they would apply in Sherman Act cases.





Illustrative Example B





Situation

: Two foreign firms, one in Europe and the other in Canada, account together for 80% of U.S. sales of a particular product.
Neither firm has a U.S. subsidiary, and neither has productive assets in the United States; instead, both serve the
U.S. market purely through direct imports. They enter into an agreement to merge.



Discussion

: As noted above, the jurisdictional provisions of Section 7 of the Clayton Act reach the stock and asset acquisitions
of persons engaged in ``any activity affecting commerce.'' In assessing jurisdiction under Section 7 for international
transactions the Agencies analyze the question of effects on commerce in a manner consistent with the foreign Trade
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1982 (``FTAIA'')
: that is, they look to see whether the effects on U.S. domestic or import commerce are direct, substantial, and reasonably
foreseeable.
 It is appropriate to do so because the FTAIA sheds light on the type of effects Congress considered necessary for foreign
commerce cases, even though the FTAIA itself did not amend the Clayton Act. On the facts of this example, the Agencies
would conclude that Section 7 jurisdiction exists.
 While the transaction may be subject to the terms of the HSR Act (assuming size of person and size of transaction thresholds
are met), it would appear to be exempted by 16 CFR 802.51(b). See Section 4.22 

infra

.







3.13 Jurisdiction Over Conduct Involving Other Commerce



With respect to foreign commerce other than imports, the jurisdictional limits of the Sherman Act and the FTC Act are
delineated in the FTAIA.



3.131 The Foreign Trade Antitrust Improvements Act of 1982



The FTAIA provides, in nearly identical language in both the Sherman Act and the FTC Act, that the statutes:




* * * shall not apply to conduct involving trade or commerce (other than import trade or import commerce) with foreign
nations unless_

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941019-2-00124 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941019-2-00080 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(1) such conduct has a direct, substantial, and reasonably foreseeable effect_
(A) on trade or commerce which is not trade or commerce with foreign nations, or on import trade or import commerce with
foreign nations; or
(B) on export trade or export commerce with foreign nations, of a person engaged in such trade or commerce in the United
States;
 and 




(2) such effect gives rise to a claim under the provisions of [the Sherman Act or the FTC Act], other than this Section.


Illustrative Example C




Situation: 

Companies E and F are the only producers of product Q in country Epsilon, one of the biggest markets for sales of Q in the
world. E and F together account for 90% of the sales of product Q in Epsilon. In order to prevent a competing U.S. producer
from entering the market in Epsilon, E and F agree that neither one of them will purchase or distribute the U.S. product,
and that they will take ``all feasible'' measures to keep the U.S. company out of their market. Without specifically
discussing what other measures they will take to carry out this plan, E and F meet with their distributors and, through
a variety of threats and inducements, obtain agreement of all the distributors not to carry the U.S. product. There
are no commercially feasible substitute distribution channels available to the U.S. producer. Because of the actions
of E and F, the U.S. producer cannot find any distributors to carry its product and is unable to enter the market in Epsilon.


Discussion: 

The agreement between E and F not to purchase or distribute the U.S. product would clearly have a direct and reasonable
foreseeable effect on U.S. export commerce, since it is aimed at a U.S. exporter. The substantiality of the effects
on U.S. exports would depend on the significance of E and F as purchasers and distributors of Q, although on these facts
virtually total foreclosure from the Epsilon market would almost certainly qualify as a substantial effect for jurisdictional
purposes.


3.132 Jurisdiction in Cases Under Subsection 1(A) of FTAIA


To the extent that conduct in foreign countries does not ``involve'' import commerce but does have an ``effect'' on
either import transactions or commerce within the United States, the Agencies apply the ``direct, substantial,
and reasonable foreseeable'' standard of the FTAIA. That standard is applied, for example, in cases in which a cartel
of foreign enterprises, or a foreign monopolist, reaches the U.S. market through any mechanism that goes beyond direct
sales, such as the use of an unrelated intermediary, as well as cases in which foreign vertical restrictions or intellectual
property licensing arrangements have an anticompetitive effect on U.S. commerce.

Illustrative Example D





Situation:

 As in Illustrative Example A, the foreign cartel produces a product in several foreign countries. None of its members
have any U.S. production, nor do any of them have U.S. subsidiaries. They organize a cartel for the purpose of raising
the price for the product in question. Rather than selling directly into the United States, however, the cartel sells
to an intermediary outside the United States, which they know will resell the product in the United States.



Discussion:

 The jurisdictional analysis would change slightly from the one presented in Example A, because not only is the conduct
being challenged entered into by cartelists in a foreign country, but it is also initially implemented through a sale
made in a foreign country. Despite the different test, however, the outcome would remain the same. The existence of
the intermediary would trigger the application of the FTAIA because the conduct would not involve import commerce
within the meaning of the FTAIA and the Agencies would have to determine whether the challenged conduct had ``direct,
substantial and reasonably foreseeable effects'' on U.S. domestic or import commerce. Furthermore, in keeping
with the Supreme Court's admonition in 

Summit Health, Ltd.

 v. 

Pinhas

, 111 S. Ct. 1842, 1847 (1991), the Agencies would focus on the potential harm that would ensue if the conspiracy were
successful, not on whether the alleged unlawful conduct itself had the prohibited effect upon interstate or foreign
commerce.



Illustrative Example E





Situation:

 Widgets are manufactured in both the United States and various other countries around the world. The non-U.S. manufacturers
get together privately outside the United States and agree among themselves to raise prices to specified levels and
take measures to restrict imports into their respective countries, but specifically indicate that sales in the United
States are not covered, and that each company will be free independently to set its prices for the U.S. market. Over
time, however, the cartel members unilaterally begin to sell excess production into the United States as a means by
which to stabilize the existing pact. The resulting sales into the United States affect output and price in the United
States and U.S. exports are impaired.



Discussion:

 This example is intended to highlight the type of effects on U.S. commerce that can result from a price-fixing agreement
that expressly excludes sales in the United States and thus does not involve import commerce within the meaning of
the FTAIA. The jurisdictional issue presented, therefore, is whether the consequence of each party's unilateral
decision to sell into the United States in order to stabilize the agreement is sufficiently direct and reasonably
foreseeable under the FTAIA to satisfy the jurisdictional standard. If the facts showed that certain members of the
cartel independently sold in a manner that was not attributable to the agreement, the Agencies would not have jurisdiction
to challenge the underlying agreement.
 However, if the facts showed that the cartel anticipated affecting the U.S. market as a necessary and indispensable
aspect of the original conspiracy, then the express exclusion of the U.S. market in the price-fixing agreement would
be pretextual. In that case, the cartel would be affecting output and price in the United States, and the sales into
the United States to alleviate pressure on the cartel would be considered sufficiently direct to satisfy the requirements
of the FTAIA. In addition, because the illegal agreement incorporated provisions designed to restrict access to
foreign markets and stymied efforts by U.S. firms to export, the facts would support a conclusion that the agreement's
restraints had a ``direct, substantial and reasonably foreseeable effect'' on the commerce of U.S. exporters. See
infra Sec. 3.133.





3.133 Jurisdiction in Cases Involving Foreign Export Commerce



Two categories of ``export cases'' fall within the FTAIA's jurisdictional test.

First, the Agencies may in appropriate cases take enforcement action against anticompetitive conduct, wherever
occurring, that restrains U.S. exports, if (1) the conduct has a direct, substantial, and reasonably foreseeable
effect on exports of goods or services from the United States, and (2) the U.S. courts can obtain jurisdiction over
the foreign persons or corporations engaged in such conduct.
 As Section 3.2 below explains more fully, if the conduct is unlawful under the importing country's antitrust laws
as well, the Agencies are also prepared to work with that country's authorities if they are better situated to remedy
the conduct, and if they are prepared to take action against such conduct pursuant to their antitrust laws that will
address the U.S. concerns.





Second, the Agencies may in appropriate cases take enforcement action against conduct by U.S. exporters that has
a direct, substantial, and reasonably foreseeable effect on trade or commerce within the United States, or on import
trade or commerce. This can arise in two principal ways. First, if demand in the United States were inelastic or if sellers
not involved in the agreement are unable to increase sales readily, an agreement among U.S. firms regarding the level
of their exports that had a substantial share of the relevant market could reduce supply and raise prices in the United
States.
 Second, conduct ostensibly export-related could affect the price of products sold or resold in the United States.
This kind of effect could occur if, for example, U.S. firms fixed the price of an input used to manufacture a product
overseas for ultimate resale in the United States.

Situation:

 Companies, P, Q, R, and S, organized under the laws of country Alpha, all manufacture and distribute construction
equipment. Much of that equipment is protected by patents in the various countries where it is sold, including Alpha.
The companies all belong to a private trade association, which develops industry standards that are often (although
not always) adopted by Alpha's regulatory authorities. Feeling threatened by competition from the United States,
the companies agree at a trade association meeting (1) to refuse to adopt any U.S. company technology as an industry
standard, and (2) to boycott any distributor of construction equipment that stocks competing U.S. products. The
U.S. companies have taken all necessary steps to protect their intellectual property under the law of Alpha. 

 

Discussion:

 In this example, the collective activity impedes U.S. companies in two ways: Their technology is boycotted (even
if U.S. companies are willing to license their intellectual property) and they are foreclosed from access to existing
distributors who cannot afford to lose the accounts of their major domestic companies. The jurisdictional question
is whether these actions create a direct, substantial, and reasonably foreseeable effect on the exports of U.S. companies.
The mere fact that only the market of Alpha appears to be foreclosed is not enough to defeat such an effect. Only if exclusion
from Alpha as a quantitative measure were so 

de minimis

 in terms of actual volume of trade that there would not be a substantial effect on U.S. export commerce would jurisdiction
be lacking. Given that this example involves construction equipment, a generally highly priced capital good, the
exclusion from Alpha would probably satisfy the substantiality requirement for FTAIA jurisdiction, even if U.S.
exports to Alpha would be expected to amount to only a few machines. This arrangement appears to have been created with
particular reference to competition from the United States, which indicates that the effects on U.S. exports are
both direct and foreseeable. 

 

3.14 Jurisdiction When U.S. Government Finances or Purchases 

 

The Agencies may, in appropriate cases, take enforcement action when the U.S. Government is a purchaser, or substantially
funds the purchase, of goods or services for consumption or use abroad. Cases in which the effect of anticompetitive
conduct with respect to the sale of these goods or services falls primarily on U.S. taxpayers may qualify for redress
under the federal antitrust laws.
 As a general matter, the Agencies consider there to be a sufficient effect on U.S. commerce to support the assertion
of jurisdiction if, as a result of its payment or financing, the U.S. Government bears more than half the cost of the
transaction. For purposes of this determination, the Agencies apply the standards used in certifying export conduct
under the ETC Act of 1982, 15 U.S.C.   4011-21 (1982).
 

 




Illustrative Example G 

 



Situation:

 A combination of U.S. firms and local firms in country Beta create a U.S.-based joint venture for the purpose of building
a major pollution control facility for Beta's Environmental Control Agency (``BECA''). The venture has received
preferential funding from the U.S. Government, which has the effect of making the present value of expected future
repayment of the principal and interest on the loan less than half its face value. Once the venture has begun work, it
appears that its members secretly agreed to inflate the price quoted to BECA, in order to secure more funding. 

 

Discussion:

 The fact that the U.S. Government bears more than half the financial risk of the transaction is sufficient for jurisdiction.
With jurisdiction established, the Agencies would proceed to investigate whether the apparent bid-rigging actually
occurred.

Situation: 

The United States has many military bases and other facilities located in other countries. These facilities procure
substantial goods and services from suppliers in the host country. In country X, it comes to the attention of the local
U.S. military base commander that bids to supply certain construction services have been rigged.


Discussion: 

Sales made by a foreign party to the U.S. Government, including to a U.S. facility located in a foreign country, are
within U.S. antitrust jurisdiction when they fall within the rule of Section 3.13 above. Bid-rigging of sales to the
U.S. Government represents the kind of conduct that can lead to an antitrust action. Indeed, in the United States this
type of behavior is normally prosecuted by the Department as a criminal offense. In practice, the Department has whenever
possible worked closely with the host country antitrust authorities to explore remedies under local law. This has
been successful in a number of instances.





3.2 COMITY


In enforcing the antitrust laws, the Agencies consider international comity. Comity itself reflects the broad concept
of respect among co-equal sovereign nations and plays a role in determining ``the recognition which one nation allows
within its territory to the legislative, executive or judicial acts of another nation.''
 Thus, in determining whether to assert jurisdiction to investigate or bring an action, or to seek particular remedies
in a given case, each Agency takes into account whether significant interests of any foreign sovereign would be affected.






In performing a comity analysis, the Agencies take into account all relevant factors. Among others, these may include:
(1) the relative significance to the alleged violation of conduct within the United States, as compared to conduct
abroad; (2) the nationality of the persons involved in or affected by the conduct; (3) the presence or absence of a purpose
to affect U.S. consumers, markets, or exporters; (4) the relative significance and foreseeability of the effects
of the conduct on the United States as compared to the effects abroad; (5) the existence of reasonable expectations
that would be furthered or defeated by the action; (6) the degree of conflict with foreign law or articulated foreign
economic policies; (7) the effect on foreign enforcement; and (8) the effectiveness of foreign enforcement.
The relative weight that each factor should be given depends on the facts and circumstances of each case. With respect
to the factor concerning foreign law, the Supreme Court made clear in Hartford Fire


 that no conflict exists for purposes of an international comity analysis in the courts if the person subject to regulation
by two states can comply with the laws of both. Bearing this in mind, the Agencies first ask what laws or policies of the
arguably interested foreign jurisdictions are implicated by the conduct in question. There may be no actual conflict
between the antitrust enforcement interests of the United States and the laws or policies of a foreign sovereign.
This is increasingly true as more countries adopt antitrust or competition laws that are compatible with those of
the United States. In these cases, the anticompetitive conduct in question may also be prohibited under the pertinent
foreign laws, and thus the only possible conflict would relate to enforcement practices or remedy. If the laws or policies
of a foreign nation are neutral, it is again possible for the parties in question to comply with the U.S. prohibition
without violating foreign law. Of course, the Agencies take into account comity factors beyond whether there is a
conflict with foreign law. For example, in deciding whether or not to challenge an alleged antitrust violation, the
Agencies would, as part of a comity analysis, consider whether one country either encourages a certain course of conduct
or wishes to leave parties free to choose among different strategies, while another opts to prohibit some of those
strategies.




In lieu of bringing an enforcement action, or course, the Agencies may consult with interested foreign sovereigns
through appropriate diplomatic channels to attempt to eliminate anticompetitive effects in the United States.
If, however, the United States decides to prosecute an antitrust action, such a decision represents a determination
by the Executive Branch that the importance of antitrust enforcement outweighs any relevant foreign policy concerns.
 The Department does not believe that it is the role of the courts to ``second-guess the executive branch's judgment
as to the proper role of comity concerns under these circumstances.
 To date, no Commission cases have presented this issue. It is important also to note that in disputes between private
parties, many courts are willing to undertake a comity analysis.







Illustrative Example I




Situation: 

A group of buyers in one foreign country decide that they will agree on the price that they will offer to suppliers of
a particular product that they procure from overseas. Major suppliers of that product are located in the United States
and the agreement results in substantial loss of sales and capacity reductions in the United States.


Discussion: 

From a jurisdictional point of view, the FTAIA standard appears to be satisfied because the effects on U.S. exporters
presented here are direct and the percentage of supply accounted for by the buyers' cartel is substantial given the
fact that the U.S. suppliers are ``major.'' The Agencies, however, would also take into consideration the comity
aspects presented before deciding whether or not to proceed.
Consistent with its consideration of comity and its obligations under various international agreements, the Agencies
would ordinarily notify the antitrust authority in the cartel's home country. If that authority were in a better position
to address the competitive problem, and were prepared to take effective action to address the adverse effects on U.S.
commerce, the Agencies would consider working cooperatively with the foreign authority or staying their own remedy
pending enforcement efforts by the foreign country. In deciding whether to proceed, the Agencies would weigh the
factors relating to comity set forth above. Factors weighing in favor of bringing such an action include the substantial
harm caused by the cartel to the United States and the fact that the foreign parties purposefully availed themselves
of the benefits of doing business in and with the United States.


3.3 Effects of Foreign Government Involvement


Foreign governments may be involved in a variety of ways in conduct that may have antitrust consequences. To address
the implications of such foreign governmental involvement, Congress and the courts have developed four special
doctrines: The doctrine of foreign sovereign immunity; the doctrine of foreign sovereign compulsion; the act of
state doctrine; and the application of the 

Noerr-Pennington 

doctrine to immunize the lobbying of foreign governments. Although these doctrines are interrelated, for purposes
of discussion the Guidelines discuss each one individually.


3.31 Foreign Sovereign Immunity


The scope of immunity of a foreign government or its agencies and instrumentalities (hereinafter foreign government)
 from the jurisdiction of the U.S. courts for all causes of action, including antitrust, is governed by the Foreign
Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (``FSIA'').
 Subject to the treaties in place at the time of FSIA's enactment, a foreign government is immune from suit except where
designated in the FSIA.







Under the FSIA, a U.S. court has jurisdiction if the foreign government has:
(a) Waived its immunity explicitly or by implication,
(b) Engaged in commercial activity,
(c) Expropriated property in violation of international law,
(d) Acquired rights to U.S. property,
(e) Committed certain torts within the United States, or agreed to arbitration of a dispute.




</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941019-2-00128 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941019-2-00080 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The commercial activities exception is a frequently invoked exception to sovereign immunity under the FSIA. Under
the FSIA, a foreign government is not immune in any case:



* * * in which the action is based upon a commercial activity carried on in the United States by the foreign
state; or upon an act performed in the United States in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere;
or upon an act outside the territory of the United States in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state
elsewhere and that act causes a direct effect in the United States.






``Commercial activity of the foreign state'' is not defined in the FSIA, but is to be determined by the ``nature of the
course of conduct or particular transaction or act, rather than by reference to its purpose.''
 In attempting to differentiate commercial from sovereign activity, courts have considered whether the conduct
being challenged is customarily performed for profit
 and whether the conduct is of a type that only a sovereign government can perform.
 As a practical matter, most activities of foreign government-owned corporations operating in the commercial marketplace
will be subject to U.S. antitrust laws to the same extent as the activities of foreign privately-owned firms.






The commercial activity also must have a substantial nexus with the United States before a foreign government is subject
to suit. The FSIA sets out three different standards for meeting this requirement. First, the challenged conduct
by the foreign government may occur in the United States.
 Alternatively, the challenged commercial activity may entail an act performed in the United States in connection
with a commercial activity of the foreign government elsewhere.
 Or, finally, the challenged commercial activity of a foreign government outside of the United States may produce
a direct effect within the United States, i.e., there is an effect which follows ``as an immediate consequence of the
defendant's * * * activity.''







3.32 Foreign Sovereign Compulsion


Although U.S. antitrust jurisdiction extends to conduct and parties in foreign countries whose actions have the
required effects on U.S. commerce, as discussed above, those parties may find themselves subject to conflicting
requirements from the other country (or countries) where they are located.
 Under 

Hartford Fire

, if it is possible for the party to comply both with the foreign law and the U.S. antitrust laws, the existence of the
foreign law does not provide any excuse for actions that do not comply with U.S. law. However, sometimes a direct conflict
arises when the facts demonstrate that the foreign sovereign has compelled the very conduct that the U.S. antitrust
law prohibits.




In these circumstances, at least one court has recognized a defense under the U.S. antitrust laws, and the Agencies
will also recognize it.
 There are two rationales underlying the defense of foreign sovereign compulsion. First, Congress enacted the U.S.
antitrust laws against the background of well recognized principles of international law and comity among nations,
pursuant to which U.S. authorities give due deference to the acts of foreign governments acting within their own spheres
of authority. A defense for actions taken under the circumstances spelled out below serves to accommodate two equal
sovereigns. Second, important considerations of fairness to the defendant require some mechanism that provides
a predictable rule of decision for those seeking to conform their behavior to all pertinent laws.




Because of the limited scope of the defense, the Agencies will refrain from enforcement actions on the ground of foreign
sovereign compulsion only when certain criteria are satisfied. First the foreign government must have compelled
the anticompetitive conduct in circumstances in which refusal to comply with the foreign government's command would
give rise to the imposition of penal or other severe sanctions. As a general matter, the Agencies regard the foreign
government's formal representation that refusal to comply with its commend would have such a result as being sufficient
to establish that the conduct in question has been compelled, as long as the representation contains sufficient detail
to enable them to see precisely how the compulsion would be accomplished under the local law.
 Foreign government measures short of compulsion do not suffice for this defense, although they can be relevant in
a comity analysis.




Second, although there can be no strict territorial test for this defense, the defense normally applies only when
the foreign government compels conduct which can be accomplished entirely within its own territory. If the compelled
conduct occurs in the United States, the Agencies will not recognize the defense.
 For example, no defense arises when a foreign government requires the U.S. subsidiaries of several firms to organize
a cartel in the United States to fix the price at which products would be sold in the United States, or when it requires
its firms to fix mandatory resale prices for their U.S. distributors to use in the United States.

<PARENT> FR941019-2-00080 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Third, with reference to the discussion of foreign sovereign immunity in Section 3.31 above, the order must come from
the foreign government acting in its governmental capacity. The defense does not arise from conduct that would fall
within the FSIA commercial activity exception. 



Illustrative Example J 





Situation: 

Greatly increased quantities of commodity X have flooded into the world market over the last two or three years, including
substantial amounts indirectly coming into the United States. Because they are unsure whether they would prevail
in an antidumping and countervailing duty case, U.S. industry participants have refrained from filing trade law
petitions. The officials of three foreign countries meet with foreign firms and urge them to ``rationalize'' production
by cooperatively cutting back. The foreign firms agree among themselves to limit production, but there are governmental
penalties contemplated for a failure to do so. 



Discussion: 

In the facts stated here, the Agencies would not find that sovereign compulsion precluded prosecution of this agreement,
assuming for the purpose of this example that the overseas production cutbacks have the necessary effects in the U.S.
market to support jurisdiction. Other doctrines, such as the foreign analog to the domestic 

Noerr-Pennington 

doctrine,
 may also be relevant in these circumstances. 





3.33 Acts of State 
 



As it presently stands, the act of state doctrine is a judge-made rule of federal common law.
 It is a doctrine of judicial abstention based on considerations of international comity and separation of powers,
and applies only if the specific conduct complained of is a public act of the foreign sovereign within its territorial
jurisdiction on matters pertaining to its governmental sovereignty. The act of state doctrine arises when the validity
of the acts of a foreign government constitutes an unavoidable aspect of a case.
 In such cases, courts have refused to adjudicate claims or issues that would require the court to judge the legality
(as a matter of U.S. law or international law) of the sovereign act of a foreign state.
 Although in some cases the sovereign act in question may also compel private behavior, other situations may arise
in which the act imposes no such obligation.
 While the act of state doctrine does not compel dismissal as a matter of course, abstention is appropriate in a case
where the court must ``declare invalid, and thus ineffective as a rule of decision in the U.S. courts,* * *
the official act of a foreign sovereign.''
 









When a restraint on competition arises directly from the act of a foreign sovereign, such as the grant of a license,
award of a contract, expropriation of property, or the like, the Agencies may refrain from bringing an enforcement
action based on the act of state doctrine. For example, the Agencies will not challenge foreign acts of state if the
facts and circumstances indicate that: (1) the specific conduct complained of is a public act of the sovereign, (2)
the act was taken within the territorial jurisdiction of the sovereign, and (3) the matter is governmental, rather
than commercial. 



3.34 Petitioning of Sovereigns 



Under the 

Noerr-Pennington

 doctrine, a genuine effort to obtain or influence action by governmental entities in the United States is immune from
application of the Sherman Act, even if the intent or effect of that effort is to restrain or monopolize trade.
 Whatever the basis asserted for 

Noerr-Pennington

 immunity (either as an application of the First Amendment or as a limit on the statutory reach of the Sherman Act, or
both), the Agencies will apply it in the same manner to the petitioning of foreign governments and the U.S. Government.






Illustrative Example K 





Situation: 

In the course of preparing an antidumping case, which requires the U.S. industry to demonstrate that it has been injured
through the effects of the dumped imports, producers representing 75% of U.S. output exchange the information required
for the adjudication. All the information is exchanged indirectly through third parties and in an aggregated form
that makes the identify of any particular producer's information impossible to discern. 



Discussion: 

Information exchanged by competitors within the context of an antidumping proceeding implicates the 

Noerr-Pennington 

petitioning immunity. To the extent that these exchanges are reasonably necessary in order for them to prepare their
joint petition, which is permitted under the trade laws, 

Noerr 

is available to protect against antitrust liability that would otherwise arise. On these facts the parties are likely
to be immunized by 

Noerr

 if they have taken the necessary measures to ensure that the provision of sensitive information called for by the Commerce
Department and the ITC cannot be used for anticompetitive purposes. In such a situation, the information exchange
is incidental to genuine petitioning and is not subject to the antitrust laws. 

Conversely, were the parties directly to exchange extensive information relating to their costs, the prices each
has charged for the product, pricing trends, and profitability, including information about specific transactions
that went beyond the scope of those facts required for the adjudication, such conduct would go beyond the contemplated
protection of 

Noerr

 immunity.

3.4 Antitrust Enforcement and International Trade Regulation



There has always been a close relationship between the international application of the antitrust laws and the policies
and rules governing the international trade of the United States. Restrictions such as tariffs or quotas on the free
flow of goods affect market definition, consumer choice, and supply options for U.S. producers. In certain instances,
the U.S. trade laws set forth specific procedures for settling disputes under those laws, which can involve price
and quantity agreements by the foreign firms involved. When those procedures are followed, an implied antitrust
immunity results.
 However, agreements among competitors that do not comply with the law, or go beyond the measures authorized by the
law, do not enjoy antitrust immunity. In the absence of legal authority, the fact, without more, that U.S. or foreign
government officials were involved in or encouraged measures that would otherwise violate the antitrust laws does
not immunize such arrangements.







If a particular voluntary export restraint does not qualify for express or implied immunity from the antitrust laws,
then the legality of the arrangement would depend upon the existence of the ordinary elements of an antitrust offense,
such as whether or not a prohibited agreement exists or whether defenses such as foreign sovereign compulsion can
be invoked. 



Illustrative Example L





Situation: 

Six U.S. producers of product Q have initiated an antidumping action alleging that imports of Q from country Sigma
at less than fair value are causing material injury to the U.S. Q industry. The ITC has made a preliminary decision that
there is a reasonable indication that the U.S. industry is suffering material injury from Q imported from Sigma. The
Department of Commerce has preliminarily concluded that the foreign market value of Q imported into the U.S. by Sigma's
Q producers exceeds the price at which they are selling Q in this country by margins of 10 to 40 percent. Sigma's Q producers
jointly initiate discussions with the Department of Commerce that lead to suspension of the investigation in accordance
with Section 734 of the Tariff Act of 1930, 19 U.S.C.  1673c. The suspension agreement provides that each of Sigma's
Q producers will sell product Q in the United States at no less than its individual foreign market value, as determined
periodically by the Department of Commerce in accordance with the Tariff Act. Before determining to suspend the investigation,
the Department of Commerce provides copies of the proposed agreement to the U.S. Q producers, who jointly advise the
Department that they do not object to the suspension of the investigation on the terms proposed. The Department also
determines that suspension of the investigation was in the public interest. As a result of the suspension agreement,
prices in the United States of Q imported from Sigma rise by an average of 25 percent from the prices that prevailed before
the antidumping action was initiated. 



Discussion: 

While an unsupervised agreement among foreign firms to raise their U.S. sales prices ordinarily would violate the
Sherman Act, the suspension agreement outlined above qualifies for an implied immunity from the antitrust laws.
As demonstrated here, the parties has engaged only in conduct contemplated by the Tariff Act and none of the participants
have engaged in conduct beyond what is necessary to implement that statutory scheme.



Illustrative Example M





Situation: 

The Export Association is a Webb-Pomerene association that has filed the appropriate certificates and reports with
the Commission. The Association exports a commodity to markets around the world, and fixes the price at which all of
its members sell the commodity in the foreign markets. Nearly 80% of all U.S. producers of the commodity belong to the
Association, and on a world-wide level, the Association's members account for approximately 40% of annual sales.

<DOCNO> FR941019-2-00131 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941019-2-00080 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 




Discussion:

 The Webb-Pomerene Act addresses only the question of antitrust liability under U.S. law. Although the U.S. antitrust
laws confer an immunity on such associations, the Act does not purport to confer immunity under the law of any foreign
country, nor does the Act compel the members of a Webb-Pomerene association to act in any particular way. Thus, a foreign
government retains the ability to initiate proceedings if such an association allegedly violates that country's
competition law.




4. Personal Jurisdiction and Procedural Rules




4.1 Personal Jurisdiction





The Agencies will bring suit only if they conclude that personal jurisdiction exists under the due process clause
of the U.S. Constitution.
 Section 12 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C.  22, provides that any suit under the antitrust laws against a corporation
may be brought in the judicial district where it is an inhabitant, where it may be found, or where it transacts business.
The concept of transacting business is interpreted pragmatically by the Agencies. Thus, a company may transact business
in a particular district directly through an agent, or through a related corporation that is actually the ``alter
ego'' of the foreign party.
 In all cases, the assertion of personal jurisdiction must satisfy constitutional requirements of minimum contacts
with the United States, such that the proceeding comports with ``fair play and substantial justice.''










4.2 Investigatory Practice Relating to Foreign Nations





In conducting investigations that require documents that are located outside the United States, or contacts with
persons located outside the United States, the Agencies first consider requests for voluntary cooperation when
practical and consistent with enforcement objectives. When compulsory measures are needed, they seek whenever
possible to work with foreign government involved. U.S. law also provides authority in some circumstances for the
use of compulsory measures directed to parties over whom the courts have personal jurisdiction, which the Agencies
may use when other efforts to obtain information have been exhausted or would be unavailing.








Conflicts can arise, however, where foreign statutes purport to prevent persons from disclosing documents or information
for us in U.S. proceedings. However, the mere existence of such statutes does not excuse noncompliance with a request
for information from one of the Agencies.
 To enable the Agencies to obtain evidence located abroad more effectively, as noted in Section 2.91 above. Congress
recently has enacted legislation authorizing the Agencies to negotiate bilateral agreements between antitrust
enforcement agencies to facilitate the exchange or documents and evidence in civil and criminal investigations.









4.22 Hart-Scott-Rodino: Special Foreign Commerce Rules





As noted above in Section 2.4, qualifying mergers and acquisitions, defined both in terms of size of party and size
of transaction, must be reported to the Agencies, along with certain information about the parties and the transaction,
prior to their consummation, pursuant to the HSR Amendments to the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C.  18a.



In some instances, the HSR implementing regulations exempt otherwise reportable foreign transactions.
 First, some acquisitions by U.S. persons are exempt. Acquisitions of foreign assets by a U.S. person are exempt when
(i) no sales in or into the United States are attributable to those assets, or (ii) some sales in or into the United States
are attributable to those assets, but the acquiring person would not hold assets of the acquired person to which $25
million or more of such sales in the acquired person's most recent fiscal year were attributable.
 Acquisitions by a U.S. person of voting securities of a foreign issuer are exempt unless the issuer holds assets in
the United States having an aggregate book value of $15 million or more, or made aggregate sales in or into the United
States of $25 million or more in its most recent fiscal year.










Second, some acquisition by foreign persons are exempt. An exemption exists for acquisitions by foreign persons
if (i) the acquisition is of voting securities of a foreign issuer and would not confer control of a U.S. issuer having
annual net sales or total assets of $25 million or more, or of any issuer with assets located in the United States having
a book value of $15 million or more; or (ii) the acquired person is also a foreign person and the aggregate annual net
sales of the merging firms in or into the United States is less than $110 million and their aggregate total assets in
the United States are less than $110 million.
 In addition, an acquisition by a foreign person of assets located outside the United States is exempt. Acquisitions
by foreign persons of U.S. issuers or assets are not exempt.







Finally, acquisitions are exempt if the ultimate parent entity of either the acquiring or the acquired person is controlled
by a foreign state, and the acquisition is of assets located within that foreign state, or of voting securities of an
issuer organized under its laws.
 The HSR rules are necessarily technical, and should be consulted rather than relying on the summary description herein.

Illustrative Example N




Situation:

 A and B manufacture a consumer product for which there are no readily available substitutes in ten different countries
around the world, including the United States, Canada, Mexico, Spain, Australia, and others. When they decide to
merge, it becomes necessary for them to file premerger notifications in many of these countries, and to subject themselves
to the merger law of all ten.







Discussion:

 Under the OECD 1986 Recommendation, OECD countries notify one another when a proceeding such as a merger review is
underway that might affect the interests of other countries. Within the strict limits of national confidentiality
laws, agencies attempt to cooperate with one another in processing these reviews. This might extend to exchanges
of publicly available information, agreements to let the other agencies know when a decision to institute a proceeding
is taken, and to consult for purposes of international comity with respect to proposed remedial measures and investigatory
methods. The parties can facilitate faster resolution of these cases if they are willing voluntarily to waive confidentiality
protections and to cooperate with a joint investigation. At present neither U.S. law nor foreign laws permit effective
coordination of a single international investigation in the absence of such waivers.

United States District Court for the District of Arizona, United States of America, Plaintiff, Pilkington plc and
Pilkington Holdings, Inc., Defendants. Civil No. 94-00345 WDB.


Response of the United States to Public Comments


Pursuant to Section 2(d) of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act (the ``APPA''), 15 U.S.C.  16(b)-(h),
the United States hereby responds to public comments to the proposed Final Judgment submitted on May 25, 1994, for
entry in the civil antitrust action.
This action began on May 25, 1994, when the United States filed a Complaint alleging that the Defendants violated Section
1 of the Sherman Act by maintaining and enforcing licenses and other agreements that unreasonably restrict the construction
and operation of float glass plants and the use and transfer of float glass process technology within the United States
and around the world. In addition, the Complaint alleges that Defendant Pilkington plc violated Section 2 of the Sherman
Act by wilfully acquiring and maintaining a monopoly in the world market for the design and construction of float glass
plants.
On the same day, the United States and both Defendants filed with the Court, pursuant to Section 2(b) of the APPA, 15
U.S.C.  16(b), a Stipulation submitting for entry a proposed Final Judgment, and a Competitive Impact Statement.
The proposed Final Judgment embodies the relief sought in the Complaint.
During the 60-day period provided by Sections 2(b)-(d) of the APPA, 15 U.S.C.  16(b)-(d), which
expired on September 1, 1994, the United States received three comments concerning the proposed Final Judgment.
The United States attaches hereto a copy of each comment and of each individual response that it made thereto.
Two of the comments were submitted by counsel for PPG Industries, Inc. (``PPG'') and International Technologies
Consultants, Inc. (``ITC''), the respective plaintiffs in two civil actions against Defendant Pilkington plc 

et al. 

currently pending in this Court. The third comment was submitted on behalf of an unidentified client by a Minneapolis,
Minn. lawyer.
The PPG comment asserts that ``[w]hile the Proposed Final Judgment does make it more difficult for Pilkington to continue
these [trade-restraining] practices * * *. the public interest counsels modification or clarification''
thereof in accordance with eleven specific proposals. The ITC comment states that ``[t]he proposed decree represents
an important initial step in eradicating the obviously pernicious and indefensible license provisions, but unfortunately
it stops far short of providing the competitive relief required to definitively eradicate the Pilkington cartel
* * *'' and proposes two specific changes in it. Both comments quote press statements by Pilkington
in justification of their proposals.
In response to both of these comments the United States initially points out that the sole issue currently under consideration
is whether it is in the public interest to enter the proposed Final Judgment submitted to the Court by stipulation.
Entry is in the public interest if the proposed Final Judgment is adequate to remedy the antitrust violations alleged
in the Complaint.

ITC, a U.S.-based company that never had a Pilkington license and that has persistently but so far unsuccessfully
attempted to enter the float glass plant design and construction market, proposes to add a broad injunction against
Defendants' entering or enforcing any contract with a U.S.-based licensee that has the purpose or effect of inhibiting
market entry by U.S.-based non-licensees. PPG, a U.S.-based Pilkington licensee, proposes rendering null and void
all of the U.S.-based licensees' obligations under their respective Pilkington licenses.

In response, the United States agrees that Pilkington's continued efforts to hinder entry and to enforce geographic
and use restrictions against its U.S.-based licensees must be enjoined, and points out that the proposed Final Judgment
achieves those results, albeit with more specifically drawn injunctive provisions that those proposed in the comments.
Thus, Subparagraph IV.A. forbids Defendants to enforce license agreements with U.S.-based licensees insofar as
they contain any contractual limitations or any payment or confidentiality obligations with respect to any technology
that Pilkington disclosed to any U.S. licensee under its licensee agreement, subject to some narrow exceptions that
lack the potential for competitive harm. Analogously, Subparagraph IV.B. forbids Defendants to claim that persons
dealing with U.S.-based entities that have not been licensed by Pilkington are subject to liability under Pilkington's
exclusive rights to float glass know-how, unless such claims are in good faith based on technology that is a misappropriated
Pilkington trade secret specifically identified by Pilkington to the Department of Justice. 

The other comments offered by ITC and PPG propose specific changes of language to the proposed Final Judgment. The
United States has considered each of these, and for the detailed reasons set forth in the attached individual letter
responses, explains why the public interest does not justify withdrawing its consent to entry of the proposed Final
Judgment. 

In the third comment, Minneapolis, Minn. lawyer John A. Grimstad, Esq. proposed several changes to the Judgment out
of concern that they are necessary to protect the interest of his unidentified client, a domestic float glass producer
that acquired its technology by a route not fully explained in the comment, and is uncertain as to where it fits into
the Judgment's taxonomy of actual and potential technology users. Our individual response to Mr. Grimstad, appended
hereto, demonstrates that the Judgment fully protects his client's right to be free of anticompetitive interference
with its operations by Defendants, and that his proposed changes are therefore unnecessary.

In sum, the United States finds no basis in any of the Comments for concluding that the public interest would be served
by withdrawing its consent to entry of the proposed Final Judgment submitted to the Court by stipulation on May 25,
1994. and will request that the Court enter it forthwith.



Supplement to Response



On September 30, 1994, PPG filed an ``Additional Comment''
 reiterating its earlier proposal that Subparagraph IV.D. of the proposed Final Judgment be amended to add to the injunction
against restraining float glass exports to the United States a new provision enjoining Defendants from restraining
exports of float glass from the United States. PPG asserts that documents ``recently produced'' by Pilkington plc
 ``demonstrate the need for the suggested change'' by showing






That Pilkington's conduct * * * is designed to foreclose * * * American manufacturers
from competing with Pilkington in the construction of new plants in foreign countries and, as well, in the export of
glass from the United States to those foreign countries. They suggest that such exclusionary conduct is continuing
to the present day.






Without suggesting that these Pilkington documents lack the probative value that PPG asserts, the Government finds
in them no reason to supplement its prior response to this suggestion. As stated in our individual response letter
to PPG's counsel, at 3, 5-6, the need for the proposed change is obviated by the provisons of Subparagraphs IV.A.
and IV.B., which respectively assure U.S.-based Pilkington licensees and U.S.-based non-licensees freedom to
export float glass from the United States to any point in the world.




Dated: October 6, 1994.

Comments of PPG Industries, Inc. on Proposed Final Judgment, Stipulation and Competitive Impact Statement


PPG Industries, Inc. (``PPG'') comments on the Proposed Final Judgment, Stipulation and Competitive Impact Statement
in 

United States v. Pilkington plc

 as follows:


Preliminary Statement


Pilkington has repeatedly brought vexatious litigation and has attempted to restrain trade under the guise of protecting
the confidentiality of float technology and enforcing license restrictions. While the Proposed Final Judgment
does make it more difficult for Pilkington to continue these practices, Pilkington has already publicly indicated
in its own press releases that it intends to continue engaging in such behavior to the degree that the consent decree
allows it.
For example, on May 26, 1994, the Pilkington press release announcing the terms of this consent decree stated:



The Government's allegations are unproven and would not have survived a test in court. * * * The Consent
Decree * * * recognizes the subsequent evolution of [float] technology and that recent float bath
technology developed by Pilkington will continue to be treated through normal licensing arrangements. * * *
Pilkington's protection and licensing of its total float technology, throughout the rest of the world, remains unaffected.
* * * Pilkington is reassured that the confidentiality of the process is protected and that the normal
licensing arrangements for current and future float glass technology are secure.



Pilkington Press Release, May 26, 1994. As reported in the Financial Times on May 27, 1994, Sir Robin Nicholson, Pilkington's
technology director, said:



We have got what we wanted, in that we retain a substantial amount of proprietary knowledge which we can license in the
normal way.



``Pilkington Emerges with Advantages,'' Financial Times, p. 6, May 27, 1994.


Based on Pilkington's own statements and to prevent continued vexations litigation and trade restraints, PPG submits
that protection of the public interest counsels modification or clarification of the Proposed Final Judgment in
the following limited respects.


Comments


1. Float License Agreements


Change: Paragraph IV.A.1. should be modified to provide: ``All obligations of U.S. LICENSEES in all LICENSE AGREEMENTS
between any defendant and any U.S. LICENSEE are hereby declared null, void and unenforceable. No defendant shall
take any action to invoke, enforce or assert any claim under any such agreement.'' Alternatively, at a minimum, paragraph
IV.A.1 should be modified to add: ``Moreover, no defendant shall enter into, enforce or claim any right under any AGREEMENT
to the extent that it requires any U.S. LICENSEE to: (i) Report and grant back to any defendant all improvement in FLOAT
TECHNOLOGY; (ii) limit exports of FLAT GLASS to any geographic areas; (iii) litigate disputes in an arbitration,
as opposed to a U.S. Court, unless such arbitration permits the application of substantive U.S. antitrust law, including
its provisions for treble damages and attorneys' fees awarded to a prevailing plaintiff; or (iv) prove that the SUBJECT
FLOAT TECHNOLOGY had become publicly known before being relieved of the territorial and use restrictions.''
The references in paragraphs IV.A.2.(b); IV.A.3; IV.B.1; IV.B.2(a); and IV.C to ``trade secret under applicable
law'' should be changed to ``trade secret under applicable law, provided that any applicable non-U.S. trade secret
law will not be applied to permit the protection of items of technology that would be unprotectable under U.S. law.''
Reason for Change: As is set forth in the complaint in 

United States v. Pilkington plc,

 CIV 94-00345-WDB (D. Ariz.) (the ``Complaint''), defendants have used float license agreements (``FLAs'')
to restrain trade and secure monopoly power unlawfully. The Competitive Impact Statement and the Complaint both
note that Pilkington has no intellectual property of substantial value, that, since 1982, Pilkington's remaining
secret unpatented technology consisted largely of engineering solutions with no substantial value over other equally
efficacious engineering alternatives and that one of the devices Pilkington has used to perpetuate its control is
its FLAs, including their burden-shifting clauses, which require licensees to establish the nonexistence of confidential
information in any arbitration. Competitive Impact Statement (``Comp. Imp. Stat.'') at 10; Complaint  24.
If Pilkington is to be allowed to continue to protect its alleged trade secrets, it should be required to prove that
they exist. Pilkington should not be able to shift that burden of proof, as it has done in its FLAs.
Pilkington's grant-back clauses require licensees to report and grant to Pilkington all improvements in float glass
technology. They thus deprive any licensee of the incentives to create innovative technologies, precluding any
competitive advantage to accrue to an innovative licensee and, in effect, discourage efforts to create such technologies.
The grant-back clauses should be invalidated for that reason.
Pilkington also should be precluded from utilizing the FLA arbitration clauses to enforce so-called trade secret
claims. Those clauses have permitted Pilkington to assert claims in a forum that: (a) Is hostile to the application
of U.S. antitrust law; (b) does not recognize the extraterritorial application of U.S. antitrust law and may not recognize
even this Final Judgment; and (c) enforces anticompetitive restrictions not permissible under U.S. antitrust law.
Any issues involving U.S. trade secret law and U.S. antitrust . . . law should be litigated in a forum
that will permit an adjudication and award under those laws.


2. Assertion of Claims Against PPG With Respect to the Use or Licensing of the LB Process


Change: Change paragraph IV.A.1 to provide: ``with respect to the use, licensing or sublicensing of any SUBJECT FLOAT
TECHNOLOGY 

or any process developed with the use or aid of SUBJECT FLOAT TECHNOLOGY.'' Paragraphs IV.A.2.(a) and IV.A.3 also
should be modified accordingly.
Reason for Change: In the Shenzhen Arbitration, which Pilkington filed in 1985 and which continued until 1992, Pilkington
asserted that PPG's LB process was ``tainted'' because it was developed using Pilkington float technology, irrespective
of whether PPG's use was wrongful. That ``taint,'' according to Pilkington, subjected the LB process as a whole to
an obligation of confidence coextensive with that applicable to information that was transferred by Pilkington
to PPG. The design and effect of Pilkington's ``taint'' argument was to make it virtually impossible for any licensee
to develop competing innovative technology free of Pilkington's aggressive claims and litigation, thus further
discouraging and inhibiting the development of innovative technologies by those most likely and able to engage in
such developmental efforts.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941019-2-00136 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941019-2-00081 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Although Pilkington's ``taint'' claim was rejected by the Shenzhen arbitrators, the language of the Proposed Final
Judgment does not clearly resolve the issue and may be used to revive Pilkington's anti-competitive claims. The ambiguity
may be easily remedied by amending the term ``Subject Float Technology'' to encompass technologies developed by
licensees whether or not developed with the use or aid of subject float technology.



3. Confidentiality Provisions



Change: Paragraph IV.A.3.(b) should be changed to read: ``CONFIDENTIALITY of the transferred SUBJECT FLOAT TECHNOLOGY.''

Reason for Change: The reference to FLOAT TECHNOLOGY (instead of SUBJECT FLOAT TECHNOLOGY) appears to be an oversight
because, as drafted, the provision would require licensees to protect the confidentiality of all float technology,
whatever its source. 



4. Litigation Commenced Before the Stipulation Date



Change: Paragraph IV.A.4 should be deleted and paragraph IV.A.1 should be changed to ensure that Pilkington may not
enforce new unadjudicated claims arising under any FLA regardless of whether a proceeding was instituted prior to
the date of the stipulation.

Reason for Change: In August 1992, only two days after the High Court denied Pilkington leave to appeal from the award
in the Shenzhen Arbitration, Pilkington notified PPG of is intent to commence a new arbitration. Although a 1978 Settlement
Agreement between PPG and Pilkington explicitly permits PPG to use the LB process in Canada and Italy, Pilkington
now alleges that PPG's operation of its LB lines in those countries is not permitted because the width of the glass ribbons
in those lines has not always been ``from 70% to 90% of the constant spacing between the sidewalls,'' which Pilkington
argues is required under the Agreement, notwithstanding the fact that any variation in the width of the ribbons at
those lines does not implicate any Pilkington trade secrets or other intellectual-property interests. 

United States antitrust consent decrees commonly provide that the defendants are enjoined from any future enforcement
of anticompetitive restraints. However, paragraph IV.A.4 of the Proposed Final Judgment would permit Pilkington
to continue its monopolistic practices by pursuing its recently commenced arbitration proceedings against PPG
and its subsidiaries to punish PPG for its efforts to end Pilkington's monopolistic interference with United States
trade in the worldwide float technology market. No good reason exists why Pilkington's claims in those proceedings,
in which earnings have not yet commenced, should be exempted from the Proposed Final Judgment.



5. Subsidiaries and Affiliates



Change: Paragraph II.Q should be changed to read: ``U.S. LICENSEE'' means any LICENSEE that was or is incorporated
in the United States, and shall include any subsidiaries, affiliates or parents of any such LICENSEE. * * *''

Reason for Change: As currently constituted, the Final Judgment offers no protection for subsidiaries and affiliates
of U.S. companies, although Pilkington's actions directed at such entities have had and could continue to have anticompetitive
effects in the United States. PPG and other U.S. competitors often participate in float glass manufacturing projects
outside the United States through joint ventures and through their non-U.S. subsidiaries or affiliates. The use
of U.S. licensees of subsidiaries, joint ventures and affiliates is often necessary to accommodate participation
of local investors.

Because effective competition with Pilkington by U.S. Licensees will necessarily entail the use of subsidiaries
and affiliates in foreign countries, PPG's ability to participate in such ventures would be impaired (and U.S. commerce
thereby affected) if Pilkington were free to continue to enforce its monopolistic restrictions against these U.S.-related
entities.



6. Protection of Flat Glass Exports



Change: Paragraph IV.D. should be changed to add ``or from'' to the caption after the word ``to'' and in the second line
of text after the word ``to.''

Reason for Change: The Consent Decree should protect exports from the United States as well as imports to the United
States. Exports from the United States are part of the foreign commerce of the United States and Pilkington and its
subsidiaries and affiliates have engaged in a variety of exclusionary practices, unlawful under the United States
antitrust laws, intended to interfere with export of Float Glass from the United States into, e.g., 

Mexico, Brazil, Argentina and Australia.



7. Perpetual Confidentiality Obligations Should Not Revive Upon the Expiration of This Final Judgment



Change: Paragraph VII.(A) should be changed to provide: ``Other than the provisions of paragraphs IV.A. and B., which
provisions shall remain in effect permanently, this Final Judgment shall expire on the tenth anniversary of its entry.''

</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941019-2-00137 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941019-2-00081 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Reason for Change: The ten-year expiration of the Final Judgment should not leave open an argument that the otherwise
perpetual confidentiality obligations of Pilkington's FLAs somehow revive upon its expiration, as provided in
VII(A).



8. Pilkington Should Not Be Able To Assert U.S. Trade Secret Rights Against Any U.S. Licensee or Non-Licensee



Change: Paragraph IV.A.2 should be changed to read: ``No defendant shall assert against any U.S. LICENSEE any proprietary
FLOAT TECHNOLOGY know-how rights that it may have or claim with respect to any FLOAT TECHNOLOGY.''

Reason for Change: Paragraph 24 of the DOJ Complaint states that ``Pilkington's maintenance and continued enforcement
of the licensee restraints described above was not justified by any intellectual property rights of substantial
value.'' Pilkington's core float glass technology was disclosed in numerous patents that have long expired, placing
that technology in the public domain. Moreover, unpatented Pilkington float glass technology has been publicly
disclosed in substantial part. The Department of Justice has determined that the remaining secret unpatented technology
consists largely of ``engineering solutions with no substantial value over other, equally efficacious engineering
alternatives.'' Complaint  24. Moreover, Attorney General Reno, in announcing the consent decree, said that
``Pilkington had agreed that much of its technology is in the public domain.'' ``British Company Agrees to Settle
Justice Department Antitrust Suit,'' New York Times, p. 1, May 27, 1994.

If Pilkinton no longer holds intellectual property of substantial value, there is no reason why it should be allowed
to assert trade secret rights against any United States licensee or United States non-licensee with respect to any
Float Technology in existence as of the date of the Final Judgment.

Forfeiture of patent rights is a common remedy for the abuse of patent rights giving rise to antitrust violations and
there is no reason that that remedy should not be applied to Pilkington's abuse of its alleged trade secret rights,
particularly in view of the Department's view that its technical information is without redeeming value. Comp. Imp.
Stat. at 10; Complaint   26. Given Pilkington's demonstrated propensity to pursue its monopolistic practices
through unjustified assertions of propriety trade secret rights and given the trivial nature of Pilkington's claimed
``trade secrets,'' there is no sufficient justification for allowing Pilkington to retain these weapons empowering
it to use threats and litigation based on asserted trade secrets to continue to its monopolistic practices. Paragraph
IV.A.2 should be modified accordingly. This suggested change is not meant to prevent Pilkington from seeking to protect
any bona fide trade secrets developed after the date of entry of this Final Judgment.

9. As An Alternative, Pilkington Should be Barred From Asserting Any Trade Secret Rights Based on Information in Existence
Prior to December 31, 1982 and Identify Any Other Trade Secrets on the Basis of Which Pilkington Imposes Any Restraint
of Trade



Change: Paragraph IV.A.2 should be changed to read: ``No defendant shall assert against any U.S. LICENSEE OR U.S.
NON-LICENSEE any proprietary FLOAT TECHNOLOGY know-how rights based on information in existence prior to December
31, 1982, the date referred to in  26 of the Complaint. Within sixty (60) days of entry of this Final Judgment,
Pilkington shall identify and specifically describe any trade secrets developed after December 31, 1982, which
it claims may justify a restraint of trade to the Department of Justice, Antitrust Division; and identify such trade
secret to all U.S. LICENSEES and to all U.S. NON-LICENSEES who shall request the same in writing.

Reason for Change: Should the Department believe it inappropriate to bar defendants from asserting any trade secrets
in existence as of the date of the Final Judgment, the Department should at least bar defendants from imposing restraints
of trade based on technical information in existence prior to December 31, 1982, and require defendants to identify
and specifically describe any trade secret developed after December 31, 1982, which any defendant may claim justifies
a restraint of trade, to the Department of Justice, Antitrust Division; and identify such trade secret to any U.S.
LICENSEE and any U.S. NON-LICENSEE who requests the same.

Such relief is minimally necessary to prevent defendants from continuing to rely on stale claims of trade secrets
and refusing to disclose with reasonable specificity any trade secret created after December 31, 1982, upon which
it may seek to impose a restraint of trade. Without such relief, defendants will be enabled to continue their past practice
of threatening their competitors with litigation based on some ambiguous assertion of trade secret rights. Defendants'
public announcements make it clear that they intend to continue the assertion of some unidentified body of trade secrets,
notwithstanding the Final Judgment. (See pp. 1-2 above.)



10. Justice Department Scrutiny of Litigation Brought by Pilkington



Change: Alternatively, paragraph IV.A.2(b) should be changed to add subparagraphs (iii) and (iv):

(iii) defendant has, within fourteen (14) days after any such assertion:

(a) made a showing in writing to the Department of Justice, Antitrust Division in support of the arguments described
in subparagraphs 2(b)(i) and 2(b)(ii), above;

(b) identified, enumerated, and described such item or combination of items (in sufficient detail and with sufficient
clarity to distinguish them from information not a trade secret under applicable law) on a list submitted to the Antitrust
Division and to the U.S. LICENSEE against whom such right is asserted; and

(iv) such U.S. LICENSEE is unwilling to make lawful and commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the CONFIDENTIALITY
of any such item or combination of items for which it has received actual notice of a defendant's claim of proprietary
rights therein pursuant to subparagraph 2(iii)(b), above, and for which a defendant has made the requisite showing
pursuant to subparagraph 2(iii)(a), above.

Reason for Change: The change is necessary to provide for the same scrutiny for Pilkington suits against licensees
as is provided for suits against non-licensees (as is set forth in paragraph IV.B.2(c)). No adequate justification
exists for discriminating against licensees, especially given that competition has been stultified principally
through use of Pilkington's licensing scheme.



11. Adjudications in Which Information Alleged To Be Confidential by Pilkington Has Been Held To Have Been Publicly
Disclosed or Otherwise Unenforceable and Related Disclosure Obligations



Change: Paragraph IV.G.1. should be changed to replace ``public knowledge in the FINAL AWARD'' with ``public knowledge
found to have been such or otherwise found to be not an enforceable trade secret in the FINAL AWARD or in any other prior
proceeding . . . '' Paragraph IV.G.2(b) also should be modified accordingly.




Paragraph IV.G.2 also should be changed to replace ``public domain'' in subparagraphs (a), (b), and (c) with ``public
knowledge or otherwise not a trade secret'' in each subparagraph.

Reason for Change: The present formulation does not account for unenforceability arising from anything other than
the public disclosure of trade secret information. Information that is claimed as a trade secret also may not be enforceable
if it is readily ascertainable or had not been the subject of adequate precautions to preserve confidentiality. The
change also gives effect to all proceedings to which information alleged to be confidential by Pilkington has been
held to have been publicly disclosed or with respect to which Pilkington's rights have been held unenforceable for
any reason.

Additional Comment of PPG Industries, Inc. on Proposed Final Judgment (Exhibits Filed Under Seal) 

 

PPG Industries, Inc. (``PPG'') submits this Additional Comment on the Proposed Final Judgment in 

United States 

v. 

Pilkington plc

 as follows: 

 Paragraph IV.D of the proposed Final Judgment provides that ``[n]o defendant, with the intent of restraining or limiting
the amount of exports of FLOAT GLASS 

to

 the United States [etc.]''. We have suggested [Comments at 8] that the paragraph should be changed to add ``or from''
after the word ``to.'' 

 Enclosed are documents recently produced by Pilkington in the suit by PPG Industries against Pilkington in the District
of Arizona (No. CIV-92-753-TUC-WDB). Those documents demonstrate the need for the suggested
change. They show, we believe, that Pilkington's conduct, as alleged in the U.S. complaint and in PPG's complaint,
is designed to foreclose PPG and other American manufacturers from competing with Pilkington in the construction
of new plants in foreign countries and, as well, in the export of glass from the United States to those foreign countries.
They suggest that such exclusionary conduct is continuing to the present day. The documents are filed under seal because
they were produced to us on a restricted basis. We therefore suggest that the Court should seek from Pilkington a statement
of the reasonable terms and conditions under which the Court may inspect the documents and obtain comments thereon
from counsel appearing for the United States.

Re: Response to Comment on Proposed Final Judgment U.S. v. Pilkington plc and Pilkington Holdings, Inc., CIV 94-345
TUC WDB (D. Ariz.), filed May 25, 1994




Dear Messrs. Brown and Barr: This letter responds to the Comments of PPG Industries, Inc. [``PPG''] on Proposed Final
Judgment, Stipulation and Competitive Impact Statement 

(``Comments'') submitted to the Antitrust Division over your names on August 13, 1994. The Comments include a ``Preliminary
Statement'' that summarizes certain representations by Defendants to the press that, in your words, indicate that
``Pilkington * * * intends to continue engaging in [its prior anticompetitive] behavior to the degree
that the consent decree allows it.'' You further assert that ``[b]ased on Pilkington's own statements * * *
protection of the public interest counsels modification or clarification of the Proposed Final Judgment'' in eleven
specific ways.
Before addressing your eleven specific proposed changes, we would point out that the text of the proposed Final Judgment
(``Judgment''), rather than Pilkington's characterization thereof in its own press releases, controls what it
will be permitted




and required to do. Thus, contrary to Pilkington's public claim, which you quote, that the restraints Pilkington
has imposed under the guise of ``protection and licensing of its total float technology, throughout the rest of the
world, remain unaffected,'' the Judgment will in fact enjoin Pilkington from anticompetitive practices 

throughout the world 

to the extent that those practices are aimed at U.S.-based entities seeking to use float technology anywhere, or are
aimed at anyone else seeking to use float technology in North America. That is, Pilkington's specified anticompetitive
conduct is enjoined insofar as it is within the jurisdiction of the U.S. antitrust laws. The competitive effect of
Pilkington's ability, also referred to in the portion of Pilkington's press release that you quote, to acquire ``normal
licensing'' of its ``recent float bath technology,'' must be considered in the light of its ready concession to the
United States during settlement negotiations that very little significant technology of that kind exists. A good
measure of the near-absence of such significant recent technology, as you must certainly realize, in that float glass
manufactured in this country by PPG and others who have not been licensed to use this ``recent technology'' has been
quite competitive with Pilkington's subsidiary's production.


The standard we have applied in assessing your eleven specific proposals for modification or clarification is whether
it is in the public interest to enter the Judgment that has been submitted for entry by stipulation. Entry is in the public
interest if the Judgment is adequate to remedy the antitrust violations alleged in the Complaint. 

United States v. Bechtel Corp.

, 1979-1 Trade Cas. (CCH)  62,430 (N.D. Cal. 1979), 

aff'd

, 648 F. 2d 660, 665 (9th Cir. 1981), 

cert. denied

, 454 U.S. 1083 (1982).
1. You propose, in the alternative, to change subparagraph IV.A.1 of the Judgment to provide that all obligations
of U.S. LICENSEES
 under all LICENSE AGREEMENTS are declared null, void, and unenforceable, or alternatively ``at a minimum'' to make
four specific changes in that paragraph. As to your first proposed alternative, the Department of Justice does not
agree that it is in the public interest to withhold entry of the Judgment on the ground that it does not totally render
these agreements null, void, and unenforceable. We believe, rather, that the existing provisions of subparagraph
IV.A. protect the interest of the public by restoring competition and remedying the violation with regard to the ability
of U.S. LICENSEES to compete freely in float glass process technology and float glass markets. In that regard, we would
point out that in the Complaint in 

PPG Industries, Inc. v. Pilkington plc et al.

, Civil Action CIV 92-753 TUC WDB (D. Ariz.) the relief you seek is for the Court to declare null, void, and unenforceable
only ``the anticompetitive restraints in the Pilkington license agreements,'' and not the agreements themselves,
relief that is essentially like that provided in the Judgment rather than that which now you propose.




As an alternative to the above, you make a four-part proposal, to which we have the following responses:


</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941019-2-00141 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941019-2-00081 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(i) The first part of this alternative proposal is that Defendants be enjoined from entering, enforcing, or claiming
rights under any AGREEMENT requiring any U.S. LICENSEE to report or grant back rights to FLOAT TECHNOLOGY improvements.
Inasmuch as all such improvement reporting and grant-back provisions in licenses to U.S. LICENSEES expired long
ago, this proposes an unnecessary addition to the provision of the Judgment.
(ii) The second part of this alternative proposal is that Defendants be enjoined from entering, enforcing, or claiming
rights under any AGREEMENT requiring any U.S. LICENSEE to limit exports of FLAT GLASS to any geographic areas. We note
that Defendants have not imposed express contractual restraints upon the export of glass from the United States by
PPG nor by any other U.S. LICENSEE. Nevertheless, there have been instances when defendants relied upon their patents
in the destination countries to limit or prevent such exports when the U.S. LICENSEE was unable to persuade Defendants
to grant or sell a full waiver of those foreign patent rights. The patents on which Defendants relied for this purpose,
however, have now expired along with their counterpart U.S. patents, denying them the means to carry on this form of
export restraint.
(iii) The third part of this alternative proposal is that Defendants be enjoined from entering, enforcing, or claiming
rights under any AGREEMENT requiring any U.S. LICENSEE to arbitrate rather than litigate disputes unless substantive
U.S. antitrust law is applied. The Judgment will foreclose most such disputes in the future by the prohibitions and
conditions that it places on Defendants' ability to require U.S. LICENSEES to pay FEES, observe LIMITATIONS, or maintain
CONFIDENTIALITY with respect to the use or sublicensing of any SUBJECT FLOAT TECHNOLOGY. Moreover, even prior to
the entry of any judgment herein PPG has obtained the very result that this request seeks. Specifically, we refer to
Judge Browning's finding
That arbitration * * * will not operate as a prospective waiver of PPG's statutory claims due to Pilkington's
express representation and consent to the substantive arbitration or PPG's claims pursuant to U.S. antitrust law.





PPG Industries, Inc. v. Pilkington et al.,

 CIV 92-753-TUC-WDB (D. Ariz. July 9, 1994) (Order Granting Stay and Compelling Arbitration).


(iv) The fourth part of this alternative proposal is that Defendants be enjoined from entering, enforcing, or claiming
rights under any AGREEMENT requiring any U.S. LICENSEE to bear the burden of proving that SUBJECT FLOAT TECHNOLOGY
has become publicly known before being relieved of territorial and use restrictions. Subparagraph IV.A. accomplishes
precisely that result.
2. You propose to expand the coverage of subparagraph IV.A.1. to include processes developed with the use or aid of
SUBJECT FLOAT TECHNOLOGY so as to preclude Defendants' future reassertion of arguments that technology developed
in minds ``tainted'' by prior knowledge of Pilkington technology also belongs to Pilkington. However, the Judgment
precludes Defendants from making such assertions. Any ``taint'' claim by Defendants is enjoined by subparagraph
IV.A.1., inasmuch as it would ``require * * * any U.S. LICENSEE to * * * observe LIMITATIONS,''
LIMITATIONS being defined in subparagraph II.K. as including ``any restriction or limitation, or purported restriction
or limitation, of the use of FLOAT TECHNOLOGY, whether the result of an affirmative prohibition or a limited authorization.''
In the discussions leading to the Stipulation to submit the Judgment to the Court for entry, Defendants' representatives
repeatedly acknowledged to the Department that the taint issue had been resolved against Pilkington in the ``Shenzhen''
arbitration (a point you also make in your comment) and in subsequent judicial review thereof, and that they considered
this a final determination precluding them from again asserting ``taint'' against your client.
3. You propose limiting IV.A.3.(b) by adding the word ``SUBJECT'' just before the words ``FLOAT TECHNOLOGY,'' stating
that we appear to have omitted the word by oversight. Contrary to your assumption, however, the text of this provision
intentionally covers all FLOAT TECHNOLOGY. By omitting the word that your proposal would add, this provision protects
against future Pilkington misappropriation charges any U.S. LICENSEE who transfers any FLOAT TECHNOLOGY (e.g.,
in connection with building a float glass plant abroad). This protection will cover not only charges of misappropriating
SUBJECT FLOAT TECHNOLOGY, i.e., FLOAT TECHNOLOGY disclosed to the U.S. LICENSEE under its LICENSE AGREEMENT, but
also FLOAT TECHNOLOGY that found its way to the U.S. LICENSEE via a third party (e.g., by hiring a former Pilkington
employee) as long as the U.S. LICENSEE, when transferring such technology, includes in the agreement of transfer
``a lawful and commercially reasonable provision requiring the transferee to maintain CONFIDENTIALITY.'' Such
confidentiality provisions are customarily included in technology transfer agreements, so that this provision
imposes no significant burden on U.S. LICENSEES, while protecting them against such claims by Pilkington.
4. You propose deleting subparagraph IV.A.4. and changing subparagraph IV.A.1. to ensure Pilkington cannot pursue
monetary relief in proceedings regardless of when they were instituted, pointing out that in 1992 Pilkington instituted
an additional arbitration proceeding against PPG on a claim growing out of a 1978 settlement concerning LB technology.
Subparagraphs A.1. and A.2. of the Judgment enjoin Defendants' further pursuit of injunctive and declaratory relief
against U.S. LICENSEES' ``violations'' of license restrictions. Subparagraph IV.A.4. creates a narrow exception
that permits Defendants to continue to pursue solely monetary (but not injunctive or declaratory) relief, but only
for past conduct, and only in proceedings instituted before May 25, 1994. Your comment indicates that your concern
about this exception is raised by a single dispute that Pilkington initiated in 1992, one that arose out of a 1978 settlement
of an earlier litigated dispute. The Department of Justice's role in this civil Sherman Act case extends to securing
prospective relief that assures open competition for the benefit of the public. ``[T]he antitrust laws * * *
were enacted `for the protection of competition, not competitors,''' 

Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat,

 429 U.S. 477, 488 (1977), 

quoting Brown Shoe Co. v. United States,

 370 U.S. 294, 320 (1962). To that end, the Judgment enjoins Defendants not only from prospective enforcement of previously
obtained equitable relief but also from the imposition of FEES, as defined in subparagraph II.C., for the prospective
use or sublicensing of SUBJECT FLOAT TECHNOLOGY. Contrarily, the claim to which you allude is limited strictly to
monetary relief for your client for past conduct. Thus, no matter how ill-founded or unjust this Pilkington monetary
claim against PPG may be, its assertion is a private matter and consequently concerns only the private parties involved.

5. You propose including within the definition of U.S. LICENSEE (subparagraph II.Q.) the licensees' subsidiaries,
affiliates, and parents, pointing out that participation by U.S. LICENSEES in off-shore float glass manufacturing
projects is often likely to occur through their subsidiaries or affiliates. While this is undoubtedly correct, such
subsidiaries or affiliates participate in such projects under sublicenses granted to them by their respective U.S.
LICENSEE parents or affiliates. Your proposal is unnecessary since subparagraph IV.A. of the Judgment expressly
enjoins Defendants from conduct interfering with U.S. LICENSEES' sublicensing activities to the same extent as
it enjoins interfering with their use of SUBJECT FLOAT TECHNOLOGY. It may be noted that, in the course of discussions
leading to the Stipulation to submit the Judgment to the Court, Pilkington's representatives acknowledged that
under the Judgment U.S. LICENSEES will be free, through subsidiaries or affiliates, to participate in the design,
construction, and operation of overseas float glass plants such as the Shenzhen plant.


6. You propose broadening the injunctive provisions of subparagraph IV.D., which deal with exports of float glass
from abroad into the United States, to cover exports of float glass from the United States as well. Subparagraph IV.A.
leaves U.S. LICENSEES free to export float glass from this country. Subparagraph IV.B. analogously protects U.S.
NON-LICENSEES from interference with their export of float glass from this country.


7. You propose that the injunctive provisions of subparagraphs IV.A. and IV.B. be made perpetual by exempting them
from the ten-year Judgment duration provision of subparagraph VII.A. because, in your words, the ``Judgment should
not leave open an argument that otherwise perpetual confidentiality obligations'' revive upon the Judgment's expiration.
Trade secrecy obligations are, of course, never perpetual; they last only while the information to which they pertain
has value and is not public. As set forth in Paragraph 24 of our Complaint, the SUBJECT FLOAT TECHNOLOGY, all of which
had been communicated by Pilkington to U.S. LICENSEES by no later than 1982, no longer has substantial value. The prospect
that Defendants would be able to resume interfering with open competition by assertions of confidentiality for the,
by then, even more highly superannuated technology, especially in view of the pro-competitive effects that this
Judgment can be expected to confer during the next decade, are too remote to justify your proposal. Consequently,
the Department does not consider such a change necessary.


8. You propose, in effect, to remove the exceptions to the injunction in Subparagraph IV.A.2. against Defendants'
asserting know-how rights against U.S. LICENSEES with respect to any FLOAT TECHNOLOGY on the ground that we have determined
that Pilkington's core float glass technology currently lacks substantial value. We continue strongly to believe
that this assessment of the value of Pilkington's technology is correct, of course. For that reason, Subparagraph
IV.A.2.(a) enjoins Defendants from asserting against all U.S. LICENSEES that are not subsidiaries of Defendants
any proprietary claims as to the FLOAT TECHNOLOGY disclosed to the licensees under the license agreement (except
for the reservation in Subparagraph IV.A.4. of money damage claims for past conduct that, as has already been discussed
in Item 4, above, does not affect the public interest). In addition, Subparagraph IV.A.2.(b) enjoins Defendants
from asserting any proprietary claims against such licensees as to other FLOAT TECHNOLOGY, (i.e., technology that
the licensee did not obtain under the license but that Defendants nevertheless claim is theirs, unless the claim is
based on a good faith argument that the technology in question is a legally cognizable trade secret and that it was unlawfully
acquired). Subparagraph IV.A.2. therefore properly protects U.S. LICENSEES from unjustified assertions of know-how
rights by Defendants.


9. You propose, as an alternative to your Proposal No. 8, changes to the language of Subparagraph IV.A.2. that would
categorically bar Defendants' assertion against U.S. LICENSEES of (1) rights in pre-1983 know-how and (2) trade
secrets developed after that date that a Defendant, in your words, ``claims may justify a restraint of trade,'' unless
such trade secrets have been disclosed to the Department and to all U.S. LICENSEES and U.S. NON-LICENSEES who request
it. You state that without such a provision Defendants will be able to continue to threaten competitors with ambiguous
assertions of trade secret rights. We agree that it is important that Defendants be prevented from continuing such
illegal conduct, but are certain that the Judgment will enjoin it. Subparagraph IV.A.2. absolutely bars Defendants
from making such claims against U.S. LICENSEES with respect to SUBJECT FLOAT TECHNOLOGY (which in view of the already-discussed
1982 cut-off of improvement disclosures to all U.S. LICENSEES refers to pre-1983 technology), and limits such assertion
by Defendants, when dealing with other FLOAT TECHNOLOGY, to instances where they have good faith arguments that they
are asserting rights to subject matter that qualifies as legally recognized trade secrets and also that the U.S. LICENSEE
in question has obtained the subject matter unlawfully. Subparagraph IV.B.2. similarly protects U.S. NON-LICENSEES
from such future conduct. Given the protection afforded by subparagraphs IV.A.2. and IV.B.2., the additional disclosure
requirements are unnecessary.


10. You propose to add to subparagraph IV.A.2. requirements that Defendants must satisfy before asserting know-how
rights against U.S. LICENSEES that are as exacting as the subparagraph IV.B.2. requirements that apply when Defendants
assert such claims against U.S. NON-LICENSEES. Although it may initially seem appropriate to impose the same requirements
on Pilkington regardless of whether it asserts such alleged rights against U.S. LICENSEES or U.S. NON-LICENSEES,
the differences in how the two groups gain access to Pilkington technology provides the basis for imposing different
requirements in the two situations. U.S. LICENSEES originally obtained the SUBJECT FLOAT TECHNOLOGY under their
respective licenses, an information flow, as we have already noted herein, that ended in 1982. Subparagraph IV.A.2.(a)
absolutely bars Defendants' claims against U.S. LICENSEES based on such old technology; thus, Defendants would
have to establish that any claim they make against a U.S. LICENSEE not only meets the requirements of subparagraphs
IV.A.2.(b) but also that the technology in question was obtained by the U.S. LICENSEE after 1982. The requirement
for such a showing substantially diminishes the need for the kind of additional showing in claims against U.S. LICENSEES
that you propose. By contrast, claims that Defendants might make against U.S. NON-LICENSEES could cover pre-1983
technology as well as that of later origin, making the provisions of IV.B.2. (c) and (d) far more important as safeguards
against anticompetitive assertions of such know-how rights.

11. Finally, you propose to extend Defendants' obligation pursuant to subparagraph IV.G.1. to identify the FLOAT
TECHNOLOGY found to be public knowledge in the FINAL AWARD entered in the Shenzhen arbitration so that it also requires
such identification for material ``otherwise found not to be a trade secret in the FINAL AWARD or in any other proceeding.''
You further propose a similar change for subparagraph IV.G.2(b). Such changes would be counterproductive. Contrary
to loose assertions made on Defendants' behalf that the Shenzhen arbitrators determined what Pilkington technology
still merits trade secret status, they made no such determination but rather determined only that certain items had
not been proven to be in the public domain. There is no basis in law for the assertion implied by the proposed change,
i.e., that any subject matter not in the public domain is entitled to trade secret protection. Such a formulation would
ignore, inter alia, the requirement that alleged trade secrets must have value to merit legal or equitable protection.
PPG, having been a party to this arbitration, already knows what this provision of the Judgment requires Defendants
to disclose; it is thus primarily for the benefit of PPG's competitors.
For the reasons noted above the Department of Justice does not believe that it would be in the public interest to forego
entry of the Judgment for failure to incorporate any of your proposed changes. We nevertheless greatly appreciate
your interest in this matter.

Comments of International Technologies Consultants, Inc. Regarding Proposed Final Judgment, Stipulation and
Competitive Impact Statement


International Technologies Consultants, Inc. (``ITC'') comments on the Proposed Final Judgment, Stipulation,
and Competitive Impact Statement in 

United States v. Pilkington plc and Pilkington Holdings, Inc. 

as follows:

Preliminary Statement



ITC, in the parlance of the proposed final decree, is a U.S. NON-LICENSEE. ITC competes in the sale of float process
technology on a worldwide basis, using float technology which it independently developed from information in the
public domain, supplemented by sound engineering practice and extensive expertise in the construction of float
process facilities. ITC is not, nor has it ever been, a Pilkington licensee. ITC's business activities are confined
to the worldwide marketing of float process technology and associated engineering and technical services. ITC has
no involvement in the production or distribution of manufactured glass.

The government complaint, proposed decree and the competitive impact statement evolved from a CID investigation
of the license arrangements between Pilkington and its licensees, the principal focus of which was the variety of
license provisions utilized by Pilkington illegitimately to perpetuate its patent monopoly of float process technology.
(See complaint,   27.) The Department's conclusion that the Pilkington licensing scheme constitutes
an illegal effort to perpetuate and maintain its monopoly far beyond the expiration of the core float process patents
and its consequent decision to confront this deeply entrenched, aggressive foreign-based cartel is to be commended.
The proposed decree represents an important initial step in eradicating the obviously pernicious and indefensible
license provisions, but unfortunately it stops far short of providing the competitive relief required to definitely
eradicate the Pilkington cartel, thereby finally permitting a competitive environment to exist in the flat glass
industry.

The need to revisit and rethink the efficacy of the proposed decree with a view to tightening its provisions was amply
demonstrated by the reaction of senior Pilkington officials to the filing of the litigation. The company's May 26,
1994 press release dismisses the government case as unprovable, and unworthy of the cost and time required to achieve
judicial vindication. The Release then describes the official Pilkington interpretation of the decree as follows:




The Consent Decree * * * recognizes the subsequent evolution of float technologies
and that some recent float bath technology developed by Pilkington will continue to be treated through normal licensing
arrangements. Pilkington's protection and licensing of its total float technology throughout the rest of the world,
remains unaffected. * * * Pilkington is reassured that the confidentiality of the
processes is protected and that the normal licensing arrangements for current and future float glass technology
are secure.






These comments must be read against the evidentiary record developed by the Division via its CID investigation which
unambiguously demonstrates that Pilkington deliberately, and with full knowledge of the illegality of its actions
under United States antitrust law, proceeded to adopt and aggressively implement its illegal licensing scheme in
order to shore up its monopoly position to combat the erosion of its patent base. Given its longstanding distaste for
antitrust law as enforced in the United States (a common malady among British corporate officials), which continues
unabated as evidenced by the above referenced reaction of its senior officials to the instant litigation, common
sense and prudence dictates that the Department must take unusual precautions to ensure that the substantial time
and public monies expended in the investigation and prosecution of this worldwide cartel translates into lasting
and meaningful pro-competitive results.



Because ITC is a U.S. NON-LICENSEE, its specific comments relative to the proposed decree reflect its perspective
as one as one of the few non-Pilkington licensees to make a sustained effort to enter the float process design market
in competition with Pilkington and its licensees. ITC defers to the U.S. LICENSEES in respect of the efficacy of the
proposed decree in addressing the anti-competitive license provisions of particular concern to them.

a. Discussions





Part B_Litigation of the Competitive Impact Statement (``CIS'') at pp. 12 and 13 describes the litigation by Pilkington
against AFG and Guardian, respectively, to prevent them from violating the territorial provisions of their respective
licenses with Pilkington, thereby eliminating (or at least carefully controlling) competition between each of
them and Pilkington. The CIS alludes to the fact that both cases were settled on the basis, 

inter alia

, that each licensee defendant would abandon its aggressive competition with Pilkington, thereby preserving the
Pilkington cartel against uncontrolled competition from its own licensees.
 Significantly, the CIS omits any mention of another important element of the aforesaid settlement, namely agreements
with each such defendant licensee to cooperate (conspire) with Pilkington to forestall the emerging competition
from non-licensees which threatened to undermine the Pilkington cartel by entering the float process technology
market and ending the cartel's control over both the production and sale of flat glass.





ITC recognizes that the Department opted to file suit against Pilkington before it had proceeded very far with its
broader investigation of the above-described collusive conduct among Pilkington and various key licensees designed
to protect the cartel against the entry of NON-LICENSEE competitors over whom the cartel would have no control. Through
discovery undertaken largely subsequent to the filing of the government suit, ITC gained access to and reviewed many
of the documents previously submitted to the Department in response to the CIDs. The CID documents pertaining to the
conspiracy issue deeply implicate two of the U.S. LICENSEES_AFG and Guardian_who are principal beneficiaries of
the proposed decree, along with various other U.S. NON-LICENSEES. This documentary record is sufficiently compelling
that in the normal course the Division would have been expected to proceed with CID depositions and otherwise aggressively
pursue the investigation. In our view, had the Division completed the comprehensive formal investigation justified
by the evidence in its possession before filing its complaint, not only would there have been a broader complaint involving
more parties, but the proposed decree would of necessity have been much more comprehensive. As it is, ITC must now secure
relief against this broad conspiratorial conduct through its own litigation efforts.

Be that as it may, the complaint and proposed decree as filed nonetheless represents an important first step in a long
overdue attack upon longstanding anti-competitive license provisions which Pilkington used in its increasing
futile effort to prop up its monopoly position vis-&agrave;-vis its own licensees as its key patents expired. As noted,
the principal beneficiaries of the lawsuit and the decree as currently structured are the U.S. LICENSEES who have
finally achieved an important measure of freedom to engage in meaningful competition with Pilkington. However,
neither the complaint nor the proposed decree displays any understanding of the critically important competitive
role played by the U.S. NON-LICENSEES, nor does the decree contain provisions essential to enable U.S. NON-LICENSEES
to freely enter and compete in the float process technology market, thereby achieving an even broader pro-competitive
effect. It is, in short, all well and good for the government to take action which permits AFG, Guardian and other U.S.
LICENSEES to free themselves from the anti-competitive constraints central to the Pilkington licensing scheme.
However, U.S. NON-LICENSEES also have a right to expect their government to protect them from blatantly anti-competitive
conduct undertaken by certain U.S. LICENSEES, albeit at the insistence of a foreign cartel manager desperate to protect
itself against the competitive in-roads of NON-LICENSEE competitors. Indeed, one would expect that the Department
would have a particularly acute interest, not to mention a solemn obligation, to ensure that, at the very least, Pilkington
is enjoined from enforcing or implementing any agreements or understandings extracted from any of its Licensees
as a condition to the settlement of litigation it initiated. Further, given what the evidence in the government's
possession reveals, it is incumbent upon the Department to take corrective action to eliminate the remaining barriers
to entry by U.S. NON-LICENSEES, thereby finally achieving and creating a truly competitive marketplace.

b. Proposed Corrective Language



ITC proposes that a new paragraph 5 be added at the end of IV A at page 7, to wit:




5. Defendants shall neither enter into any agreement or understanding, whether written or oral, and any U.S. LICENSEE,
nor enforce or implement any existing such agreement or understanding, having the purpose or effect of preventing,
interfering with, or otherwise handicapping efforts by U.S. NON-LICENSEES to enter the float process technology
market anywhere in the world.





In addition, the Department should accelerate this critically important phase of its investigation and indicate
via issuance of a press release that the investigation of alleged conspiratorial conduct among Pilkington and its
licensees is continuing. The Department would be derelict in its duties were it to stand idle given the evidence in
its possession.



2. Preventing Defendants From Using Assertions of Proprietary Float Technology Know-How Rights or Claims of Confidentiality
To Preclude or Retard Efforts by U.S. NON-LICENSEES To Enter the Float Technology Process Market



a. Discussion



For decades Pilkington has been highly successful in discouraging prospective clients from dealing with U.S. NON-LICENSEES
simply by asserting that Pilkington had been the first to develop float process technology and thus had the exclusive
worldwide right to use or license that technology, and that for anyone to secure such technology from non-Pilkington
sources was to invite litigation. This mantra has been repeated so often and so categorically by Pilkington and its
allies that at this point in time many potential clients simply accept the primacy of Pilkington in float process-technology
as an immutable given_baseless though it may be. This pattern of Pilkington conduct_fraudulent claims of exclusivity
and confidentiality, accompanied by threats of litigation (should the use of non-Pilkington float process technology
be contemplated) to prospective customers, competing sources of technology and float technology and sources of
capital, materials and supplies, has continued at least through the spring of 1994.

Given this unbroken record of illegal conduct, the resulting deeply entrenched cartel, and the substantial economic
harm caused thereby, it is obvious that the relief proposed in Section IV.B.2 of the proposed decree falls woefully
short of the mark. In the first place, defendants having such a record of illegal conduct are hardly entitled to any
benefit of the doubt regarding their alleged good faith in asserting proprietary float technology know-how rights
and claims of confidentiality; to the contrary, the burden of proof regarding such assertions must necessarily rest
upon Pilkington, rather than upon the victims of its repeated acts of illegality. Indeed, as proposed, the decree
language invites precisely the sort of protracted exercise which places prospective new entrants at a fatal disadvantage.
Further, the decree must contain a mechanism for fairly, quickly and effectively resolving any disputes regarding
proprietary know-how or confidentiality in a neutral setting, and defendants must be enjoined from making any assertions
regarding know-how rights and confidentiality unless and until their position is vindicated through the dispute
resolution mechanism.

More particularly, Section IV.B.2 should be replaced in its entirety by the following:




2. No defendant shall assert against U.S. NON-LICENSEES (other than in respect of Agreements referred to in subparagraph
B.1. above) any alleged proprietary FLOAT TECHNOLOGY Know-how rights (including any claim of Confidentiality)
that it or any U.S. LICENSEE claims to have with respect to any FLOAT TECHNOLOGY offered by U.S. NON-LICENSEES anywhere
in the world, or communicate to third parties regarding any such assertions or claims, unless for each such claim the
following occurs:

a. Defendants shall have the burden of describing in writing with specificity the item of float technology covered
by each claim and shall provide a detailed statement setting forth the basis for the claim;

b. a copy of the aforesaid statements shall be served upon the Court, the U.S. NON-LICENSEE involved and the Department
of Justice;


c. the U.S. NON-LICENSEE and the Department shall serve any reply thereto to the court and Pilkington within fourteen
(14) days of receipt of the Pilkington specification of allegations;

2d. unless the matter is resolved via negotiations between or among the defendants and the U.S. NON-LICENSEES within
five (5) days, the court shall appoint a special master knowledgeable in float technology to conduct an inquiry to
determine whether defendants have met their burden, and will promptly file a written report and recommendation to
the court; 

e. the court will enter an appropriate order;

f. only if the court order supports the claim will defendants then be permitted to notify others of the trade secrets
rights and claims of confidentiality against any U.S. NON-LICENSEE; and 

g. Pilkington will pay all costs should it not prevail.




ITC recognizes that such a dispute resolution mechanism has a regulatory flavor and that the Department often disfavors
regulatory decrees. However, several factors militate strongly in favor of such an approach in the unique circumstances
here presented. First, the proposed truth seeking process would be triggered at the earliest stage of the dispute,
before the invariably corrosive and damaging false accusations circulate among prospective clients, sources of
financial support and suppliers. A somewhat similar approach proved potentially useful in evaluating Guardian's
trade secrets claims against ITC and Euroglas. Procedural ambiguities, confusion about the format and Guardian's
reluctance to participate at the critical early stage in the process substantially compromised the proceeding,
but all such potential problems have been eliminated from the mechanism proposed above. The clean bill of health ultimately
achieved by ITC in the Euroglas situation unfortunately had little practical effect because Guardian had had a year
to fraudulently disparage the ITC design before the report was issued. This difficulty is avoided in the proposed
mechanism by enjoining Pilkington from making such characterizations until and unless it had met its burden of proof,
which both creates an incentive for Pilkington to cooperate in seeking an early resolution of the dispute and prevents
the circulation of fraudulent assertions until the process has been completed.

<TEXT>
 

Second, there is little danger that the court and the parties will be inundated by a flood of hypertechnical disputes
about know-how and confidentiality claims. Once the burden of proof is placed upon Pilkington_where it obviously
belongs, coupled with the requirement that a detailed specification of the basis of the claim be prepared and shared
with the accused party, the era of generalized and vague allegations of impropriety and veiled threats of litigation
will finally end. Indeed, there is every likelihood that the dispute resolution mechanism would need to be used perhaps
only once, to initially and definitively clear the air regarding the usual litany of Pilkington allegations of impropriety
by U.S. NON-LICENSEES. Once the U.S. NON-LICENSEE passed its initial litmus test, there is little likelihood that
Pilkington would have much stomach for insisting upon rematches, and the U.S. NON-LICENSEE would be free to immediately
enter the market place and would do so. Apart from the 

sui generis

 Muliaglass situation, the Pilkington cartel, aided by various U.S. LICENSEES and others, has succeeded in preventing
every effort by U.S. NON-LICENSEES from entering the float process technology market, all of which entrenches the
myth that Pilkington, by virtue of divine right, is the exclusive worldwide source of such technology. In sum, once
the Pilkington canards about know-how rights and confidentiality are exposed for the empty shells they are, as ITC
is confident they would be by the proposed procedure, the walls of the cartel will finally crumble and the forces of
competition will finally prevail.


Conclusion


ITC recognizes that the proposed decree is the product of considerable negotiations between the Department and Pilkington
and that to press Pilkington further in hopes of achieving the additional relief described above may jeopardize the
deal. So be it. The Antitrust Division has rarely been exposed to a cartel with the reach, longevity and anti-competitive
consequences of the Pilkington cartel. The evidence of willfulness and of liability, as we both know, is unusually
rich and unambiguous. The world business community, upon whom the Antitrust Division quite properly devotes considerable
time and public resources in order to both demonstrate the commitment of the U.S. government to aggressive enforcement
of the U.S. antitrust laws and the important public benefits to be derived therefrom, has long been aware of Pilkington
and its success in creating and maintaining its worldwide cartel. Thus, should the Division lack the tenacity and
commitment to principle to insist that the decree be amended in order to meaningfully eradicate this particularly
pernicious, long-lived cartel, the message received by the many observers of the antitrust scene will be most unfortunate.
That message, however unfair from your perspective, is that the Antitrust Division lacks the will to litigate potentially
protracted cases, preferring instead to settle for the appearance of progress by accepting what has been characterized
as a ``sleeves off the vest'' type of decree. At some point, in some case, the Department must demonstrate that this
message is incorrect; that in the appropriate circumstances, the Division will litigate aggressively and fearlessly
in order to fully vindicate the public interest. ITC submits that the Pilkington case_should Pilkington be unwilling
to renegotiate the decree to satisfy the concerns expressed above_is the perfect vehicle for the Division to use for
this purpose and ITC urges it to do so.

Kenneth C. Anderson, Esq., 


Anderson, Aukamp & Gingold, 1201 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Suite 821, Washington, DC 20004




Re: Response to Comments on Proposed Final judgment U.S. v. Pilkington plc and Pilkington Holdings, Inc. Civ 94-345
TUC WDB (D. Ariz.), filed May 25, 1994




Dear Mr. Anderson: This responds to the Comments of International Technologies Consultants, Inc. Regarding Proposed
Final Judgment, Stipulations and Competitive Impact Statement (``Comments'') submitted to the Antitrust Division
over your signature on September 1, 1994. The Comments, in addition to making a Preliminary Statement that characterizes
the proposed Final Judgment (``Judgment'') and summarizes certain representations by Defendants to the press concerning
the effect that they expect it to have on their future conduct, proposes two specific changes to be made before the Judgment
is entered.

Before addressing your specific proposals for change, we would point out that the text of the proposed Final Judgment
(``Judgment''), rather than Pilkington's characterization thereof in its own press releases controls what it will
be permitted and required to do. Thus, contrary to Pilkington's public claim, which you quote, that the restraints
Pilkington has imposed under the guise of ``protection and licensing of its total float technology, throughout the
rest of the world, remain unaffected,'' the Judgment will in fact enjoin Pilkington from anticompetitive practices
throughout the world

 to the extent that those practices are aimed at U.S.-based entities seeking to use float technology anywhere, or are
aimed at anyone else seeking to use float technology in North America. That is, Pilkington's specified anticompetitive
conduct is enjoined insofar as it is within the jurisdiction of the U.S. antitrust laws. The competitive effect of
Pilkington's ability, also referred to in the portion of Pilkington's press release that you quote, to continue ``normal
licensing'' of its ``recent float bath technology,'' must be considered in the light of its ready concession to the
United States during settlement negotiations that very little significant technology of that kind exists. A good
measure of the near-absence of such significant recent technology is that float glass manufacture by those who have
not been licensed to use this ``recent technology'' has been quite competitive with Pilkington's and its subsidiaries'
production.

The standard we have applied in assessing your specific proposals for modification or clarification is whether it
is in the public interest to enter that Judgment that has been submitted for entry by stipulation. Entry is in the public
interest if the Judgment is adequate to remedy the antitrust violations alleged in the Complaint.

 United States v. Bechtel Corp., 

1979-1 Trade Cas. (CCH)  62,430 (N.D. Cal. 1979), 

aff'd, 

648 F. 2d 660, 665 (9th Cir. 1981), 

cert. denied,

 454 U.S. 1083 (1982).

Your first proposed change is to add, at the end of Subparagraph IV.A., a provision enjoining Defendants from entering,
enforcing, or implementing any contract having the purpose or effect of preventing, interfering with, or otherwise
handicapping efforts by U.S. NON-LICENSEES
 to enter the float process technology market anywhere in the world. It is the Department's view that, although the
conduct proscribed by the proposed amendment would clearly be unlawful, this proposed amendment would be redundant
inasmuch as Subparagraph VI.B. adequately protects against such conduct by enjoining Defendants from employing
the means it heretofore relied upon to achieve its anticompetitive ends, i.e., making unjustified assertions of
intellectual property rights against putative entrants and their customers, financing sources, suppliers, and
the like.





Second, your Comments propose different conditions than those contained in Subparagraph IV.B.2. of the Judgment
to govern the circumstances under which Defendants can avoid violating that provision's injunction against asserting
certain know-how rights vis-a-vis U.S. NON-LICENSEES. The proposed amendment would require this Court, each time
such an assertion is made, to appoint a Special Master to determine whether Defendants have proven an adequate basis
for the assertion unless the matter is resolved by negotiation. (Your proposal would require ``Pilkington [to] pay
all costs should it not prevail'' in such a proceeding, but is silent as to who would pay the Special Master's costs if
Defendants do prevail.) Your proposal would thus delete from the Judgment provisions that require defendants to
justify in writing to the Department of Justice assertions of the kind that your proposal would submit to Special masters.
In the Department's view, requiring this Court to appoint a Special Master whenever such an assertion fails to be resolved
by negotiation would not assure, to a sufficiently greater extent than the provisions of the proposed Final Judgment,
that Defendants will henceforth desist from claiming know-how rights that are unjustified.

For the reasons stated above the Department of Justice does not believe that it would be in the public interest to forego
entry of the Judgment for failure to incorporate any of your proposed changes. We nevertheless greatly appreciate
your interest in this matter.




   Sincerely,

Ms. Gail Kursh,



Chief, Professions and Intellectual Property Section, 
Room 9903, U.S. Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, 555 4th Street, NW., Washington, DC 20001




Dear Ms. Kursh: These comments are given to the proposed Final Judgment set out in the Notice of the Department of Justice,
Antitrust Division, dated June 14, 1994, respecting United States 

v. 

Pikington plc and Pilkington Holdings, Inc., 

United States District Court for the District of Arizona, Civil Action No. 94-345, filed May 25, 1994 (the ``Civil
Action''). 



Definitions



Capitalized terms used in these comments without definition will have the meanings accorded to them by the proposed
Final Judgment. The ``Competitive Impact Statement'' is the Competitive Impact Statement filed in the Civil Action
pursuant to Section 2(b) of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act (15 U.S.C. 15(b)).



Introduction



In Article I.A. of the Competitive Impact Statement, the Department of Justice (``DOJ'') summarizes the seven (7)
categories of activity allegedly engaged in by the Defendants in violation of the antitrust laws and the three (3)
categories of relief sought by the Complaint to eliminate such activities. At Article III of the Competitive Impact
Statement, DOJ summarizes how the competition favorable elements of the Final Judgment will, in effect, stop the
seven (7) categories of activity and thereby ``* * * eliminate any residual anticompetitive effects
of the restrictive license agreements and other conduct challenged by the Complaint.'' 

The competition favorable elements are: 

Element Number 1: * * * [T]he Final Judgment would eliminate all territorial and use limitations [Defendants]
imposed on [their] U.S. licensees and allow them to manufacture on their own or sublicense any third party to do so anywhere
in the world * * *.''

Element Number 2: The Final Judgment will create ``* * * a similar `safe harbor' for any other American
individual or firm who is not a Pilkington float glass licensee to use any float technology 

in its position

 without liability to [Defendants]. (Emphasis supplied).

Element Number 3: The Final ``* * * Judgment would enjoin certain conduct having the purpose or effect
of restricting exports of float glass to the United States * * *.''

Element Number 4: The Final ``* * * Judgment would enjoin the [D]efendants from making certain adverse
representations * * * and would require [certain disclosures]. 

DOJ has wrongly concluded that the issuance of an order embodying these four (4) elements will achieve the goal of ``* * *
eliminat[ing] any residual anticompetitive effects of the restrictive license agreements and other conduct challenged
by the Complaint * * *.'' because its selection of the elements rests upon flawed premises, including
at least the following:

1. The Pilkington License Agreements have terminated and no valuable rights other than ``know-how'' rights may be
obtained under them by assignees or sublicensees. 

2. The ``safe harbor'' as to Pilkington know-how created for U.S. Non-Licensees offers sufficient protection for
prospective assignees and/or sublicensees of U.S. Licensees and their lenders to cause them to risk tens of millions
of dollars in the construction of float glass plants.

3. The Defendants will take no retributive action after the ten (10) year term of the Final Judgment.

4. The Pilkington float technology that is in the public domain (expired Patents and proprietary know-how), if known
to prospective competitors, is sufficient to enable prospective competitors to construct and/or operate competitive
float plants. 

See Article II.A.2. of the Competitive Impact Statement

 which states ``* * * Pilkington has no intellectual property rights of substantial value * * *.''

Commenting Party is One of the New Entrants Sought by DOJ



Our client (the ``Commenting Party'') is an entity formed under the laws of one of the States of the United States which
now owns a Float Glass plant at which it manufactures and sells Float Glass. Commenting Party is an assignee and/or
sublicensee of two License Agreements entered into between a subsidiary and/or predecessor of one of the Defendants
and one of AFG, Ford, Guardian, PPG or LOF (the ``named Licensees''). 

Under the License Agreements as to which the Commenting Party is an assignee and/or sublicensee, the ``Licensed Patents''
covered by such License Agreements are expansively defined to include all U.S. Patents issued during the ``Term''
of the relevant License Agreement, U.S. Patent applications filed during such Term and the U.S. Patents that may be
issue thereunder, Patents as to which the contracting Pilkington entity has the right to grant a license or sub-license
and continuations, divisions and reissues of such Patents. The Terms of License Agreements ``expire'' after 1985
but the license rights concerning the License Patents become ``paid up'' and remain vital. This vitality extends
for the life of each of the License Patents and reaches into the 21st century. 

The Commenting Party regarded and still regards these acquired and/or sublicensed rights to be essential to its continued
operation of its Float Glass plant. It would not have expended the tens of millions of dollars it did for its Float Glass
plant in the absence of its rights under such License Agreements. 



The Final Judgment Does Not Adequately Protect New Entrants



In obtaining these valuable license rights by assignment and/or sublicensing, Commenting Party in effect stepped
into the shoes of its assignor/sublicensor and may have inherited certain other features of the License Agreements
that DOJ has described as characteristic of Defendents' allegedly unlawful activities. These features include:


1. Purported limitations on assignment and/or sublicensing.

2. Restrictive confidentiality provisions respecting allegedly confidential information

 i.e.

 know-how (confidentiality provisions do not apply to technology disclosed in Patents laws restrict competitive
uses).

3. Choice of law provisions invoking the laws of England. (All Agreements deriving important rights from the Defendants,
their predecessors or subsidiaries presumably invoke the laws of England as the ``applicable law.'').

4. Arbitration provisions requiring arbitration venued in England for all disputes. (All Agreements deriving important
rights from the Defendants, their predecessors or subsidiaries presumably require arbitration in England.)

Commenting Party believes that other prospective entrants into the Float Glass industry will conclude, as Commenting
Party did, that the construction and operation of a competitive Float Glass plant requires such entrant to become
an assignee and/or sublicensee of Patent and other rights under a License Agreement derived from the Defendants,
their predesessors or subsidiaries (the ``Pilkington Group''). When they do so they may become subject to restrictive
provisions like those described above. The Final Judgment appears to permit the enforcement of these allegedly anti-competitive
provisions.

If a prospective entrant into the Float Glass industry requires institutional financing in order to construct a Float
Glass plant having a cost, according to DOJ, of between $100 and $150 million dollars, will the protections allegedly
afforded by the Final Judgment resolve the issues that institutional lenders, institutional lawyers and borrower's
counsel will find in the License Agreements as modified by the Final Judgment? The answer simply stated is

 no

.

Commenting Party believes the flawed assumptions have led to a flawed result. This conclusion is illuminated by the
application of the elements of the Final Judgment to the facts of Commenting Party's case.



What Is Commenting Party's Assignor's/Sublicensor's Status?



Does the Final Judgment classify the Named Licensee with whom Commenty Party contracted (``Commenting Party's Assignor/Sublicensor'')
as a ``U.S. Licensee''? To be a U.S. Licensee, one must first be a person, company or entity who is a ``Licensee.'' A person,
company or entity is not a Licensee unless they have ``

* * * entered into a License Agreement with Pilkington.''

 (Emphasis added'').

The phrase ``* * * entered into * * * with Pilkington * * *'' appears
to require privity of contract. This privity is restricted, apparently, to persons, companies or entities in privity
with ``Pilkington.'' Since ``Pilkington'' is only Pilkington plc, this privity must be with the Defendant Pilkington
plc.

<DOCNO> FR941019-2-00150 </DOCNO>

<TEXT>
 

Pilkington plc is not the name of the member of the Pilkington Group with whom Commenting Party's Assignor/Sublicensor
contracted in the License Agreements. Therefore, it is possible that Commenting Party's Assignor/Sublicensor
is neither a ``Licensee'' nor a ``U.S. Licensee'' because its contractual privity is with a subsidiary or predecessor
of ``Pilkington'' instead of with Pilkington plc.



What is Commenting Party's and What Will Be Future Assignees'/Sublicensees' Status?



Even if a reader is to assume that the definitional flaw noted above does not exist, Commenting Party's and any other
future assignee's/sublicensee's status apparently will not change because none of them will have privity of contract
with ``Pilkington'' no matter how ``Pilkington'' is defined. Therefore, unless the Final Judgment is changed, Commenting
Party and all future assignees/sublicensees will only be ``U.S. Non-licensees.''



Why Are U.S. Non-licensees Who Enter Into Assignments/Sublicenses Under Pilkington License Agreements Not Expressly
Protected Against The Enforcement of Limitations?



It appears that DOJ believes that the prohibitions involving the enforcement of ``Limitations'' will result in the
assignment/sublicensing of ``Float Technology'' required to construct and operate competitive Float Glass plants.
These prohibitions, however, apply only to the allegedly anti-competitive activities of the defendants against
U.S. Licensees. 

See

 Final Judgment Article IV.A. The protections relevant to U.S. Non-licensees are set out in Article IV.B. of the Final
Judgment. Article IV.B. does not prohibit the Defendants asserting Limitations against U.S. Non-licensees! Thus,
if Article IV.A. permits U.S. Licensees to assign/sublicense Float Technology, nowhere does Article IV.B. enable
the prospective assignees/sublicensees who may become new owners/operators of Float Glass plants to exercise free
from suit the rights they might hope to acquire in an assignment/sublicense.

Article IV.B.1 appears to apply only to a subclass of U.S. Non-licensees 

e.g.

 employees, contractors, suppliers, consultants, etc., who, as a group, have entirely different interests than
prospective owner/operators of Float Glass plants. In substance Article IV.B.1. addresses only provisions of Agreements
respecting Confidentiality or non-competition. Since only the protections of Article IV.B.2. appear to apply to
assignees/sublicensees, the only subjects that the Defendants can't make claims about against such U.S. Non-licensees
relate to proprietary Float Technology know-how rights that Pilkington 

has in fact disclosed

 to someone who in fact fits the definition of U.S. Licensee, and which are not bona-fide trade secrets under ``applicable
law'' (as to which Pilkington may still enforce its rights under Article IV.B.2.). The protected class of intellectual
property is far less than the body of intellectual property encompassed by the License Agreements under which Commenting
Party and others similarly situated would want to derive rights.

If the Final Judgment is to be read these ways, the Defendants will be able to claim against assignees/sublicensees
that their assignment/sublicense agreements and/or practice of Patents covered by such assigned/sublicensed
Pilkington License Agreements are, among other things: wholly invalid, were obtained in breach of Pilkington's
Patent rights. (Article IV.H. of the Final Judgment expressly preserves all of Pilkington's Patent claims).



Why Do the Protections Intended By The Concept of Limitations Not Expressly And Literally Include Assignments and
Sublicenses?



As noted above, DOJ appears to believe that the elements of the final judgment will lead to assignment/sublicense
agreements concerning Float Technology. Surprisingly, the Final Judgment does not literally say anything of the
kind. We could not find any reference to assignments or sublicenses. As DOJ has noted, the License Agreements with
members of the Pilkington Group contain express, literal prohibitions respecting assignment and sublicensing.
The Defendants have reserved their rights respecting matters not ``expressly'' covered by the Final Judgment. 

See

 Article IV.I. of the Final Judgment. Institutional lenders or investors who may be asked to lend to or invest in prospective
Float Glass industry entrants can be expected to look for express, literal language in the Final Judgment to counter
the express, literal provisions of the License Agreements. Finding them absent, they will refuse to lend or invest.

``Limitations'' is defined by Article II.K. of the Final Judgment without any use of the words ``assignment'' or ``sublicensing.''
The word ``use'' appears in the definition but as Commenting Party has shown above, the word ``Limitations'' is used
only in Article IV.A. with respect to U.S. Licensees and not their contracting parties, 

i.e.

 their prospective assignees/sublicensees are U.S. Non-licensees.

Article IV.A.1. of the Final Judgment uses the word ``sublicensing'' but appears to do so only in connection with ``Subject
Float Technology.'' As defined, ``Subject Float Technology'' appears to encompass only ``know-how'' (see above
discussion). Therefore, Float Technology that is Patent technology or that was subject to disclosure by Pilkington
but not in fact disclosed is not encompassed by Article IV.A.1. of the Final Judgment.

Commenting Party notes, in passing, that Article IV.A.3.(b) curiously refers to ``transferring'' and ``transferees''
of Float Technology without thereby telling the reader what such words encompass or connecting them to other Articles
of the Final Judgment. This creates further ambiguity.

Assignments/sublicenses and the role DOJ expects them to play are too important for the Final Judgment to treat them
ambiguously or even silently. As noted above, the Defendants seem to retain important rights to sue. These rights
appear to be strongest on subject relating to Patents and provisions of the Final Judgment that are not ``express''
enough. Commenting Party believes that without changes to the Final Judgment no prospective assignee/sublicensee
can be given any clear assurances that the Final Judgment prohibits the Defendants from suing them for attempting
to enter the Float Glass industry. Why would anyone risk investing in or lending to an entity which cannot receive or
provide assurances that its ostensible assignment/sublicense under a Licensee Agreement with a member of the Pilkington
Group protects it from suits by the Defendants?

Unfortunately, even if ``Limitations'' is changed to literally permit assignments/sublicenses, under Article
IV.A. its protections extend only to U.S. Licensees. As Commenting Party has shown above, the protections afforded
to U.S. Non-licensees appear in Article IV.B. of the Final Judgment. Again, the needed words of art ``assignment''
or ``sublicense'' do not appear there.

In short, DOJ may intend that the Final Judgment will be interpreted to permit assignment/sublicensing of Float Technology
that is either or both licensed Patent technology or know-how technology, but, under the express, literal terms of
the Final Judgment, the assignee/licensee clearly has protection only with respect to non-Patented know-how that
was in fact disclosed by Pilkington plc to a person, company or entity that is a U.S. Licensee. In Commenting Party's
case, it appears the Final Judgment is too narrow in application to encompass Commenting Party's rights under its
assignment and/or sublicense agreement. If Commenting Party were to consider further assigning/sublicensing
its rights under the relevant Agreements, Commenting Party could not assure any prospective sub-assignee/sub-sublicensee
that the Final Judgment affords them any protection against the restrictions contained in such Agreements.

Finally, the ambiguous phrase ``* * * other than Float Technology * * *'' in the definition
of ``Subject Float Technology'' threatens the entire concept. Is it intended that if the Pilkington 
Group disclosed Flat Technology to LOF, then such Float Technology is not ``Subject Float Technology'' even though
such Float Technology was also disclosed to AFG, PPG or Ford? This shouldn't be the case. Presumably, the intent was
to exclude 

only

 the Float Technology that was 

only

 disclosed to a U.S. Licensee who was also a Pilkington plc subsidiary at the time of disclosure.

Commenting Party does not believe that DOJ intended any of these unfavorable interpretations. If DOJ wants there
to be assignees and/or sublicensees of License Agreements deriving from Agreements between any of the named Licensees
and any member of the Pilkington Group, then the prohibitions respecting ``Limitations'' must be extended to this
class of persons, companies and entities. The defects noted in this analysis can be eliminated by modest changes to
the definitions of ``Pilkington'', ``U.S. Licensee'', ``U.S. Non-licensee'', ``Limitations'' and ``Subject
Float technology.''

Change 

#

1. The Final Judgement should be changed so that the Named Licensees listed in Article II.A.2. of the Competitive Impact
Statement are in fact encompassed by the definition of ``Licensee/'' This is best accomplished by expanding the definition
of ``Pilkington.''

Article II.N. of the Final Judgment should be changed in its entirety to read as follows:

N. ``Pilkington'' means Defendants Pilkington plc, Pilkington Holdings Inc. and their past, present and future
predecessors, affiliates and subsidiaries.

Change 

#

2. If DOJ intends to vest in prospective assignees/sublicensee of U.S. Licensees the benefits of Agreements that
grant rights under License Agreements entered into with a member of the Pilkington Group, then the term ``U.S. Licensee''
should include all persons, companies or entities who derive rights from any chain of Agreements that extend ultimately
to a License Agreement with a member of the Pilkington Group. This will enable contracting parties to obtain licenses
under patents whose vitality extends into the next century and protect such parties from any anti-competitive assertion
of the Patent rights expressly reserved to the Defendants at Article IV.H. of the Final Judgment.

Article II.I. of the Final Judgment should be changed in its entirety to read as follows:

I. ``Licensee'' means any person, company, or entity that has either (1) entered into a License Agreement with Pilkington;
(2) become an assignee and/or sublicensee under a License Agreement with Pilkington; or (3) become an assignee and/or
sublicensee under a License Agreement with any Licensee.

Change 

#

3. The definition of ``Non-licensee'' contains the overly restrictive concept of privity of contract, 

i.e.

 ``* * * not entered into a[n] * * * Agreement with Pilkington.'' The definition should
merely encompass all persons, companies or entities who are not in a chain of Agreements extending ultimately to an
original Pilkington License Agreement.

Article II.L. of the Final Judgment should be changed in its entirety to read as follows:

L. ``Non-licensee'' means any person, company, or entity which is not a Licensee.

Change 

#

4. Article II.K. of the Final Judgment should be changed in its entirety to read as follows:

K. ``Limitations'' means: (1) Any limitation or restriction, or purported restriction or limitation under any License
Agreement with Pilkington or other Agreement or in any other form respecting territories, fields, markets, or customers
for the design and construction, or supervision of construction, or ownership of Float Glass plants, or the manufacture
and sale of Float Glass; and/or (2) any restriction or limitation, or purported restriction or limitation under any
License Agreement with Pilkington or other Agreement or in any other form respecting the assignment, licensing,
sublicensing or other use of Float Technology, whether the result of an affirmative prohibition or a limited authorization.

Change 

#

5. Article II.P. of the Final Judgment should be changed in its entirety to read as follows:

P. ``Subject Float Technology'' means Patented or Unpatented Float Technology that in relation to any given Licensee
was licensed, was subject to disclosure or was in fact disclosed to that Licensee under an Agreement with either Pilkington
or any other Licensee other than Float Technology disclosed by Pilkington plc only to any U.S. Licensee while such
U.S. Licensee was a subsidiary of Pilkington plc.

Why Will English Law Be Permitted To Govern All Important Questions of Law?


Persons, companies and entities who become assignees/sublicensees under License Agreements with a member of the
Pilkington Group may become subject to the choice of law provisions contained in the original License Agreements.
While DOJ has challenged the Pilkington Group's contracting practices, the Final Judgment does nothing to change
a central feature of the License Agreements. Even more ominously, the Final Judgment introduces vagueness and ambiguity
concerning these features leaving the Defendants free to argue entirely different meanings in venues outside the
jurisdiction of the District Court.

Throughout the proposed Final Judgement, particularly in reference to the issue of Confidential Information, the
phrase ``applicable'' law appears. Under the License Agreements available to Commenting Party, the Pilkington
Group chose the laws of England to govern the interpretation and application of such License Agreements. It is highly
likely that this choice of law appears in all relevant License Agreements and will through the assignment/sublicensing
process sought by DOJ run through any future relevant Agreements.

For example, the words ``applicable law'' appears in the phrase'' * * * trade secret under applicable
law * * *.'' What does this mean? The learned treatise 

The Legal Protection of Trade Secrets

 (the ``English Treatise''), at Section 2.2.5 says ``The term trade secret is not really a term of art in English law
in contrast with its usage in American law * * *. Thus, the effect of the Final Judgment appears to be
that the laws of England will apply to the interpretation of the concept of ``trade secret'' and such English law does
not use such words as a ``term of art.'' Does this mean that Defendants' lawyers will be free to fill in for English arbitrators
(the Final Judgment makes no attempt to eliminate the London venue and English arbitrators that have apparently been
used with such anti-competitive effect in litigation with licensees) what the term means?

The English Treatise offers two (2) formulations of the concept of ``confidential information.'' Which of the two
rules will apply? Which of them, if either, furthers the purposes of the Final Judgment? Why will the Defendants be
left with the power to argue their interpretation of what ``trade secret under applicable law'' means to arbitrators
sited in London? Why should the District Court be confident that the purposes of the Final Judgment will be given effect
by English arbitrators interpreting the vague and ambiguous language of an order of, to them, a foreign court?

The issue also is raised in another context by Final Judgment Article IV.B.1. which refers to restrictions on competition
under ``applicable law.'' If English law governs this issue too, how will the District Court be assured that such law
is consistent with the purposes of the Final Judgment?

In sum, these vague and ambiguous formulations favor the Defendants and the perpetuation of the contractual regime
challenged by DOJ. The Final Judgment obscures this issue by not disclosing that English laws governs every Agreement
that is important in the future assignment/sublicensing activity sought by DOJ. Nothing in the Final Judgment purpose
to guide (much less control) the arbitrators in their interpretation of the License Agreements and assignments/sublicenses
under them in light of the Final Judgement.

Change 

#

6. The Final Judgment should expressly reserve jurisdiction to the District Court to decide what laws are applicable
in any future litigation involving the Defendants and any person, company or entity that is an assignee/sublicensee
under any Agreement derived from a License Agreement with a member of the Pilkington Group. The Final Judgment could
permit interlocutory appeals to the District Court of any questions of interpretation and expressly subject the
arbitrators to the District Court's jurisdiction. The Final Judgment could permit 

de novo

 judicial review by the District Court of any decisions of arbitrators respecting any such assignees/sublicensees.

Change 

#

7. The Final Judgment could also replace the arbitration venue provisions of the License Agreements with the venue
of the District Court. This would ensure that any arbitrators are subject to the District Court's jurisdiction. The
Defendants are already subject to the District Court's jurisdiction and venue and there is no hint in the Stipulation
that the venue is inconvenient to the members of the Pilkington Group.



Why Is Retributive Conduct Not Prohibited After Expiration of the Final Judgment?



Article VII.A. of the Final Judgment provides that the Final Judgment will expire on the tenth anniversary of its entry.
What happens then to persons, companies or entities who have invested millions of dollars in obtaining the purported
benefits of the Final Judgment by assignment and/or sublicensing under License Agreements? There will then be no
prohibition against the Defendants enforcing their contract and other rights. Upon such expiration, can the Defendants
enforce all of their suspended rights to the extent that they haven't lapsed by application of any applicable statute
of limitations? What is the applicable statute? Does the phrase ``applicable law'' mean that this issue is governed
by the laws of England. If English law governs, The Limitation Act of 1980 provides for a six (6) year statute of limitations
for breach of contract claims. Will this not mean that assignments and/or grants of sublicenses by U.S. Licensees
in year five (5) after the entry of the Final Judgement are subject to suit in year eleven (11)?

Is the applicable statute of limitations tolled during the effectiveness of the Final Judgment? Is it the intention
of the Final Judgment to bar certain claims, not to suspend them? The Final Judgment should make this clear, whether
by providing that the Defendants shall not assert that the Final Judgment has tolled any statute of limitations, or
otherwise. Alternatively, the Final Judgment could simply be made permanent with respect to all facts and circumstances
arising during the ten (10) year period the Final Judgment is effective.

Change 

#

8. At the least, Article VII.A. of the Final Judgment should be changed in its entirety to read as follows:

A. This Final Judgment shall expire on the tenth anniversary of its entry provided, however, that not withstanding
such expiration, the Defendants and their present and future affiliates and subsidiaries shall not thereafter take
any action prohibited by this Final Judgment with respect to any License Agreement or any other Agreement entered
into by any Licensee respecting assignment and/or sublicensing under any License Agreement prior to such expiration
date. This Final Judgment does 

not

 toll any statute of limitations as to any 

existing

 claims or claims of the Defendants that, but for this Final Judgment, would have risen during the time this Final Judgment
is in force.



Is the Necessary Float Technology Really in the Public Domain?



Change 

#

9. What is the basis for the conclusion set our in press statements by DOJ that the Float Technology embodied in Patents
expiring in 1982 and before and other technology in the public domain is sufficient to enable a prospective entrant
to construct and operate a competitive Float Glass plant? There appear to be hundreds of Pilkington Group Patents
in the United States and hundreds of others in foreign countries. Has DOJ in consultation with anyone in the Float Glass
industry or who is a prospective entrant, determined that none of these Patents describes Float Technology needed
for a competitive Float Glass plant?

Notwithstanding the Final Judgment and in the absence of an assignment or sublicense of rights under a License Agreement
with a member of the Pilkington Group, a prospective entrant into the Float Glass industry will have to engage Patent
lawyer(s) to understand each of the unexpired Patents and determine what Float Technology cannot be practiced. The
review of hundreds of unexpired Patents promises significant costs to parties who cannot obtain rights by assignment
or sublicensing.

Commenting Party believes that changes must be made in the Final Judgment if DOJ's goal is to be achieved. Commenting
Party believes that without modification of the Final Judgment no prospective entrant will be able to provide the
assurances that commercial lenders and institutional investors require on the serious issues raised by the express,
literal provisions of the Pilkington License Agreements.




   Sincerely yours,

October 6, 1994.



John A. Grimstad, Esq.,



Fredrikson & Byron, P.A., 1100 International Centre, 900 Second Avenue South, Minneapolis, MN 55402-3397




Re: U.S. v. Pilkington plc et al.

 (D. Ariz., 

filed May 25, 1994), Civ 94-345 TUC WDB




Dear Mr. Grimstad: This letter responds to your letter of August 10, 1994, commenting on and proposing changes in the
proposed Final Judgment (``Judgment'') in the above-captioned matter. You complained that (i) the Judgment rests
on several ``flawed assumptions'' listed in your letter that you said ``have led to a flawed result''; (ii) contrary
to the Department of Justice's conclusion, the relief the Judgment provides does not eliminate the residual anticompetitive
effects of the challenged agreements or behavior; and (iii) the Judgment is ``too narrow in application to encompass
[the] rights'' of a domestic glass manufacturer you represent but declined to identify. In trying to support those
complaints, you applied the precise provisions of the proposed Judgment to your anonymous client's vaguely and ambiguously
described licensing arrangements, and then concluded there are gaps in the Judgment's coverage that do not in fact
exist. We have addressed separately below each of the changes you recommended to the proposed Judgment. For the reason
indicated, we believe there is no basis for modifying the Judgment. The standard applied in assessing your specific
proposals is whether it is in the public interest to enter the Judgment submitted by stipulation. Entry is in the public
interest if the Judgment is adequate to remedy the antitrust violations alleged in the Complaint.

1. You proposed expanding the definition ``Pilkington'' to include the two named defendants' ``past, present and
future predecessors, affiliates and subsidiaries,'' so that the ``named licensees (AFG, Ford, Guardian, PPG, and
LOF) ``are in fact encompassed by the definition of `Licensee'.'' This change is necessary, you said, because your
client is ``an assignee and/or sublicensee of two license agreements * * * between [i] a subsidiary
and/or predecessor of one of the defendants'' and (ii) one of the ``named licensees,'' and because the Judgment's
definition of Licensee requires contractual privity with Pilkington itself.


We believe the change is unnecessary to achieve your stated objective since each of the ``named licensees'' already
is clearly a Licensee as defined in the proposed Judgment. All five of those companies entered into float licensee
agreements with defendant Pilkington, not with a predecessor, affiliate, or subsidiary of Pilkington. Since execution
of those agreements, only Pilkington's corporate name has been changed from ``Pilkington Brothers Limited'' to
``Pilkington plc.'' Thus, Pilkington plc is the same corporate entity as, not a successor of, Pilkington Brothers
Limited.

2. You also proposed expanding the definition of ``Licensee'' to include not only anyone who has entered into a license
agreement with Pilkington, but also anyone who is ``an assignee and/or sublicensee'' under a license agreement with
either Pilkington or any of the ``named licensees.'' That is necessary, you said, so that anyone ``who derive[s] rights
from any chain of agreements that extend ultimately to a license agreement with [Pilkington]'' will get the benefits
of such a license agreement with Pilkington as ``prospective assignees/sublicensees of U.S. Licensees'' under
the proposed Judgment. But this change, too, is unnecessary.

Subparagraph IV.A.1. of the proposed Judgment, subject to a narrow exception and certain conditions relating to
maintaining the confidentiality of legitimate trade secrets, expressly permits any U.S. Licensee (including each
of the five ``named licensees'') to sublicense anywhere in the world (including the U.S.) the float glass technology
Pilkington disclosed and licensed to it, free of any license restrictions or limitations and without payment of any
royalties, lump sum, or line fees for such sublicensing. Clearly then, for that provision of Subparagraph IV.A.1.
to have any meaningful effect, anyone acquiring rights to use such technology under such a sublicense must be as free
to use it anywhere without restriction or limitation by Pilkington or payment of royalties or fees to Pilkington,
subject to the same conditions concerning confidentiality, as the U.S. Licensee from whom such rights were obtained.
The same would be true too for any further sublicensing by such a sublicensee. Anything less than that, if the result
of any action taken by Pilkington, would be a clear violation of the proposed Judgment, with which Pilkington is required
by stipulation to comply pending its approval by the court.

It seems clear to us that the result would be the same, insofar as Pilkington is concerned, whether such a sublicense
agreement were executed before or after entry of the proposed Judgment. As for assignments, the result should be the
same, assuming, as a matter of law, the assignee effectively stands in the shoes of or is substituted for the assignor,
and the rights involved are assignable. However, the proposed Judgment does not purport to address specifically
the consequences of such assignments since they were not the principal focus of the challenged agreements or conduct
involved here. Moreover, we cannot be any more definitive on their implications for your client because you have not
provided enough information about its current licensing arrangements.

3. You proposed changing the definition of ``Non-Licensee'' from anyone who has not entered into a license agreement
with Pilkington to anyone who is not a Licensee, because, you said, the current definition ``contains the overly restrictive
concept of privity of contract * * *.'' But since anyone who is not in contractual privity with Pilkington
is not a Licensee, your proposal is the equivalent of the current definition. Moreover, since a Licensee is anyone
who is in contractual privity with Pilkington, the proposed Judgment's definitions of ``Licensee'' and ``Non-Licensee''
together cover the entire universe of persons entitled to the benefits of the Judgment, without any gap between them.
For purposes of the proposed Judgment, your client is either a ``Licensee'' or a ``Non-Licensee,'' whatever else
it may be (assignee, sublicensee, etc.) by reason of its current licensing arrangements. Thus, no need for the proposed
change has been shown.

4. The change proposed in the definition of ``Limitations'' is to include references to sublicensing and assignment
so as to permit those activities. But including such references in the definition of ``Limitations'' does not provided
the authorization you seek and confuses the concept of ``Limitations,'' which are restrictions on the exercise (e.g.,

 in certain territories or for certain uses) of rights already granted. Whether the separate right of sublicense or
to make assignments also is authorized is, as noted above, already controlled by Subparagraph IV.A.1. of the proposed
Judgment in the case of sublicensing and by operation of law for assignments.

You also complained that ``the needed words of art `assignment' or `sublicense' do not appear'' in Subparagraph IV.B.,
which provides certain injunctive relief for U.S. Non-Licensees (

i.e.,

 those who have not entered into float glass license agreements with Pilkington). As you correctly observed, however,
Subparagraph IV.B. does not enjoin Pilkington from enforcing limitations against them. But there is no need to do
so; since U.S. Non-Licensees by definition are not in privity of contract with Pilkington, there is no contractual
or other legitimate basis for Pilkington to enforce any license-agreement limitations against them. For the same
reason, it is not necessary that Subparagraph IV.B. enjoin Pilkington from restricting or prohibiting the exercise
of the right to sublicense or make assignments against persons with whom it is not in contractual privity under any
float license agreement. Thus, neither the word ``assignment'' nor the word ``sublicensee'' is ``needed as part
of the definition or concept of ``Limitations.''
5. You proposed to expand the definition of ``Subject Float Technology'' to include patented as well as unpatented
float technology and to include float technology that was ``subject to disclosure'' as well as that actually disclosed
to any given Licensee. In support, you claimed, incorrectly, that ``the protected class of intellectual property
is far less than the body of intellectual property encompassed by the License Agreements * * *'' (p.
6, your letter). Indeed, they are the same.
The purpose and effect of Subparagraph IV.A.1. of the proposed Judgment is to free U.S. Licensees from any restraints
(other than confidentiality) concerning all intellectual property rights acquired from Pilkington, to the extent
that has not already occurred. As noted in the Competitive Impact Statement (p. 9), all U.S. Licensees' float license
agreements have terminated, and the royalty obligations thereunder have become fully paid up. Also, Pilkington
has acknowledged that its basic patent protection relating to the original form of float process has largely expired,
and has represented that all mutual exchanges between Pilkington and its U.S. licensees (whether patented or not)
have been terminated, the latest ten years ago. Pilkington has represented further (as have some of its U.S. Licensees)
that all of the U.S. float glass patents licensed by Pilkington to any U.S. Licensee, either under the original grant
or the improvement exchange provisions of the licenses, have expired. It is simply unnecessary, therefore, to cover
patented rights that essentially no longer exist.
As for technology that was ``subject to disclosure,'' that language is so vague and indefinite it would be impossible
to identify the technology involved. In any case, it seems wholly unnecessary. According to the relevant float glass
license agreements, Pilkington was obliged to disclose to each licensee (i) all ``necessary or useful'' know-how
Pilkington developed, owned, or controlled at the time and (ii) all patented and unpatented float process improvements
Pilkington discovered, owned, or controlled during the term of the mutual exchange provisions. Together, those
obligations likely covered whatever might have been ``subject to disclosure.'' Of course, the proposed Judgment
does not apply to any technology disclosed by a U.S. Licensee to your client (or to anyone else) that belongs to that
U.S. Licensee rather than to Pilkington.
Finally, as you correctly observed (p. 8, your letter), the exclusionary language of the definition of ``Subject
Float Technology''_other than float technology disclosed by Pilkington to any U.S. Licensee while Pilkington owned
50% or more of that U.S. Licensee_excludes float technology disclosed to a U.S. Licensee who was a Pilkington subsidiary
at the time of disclosure (

e.g.,

 LOF) and not also disclosed to any other licensee who was not then a subsidiary (

e.g.,

 AFG, PPG, or Ford). We believe that intent is clear from the plain meaning of the exclusion (especially considering
the included language, ``in relation to any given licensee,'' which limits the excluded technology), and so it is
unnecessary to add the word ``only'' to the definition as you propose.
6/7. You objected to (i) language in the proposed Final Judgment for resolving trade secret issues under ``applicable
law,'' and (ii) the arbitration provisions of Pilkington's float license agreements plus the application of English
law to disputes involving those agreements; accordingly, you proposed that the Judgment expressly reserve to the
District Court jurisdiction over questions of applicable law in future litigation involving the defendants (including
provisions for interlocutory appeals) and over any designated arbitrators (including 

de novo

 review of their decisions). Alternatively, you also proposed replacing the choice of law provisions of the licenses
with, for example, the Uniform Trade Secrets Act and replacing the arbitration provisions with the venue of the District
Court.
Your proposal seems far too sweeping insofar as it would reach future litigation. Moreover, the proposed Judgment
(Subparagraph VII.B) already provides that the Court retains jurisdiction over this action and the parties. In addition,
any court can, as this Court did in a related case in which it referred antitrust claims to arbitration, retain jurisdiction
over arbitration proceedings for purposes of reviewing the decisions in those proceedings. Finally, the language
(``under applicable law'') in the Judgment to which you objected requires application of the relevant conflict of
laws rule, as to both U.S. Licensees and U.S. Non-Licensees, in determining the nature and existence of trade secrets,
rather than, in the case of U.S. Licensees, merely following the license provision that requires application of English
law. In any case, contrary to the implication of your letter based on the treatise cited therein (p. 10), we believe
there is little, if any, substantive difference between the trade secret law of the United States and the comparable
body of English law. Thus, we are unpersuaded that either of the alternative changes you propose should be adopted.
8. You proposed changing Subparagraph VII.A., which sets the term of the Judgment, in ways that effectively extend
its duration beyond 10 years. In concluding that a period of 10 years is the appropriate life for most consent judgments,
the Department has recognized that the anticompetitive effects of any challenged conduct or practices usually are
fully dissipated within that time and that, because of the market changes likely to occur within that period, the operation
of the judgment itself can have an undesirable competitive impact after 10 years. In this case, the Department believes
that Pilkington technology is to a very substantial extent publicly known and therefore no longer of sufficient value
to justify any restraints on its use, including obligations to maintain its confidentiality. Even more so would that
be the case 10 years from now. Clearly, Pilkington would be subject to renewed antitrust challenge in the event it reinstituted,
after expiration of the Judgment, the practices and conduct that led to this case in the first place. Thus, we believe
Subparagraph VII.A. should remain unchanged.
9. You complained that a prospective entrant into the float glass industry who cannot obtain rights by assignment
or sublicensing would incur significant costs to the extent it was necessary (i) to review what you said are hundreds
of unexpired relevant Pilkington float glass patents not licensed to U.S. Licensees, and (ii) to determine what float
glass technology in the public domain is sufficient to construct and operate a competitive float glass plant. By failing
to propose a specific change to address this complaint, you implicitly acknowledged that there are none that would
avoid this task entirely or eliminate all risks associated with entry. Of course, without any modification, the proposed
Judgment will allow U.S. Licensees to sublicense the requisite technology they used to construct and operate competitive
float glass plants in the United States.
In sum, we do not believe it would be in the public interest to forego entry of the proposed Judgment for failure to include
therein any of your proposed changes. Nevertheless, we appreciate your interest in this matter and in the enforcement
of the antitrust laws.

<DOCTITLE>Proposed Modification of Final Judgment</DOCTITLE>


Notice is hereby given that defendant United Artists Theatre Circuit, Inc. (``UATC'') has filed with the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin a motion to modify the Final Judgment in 

United States v. Capitol Service, Inc. et al.,

 No. 80-C-407, and the Department of Justice (``Department''), in a stipulation also filed with the Court,
has consented to modification of the Final Judgment, but has reserved the right to withdraw its consent based on public
comments or for other reasons. The Complaint in this case (filed on May 5, 1980) alleged that UATC and three other Milwaukee
motion picture exhibitors had since 1977 engaged in a combination and conspiracy to restrain trade by ``splitting'',
or allocating among themselves, the rights to negotiate for films released by motion picture distribution companies,
in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. 1.
The Final Judgment (entered on June 17, 1983) enjoins the defendants ``from further engaging in any motion picture
split agreements, in any form and with any person, in any motion picture exhibition market throughout the United States.''
The Department has filed with the Court a memorandum setting forth the reasons why it believes that modification of
the Final Judgment to permit a singular exemption from the Court's injunction for a UATC theatre in San Jose, California
to be constructed under the auspices of the City's Redevelopment Agency, would be in the public interest. Copies of
the Complaint, the Final Judgment, the defendant's motion papers, the Stipulation containing the Government's
tentative consent, the Department's memorandum, and all further papers filed with the Court in connection with this
motion will be available for inspection at Room 3235, Antitrust Division, Department of Justice, 10th Street and
Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20530 (Telephone: (202) 514-2481), and at the Office of the Clerk
of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Copies of any
of these materials may be obtained from the Antitrust Division upon request and payment of the copying fee set by Department
regulations.
Interested persons may submit comments to the Department regarding the proposed modification of the Final Judgment.
Such comments must be received within the sixty-day period established by court order, and will be filed with the Court
by the Department. Comments should be addressed to Gail Kursh, Chief, Professions and Intellectual Property Section,
Antitrust Division, Department of Justice, 555 Fourth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20001 (telephone: (202) 307-5799).

Petitions for Modification 



The following parties have filed petitions to modify the application of mandatory safety standards under section
101(c) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. 



1. Consolidation Coal Company 



[Docket No. M-94-139-C] 



Consolidation Coal Company, Consol Plaza, 1800 Washington 
Road, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15241-1421 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.380(d)(4)
(escapeways; bituminous and lignite mines) to its Dilworth Mine (I.D. No. 36-04281) located in Greene County,
Pennsylvania. The petitioner proposes to establish two separate and distinct primary intake escapeways during
development of three-entry longwall gate sections; to have the total length of unattended supply cars maintained
on the end of the supply track at 150 feet and other rail vehicles readily mobile on the longwall development section;
to have a clearance of 42 inches on the wide side of the cars when an unattended trip of supply cars is parked on the supply
track/intake escapeway of the three-entry development section; to periodically test the wide side clearances along
the supply cars to assure that a stretcher can move through the area; and to post a reflective sign that indicates limited
clearance at both the inby and outby ends of the supply cars and at the entrance of the mine. The petitioner proposes
to establish two separate and distinct secondary escapeways on retreat that would be identified with signs and markers
in the belt entry from the longwall face to the track entry at a distance not to exceed 1000 feet, and the minimum width
of the travelway in the belt entry at two feet and maintained clear and free of obstruction; to periodically test the
wide side clearances along that portion of the belt entry designated as an alternate escapeway to assure that a minimum
clearance of two feet is maintained; to instruct personnel working in the area to use the primary escapeway in an emergency;
to deenergize the longwall machinery and belt line when transporting persons if the primary escapeway is impassable;
and to train all personnel assigned to work in the area prior to implementation of the proposed alternate method and
during annual refresher training. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternative method would provide at
least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard. 



2. Ram Head Coal Company 



[Docket No. M-94-140-C] 



Ram Head Coal Company, 277 Main Street, Joliett, Pennsylvania 17981 has filed a petition to modify the application
of 30 CFR 75.360 (preshift examination) to its Primrose Slope (I.D. No. 36-08454) located in Schuylkill County,
Pennsylvania. 

The petitioner proposes to examine each seal for physical damage from the slope gunboat during the preshift examination
after an air quantity reading is taken in by the intake portal and to test for the quantity and quality of air at the intake
air split locations off the slope in the gangway portion of the working section. The petitioner asserts that the proposed
alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard. 



3. Ram Head Coal Company 



[Docket No. M-94-141-C] 



Ram Head Coal Company, 277 Main Street, Joliett, Pennsylvania 17981 has filed a petition to modify the application
of 30 CFR 75.364(b)(1), (4), and (5) (weekly examination) to its Primrose Slope (I.D. No. 36-08454) located
in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. Due to hazardous conditions and roof falls, certain areas of the intake air course
cannot be safely traveled. The petitioner proposes to examine the intake haulage slope and primary escapeway from
the gunboat/slope car with an alternative air quality evaluation at the section's intake level, and to travel and
thoroughly examine these areas for hazardous conditions once a month. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternative
method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.

<DOCTITLE>Georgia Power Company, Oglethorpe Power Corporation, Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia, Vogtle Electric
Generating Plant, Unit 1 and 2; Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact </DOCTITLE>


The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an exemption from the requirements
of 10 CFR 50, Appendix E, Section IV.F.2, regarding annual exercise of the emergency plan to Georgia Power Company
(GPC or the licensee), for the Vogtle Electric Generating Station, Units 1 and 2, located in Dalton, Georgia. 


Environmental Assessment 


Identification of the Proposed Action 


The proposed exemption would allow a one-time schedular exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix
E, Section IV.F.2 which states that each licensee at each site shall annually exercise its emergency plan. By letter
dated July 21, 1994, the licensee requested a schedular exemption from the requirement for the Vogtle Power Station,
based upon a request from the State of Georgia and local governments, to delay the exercise from July 27, 1994, to January
11, 1995, because of the flood disaster in Georgia. 
The licensee had planned to conduct a full-participation exercise involving the States of Georgia and South Carolina
and local response organizations on July 27, 1994. The licensee requested that an exemption be granted because the
State of Georgia requested to delay the 1994 annual exercise from July 27, 1994, to January 11, 1995. The request to
move the exercise date was originated by the Georgia Emergency Management Agency (GEMA) because they would be unable
to participate on July 27 as GEMA personnel were required to respond to a federally-declared flood disaster in South
Georgia. This proposed delay will prevent Vogtle from meeting the annual requirement to exercise the Vogtle emergency
plan as specified in Appendix E to 10 CFR 50, and therefore, GPC requested a schedular exemption. 
The previous emergency preparedness exercise at Vogtle was successfully conducted on August 4, 1993, and no violations,
deviations or exercise weaknesses were identified. Offsite participation was limited to receiving Emergency Notification
messages. A joint plume and ingestion exposure pathway exercise involving the States of Georgia and South Carolina
and the four local governmental agencies was conducted on May 19, 1992. 
The licensee had scheduled, planned and coordinated the 1994 exercise with participating Federal, State, and local
agencies for mid-July. The scope and objectives, and the final scenario documentation for the July 1994 exercise
were submitted to the NRC on April 14, 1994, and May 17, 1994, respectively, which is within the time frames established
for their submittal in support of a July 1994 exercise. 
The schedule for future exercise will not be affected by this exemption. GPC has stated it will conduct the previously
scheduled 1995 exercise the week of July 19, 1995, as planned. The licensee states that concurrence for the proposed
date of January 11, 1995, has been received from FEMA, NRC Region II, and the affected State and local agencies. FEMA
confirmed its support for the revised exercise date on September 1, 1994.

Based upon a review of the licensee's request for an exemption from the requirement to conduct an exercise of the Vogtle
emergency plan in 1994, the NRC staff finds that the underlying purpose of the regulation will not be adversely affected
by the rescheduling of the July 27, 1994, exercise to January 11, 1995. The effective response capability demonstrated
by the licensee during the 1993 emergency preparedness exercise, the activities in preparation for the 1994 exercise,
including a table top exercise with the States and counties and the readiness of the licensee's emergency preparedness
program as reflected in its SALP rating and the most recent inspection report, provide assurance that the resources
and personnel necessary for proper emergency response are in place to respond to a nuclear emergency at the Vogtle
site. Thus, an exercise in 1994 is not necessary to achieve the underlying purpose of the rule, and the requested exemption
from the requirement in 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix E, Section IV.F, to defer the performance of an exercise of the Vogtle
emergency plan until January 11, 1995, will not adversely affect the overall state of emergency preparedness at the
Vogtle site.



The Need for the Proposed Action



The proposed exemption is needed because the Georgia Emergency management Agency (GEMA) was required to respond
to a federally-declared flood disaster in South Georgia at the time of the scheduled annual emergency exercise.



Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action



The NRC staff evaluation of the proposed exemption from 10 CFR 50, Appendix E, Section IV. F.2, indicates that the granting
of the proposed exemption will not involve any measurable environmental impacts since the exemption deals with the
exercise of the licensee's emergency plan. Plant configuration and operations are not changed. Therefore, the Commission
concludes that there are no significant radiological or nonradiological environmental impacts associated with
the proposed exemption.



Alternatives to the Proposed Action



Since the Commission has concluded there is no measurable environmental impact associated with the proposed exemption,
any alternatives with equal or greater environmental impact need not be evaluated. The principal alternative to
the action would be to deny the request. Such action would not enhance the protection of the environment and would result
in diversion of plant resources from addressing important health and safety issues.



Alternative Use of Resources



This exemption from the scheduled exercise on July 27, 1994, does not reduce the use of resources since the schedule
for future exercises will not be affected by this exemption. The licensee has stated it will conduct the previously
scheduled 1995 exercise the week of July 19, 1995, as planned. Thus, the requested exemption would provide only temporary
relief from the requirement to conduct an annual exercise.



Agencies and Persons Consulted



The NRC staff consulted with the Georgia State official regarding the environmental impact of the proposed action.
The State official had no comments.



Finding of No Significant Impact



Based upon the environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant
effect on the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental
impact statement for the proposed action.

For further details with respect to the proposed exemption, see the licensee's letter dated July 21, 1994, which is
available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, The Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW.,
Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room located at the Burke County Library, 412 Fourth Street,
Waynesboro, Georgia 30830.

10 CFR Part 50, Appendix R, sets forth fire protection features required to satisfy general design Criterion 3 of the
Commission's regulations. Pursuant to 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix R, Section III. O, ``Oil collection system for reactor
coolant pump,'' the reactor coolant pump (RCP) shall be equipped with an oil collection system which ``* * *
shall be capable of collecting lube oil from all potential pressurized and unpressurized leakage sites in the reactor
coolant pump lube oil systems.''

The licensee proposed to replace the existing RCP motors with a new motor and implement a re-designed RCP lube oil system.
As a result of physical interferences and other design difficulties, four specific sites in the RCP motor lube oil
system could not accommodate an oil collection systems for collecting potential oil leakage. The four potential
leakage sites are: the anti-reverse device (ARD) vents, upper oil supply lines from the lift pump to the ARD, lower
motor leak detection system piping, and lower guide bearing thermocouple wells.

An exemption from 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix R, Section III. O, is required to permit the four specific sites in the RCP
lube oil systems not to be equipped with an oil collection system, and thus, exclude them from leakage protection.

By letter dated June 7, 1993, as supplemented March 28, 1994, the licensee submitted its exemption request for this
purpose.



III



Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12, the Commission may, upon application by any interested person or upon its own initiative,
grant exemptions from the requirements of 10 CFR part 50 when (1) the exemptions are authorized by law, will not present
an undue risk to public health or safety, and are consistent with the common defense and security; and (2) when special
circumstances are present. Special circumstances are present whenever, according to 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii), ``Application
of the regulation in the particular circumstances would not serve the underlying purpose of the rule or is not necessary
to achieve the underlying purpose of the rule * * *''.

The underlying purpose of 10 CFR 50, Appendix R, Section III. O, is to establish an oil collection system such that lube
oil leakage from potential pressurized and unpressurized leakage sites in the RCP lube oil systems will not lead to
fire during normal or design basis accident conditions and that there is reasonable assurance that the system will
withstand the Safe Shutdown Earthquake (SSE). 

 The licensee's proposed RCP motor lube oil system could not accommodate an oil collection system for collecting potential
oil leakage from four specific sites. The staff evaluation of these sites is as follows. 

 The RCP motor lube oil system, with its pumps and associated piping, supply oil to several parts of the RCP. The existing
RCP lube oil system includes a high pressure and an induced flow system. The high pressure system consists of two independent
pumps, and associated piping, and supplies oil, among other components, to the ARD. The induced flow system is driven
by the rotation of the RCP motor and provides lube oil to the thrust bearings, guide bearings, and to the ARD. 

 In the new design, the ARD vents located at the top of each RCP motor would be equipped with demisters. According to the
equipment vendor, the ARD vent lines only contain oil mist or foam during startup, shutdown, and normal operation.
The demisters are equipped with a filter to prevent lube oil mist from escaping to the atmosphere. Two upper lube oil
supply lines provide oil to the ARD from the low pressure lube oil system lift pump during startup and shutdown of the
RCP motor. During normal operation, oil is provided to the ARD by the induced flow system. 

 The ARD vents are not part of a pressurized system. Therefore, spray shield protection for mechanical connections
is not provided. If leakage were to occur during normal plant operations from the ARD demisters or from the mechanical
connections, the oil would run down the side of the torque drum and bearing housing, be collected by a one-inch lip on
the bottom of the upper RCP motor bearing housing, and then be channeled to the oil collection drain pan for the upper
lube oil cooler. The two upper lube oil supply lines are part of a pressurized system and, therefore, lube oil spray
from a leak at a mechanical connection may not be fully captured by this lip and could potentially run down the RCP motor
onto hot Reactor Coolant System (RCS) surfaces. 

 The lower RCP motor leak detection system provides detection of water leakage from the RCP motor heat exchanger. Consequently,
this system normally contains cooling water. However, oil may enter into the cooling water either from overfilling
the lube oil reservoir or from leakage at the lower RCP motor bearing. The mixture of water/oil could potentially leak
at the threaded connections of the leak detection system piping and run off onto hot RCS surfaces. It is not expected
that this oil/water mixture would represent a fire hazard under these conditions. These lines are not part of a pressurized
system and are not provided spray protection for this potential leakage site. 

 The lower guide bearing and oil temperature thermocouples are located near the lower RCP motor bearing housing. Each
of these instruments has two threaded connections. One of these connections is at the RCP motor lower bearing oil reservoir
and the other is at the outer end of the thermocouple pipe where the thermocouple is inserted into the pipe. These thermocouple
connections are located in a non-pressurized portion of the lube oil system and are not provided with spray shields.
The innermost connections are located directly over the RCP motor lower oil drain pan and it is expected that leakage
from these connections would be captured by the lower drain pan.

The new oil lubricating system would contain approximately 200 gallons of oil and would eliminate one of the two lift
pumps and its components, which should result in a decrease in the number of potential leakage sites. Of the four potential
leakage sites, ARD vents and lower RCP motor leak detection system piping do not contain oil under routine operating
conditions. The upper oil supply lines from the lift pump to the ARD are pressurized only during a brief period of motor
startups and shutdowns. The lower guide bearing thermocouple wells are passive in nature. If leakage were to occur
during normal plant operations, the oil would channel to the drain pan. Any lobe oil leak which may not have been fully
captured could potentially run down the RCP motor onto hot Reactor Coolant System surfaces. However, the flammability
characteristics of the oil, flashpoint of 452
 F, and an auto ignition temperature of 500
 F-700
 F, that would be used in the lube oil system, reduce the likelihood that the oil will readily ignite upon coming
in contact with hot RCS piping surfaces. Additionally, if the oil leak became ignited, the fire would be localized
in the area of the leakage and detected by the thermal fire detectors.

Fire protection features for the RCP motors include three temperature heat detectors with 190
 F setpoints located over each RCP. Any localized fire in the area would result in an alarm function in both the
reactor building and annunciate in the main control room. Additional indications of potential RCP fire are provided
by control room alarms on low level oil, low oil pressure or high vibrations. It is expected that the control room operators
would evaluate these alarms associated with the RCP and its lube oil system and initiate fire brigade entry into the
reactor building to investigate and fight the fire. The reactor building is equipped with an internal firefighting
standpipe hose station system and fire extinguishers are appropriately distributed throughout the structure.
RCP firefighting would be accomplished by using either portable fire extinguishers or water from a hose stream or
a combination of both. Access to the four RCPs for firefighting can be accomplished by making entry into the ``D'' rings.

The existing Crystal River Unit 3 RCP motor lube oil system in a nonseismic system. The new RCP lube oil system and lube
oil collection systems would be seismically qualified to withstand an SSE. Therefore, if an SSE were to occur, the
system is not expected to fail.

Based on the design features of the new RCP motors and associated lube oil collection systems, there is reasonable
assurance that the RCP lube oil system will not lead to fire during normal and design basis accident conditions or present
a major fire hazard during a seismic event. In addition, based on the present level of fire protection provided for
the RCPs and the fact that the plant has a trained fire brigade, if a fire were to occur in the area of RCP lube oil system
ARD vents, upper oil supply lines from the lift pump to the ARD, lower motor leak detection system piping, and lower
guide bearing thermocouple wells, there is reasonable assurance that the fire condition will be detected and mitigated.



IV



For the foregoing reasons, the NRC staff has concluded that the licensee's proposed implementation of the RCP lube
oil system with the four potential leakage sites (the ARD vents, upper oil supply lines from the lift pump to the ARD,
lower motor leak detection system piping, and lower guide bearing thermocouple wells not equipped with an oil collection
system) will not present an undue risk to public health and safety and is consistent with the common defense and security.
The NRC staff has determined that there are special circumstances present, as specified in 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2), such
that application of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix R, Section III. 0, as it relates to the oil collection at four specific sites
in the RCP, is not necessary in order to achieve the underlying purpose of this regulation.

Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12(a), an exemption is authorized by law,
will not endanger life or property or common defense and security, and is otherwise in the public interest. Therefore,
the Commission hereby grants Florida Power Corporation an exemption from those requirements of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix
R, Section III. 0, relating to oil collection in the RCP. This exemption is applicable only to the four potential leakage
sites in the RCP lube oil system: the ARD vents, upper oil supply lines from the lift pump to the ARD, lower motor leak
detection system piping, and lower guide bearing thermocouple wells.

Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that the granting of this exemption will not result in any significant
adverse environmental impact (59 FR 48338).

Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Rewrite


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On May 24, 1994, the Board of Directors for the FAR Rewrite Project published a set of core guiding principles in the


Federal Register

. Comments from that notice have been reviewed and changes made to the principles. In the course of making these changes
the Board added another principle to make it clear that if a policy or procedure is not addressed in the FAR, members
of the Government acquisition team should not assume it is prohibited. Although the entire statement is being republished
for comment, the Board is particularly interested in comments from the public on the new principle.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On September 7, 1993, the Vice President released the report of the National Performance Review which, among other
things, required the Administration to simplify the procurement process by rewriting the FAR, shifting from rigid
rules to guiding principles. As a first step, the Board drafted a set of core guiding principles intended to define
and guide the Government's general vision for the Federal acquisition process.


The Board requested comments on the set of core guiding principles and the accompanying discussion through a notice
issued in the 

Federal Register

 published on May 24, 1994. As a result of that notice the Board received approximately 50 comments from 19 different
commentors. The comments ranged from general structural to specific substantive changes. Some editing was done
and the Board added a new principle to the statement.
Some of the more significant changes included: the document was retitled as ``Statement of Guiding Principles For
The Federal Acquisition System''; the success paragraph was eliminated; the lead-in to the goals paragraph was changed;
the term ``customer'' was clarified; the phrase ``each level of the process'' was changed to ``throughout the process'';
the phrase ``using commercial products and services in preference to unique specification'' was replaced with ``maximizing
the use of commercial products and services to meet Government requirements''; and the term ``vendor'' was replaced
with ``contractor.''
In addition to these changes the Board is considering another concept under the role of the acquisition team. The intent
of the Board is to make it clear that if a policy is not specifically addressed in the FAR, members of the Government acquisition
team should not assume that it is prohibited. This concept was added to encourage members of the team to innovate in
the course of their procurements.


Statement of Guiding Principles for the Federal Acquisition System


The VISION for the Federal Acquisition System is to deliver on a timely basis the best value product or service to the
customer, while maintaining the public's trust and fulfilling public policy objectives. Participants in the acquisition
process should work together as a team and should be empowered to make decisions within their area of responsibility.
The Federal Acquisition System will:
*Satisfy the customer in terms of cost, quality, and timeliness of the delivered product or service, by, for example,
**Maximizing the use of commercial products and services,
**Using contractors with a track record of successful past performance or who demonstrate a current superior ability
to perform, and
**Promoting competition;
*Minimize administrative operating costs;
*Conduct business with integrity, fairness, and openness; and
*Fulfill public policy objectives.
The acquisition team consists of all participants in Government acquisition including not only representatives
of the technical, supply and procurement communities but also the customers they serve, and the contractors who provide
the products and services.
The role of each member of the Acquisition Team is to exercise personal initiative and sound business judgment in providing
the best value product or service to meet the customer's needs. In exercising initiative, members of the Government
acquisition team may assume that if a specific policy or procedure is not prohibited by the FAR, law (statute or case
law), Executive Order or other regulation, that the policy or procedure is a permissible exercise of authority.


Discussion on the Statement of Guiding Principles for the Federal Acquisition System


Introduction


The Statement of Acquisition Guiding Principles for the Federal Acquisition System (System) represents a concise
statement designed to be user-friendly for all participants in Government acquisition. The following discussion
of the principles is provided in order to illuminate the meaning of the terms and phrases used. The framework for the
System includes the Guiding Principles for the System and the supporting policies and procedures provided in the
Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).


Discussion


Vision


All participants in the System are responsible for making acquisition decisions that deliver the best value product
or service to the customer. Best value must be viewed from a broad perspective and is achieved by balancing the many
competing interests in the System. The result is a system which works better and costs less.

Performance Standards for the Federal Acquisition System 


 Satisfy the Customer in Terms of Cost, Quality, and Timeliness of the Delivered Product or Service 



The principal customers for the product or service provided by the System are the users and line managers, acting on
behalf of the American taxpayer. 

The System must be responsive and adaptive to customer needs, concerns, and feedback. Implementation of acquisition
policies and procedures, as well as consideration of timeliness, quality, and cost throughout the process, must
take into account the perspective of the user of the product or service. 

When selecting contractors to provide products or perform services, the government will use contractors who have
a track record of successful past performance or who demonstrate a current superior ability to perform. 

The government must not hesitate to communicate with the commercial sector as early as possible in the acquisition
cycle to help the government determine the capabilities available in the commercial marketplace. The government
will maximize its use of commercial products and services in meeting Government requirements. 

It is the policy of the System to promote competition in the acquisition process. 

The System must perform in a timely, high quality, and cost-effective manner. 

All members of the Team are required to employ planning as an integral part of the overall process of acquiring products
or services. Although advance planning is required, each member of the Team must be flexible in order to accommodate
changing or unforeseen mission needs. Planning is a tool for the accomplishment of tasks, and application of its discipline
should be commensurate with the size and nature of a given task. 


 Minimize Administrative Operating Costs 



In order to ensure that maximum efficiency is obtained, rules, regulations, and policies should be promulgated only
when their benefits clearly exceed the costs of their development, implementation, administration, and enforcement.
This applies to internal administrative processes, including reviews, and to rules and procedures applied to the
contractor community. 

The System must provide uniformity where it contributes to efficiency or where fairness or predictability is essential.
The System should also, however, encourage innovation, and local adaptation where uniformity is not essential.



 Conduct Business With Integrity, Fairness, and Openness 



An essential consideration in every aspect of the System is maintaining the public's trust. Not only must the System
have integrity, but the actions of each member of the Team must reflect that integrity. The foundation of integrity
within the System is a competent, experienced, and well-trained, professional workforce. Accordingly, each member
of the Team is responsible and accountable for the wise use of public resources as well as acting in a manner which maintains
the public's trust. Fairness and openness require open communication among team members, internal and external
customers, and the public. 

To achieve efficient operations, the System must shift its focus from ``risk avoidance'' to one of ``risk management.''
The cost to the taxpayer of attempting to eliminate all risk is prohibitive. The Executive Branch will accept and manage
the risk associated with empowering local procurement officials to take independent action based on their professional
judgment. 


 Fulfill Public Policy Objectives 



The System must support the attainment of public policy goals adopted by the Congress and the President. In attaining
these goals, and in its overall operations, the process shall ensure the efficient use of public resources. 



Acquisition Team 



The purpose of defining the Federal Acquisition Team (Team) in the Acquisition Guiding Principles is to ensure that
participants in the System are identified_beginning with the customer and ending with the contractor of the product
or service. By identifying the team members in this manner, teamwork, unity of purpose and open communication among
the members of the Team in sharing the vision and achieving the goal of the System are encouraged. Individual team members
will participate in the acquisition process at the appropriate time.

Role of the Acquisition Team



Members of the Government Acquisition Team must be empowered to make acquisition decisions within their areas of
responsibility, including selection, negotiation, and administration of contracts consistent with the Guiding
Principles. In particular, the Contracting Officer must have the authority, to the maximum extent practicable and
consistent with law, to determine the application of rules, regulations, and policies, to a specific contract.


The authority to make decisions and the accountability for the decisions made will be delegated to the lowest level
within the System, consistent with law.


The Team must be prepared to perform the functions and duties assigned. The government is committed to provide training,
professional development, and other resources necessary for maintaining and improving the knowledge, skills,
and abilities for all Government participants on the Team, both with regard to their particular area of responsibility
within the System, and their respective role as a team member. The contractor community is encouraged to do likewise.




The System will foster cooperative relationships between the government and its contractors consistent with its
overriding responsibility to the taxpayers.


The FAR outlines procurement policies and procedures that are used by members of the acquisition team. If a policy
or procedure is not specifically addressed in the FAR, Government members of the Team should not assume it is prohibited.
Rather, absence of direction should be interpreted as permitting the Team to innovate and use sound business judgment
that is otherwise consistent with law and within the limits of their authority.

<USDEPT>OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES TRADE REPRESENTATIVE</USDEPT>






Termination of Section 301 Action and Request for Public Comment: Canadian Exports of Softwood Lumber



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of the United States Trade Representative.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The United States Trade Representative (USTR) has determined to terminate action taken under section 301 of the Trade
Act of 1974 on certain entries of softwood lumber products from Canada. The USTR is taking this action in light of the
completion of binational panel proceedings under Chapter 19 of the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement concerning
countervailing duty (CVD) determinations involving Canadian softwood lumber. During these proceedings, the binational
panel directed the Department of Commerce to determine that imports of softwood lumber did not receive countervailable
subsidies.



As a result of the termination of the Section 301 action, the Customs Service will: cease the extension of liquidation
that was ordered pursuant to Section 301 on softwood lumber from Canada that entered from October 4, 1991 to March 12,
1992; de-obligate bonds collected on those entries pursuant to Section 301; and assess no Section 301 duties on those
entries.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On December 15, 1986, the United States and Canada concluded a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) under which, among
other things, Canada agreed to impose a 15 percent export charge on certain softwood lumber products exported to the
United States.





On September 3, 1991, Canada announced that it would unilaterally terminate the MOU in 30 days. In response, on October
4, 1991, Commerce announced that it would self-initiate a CVD investigation on softwood lumber from Canada. On the
same date, USTR initiated an investigation under section 301, and determined under section 301(b) that Canada's
acts, policies and practices in terminating the MOU were unreasonable and burdened or restricted U.S. commerce.
56 Fed. Reg. 50738 (October 8, 1991). USTR further determined that action was appropriate pursuant to section 304
to restore and maintain the status quo ante pending issuance of a preliminary CVD determination, and, if warranted,
to impose duties to offset the effects of any subsidies found in the investigation.

USTR directed the Customs Service, 

inter alia, 

to: (1) impose bonding requirements on certain softwood lumber from Canada entering between October 4, 1991 and the
date of Commerce's preliminary CVD determination; (2) withhold or extend, as appropriate, liquidation of all such
entries of softwood lumber until the imposition of duties; and (3) collect Section 301 duties at the rate specified
in the MOU or the rate of subsidy found in the final Commerce CVD determination, whichever was lower. 

Id. 

USTR later issued an amended notice of initiation containing certain technical corrections to its original notice.
56 Fed. Reg. 58944 (Nov. 22, 1991).

On March 12, 1992, Commerce published its preliminary CVD determination. On May 28, 1992, Commerce published its
final CVD determination, and determined an estimated subsidy rate of 6.51 per cent 

ad valorem. 

Both the domestic industry and affected Canadian parties appealed the final determination to binational panels
established pursuant to Chapter 19 of the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement (FTA).

As a result, on September 28, 1992, USTR published notice of a modification of the Section 301 action. 57 Fed. Reg. 44609
(Sept. 28, 1992). USTR directed Customs to inform importers that they may request extension of liquidation on entries
covered by the Section 301 action, and that ``any entries extended pursuant to such a request will be assessed 301 duties
in accordance with the outcome of chapter 19 proceedings (

i.e., 

at the lower of the applicable MOU rate or the Commerce rate at the conclusion of chapter 19 proceedings).'' 

Id. 

at 44610.



On May 6, 1993, the binational panel remanded the CVD determination to Commerce to reexamine certain of its findings.
On September 17, 1993, Commerce responded by issuing a remand determination, finding a subsidy rate of 11.54 per cent


ad valorem.

On December 17, 1993, the panel issued a second decision, again remanding the determination to Commerce, but this
time with instructions to determine that countervailable subsidies were not being provided to Canadian producers
of softwood lumber. On January 6, 1994, Commerce issued a second remand decision, complying with the panel's instructions.

On February 23, 1994, the panel affirmed Commerce's second remand determination. The binational panel's decision
became final on March 17, 1994. 59 Fed. Reg. 12584 (March 17, 1994).

On April 6, 1994, USTR filed a request for the establishment of an Extraordinary Challenge Committee (ECC) pursuant
to FTA Article 1904.13. The request challenged the panel's substantive determination as well as the conduct of two
of the five panelists.

On August 3, 1994, the ECC, by a two-to-one decision, affirmed the panel's decision. On August 16, 1994, Commerce published
notice of revocation of the CVD order on softwood lumber from Canada and termination of the suspension of liquidation
on softwood lumber entered on or after March 17, 1994. 59 Fed. Reg. 42029 (Aug. 16, 1994).

USTR's previous notice of September 1992 indicated that covered entries would be assessed Section 301 duties at the
lower of the MOU rate or the Commerce subsidy rate at the conclusion of Chapter 19 proceedings. Chapter 19 proceedings
have now concluded with a determination of no countervailable subsidies. Accordingly, no Section 301 duties will
be assessed on the covered entries.

The Customs Service is therefore directed to: cease the extension of liquidation that was ordered pursuant to Section
301 on softwood lumber from Canada that entered from October 4, 1991 to March 12, 1992; de-obligate bonds collected
on those entries pursuant to Section 301; and assess no Section 301 duties on those entries. This action pertains only
to the Section 301 action and is unrelated to the disposition of cash deposits collected pursuant to the lumber CVD
order itself.

Under Section 307, the USTR may modify or terminate action, subject to the direction, if any, of the President, if,
inter alia, 

the action was taken under section 301(b) and the USTR finds the action no longer to be appropriate. USTR has consulted
with representatives of the affected domestic industry regarding this action.



Public Comment: Requirements for Submissions



Section 307(a)(2) requires USTR to provide an opportunity for comment by interested parties affected by a termination
of action concerning the effects of the termination and whether the termination is appropriate. Accordingly, all
interested persons affected by this termination may submit written comments concerning it. USTR will consider any
comments submitted.

Comments must be filed in accordance with the requirements set forth in 15 CFR 2006.8(b). Comments must be in English
and provided in twenty copies to: Chairman, Section 301 Committee, room 223, USTR, 600 17th Street NW., Washington,
D.C. 20506. All comments should be submitted by November 18, 1994.

Comments will be placed in a file (Docket 301-87) open to public inspection pursuant to 15 CFR 2006.13, except
for confidential business information exempt from public inspection in accordance with 15 CFR 2006.15. Confidential
business information submitted in accordance with 15 CFR 2006.15 must be clearly marked ``Business Confidential''
in a contrasting color ink at the top of each page on each of the 20 copies, and must be accompanied by a nonconfidential
summary of the confidential information. The nonconfidential summary shall be placed in the docket, which is open
to public inspection.

<USDEPT>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION</USDEPT>






October 12, 1994.



Self-Regulatory Organizations; Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc.; Order Approving and Notice of Filing and
Order Granting Accelerated Approval to Amendment Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4 to Proposed Rule Change Relating to the Listing
and Trading of Capped Index Options With Quarterly Expiration (``Q-CAPS'') Based on the Standard & Poor's
100 and 500 Stock Indexes



I. Introduction



On January 19, 1993, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (``Act'',)
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change to provide for the listing and trading of Quarterly Index Expiration, Capped Style Options
(``Q-CAPS'') based on the Standard & Poor's (``S&P'') 100 and 500 Stock Indexes. On May 18, 1994, the
CBOE filed Amendment No. 1 (``Amendment No. 1'') to the proposal to provide for certain standards to be used with respect
to the aggregation of FLEX options and Q-CAPS for purposes of FLEX option position limits.
 On May 27, 1994, the CBOE filed Amendment No. 2 (``Amendment No. 2'') to clarify that Q-CAPS will be subject to
the same rules that govern capped-style options (``CAPS'').
 On September 16, 1994, the CBOE filed Amendment No. 3 (``Amendment No. 3'') to clarify aggregation concerns with respect
to options overlying the same index. On September 28, 1994, the CBOE filed Amendment No. 4 (``Amendment No. 4'') to
incorporate the substance of Amendment Nos. 1, 2 and 3 into the CBOE Rule book.
 This order approves the CBOE's proposal, as amended.










Notice of the proposed rule change was published for comment and appeared in the 

Federal Register 

on March 24, 1993.
 No comments were received on the proposal.

II. Description of the Proposal



A. CAPS and QIX Options



A capped-style option is an option that will be automatically exercised prior to expiration if the exercise settlement
value
 for the option on any trading day equals or exceeds (in the case of calls) or equals or is less than (in the case of puts),
the cap price for the option.
 CAPS based on the S&P 100 index (``OEX''), S&P 500 index (``SPX'') and the Russell 2000 index are currently
listed for trading on the CBOE. Quarterly Index Expiration (``QIX'') options generally have the same contract terms
as regular options, except that they expire on the first business day of the month following the end of a calendar quarter.
 QIXs based on the SPX and OEX indexes are currently listed for trading on the CBOE.







B. Q-CAPS



A Q-CAP is an option possessing the same attributes as a capped-style index option contract that expires on the
first business day of the month following the end of a calendar quarter. Q-CAPS will be subject to the same rules
that presently govern the trading of existing CAPS, including, as more fully discussed below, position limits, exercise
limits,
 the setting of cap price intervals
 and margin requirements.








Under the proposal, Interpretation .03 to CBOE Rule 24.9 would be amended to provide for the listing of up to eight near-term
quarterly expirations for Q-CAPS on the S&P 100 and 500 indexes.
 New at-the-money series of Q-CAPS will be brought up every three months and/or after significant market movements.
 Q-CAPS will feature European-style exercise and will have their exercise settlement value based upon the closing
prices of applicable index component stocks on the last business day of the quarter.

<TEXT>
 

For purposes of the Exchange's position limit framework, the CBOE proposes that Q-CAPS will be subject to the
same position limits as standard CAPS. Accordingly, (1) Q-CAPS will be aggregated with and treated identically
to A.M. Settled, European-style option contracts on the S&P 500 Index, including CAPS and QIX options on the S&P
500, for all position limit purposes, including being subject to the 25,000 contract index arbitrage limit;
 (2) Q-CAPS on the S&P 100 Index will be treated like all other OEX options, including CAPS and QIX options,
for all position limit purposes, except for the requirement that limits the number of contracts in the series of any
broad-based index option with the nearest expiration (``telescoping requirement'').
 Additionally, aggregate P.M. Settled FLEX options based on the same index (i.e., 

OEX or SPX), with the same expiration date as QIXs and Q-CAPS will be aggregated.
 Q-CAPS will also be subject to the same hedge exemptions applicable to QIXs and CAPS.








III. Discussion



The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section
6(b)(5),
 and, therefore, approves the Exchange's proposal and grants accelerated approval of the amendments thereto. In
particular, the Commission believes that Q-CAPS will provide additional choice and flexibility to investors
in their use of derivatives and provide a tailored quarterly portfolio hedge that may be more suitable to their investment
needs by allowing them to participate in the options markets at predetermined maximum gains or losses, on a quarterly
basis. The Commission believes it is reasonable for the Exchange to set a cap interval of 30 in that the cap price is placed
sufficiently far from the exercise price so that the Q-CAPS will not be exercised automatically on a frequent
basis.

The Commission also believes the CBOE's proposal to ``bring up'' new at-the-money series of Q-CAPS every three
months and/or after significant market movements is consistent with the Act because it will not result in a significant
proliferation of options series. Finally, the Commission notes that Q-CAPS will be subject to the same margin
requirements as CAPS. Due to the economic similarities of the two products and because the Commission has previously
approved the margin rules applicable to CAPS, no new or unique regulatory concerns are raised by extending this margin
treatment to Q-CAPS.
The Commission also notes that Q-CAPS will be subject to the same position and exercise limit requirements that
currently apply to CAPS. In particular, Q-CAPS on the SPX will be aggregated with SPX CAPS, SPX QIX options, and
all other A.M. Settled SPX contracts, subject to a 45,000 contract limit under Rule 24.4(b), with a 25,000 contract
limit for index arbitrage.
 Q-CAPS on the OEX, under Rule 24.4(c), will be aggregated with OEX CAPS, OEX QIX options, and all other A.M. Settled
OEX contracts, subject to a 25,000 contract limitation, however, with no telescoping requirement. The Commission
also finds that, consistent with the treatment of CAPS, it is appropriate to exclude Q-CAPS from exercise limit
requirements because holders have no control over when their positions will be exercised, except on the last business
day before expiration of the options.





The Commission notes that Q-CAPS will have their exercise settlement value based upon the closing prices of
component stocks on the last business day of the quarter. Although the Commission continues to believe that basing
the settlement of index products on opening, as opposed to closing, prices on Expiration Fridays helps alleviate
stock market volatility,
 these concerns are reduced in the case of Q-CAPS, since expiration of these stock index options will not correspond
to the normal expiration of stock index option, stock index futures and options on stock index futures.






The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4 to the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth
day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the 

Federal Register

. Amendment No. 1 addresses aggregation concerns with respect to P.M. Settled FLEX options by amending CBOE Rule 24A-7
to require aggregation of positions in P.M. Settled FLEX options with positions in Q-CAPS and QIXs based on the
same index with the same expiration date. This amendment helps to prevent any resulting increase in position limits
relating to P.M. Settled FLEX options and should help prevent an investor from using FLEX options for the purpose of
avoiding the position limits applicable to QIXs and Q-CAPS.
Amendment No. 2 states that Q-CAPS will be subject to the same rules that currently govern CAPS regarding position
and exercise limits and margin requirements. Additionally, the amendment provides that the listing of Q-CAPS
with expirations greater than 12 months will require the filing of a rule proposal with the Commission, and approval
of such filing pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act. The Commission believes that Amendment No. 2 helps to clarify
the rules and procedures applicable to the listing and trading Q-CAPS and contains only minor variations from
the original proposal.
Amendment No. 3 explains that Q-CAPS, CAPS, QIXs and standard options positions on the S&P 100 and 500, respectively,
will be aggregated for determining position limit compliance. The Commission believes this amendment clarifies
existing CBOE Rule 24.4 and helps to ensure that Q-CAPS comply with the existing position limit framework.
Amendment No. 4 incorporates the substance of Amendment Nos. 1, 2 and 3 into the CBOE's Rule book. Accordingly, the
Commission does not believe the amendment raises any new or unique regulatory concerns.
Therefore the Commission believes it is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) and 19(b)(2) of the Act to approve Amendment
Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4 to the CBOE's proposal on an accelerated basis.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; The Depository Trust Company; Notice of Extension of Comment Period for a Proposed
Rule Change Establishing a Fee Schedule for Certain Inter-Depository Deliveries</DOCTITLE>



October 12, 1994




On July 7, 1994, The Depository Trust Company (``DTC'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'')
a proposed rule change (File No. SR-DTC-94-10) pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder. DTC filed the proposal to establish a fee schedule for certain interdepository deliveries.
Notice of the proposed rule change was published in the 

Federal Register

 on August 9, 1994.
 In an earlier notice, the Commission granted an extension of the period for public comment on the proposed rule change
until September 30, 1994.









The Commission has received a request for an additional extension of the comment period on the proposed rule change
and finds that the complexity and significance of the filing dictates a longer comment period to ensure that interested
parties have sufficient time in which to conduct complete analyses of the proposal.


Thus, the Commission finds good cause to extend the period for public comment on the proposed rule change until November
15, 1994.







For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; the Options Clearing Corporation; Notice of Filing of a Proposed Rule Change Relating
to Flexibly Structured Index Options Denominated in a Foreign Currency</DOCTITLE>


October 13, 1994.


Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 notice is hereby given that on August 19, 1994, The Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which
Items have been prepared primarily by OCC. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed
rule change from interested persons.




I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


The purpose of the proposed rule change is to enable OCC to issue, clear, and settle new flexibly structured index options
denominated in a foreign currency to be traded at the Chicago Board Options Exchange (``CBOE'').





II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, OCC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule
change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined
at the places specified in Item IV below. OCC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below,
of the most significant aspects of such statements.


A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


On September 23, 1993, the Commission approved a proposed rule change filed by OCC which proposed to accommodate the
clearance and settlement of flexibly structured index options.
 Flexibly structured index options exhibit virtually the same characteristics as regular index options; therefore,
OCC establishes long and short flexibly structured index option positions in clearing member accounts in precisely
the same way it currently does for regular index options. OCC incorporates flexibly structured index options in its
premium settlement, margin collection, exercise notice, exercise assignment, and exercise/expiration statement
processes without significant changes to those processes. Premiums and exercise prices for the flexibly structured
index options that are currently being traded are denominated in United States dollars. Parties to a transaction
in such an option may customize certain terms of the option including: the expiration date, the exercise style, the
exercise price, the cap interval in the case of capped-style options, and the method to be used for establishing the
current index value for purposes of settling expiration date exercises.




The new flexibly structured index option product to be traded at the CBOE is similar to the existing flexibly structured
index option product in that the underlying interest is an index and the parties to a transaction may customize certain
terms of the option. However, the new product will have premiums and exercise prices denominated in foreign currencies
rather than in United States dollars.
 Accordingly, this new product is being called Flexibly Structured Index Options Denominated in a Foreign Currency
(``FX Index Options'').




To accommodate the clearance and settlement of FX Index Options, a new Article, Article XXIII, will be added to the
OCC By-Laws. Because FX Index Options are a type of index option, the OCC By-Laws governing index options, Article
XVII, will be incorporated into new Article XXIII and will be made applicable to FX Index Options. In addition, because
FX Index Options will settle in a foreign currency, certain of the OCC By-Laws governing Cross-Rate Foreign Currency
Options in Article XX also are being incorporated into new Article XXIII where appropriate. For example, those By-Laws
governing extraordinary events, adjustments, and the payment of premiums will be incorporated into the new article.

<DOCNO> FR941019-2-00184 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941019-2-00097 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

A Chapter XXIV will be added the OCC Rules to accommodate FX Index Options. FX Index Options will be exercised pursuant
to the rules governing existing index options. Accordingly, the rules governing exercise, assignment, allocation,
and the exercise settlement date from Chapter XVIII, which pertains to index options, will be incorporated into new
Chapter XXIV and will be made applicable to FX Index Options. In addition, the settlement procedure for FX Index Options
will be the same as the procedure for existing index options. Exercised FX Index Options will be settled through the
payment of an exercise settlement amount, which is the difference between the aggregate exercise price and the aggregate
current index value. Accordingly, the rules governing exercise settlement and the exercise settlement date from
Chapter XVIII will be incorporated into new Chapter XXIV and will be made applicable to FX Index Options. Because FX
Index Options will settle in a foreign currency, certain settlement obligations of a party to a FX Index Option contract
will be similar to the settlement obligations of a party to a cross-rate foreign currency option contract. Therefore,
certain rules governing settlement obligations from Chapter XXI, which pertains to cross-rate foreign currency
options, will be incorporated into new Chapter XXIV. Specifically, these include the obligation to set up bank accounts
and the consequence of failing to pay a foreign currency. Finally, FX Index Options will be margined like cross-rate
foreign currency options in that the margin requirement will be calculated in the applicable trading currency and
then converted to United States dollars. Consequently, the language of Rule 2111 governing margin requirements
for cross-rate foreign currency options will be incorporated into new Chapter XXIV. 
Two additional changes to the OCC By-Laws and an additional change to OCC's Rules also will be made. Specifically,
the term ``FX index option clearing member'' will be added to the definition of ``clearing member'' in Article I, Section
1 of the By-Laws. In addition, the reference to the term ``FLEX'' in the definition of clearing member will be changed
to ``flexibly structured option'' in order to make that term more generic. Finally, OCC Rule 401 will be amended to
require that the currency in which the option is denominated, the expiration date of the option contract as opposed
to the month, and the cap price, if any, be included in the Report of Matched Trades.
OCC believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the purposes and requirements of Section 17A of the Act because
it provides for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of transactions in flexibly structured index options
denominated in a foreign currency and because it provides for the safeguarding of related securities and funds. The
proposed rule change meets such requirements by establishing a framework in which existing OCC systems, rules, and
procedures are extended to the processing of the new FX Index Options.

<DOCTITLE>Corporate Renaissance Group, Inc., et al.; Notice of Application </DOCTITLE>



October 13, 1994. 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'').



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of application for order of exemption under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``Act'').







APPLICANTS: 

Corporate Renaissance Group, Inc. (the ``Company'') and M.D. Sass Investors Services, Inc. (the ``Investment Adviser'').




RELEVANT ACT SECTIONS: 

Order requested under sections 6(c) and 57(i) and rule 17d-1 thereunder permitting certain joint transactions
otherwise prohibited by section 57(a)(4).



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: 

Applicants request an order to permit the Company to co-invest with certain private investment companies either
advised by the Investment Adviser or by certain affiliates of the Investment Adviser.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application is available for a fee at the SEC's Public Reference
Branch.





Applicants' Representations



1. The Company, a Delaware corporation, is a newly formed non-diversified closed-end management company that has
elected to operate as a business development company under the Act. The Company has filed a registration statement
on Form N-2 (File No. 33-50424) with respect to an initial public offering of its common stock. The registration
statement has not yet been declared effective by the SEC. The Company's primary investment objective will be to achieve
long-term capital appreciation through controlling (25% or greater) investments in ``eligible portfolio companies''
(as defined in the Act). The Company will invest in portfolio companies with viable existing businesses generating
substantial revenues in established markets, but that have recently completed, are in the process of undergoing,
or are likely to undergo, a financial restructuring pursuant to bankruptcy or reorganization proceedings or on a
negotiated basis outside of bankruptcy or reorganization proceedings. 

2. The Investment Adviser is a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the ``Advisers
Act''). The Company has retained the Investment Adviser as the Company's investment adviser to identify, negotiate,
manage and liquidate investments for the Company. 

3. Martin D. Sass and Hugh R. Lamle, who are officers and directors of the Company, are principal stockholders, officers
and directors of the Investment Adviser. James B. Rubin, an officer and director of the Company and Martin E. Winter,
an officer of the Company, are also officers of the Investment Adviser. In addition, Messrs. Sass and Lamle are principal
stockholders, officers, and directors of two other investment advisers registered under the Advisers Act, M.D.
Sass Associates, Inc. (``Associates'') and M.D. Sass Management, Inc. (``Management''). Messrs. Rubin and Winter
are also officers of Associates and Management. The Investment Adviser, Associates and Management control other
entities engaged in investing primarily in financially distressed companies (the ``M.D. Sass Funds'').

4. None of the M.D. Sass Funds has made or presently proposes to make a public offering of its securities. Each of the
M.D. Sass Funds: (a) Is exempt from registration under the Act pursuant to section 3(c)(1) because its outstanding
securities are beneficially owned by less than 100 persons; or (b) is not subject to registration under section 7(d)
because it is not organized or otherwise created under the laws of the United States or any state and has not made use
of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce in connection with any public offering of its securities.
The M.D. Sass Funds and those entities not subject to the registration requirements of the Act that may be subsequently
created or otherwise organized by the Investment Adviser or affiliates of the Investment Adviser are referred to
as the ``M.D. Sass Affiliates.'' The Company proposes to co-invest with the M.D. Sass Affiliates in order to acquire
a diversified portfolio of investments and to compete effectively for such investments with larger entities. 



Applicants' Legal Analysis 



1. Section 17(d) and rule 17d-1 thereunder provide, among other things, that it shall be unlawful for an affiliate
person of an investment company, or an affiliated of such person, acting as principal, to participate in any joint
enterprise or other joint arrangement in which any such investment company is a participant, unless the SEC has issued
an order approving the joint enterprise or arrangement. Section 57(a)(4) applies the same prohibitions to affiliated
persons of a business development company. Section 57(i) applies the rules adopted under section 17(d) to business
development companies.

2. Applicants submit that the substantive ongoing obligations imposed on the independent directors of the Company
provide significant protection to investors against possible conflicts of interest in co-investments by the applicants
and the M.D. Sass Affiliates. Applicants also believe that the proposed conditions applicable to the operations
of the Company governing the terms on which co-investments may be made and the disposition of investments held by any
affiliate that co-invests with the Company (including the conditions set forth herein) are consistent with the policies
underlying the Act and rule 17d-1 thereunder.



Applicants' Conditions



Applicants agree that the order shall be subject to the following conditions:

1. Before a co-investment transaction is effected, the Investment Adviser must make an initial determination on
behalf of the Company regarding investment suitability. Following this determination, the Investment Adviser
will make a written investment presentation regarding the proposed co-investment to the independent directors
of the Company. Such information will include the identity of each affiliate that proposes to co-invest with the Company
(collectively, including the Company, the ``Co-Investors'').

2. The independent directors of the Company will review the Investment Adviser's initial determination. In doing
so, the independent directors will request such additional information from the Investment Adviser as they deem
necessary to the exercise of their reasonable business judgment, and will employ such experts, including lawyers
and accountants, as they deem appropriate. Prior to committing to a co-investment, a ``required majority'' (as defined
in section 57(o) of the Act) of the independent directors of the Company must conclude that:

(a) The terms, of the transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to the stockholders
and the Company and do not involve overreaching of the stockholders and the Company on the part of any person concerned;

(b) The transaction is consistent with the interests of the stockholders of the Company and is consistent with the
investment objective and policies of the Company as recited in its Registration Statement filed under the Securities
Act of 1933 and subsequent reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; and

(c) The investment by one or more of the other Co-Investors would not disadvantage the Company in the making of such
investment, maintaining its investment position, or disposing of such investment and that participation by the
Company would not be on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other Co-Investors.

3. The other Co-Investors will be permitted to invest only to the extent that the total investment opportunity exceeds
the amount that the Company determines to invest.

4. Co-Investments in securities by the Company with any other Co-Investor will consist of the same class of securities
including the same registration rights (if any) and other rights related thereto, purchased at the same price on the
same settlement date, and the approval of such transaction by the Company's independent directors will be made in
the same time period.

5. If any Co-Investor determines to make an additional investment in an issuer whose securities were purchased in
a co-investment transaction (a ``Follow-On Investment''), notice of the proposed Follow-On Investment will be
given to the Company at the earliest practical time. Follow-on investments will be reviewed, approved, allocated,
and disposed of in the same manner as prescribed for initial co-investments under these conditions.

6. No co-investment will be made in the securities of any entity if any Co-Investor has previously acquired a security
issued by such entity provided that this prohibition shall not apply to Follow-On Investments.

7. If any Co-Investor elects to sell, exchange, or otherwise dispose of any interest in a security purchased in a co-investment
transaction, notice of the proposed disposition will be given to the Company at the earliest practical time. The Investment
Adviser will provide a written recommendation to the independent directors of the Company concerning the proposed
disposition. The Company will participate in the disposition at the same time as the other Co-Investors, on a proportionate
basis, and on the same terms and conditions: provided that a required majority of the independent directors may decide
that the Company will not participate in the proposed disposition or will dispose of less than its proportionate interest
if they determine that such action is in the best interest of the Company, is reasonable and fair to the stockholders
and the Company, and does not involve overreaching of the stockholders and the Company on the part of any person concerned.

8. The independent directors of the Company will be provided quarterly for review all information concerning co-investment
transactions made by the Co-Investors, including co-investment transactions in which the Company has declined
to participate, so that they may determine whether all co-investment transactions made during the preceding quarter,
including those co-investment transactions that were declined, complied with the conditions set forth above. In
addition, the independent directors of the Company will consider at least quarterly the continuing appropriateness
of the standards established for co-investment transactions by the Company, including whether use of the standards
continues to be in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders and does not involve overreaching of the Company
and its stockholders on the part of any party concerned.

9. The independent directors of the Company will maintain the records described in section 57(f)(3) of the Act as if
each of the transactions permitted under these conditions were approved by the independent directors of the Company
under section 57(f). In addition, the Company will maintain, at its office, written records detailing the factors
considered in each of its determinations or recommendations referred to in these conditions. All records referred
to or required under these conditions will be available for inspection by the Commission and will be preserved permanently,
the first two years in an easily accessible place.

10. No independent director of the Company shall participate in the consideration of any aspect of a co-investment
transaction if he is affiliated with an M.D. Sass Affiliate that proposes to participate or has participated in the
transaction.

<DOCTITLE>USAA Life Insurance Company, et al.</DOCTITLE>



October 13, 1994.



<AGENCY>
agency: 

Securites and Exchange Commission (the ``SEC'' or ``Commission'').



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
action: 

Notice of Application for Exemptions under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``1940 Act'').





applicants: 

USAA Life Insurance Company (``USAA Life''), Separate Account of USAA Life Insurance Company (the ``Account''),
any other separate account (``Other Account''; together with the Account, the ``Separate Accounts,'' unless the
context otherwise requires) established by USAA Life in the future to support certain variable annuity contracts,
and USAA Investment Management Company (``USA IMCO'').




relevant 1940 act sections: 

Exemptions requested under Section 6(c) from Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary of application: 

Applicants seek an order permitting them to deduct a mortality and expense risk charge from the assets of the Account
and any Other Account under certain flexible premium deferred combination fixed and variable annuity contracts
(the ``Contracts'').



</SUMMARY>
</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941019-2-00189 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941019-2-00099 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The mortality and expense risk charge would be a daily net asset charge at an aggregate nominal rate of 1.05% per annum,
consisting of approximately .70% for mortality risks and .35% for expense risks. USAA Life will assume a mortality
risk arising from its obligation to pay a death benefit prior to the annuity date. The death benefit payable is the greater
of (a) the monetary value of the Contract (

i.e.,

 the sum of the Contract values invested in the Variable Fund Accounts and in USAA Life's general account) on the date
USAA Life receives proof of death or (b) the sum of all premium payments credited to the Contract, less the amount of
any withdrawals and less any applicable premium tax. USAA Life assumes an additional mortality risk by its contractual
obligation to continue to make annuity payments for the entire life of the annuitant under annuity options that involve
life contingencies.


6. In addition to mortality risks, USAA Life will assume an expense risk because the administrative charges under
the Contract, which cannot be raised, may be insufficient to cover actual administrative expenses. In this regard,
USAA Life agrees not to raise, for the duration of the Contracts, the daily net asset value charge of 0.10% for administrative
expenses and the annual Contract maintenance charge in the amount of $30 per year.


7. The order requested by Applicants would apply to the Contracts and also to substantially similar contracts issued
by the Account or by any Other Account.




Applicants' Legal Analysis




1. Applicants request an order under Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act granting exemptions from Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and
27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act to the extent necessary to permit the deduction of the mortality and expense risk charge. Sections
26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) prohibit a registered unit investment trust and any depositor or underwriter thereof from
selling periodic payment plan certificates unless the proceeds of all payments are deposited with a trustee or custodian
having the qualifications prescribed by Section 26(a)(1) of the 1940 Act and are held under an agreement that provides
that no payment to the depositor or principal underwriter shall be allowed except as a fee, not exceeding such reasonable
amount as the Commission may prescribe, for bookkeeping and other administrative services. Applicants' proposed
mortality and expense risk charge would not be considered a bookkeeping and administrative expense.


2. Applicants propose to assess against the assets of the Account a daily mortality and expense risk charge at an aggregate
rate of 1.05% per annum. USAA Life guarantees that it will not raise the charge for the duration of the Contracts. USAA
Life expects to make a profit from this charge. Applicants represent that the level of the mortality and expense risk
charge is within the range of industry practice for comparable annuity contracts. Applicants state that they have
reviewed publicly-available information regarding products of other companies, taking into consideration such
factors as guaranteed minimum death benefits, guaranteed annuity purchase rates, minimum initial and subsequent
premium payments, other contract charges, the manner in which charges are imposed, market sector, investment options
under the contracts, and availability to individual qualified and nonqualified plans. Based upon this review, Applicants
have concluded that the mortality and expense risk charge is within the range of charges determined by industry practice.
With respect to any Contracts offered by it, USAA Life will maintain at its principal offices a memorandum setting
forth in detail the variable annuity products analyzed and the methodology, and results, of Applicants' comparative
review. USAA Life will make this memorandum available to the Commission and its staff upon request.


3. If the mortality and expense risk charge is insufficient to cover the expenses and cost assumed, the loss will be
borne by USAA Life. Conversely, if the charge deducted proves more than sufficient, the excess will be profit to USAA
Life. USAA Life expects to earn a profit from the mortality and expense risk charge.


4. Applicants acknowledge that, in the absence of a specified charge for the costs of distributing the Contracts,
all or a portion of any profit realized from the mortality and expense risk charge may be offset by distribution expenses.
In such circumstances, a portion of the mortality and expense risk charge might be viewed as providing for a portion
of the costs relating to distribution of the Contracts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, USAA Life has concluded that
there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed distribution financing arrangements made with respect to the
Contracts will benefit the Account and Contract owners. The basis for such conclusion will be set forth in a memorandum
which will be maintained by USAA Life at its principal offices and will be made available to the Commission and its staff
upon request.


5. USAA Life represents that the Account will invest only in an underlying mutual fund that undertakes, in the event
it should adopt any plan under Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act to finance distribution expenses, to have such plan
formulated and approved by a board of trustees, a majority of the members of which are not ``interested persons'' of
such fund within the meaning of Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act.

6. Applicants submit that the requested relief is appropriate in the public interest, because it would promote competitiveness
in the variable annuity contract market by eliminating the need for Applicants to file redundant exemptive applications,
thereby reducing their administrative expenses and maximizing the efficient use of their resources.



Applicants' Conclusion




For the reasons discussed above, Applicants conclude that granting their requested order would be necessary or appropriate
in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy
and provisions of the 1940 Act.

For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority.

AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of public hearings.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The FAA intends to conduct hearings in New Jersey to gather comments on the supplemental draft environmental impact
statement (EIS) released on September 30, 1994.



As a result of the analysis phase of the comment period associated with the Draft EIS, new information was developed
by the FAA. Additionally, new information was received from the public during the comment period. Since this information
is pertinent to the decision process leading to issuance of a final EIS, the public should have an opportunity to examine
the new material and comment on it prior to completion of the EIS.

The supplemental draft EIS (SDEIS) was prepared in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act. Copies
have been mailed to individuals that participated in the EIS process as well as to libraries in select locations throughout
New Jersey.




COMMENT PERIOD: 

Written comments, in triplicate, must be received at the following address by November 30, 1994: Federal Aviation
Administration, Office of the Chief Counsel: Docket Number 27649, 800 Independence Avenue S.W., Washington, DC
20591.



During the comment period, the FAA will conduct three public hearings in New Jersey to solicit both written and oral
comments on the SDEIS. All persons wishing to make oral presentations at the public hearings are strongly urged to
provide a written copy of their statement at the hearing or at the FAA address provided in the above paragraph.

The following is a listing of the dates, times and locations of the hearings in New Jersey:






The FAA will consider and respond to all comments directly related to the scope of the SDEIS. The geographic scope delineated
by Congress for the EIS was the environmental effects of the Expanded East Coast Plan over the State of New Jersey and
adjacent coastal waters. Please note, however, that the most useful comments are those which provide facts and analyses
to support the reviewer's recommendations or conclusions on specific topics contained in the document. Should any
comments be received after the close of the comment period, FAA cannot assure they will be considered or addressed
in the final EIS.

The FAA will issue a final EIS that will include corrections, clarifications and responses to comments on the SDEIS.




Issued in Washington, D.C., on October 14, 1994.

the repayment of up to $20,000 of the principal and interest of the educational loans of such health professionals

health professionals, who are from disadvantaged backgrounds, to clinical research careers at the NIH. Through
this notice, the NIH invites health professionals, who are from disadvantaged backgrounds and interested in engaging
