Career and Career-Conditional Employment



<AGENCY>

Office of Personnel Management.

<ACTION>
action: 

Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) proposes to revise requirements of the career-conditional employment
system concerning reinstatement, career tenure, and probation. Consistent with recommendations of the National
Performance Review, these proposals would deregulate and simplify the appointment system. These proposals would
drop the time limit on reinstatement eligibility, link career tenure to completion of probation instead of 3 years
of service, and clarify probationary period requirements.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information: 

The National Performance Review (NPR) has recommended changes in the way the Government operates. One recommendation
was to deregulate and decentralize the personnel system to give agencies more authority over hiring. Consistent
with the NPR recommendations, these proposals would simplify the career tenure, probation, and reinstatement aspects
of the career-conditional appointment system.



A specific NPR recommendation was to abolish the Federal Personnel Manual (FPM). When this was done in December 1993,
FPM Chapter 315 was provisionally retained through December 1994 to enable OPM to issue regulations to replace needed
instructions found only in the FPM. Rather than transfer existing rules from the FPM to the CFR, OPM proposes to simplify
requirements.



Career-Conditional Appointment System



The Federal career-conditional system is close to 40 years old. Because it was created to meet the needs of another
era, many aspects of the system are outdated. For example, major concerns in designing the system were two provisions
of the now expired ``Whitten Amendment'' (section 1310 of Pub. L. 82-253, November 1, 1951). One provision was
a Governmentwide ceiling on permanent employees and another was a requirement that appointments be made on a nonpermanent
basis. Thus, the length of the career-conditional period was made to be flexible so it could be extended beyond 3 years
if the permanent workforce became larger than permitted by law.

Today, however, both career and career-conditional employees are counted as permanent, and the idea of a varying
service requirement for career tenure no longer fits our framework. Other than the probationary period, there are
only two differences between career and career-conditional appointments. First, non-veteran career-conditional
employees have a 3-year reinstatement eligibility. Other employees have no time limit. Second, in a reduction in
force, career employees who are not serving probation have higher standing than career-conditional employees have.

The basic purpose of the tenure system has changed too. The original intent was that an employee would gain the full
benefits of the system only after working continuously in the career system for a certain period. A lengthy continuous
service requirement, however, is too burdensome in today's society where workers, many of whom are from dual income
families, are highly mobile and subject to relocation (which often results in breaks in service in Federal careers).
Furthermore, over the years, we have added exceptions and new rules to accommodate changing employment conditions.
In the process, the body of rules for career tenure has become complex.

The relationship of probation and career tenure is also a confusing aspect of the appointment system. Most individuals
view completion of the probationary period as the most significant change in an employee's status. Once employees
complete probation, they acquire the adverse action rights under 5 CFR part 432 and 752. Despite having these rights,
most employees continue for an additional 2 years as career-conditional before reaching career tenure.



Career Tenure



Currently, 5 CFR 315.201(a) requires 3 years of creditable service for an employee to receive a career appointment.
Section 315.201(b) provides that OPM will publish in the FPM the conditions under which service may be credited in
meeting the 3-year requirement.

These conditions are in subchapter 2 of the provisionally retained FPM Chapter 315. An employee's 3-year period of
service must begin with one of 16 different categories of employment, be substantially continuous (with nine categories
of exceptions), and total 3 years (with special rules for less than full-time service, credit for time in nonpay status
in four situations, credit for time off the rolls in six situations, and credit for certain intervening service in
seven situations). As a result, making a determination of an employee's eligibility for career status can be confusing
and time consuming.

To simplify these rules and to link career employment to the significant event of completing probation, OPM proposes
that acquisition of career tenure rest on completion of the probationary period. Generally, an individual's first
permanent appointment in the competitive service would be a career-conditional appointment. Upon completion of
probation as provided in 5 CFR 315, subpart H, the employee would automatically become a career appointee. (Certain
authorities specifically exempt appointees from probation. Individuals employed under these authorities would
be hired under career appointment. Example: employees noncompetitively converted from a Veterans Readjustment
Appointment to the competitive service are not subject to probation, so they would be converted to a career appointment
upon satisfying requirements.)

At present, the probationary period on appointment is 1 year. However, the National Performance Review and the National
Partnership Council have recommended that legislation be sought to enable probationary periods to be set for up to
3 years, based on the requirements of the position. Therefore, this proposal anticipates that at some time in the future,
employees may be subject to differing probationary periods and may acquire career tenure after varying periods.

OPM recognizes that this proposal to simplify the appointment system could impact the outcome of any reduction in
force (RIF). This is because tenure is one of the four factors required by law to determine retention standing in a RIF.
Under this proposal, employees would acquire career tenure and move to tenure group I, the highest tenure group, sooner
than they do under current rules. This would result in relatively fewer employees in tenure group II than there are
now, reducing opportunities for tenure group I employees to displace, or bump, employees in lower tenure groups.
If this proposed rule is adopted, OPM would make the change mandatory for all RIF actions effective 6 months after publication
of the final rule.

Under this proposal, current career-conditional employees who have completed probation would be changed to a career
appointment. Upon reinstatement, a former career-conditional employee who had completed probation would be reinstated
to a career appointment; if probation had not been completed, reinstatement would be to a career-conditional appointment.
In revising  315.201(c), we dropped the term ``conversion'' as redundant; this term simply indicates that
an employee was changed from one type of appointment to another appointment, without a break in service, while on the
rolls of the same agency.

5 CFR 2.2(a)(2) provides that a current or former career employee who is appointed from a register must be given a career
appointment, even if subject to a probationary period. (Therefore, OPM is not proposing any change in the tenure groups
defined in the reduction in force rules at 5 CFR 351.501(b).) Rule 2.2(a)(2) can be amended only by Executive order.
OPM welcomes comments on whether it should seek an amendment to this provision so that all current or former career
employees who are reappointed subject to probation would be hired as career-conditional employees. This would not
lessen their rights since, even now, current and former career employees who accept an appointment with a probationary
period are placed in the same tenure group with career-conditional employees.

Probationary Period



OPM proposes to clarify basic requirements of the probationary period for new appointments, and for new supervisors
and managers. The following changes are proposed: 

Section 315.801 would clarify that family members appointed under Executive Order 12721 are required to serve probation
and that Postal Career employees who transfer to the competitive service, without having completed 1 year of service,
serve the remainder of the 1 year in their new agencies as probationers.

Section 315.802 would clarify that agencies may not extend the probationary period beyond 1 year and specify how prior
and other service is credited towards the completion of probation. OPM may not permit agencies to extend probation
beyond 1 year or impose it at agency discretion because the OPM General Counsel has advised that such an extension would
be inconsistent with the adverse action protections and procedures under current law that are afforded to employees
who have completed 1 year of current continuous service. Legislation is needed for longer probationary periods.

Section 315.804 would clarify when the probationary period ends and when a separation must be effected.

Section 315.902 refers the reader to the FPM, which referenced the Supervisory Grade Evaluation Guide (SGEG). The
SGEG was replaced by General Schedule Supervisory Guide in April 1993.

Section 315.906 would clarify the crediting of various service toward completion of probation for new supervisors
and managers.

Section 315.907 would clarify what happens when an employee takes a downgrade to enter a supervisory or managerial
position and fails to complete probation.



Reinstatement Eligibility



Currently, 5 CFR 315.401 places a 3-year limit on the reinstatement eligibility of a nonpreference eligible who previously
served under a career-conditional appointment. (Reinstatement eligibility permits an individual to be re-hired
without competing in a competitive civil service examination.) Subchapter 3 of the provisionally retained FPM Chapter
315 authorizes agencies to extend this limit based on any of 14 different activities of a former employee, such as excepted
employment or education which gave the individual valuable training for the job to be filled. (Career employees and
preference eligible career-conditional employees already have unlimited reinstatement eligibility.)

To simplify the appointment system, OPM proposes to drop the time limit on reinstatement eligibility so that any individual
who served under career-conditional appointment could be rehired at any time. This change also recognizes the difficulties
encountered by spouses subject to relocation (such as spouses of members of the Armed Forces) due to the current 3-year
limit and that, in the future, individuals may have fewer opportunities to exercise a reinstatement eligibility
in a shrinking Federal Government. Dropping the time limit will enable them to exercise their eligibility at any time.

I certify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
because it pertains only to Federal employees and agencies.

2. Subpart B is revised to read as follows:



Subpart B_The Career-Conditional Employment System



 315.201



Competitive status and career employment.



(a) A person employed in the competitive service for other than temporary, term, or indefinite employment is appointed
as a career or career-conditional employee subject to the probationary period required by subpart H of this part.

(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, an appointee who is required to serve a probationary period
under subpart H of this part is appointed as a career-conditional employee. A career-conditional employee becomes
a career employee automatically on completion of probation.

(c) A person is appointed as a career employee on:

(1) Appointment from a register if the person previously completed the requirement for a career appointment, even
if the person must serve a probationary period under subpart H of this part;

(2) Reinstatement if the person previously completed the requirement for a career appointment or served with competitive
status under an appointment that did not require a probationary period under subpart H of this part;

(3) Appointment based on a noncompetitive authority under which the person acquired competitive status or is not
required to serve a probationary period under subpart H of this part; and

(4) Appointment to a position required by law to be filled on a permanent basis, including while an employee is serving
in such a position.

(d) Career and career-conditional employees are assigned to tenure groups for retention purposes in accordance
with  351.501(b) of this chapter.

3. Section 315.401 is revised, to read as follows:


 315.401


Reinstatement.




Subject to part 335 of this chapter, an agency may appoint by reinstatement to a competitive service position any person
who previously was employed under career or career-conditional appointment. There is no time limit on a person's
eligibility for reinstatement.

4. Sections 315.501 and 315.502 are revised, to read as follows:


 315.501


Transfer.



Subject to part 335 of this chapter, an agency may appoint by transfer to a competitive service position, without a
break in service of a single day, a current career or career-conditional employee of another agency.


 315.502


Tenure on transfer.

Exception. 

A career-conditional employee who transfers to a position required by law to be filled on a permanent basis becomes
a career employee.

5. In  315.801, paragraphs (a)(8) and (d) are added, to read as follows:


 315.801

(d) Upon noncompetitive appointment to the competitive service under the Postal Reorganization Act (39 U.S.C. 101


et seq.

), an employee of the Postal Career Service (including substitute and part-time flexible) who has not completed 1
year of Postal service, must serve the remainder of a 1-year probationary period in the new agency.

6. Section 315.802 is revised to read as follows:



 315.802

Length of probationary period; crediting service.



(a) The probationary period required by  315.801 is 1 year and may not be extended. 

(b) Prior Federal civilian service (including nonappropriated fund service) counts toward completion of probation
when the prior service:

(1) Is in the same agency, e.g., Department of the Army;

(2) Is in the same line of work (determined by the employee's actual duties and responsibilities); and

(3) Contains or is followed by no more than a single break in service that does not exceed 30 days.

(c) Periods of absence while in a pay status count toward completion of probation. Absence in nonpay status while on
the rolls (other than for compensable injury or military duty) is creditable up to a total of 22 workdays. Absence (whether
on or off the rolls) due to compensable injury or military duty is creditable in full upon restoration to Federal service.
Nonpay time in excess of 22 workdays extends the probationary period by an equal amount. An employee serving probation
who leaves Federal service to become a volunteer with the Peace Corps or ACTION serves the remainder of the probationary
period upon reinstatement provided the employee is reinstated within 90 days of termination of service as a volunteer,
or training for such service.

(d) The probationary period for part-time employees is computed on the basis of calendar time, in the same manner as
for full-time employees. For intermittent employees, i.e., those who do not have regularly scheduled tours of duty,
each day or part of a day in pay status counts as 1 day of credit toward the 260 days in a pay status required for completion
of probation. (However, the probationary period cannot be completed in less than 1 year of calendar time.)

7. In  315.804, the existing text is designated as paragraph (a) and paragraph (b) is added, to read as follows:



 315.804

Termination of probationers for unsatisfactory performance or conduct.



* * * * *



(b) Probation ends when the employee completes his or her scheduled tour of duty on the day before the anniversary date
of the employee's appointment. For example, when the last workday is a Friday and the anniversary date is the following
Monday, the probationer must be separated before the end of the tour of duty on Friday since Friday would be the last
day the employee actually has to demonstrate fitness for further employment.

8. Section 315.902 is revised to read as follows:



 315.902

Definitions.

9. In  315.906, paragraph (b) is revised and new paragraphs (c) and (d) are added, to read as follows:



 315.906

Crediting service toward completion of the probationary period.



* * * * *



(b) Service on detail, temporary promotion, or reassignment to another supervisory or managerial position while
serving probation is creditable toward completion of probation. Service in a nonsupervisory or nonmanagerial position
is not creditable.

(c) Absence in a non-pay status while on the rolls (other than absence because of compensable injury or military duty)
is creditable up to a total of 22 workdays. Absence (whether on or off the rolls) due to compensable injury or military
duty is creditable in full upon restoration to Federal service.

(d) Service during a probationary period from which an employee was separated or demoted for cause does not count toward
completion of probation required under a subsequent appointment. In other situations in which an employee does not
complete probation, service is creditable as determined by agency policy.

10. In  315.907, paragraph (b) is revised to read as follows:



 315.907

Failure to complete the probationary period.



* * * * *



(b) A nonsupervisory or nonmanagerial employee who is demoted into a position in which probation under  315.904
is required and who, for reasons of supervisory or managerial performance, does not satisfactorily complete the
probationary period is entitled to be assigned to a position at the same grade and pay as the position in which he or she
was serving probation. The employee is eligible for repromotion in accordance with agency promotion policy.

Food Stamp Program: Resource Provision From the Mickey Leland Memorial Domestic Hunger Relief Act of 1990


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Nutrition Service, USDA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This rule proposes to amend Food Stamp Program regulations to implement a provision contained in the Mickey Leland
Memorial Domestic Hunger Relief Act of 1990 (the Leland Act) to expand the criteria by which a resource can be considered
inaccessible. The Department originally published a proposed rule concerning this provision on August 13, 1991
at 56 FR 40164. After reviewing the comments received, the Department elected to withdraw the provision as originally
proposed and amend its proposal. Subsequently, on December 13, 1991, the Food Stamp Act of 1977 was amended by the Food,
Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act Amendments of 1991 which refined the Leland Act provision concerning inaccessible
resources. In this proposed rulemaking, the Department is addressing both statutory provisions dealing with inaccessible
resources.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Executive Order 12372



The Food Stamp Program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.551. For the reasons set
forth in the final rule and related Notice(s) to 7 CFR 3105, subpart V (48 FR 29115, June 24, 1983; or 48 FR 54317, December
1, 1983, as appropriate), this Program is excluded from the scope of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental
consultation with State and local officials.


Executive Order 12778



This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is intended to have
preemptive effect with respect to any state or local laws, regulations, or policies which conflict with its provisions
or which would otherwise impede its full implementation. This rule is not intended to have retroactive effect unless
so specified in the ``Effective Date'' paragraph of this preamble. Prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions
of this rule or the application of its provisions all applicable administrative procedures must be exhausted. In
the Food Stamp Program the administrative procedures are as follows: 

(1) For program benefit recipients_state administrative procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2020(e)(10) and
7 CFR 273.15; 

(2) For State agencies_administrative procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2023 set out at 7 CFR 276.7 (for rules
related to non-quality control (QC) liabilities) or Part 284 (for rules related to QC liabilities); 

(3) For retailers and wholesalers_administrative procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2023 set out at 7 CFR 278.8.



Executive Order 12866



This proposed rule is issued in conformance with Executive Order 12866.


Regulatory Flexibility Act



This proposed rule has also been reviewed with respect to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980
(Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, September 19, 1980). The Administrator of the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS)
has certified that this proposal would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
State and local agencies that administer the Program will be the most affected. Food stamp applicants and recipients
will be affected due to changes in excludable resources for purposes of the Food Stamp Program.


Paperwork Reduction Act



This action does not contain reporting or record keeping requirements subject to approval by the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507).


Background



The Mickey Leland Memorial Domestic Hunger Relief Act (Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990, Title
XVII, Pub. L. 101-624, 104 Stat. 3783); (hereinafter referred to as the Leland Act) made several changes to the
Food Stamp Act of 1977, as amended (7 U.S.C. 2011, 

et seq.

) (the Act). This proposed rulemaking pertains to Section 1719 of the Leland Act which amended Section 5(g) of the Act,
7 U.S.C. 2014(g)(5), to expand the criteria by which property can be considered inaccessible to households in the
calculation of their resources for purposes of food stamp eligibility. The Department originally published a proposed
rule on August 13, 1991 at 56 FR 40164 regarding, in part, this Leland Act provision. The Department received twenty
comments on the proposal to amend 7 CFR 273.8(e) to incorporate this provision. On December 13, 1991, Section 904 of
the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act Amendments of 1991 (Pub. L. 102-237, 105 Stat. 1818); (hereinafter
referred to as the 1991 Technical Amendments) further amended Section 5(g)(5) of the Act. In light of the additional
legislation, and after full consideration of the comments received in response to the earlier proposed rule, the
Department has elected to re-propose the rule on the inaccessible resources provision.

Following are explanations of current rules, the Department's earlier proposal and the comments received, the 1991
Technical Amendments, and the new proposal. We believe understanding these items will lead to a better understanding
of the re-proposal.

Currently, regulations at 7 CFR 273.8(c) describe both liquid and non-liquid resources that are counted when determining
a household's eligibility for food stamps. Non-liquid resources such as land, buildings, and licensed and unlicensed
vehicles, with some exceptions, are included as resources because they can be converted to cash. However, not all
property can be easily sold, and this has posed significant problems for both State agencies administering the Food
Stamp Program and households applying for benefits. Except for the provisions regarding vehicles, current regulations
focus on the accessibility/inaccessibility of resources. In establishing inaccessibility, State agencies are
compelled to require a household to verify that the property it owns, which is not otherwise an exempt resource, has
little or no fair market value; cannot be sold because it is jointly owned with non-household members who are unwilling
to sell; or is otherwise inaccessible. In many instances, households have found it difficult to provide this verification.
Further, in establishing accessibility/inaccessibility, State agencies may be faced with questions of state property
law and probate law. The situation was particularly difficult with heir property, i.e., an undivided fractional
interest in a decedent's property. It is apparent that the treatment of heir property was the primary problem Congress
was addressing when it passed Section 1719 of the Leland Act, as the legislative history contained in House Report
No. 101-569, 101st Congress, 2nd Session, Part 1, at 429-30, specifically refers to the problems of heir
property encountered by food stamp applicants and State agencies.

Section 1719 of the Leland Act required the Department to promulgate regulations requiring State agencies to develop
standards for identifying kinds of resources that, as a practical matter, a household is unlikely to be able to sell
for any significant return because the household's interest is relatively slight or because the cost of selling the
household's interest would be relatively great. Resources so identified were to be excluded as inaccessible resources
for food stamp purposes.



Our Earlier Proposal and Comments



In order to implement Section 1719, the Department proposed an amendment to 7 CFR 273.8(e) that would have excluded
as a resource property that a household could not sell for any significant return because the household's interest
was relatively slight or because the cost of selling the household's interest would have been greater than the value
of the property. The proposed rule provided that a property would be excluded as a resource if it could not be sold for
more than $2,000 

and 

the cost of selling the property exceeded 75 percent of the expected sale price. State agencies would have been required
to establish standards for identifying the costs likely to be associated with the sale of various types of property
and the likely gross value of such property as a guide for recipients and eligibility workers to follow in determining
if the property was accessible as a resource.

The August 13, 1991 proposed rulemaking generated twenty comments. The general consensus of the comments was that
the proposed rule violated the intent of Congress by imposing criteria that a property is considered an inaccessible
resource if it could not be sold for more than $2,000 

and 

the cost of selling the property exceeded 75 percent of the expected sale price. However, the Department found there
was no consensus among the commenters on how to amend the proposed rule to determine what types of property should be
excluded. For example, one commenter suggested amending the proposed rule to say that the property be considered
inaccessible if it cannot be sold for $2000 or more 

or 

the cost of selling the property is at least 75 percent or more of the sale price. Another commenter recommended the
definition of inaccessible property be changed to include the following criteria: 

(1) It is jointly owned by non- household and household members; 

(2) It cannot be converted to cash without the consent of all parties; and 

(3) It cannot be converted to cash because all parties do not agree to sell or all parties cannot be contacted to consult.
A third commenter suggested the final rule exclude property which is either heavily mortgaged (such as over 75 percent
of its value) or owned by more than two people and exclude property where for whatever reason net proceeds after paying
all expenses (including co-owners and liens) in selling the property would be less than $2000.



1991 Technical Amendment



In December 1991, Section 904 of the 1991 Technical Amendments amended Section 5(g)(5) of the Food Stamp Act by adding
to the end of this paragraph the following new sentences:




A resource shall be so identified [as inaccessible] if its sale or other disposition is unlikely to produce any significant
amount of funds for the support of the household. The Secretary shall not require the State agency to require verification
of the value of a resource to be excluded under this paragraph unless the State agency determines that the information
provided by the household is questionable.



The Current Proposal



The Department has carefully considered Section 1719 of the Leland Act, the Congressional intent evidenced in House
Report No. 101-529, 101st Congress, 2nd Session, part 1, the comments regarding the August 13, 1991 proposed
rule, and the language in Section 904 of the 1991 Technical Amendments. As a result, this proposed rulemaking is significantly
different from the Department's previous proposed rule on this subject.

The regulations at 7 CFR 273.8(d) already exclude jointly-owned resources that can be shown to be inaccessible. An
example is a bank account that is jointly-owned by food stamp applicant household and non-household members which,
by State law, is determined to be inaccessible wholly or in part to the food stamp household. Also, certain types of
property are excluded from consideration as a resource including property that the household is making a good faith
effort to sell (7 CFR 273.8(e)(8)). The Department believes that the amendments to Section 5(g)(5) of the Act were
not intended to supplant the existing regulations on inaccessible resources. Rather, these amendments were intended
to provide an additional exclusion for resources such as heir property or other property which is unlikely to produce
a significant return or significant funds for the support of the household.

In Section 1719 of the Leland Act, Congress required that household resources unlikely to be sold for any significant
return because the household's interest is relatively slight or because the cost of selling the household's interest
would be relatively great be excluded from income for Food Stamp eligibility purposes. The legislative history of
this provision did not provide any further guidance as to how this was to be implemented. The floor debate indicated
that it would not be necessary for State agencies to determine the exact fair market value for a resource for such resource
to be considered inaccessible. 

Cong. Rec.

 H11862, October 23, 1990, remarks of Congressman Hatcher. The 1991 Technical Amendments added to the Leland Act provision
the requirement that a resource be excluded as inaccessible if its sale or other disposition is unlikely to produce
any significant amount of funds for the support of the household. The legislative history of this provision also did
not provide any definitive guidance as to what Congress intended by ``any significant return''. The floor debates
indicated that the term was to include ``any significant amount of money to buy food for the household'' and that ``[N]o
arbitrary sale price of percent-of-value test may be imposed.'' 

Cong. Rec.

 S18326, November 26, 1991, remarks of Senator Leahy. The Department is proposing to define ``any significant return''
as being one half the resource limit for the household. The Department believes that some value above which the resource
must be sold must be established for uniform administration of the program. The Act requires that the standards of
eligibility be uniform for all participants, 7 USC 2014(b), and provides that the Secretary shall issue such regulations,
consistent with the terms of the Act, that the Secretary deems necessary or appropriate for the effective and efficient
administration of the Food Stamp Program. 7 USC 2013(c). Given this, and the lack of clarity of the statute and legislative
history, the Department believes that it is reasonable to establish ``significant return'' or ``significant funds''
to mean one half of the household resource limit.

For food stamp purposes, households are permitted to have up to $2,000 in resources ($3,000 for households if at least
one member is aged 60 or older). (For categorically-resource-eligible households, the issue of accessibility is
irrelevant.) Current data show that the average value of countable resources for all food stamp households is less
than $100. Ninety-five percent of all food stamp households have $1,000 or less in countable resources. As very few
households participating in the food stamp program have resources exceeding $1,000, the Department believes that
a resource that would yield a return of $1,000 (or $1,500, as appropriate) would be a significant return for a household
that is otherwise eligible for food stamps.

Section 5(g)(5) also provides that the return must be determined to be not significant either (1) because the household's
interest is relatively slight or (2) because the cost of selling the household's interest would be relatively great.
The legislative history does not provide any direction to the Department in establishing the meaning of relatively
slight interest or relatively great cost of selling other than a statement by Senator Leahy in the floor debates that
no ``arbitrary sale price or percent-of-value test may be imposed''. 

Cong. Rec.

 S18326, November 26, 1991. The Department recognizes that what constitutes a ``relatively slight interest'' or
a ``relatively great cost of selling'' may vary, depending on the specific resource. The ultimate inquiry is whether
the resource, given the ownership interest and/or the cost of sale, would produce a significant return or significant
amount of funds to the household, if sold.

The Department is proposing in 7 CFR 273.8(e) to prohibit applying this provision to negotiable financial instruments
such as stocks and bonds. As a general matter, stocks and bonds are liquid resources which are available to the household.
Section 5(g)(5) is directed in part at inaccessibility due the cost of selling being relatively great in relation
to the amount of funds that would be realized if the resource were sold. In general, brokerage firms and other financial
institutions charge either a minimum fee or a small percentage of the sale when a negotiable financial instrument
is sold. The Department recognizes that a household may own stock or some other negotiable financial instrument that
has decreased in value since the household acquired it. However, regardless of the reduced value of that resource,
it could not be considered to be inaccessible because the cost of selling it would not be ``relatively great'' unless
the stock were basically worthless, and thus would not be of value as a resource in any event.

The proposed distinction between negotiable financial instruments, which could not be declared inaccessible under
this proposal, and other types of resources which, depending on the value of the resource and the circumstances of
each particular household's ownership interest in the resource, could be found inaccessible, is given further support
in language found in the Congressional floor debates on the statutory provision. Senator Leahy indicated that the
``availability'' of a resource should be one of the determinants of whether that resource may be declared inaccessible.


Cong. Rec.

 S18325, November 26, 1991. By their very nature, negotiable financial instruments, regardless of either their current
value or their value when purchased, are liquid and available to the household in contrast to other nonliquid resources
such as real property.

This proposal retains the provision from the 1991 proposed rule that would have required State agencies to develop
standards to be used to identify the kinds of resources that, as a practical matter, the household is unlikely to sell
for any significant return. Several commenters said the proposed rule placed too heavy a burden on State agencies
by requiring them to develop these standards. The Department understands these concerns; however, Section 5(g)(5)of
the Act is clear in requiring State agencies to develop such standards. In order to emphasize this requirement, the
Department is proposing to add a new paragraph (18) to 7 CFR 273.8(e) that would require State agencies to develop standards
for identifying resources, that as a practical matter, the household is unable to sell for any significant return
because the household's interest in the property is relatively slight or because the cost of selling the household's
interest would be relatively great. State agencies are not required to submit these standards to the Department for
approval.

In developing their standards, the State agencies need to keep in mind that verification of the inaccessibility of
a resource that meets the defined standard is necessary only if the information provided by the household appears
questionable. The 1991 Technical Amendments prohibited requiring State agencies to require verification unless
the information provided appears questionable. Accordingly, the Department is proposing in 7 CFR 273.8(e)(18)
to require verification of inaccessibility of resources only if the information provided by the household is insufficient
to clearly establish inaccessibility.

The Department would like to make it clear that this standard does not invalidate any other provision regarding jointly-owned
resources and inaccessible resources, as described in 7 CFR 273.8(d).



Application of This Rule to Vehicles



Three commenters on the August 13, 1991 proposed rulemaking discussed whether or not vehicles could be identified
as inaccessible resources under this provision. The Department believes that it is very clear from the statutory
language and the legislative history of the inaccessible resource provision that it was not the intent of Congress
to include vehicles. Neither Section 1719 of the Leland Act or Section 904 of the 1991 Technical Amendments nor their
legislative history made any reference to vehicles when discussing the resources to be dealt with under Section 5(g)(5)of
the Act. On pages 429 and 430 of House Report No. 101-569, the reasons for the legislative provision are spelled
out. This legislative history specifically mentions heir property and the problems associated with attempting
to assess the value of such property as the primary reason for the statutory amendments.

Historically, vehicles have always been treated differently than all other resources under the Act. Section 5(g)(2)
of the Act continues to require that the fair market value of vehicles be the test of whether any portion of their value
is counted as a resource despite the addition of Section 5(g)(5) to the Act. Moreover, the Congressional Budget Office
estimated that there would be no cost involved in implementing the inaccessible resources provision. The cost of
including vehicles under the inaccessible resources provision would be substantial. The Department estimates
that the cost would be over $1 billion over the next five years. Therefore, the Department does not believe that it was
Congressional intent to include vehicles as an inaccessible resource under this provision.

Implementation 



Section 1781 of the Leland Act required the Department to promulgate a final rule to implement Section 1719 of the Leland
Act by October 1, 1991, with implementation required the first day of the month 120 days after publication of implementing
regulations. Thus, the latest date for implementation of Section 1719 of the Leland Act was February 1, 1992. The 1991
Technical Amendments require Section 904 to be effective and implemented no later than February 1, 1992. In response
to these implementation requirements, and since final regulations would not be issued before that date, the Department
issued a memorandum, dated December 27, 1991, notifying State agencies of these provisions and the February implementation
date. State agencies were advised to exercise their best judgment regarding procedures for applying these provisions.
Clarification that the standard did not apply to vehicles was provided to all State agencies in January 1992. Whatever
standards State agencies have used between February 1, 1992 and the publication of the final rule meet the requirements
of the Act, provided that such standards were not applied to vehicles. Recognizing that the statutory amendments
regarding inaccessible resources have already been implemented through the above described memoranda and in order
to provide for the orderly implementation of the specific provision of this proposed rule, the Department is proposing
to require that this rule be effective in any given State upon implementation by the State agency but in no event later
than the first day of the month 120 days after publication of the final rule.

(18) State agencies shall develop clear and uniform standards for identifying kinds of resources that, as a practical
matter, the household is unable to sell for any significant return because the household's interest is relatively
slight or because the costs of selling the household's interest would be relatively great. A resource shall be so identified
if its sale or other disposition is unlikely to produce any significant amount of funds for the support of the household.
This provision does not apply to negotiable financial instruments or vehicles. The determination of whether any
part of the value of a vehicle is included as a resource shall be handled using the provisions of paragraph (h) of this
section. The State agency may require verification of the value of a resource to be excluded if the information provided
by the household is questionable. The following definitions shall be used in developing these standards:
(i) 

Significant return 

shall be any return, after estimated costs of sale or disposition, and taking into account the ownership interest
of the household, that is estimated to be one half or more of the applicable resource limit for the household; and

End-Use Certificate Program 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, USDA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This rule proposes to implement a U.S. end-use certificate program for wheat and barley imported from any foreign
country or instrumentality that as of April 8, 1994, requires end-use certificates for imports of U.S.-produced
wheat and barley, respectively, as required by section 321(f) of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation
Act (the Act). 


A notice requesting comments regarding a U.S. end-use certificate system was published in the 

Federal Register

 on April 13, 1994, at 59 FR 17495. Comments were solicited with respect to the alternatives and issues that need to be
addressed in implementing such a program. These comments were taken into consideration by the Agricultural Stabilization
and Conservation Service (ASCS) with respect to the development of this proposed rule. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Executive Order 12866 


This rule has been determined to be significant and was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under
Executive Order 12866. 


Executive Order 12778 


This proposed rule has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12778. The provisions of this proposed rule
do not preempt State laws, are not retroactive, and do not involve administrative appeals. 


Environmental Evaluation 


It has been determined by an environmental evaluation that this action will not have a significant impact on the quality
of the human environment. Therefore, neither an Environmental Assessment nor an Environmental Impact Statement
is needed. 


Executive Order 12372 


This program/activity is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental
consultation with State and local officials. See notice related to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, published at 48 FR 29115
(June 24, 1983). 


Paperwork Reduction Act 


This proposed rule contains new reporting and recordkeeping requirements. The public reporting burden for the information
collection contained in this proposed rule with respect to a U.S. end-use certificate program is estimated to average
10 minutes for each end-use certificate and six and one-half hours for each quarterly report, including the time for
reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing
and reviewing the collection of information. These new reporting and recordkeeping requirements will be submitted
to OMB for expedited approval under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. 35 (see appendix A). Send comments regarding this collection
of information to: Department of Agriculture, Clearance Office, Office of Information Resources Management, Room
404-W, Washington, DC 20250, and Regulatory Affairs of OMB, Attention: Desk Officer for USDA, Room 3201, New
Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503. 


Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis 


The Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis describing the options considered in developing this proposed rule
and the impact of the implementation of each option is available on request from Craig Jagger, Grains Analysis Division,
ASCS, P.O. Box 2415, Washington, DC 20013-2415; phone 202-720-4418. The analysis can be summarized
as follows: 
The North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act requires that end-use certificates be established for
wheat and barley imported into the U.S. from any foreign country that requires end-use certificates for imports from
the U.S. Currently, Canada is the only such country. Three options are considered for the implementation of end-use
certificates: 


Option 1: 

Border Certificate. Importers would file these certificates to show the intended use of the grain. No additional
reporting or storage and handling requirements would apply. 


Option 2: 

Identity Preserve and Track Commingled Grain. Certificates showing the intended use would accompany the grain to
the end user. Imported grain could be commingled with U.S.-origin grain and the commingled grain would be treated
as imported grain that would have to be stored separately from 100-percent U.S.-origin grain. Holders of grain would
file quarterly reports with USDA. 


Option 3: 

Identity Preserve and Track Imported Grain. Certificates showing the in ended use would accompany the grain to the
end user. Imported grain would not be allowed to be commingled with U.S.-origin grain. Imported grain would be identity
preserved and holders of the grain would file quarterly reports with USDA. This option most closely matches the Canadian
system.

<DOCNO> FR941020-1-00014 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941020-1-00003 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The impacts of the options considered depend on import levels, the number of certificates issued, possible changes
in import practices and the proportion of imported grain that is already identity preserved. Impacts would result
from compliance costs for certificate filing, quarterly reporting, and storage and handling costs needed for identity
preservation. Market impacts would result from reduced imports and higher domestic market prices. Because of differences
among warehouses in storage capacity and involvement in government export assistance programs, it is 
not clear whether, in practice, costs would be higher or lower under Option 2 rather than Option 3 so costs are assumed
to be similar under the two options. The potential impacts of the end-use certificate options considered are summarized
below: 







Reduced program costs and higher producer income would almost offset the increased costs to buyers, for a net impact
for Options 2 and 3 of about $3.5 million. 
An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis indicates that the compliance requirements of the program will disproportionately
affect small entities. Option 1 would have the least impact because it does not require identity preservation. 



Regulatory Flexibility Act 


It has been determined under the Regulatory Flexibility Act that this proposed rule will have an adverse effect on
a substantial number of small businesses. The analysis discussing these impacts is available on request from Craig
Jagger, at the address and telephone number noted above. The analysis can be summarized as follows: 
Warehousemen with average annual receipts of $12.5 million or less are considered small entities. Warehousemen
in the states of Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Washington, Idaho, and Minnesota are most apt to be affected
by an end-use certificate program. About 85 percent of the warehousemen located in these states are estimated to be
small warehousemen. Of all small warehousemen, only those who import Canadian grain would be directly affected by
an end-use certificate program.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941020-1-00015 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941020-1-00003 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Because small warehousemen are likely to have a disproportionate share of truck-delivered imports and each entry
would require an end-use certificate, small warehousemen will likely need to file more end-use certificates than
large importers under all options considered. Because small warehousemen can be expected to have fewer separate
storage and handling facilities and because they are less likely to be already identity preserving imported grain,
costs of identity preservation under Options 2 and 3 will likely also affect a disproportionately large share of small
warehousemen. And if identity-preservation requirements under Options 2 and 3 reduce the quantity of grain imported,
the resulting reduction in storage, handling, and merchandising income will likely be felt most heavily by small
warehousemen. 


Background 


This proposed rule establishes a new 7 CFR part 782 to set forth regulations with respect to a U.S. end-use certificate
program. Section 321(f) of the Act established an end-use certificate requirement for imports into the U.S. of wheat
and barley from any foreign country or instrumentality that as of April 8, 1994, requires end-use certificates for
imports of U.S.-produced wheat or barley, respectively. Canada currently is the only foreign country or instrumentality
that requires such certificates. The Act is not otherwise specific regarding the type of end-use certificate program
to be implemented or the particular information to be collected. 
A notice requesting comments on the implementation of an end-use certificate program was published on April 13, 1994,
at 59 FR 17495. The notice: 
(1) Compared the U.S. and Canadian marketing systems, 
(2) Described the Canadian end-use system, 
(3) Identified three basic alternatives that ASCS could consider in implementing an end-use certificate program,
and 


(4) Described current rules and policies used by ASCS to procure U.S.-produced commodities for donation or sale under
domestic and export food assistance programs. 
Forty-one comments were received in response to the notice requesting comments. 
All 41 respondents commented on one or more of the three basic alternatives that ASCS could consider in implementing
an end-use certificate program. The key issue separating the alternatives involves the issue of commingling vs.
separate storage (

i.e., 

identity preservation) of Canadian and U.S.-produced grain. In brief, the alternatives described in the notice
are as follows: 
(1) Allow commingling of Canadian and U.S. grain. Require that a certificate which sets forth all relevant information
be collected at the U.S. border on imported grain. Continue (or modify) current rules and policies used by ASCS to procure
U.S.-produced commodities for U.S. Government-assisted programs; 
(2) Allow commingling of Canadian and U.S. grain. Require that such commingled grain be stored separately from U.S.-origin
grain until delivered to the end-user; or 
(3) Prohibit commingling of Canadian and U.S. grain. Require that Canadian grain be stored separately from U.S.-
origin grain until delivered to the end-user. 
Of 41 respondents, 34 respondents recommended that ASCS adopt alternative 3, which would prohibit the commingling
of Canadian and U.S. grain. Three respondents recommended adoption of either alternative 2 or 3, but not alternative
1; two respondents recommended adoption of alternative 1; and two respondents did not recommend adoption of one alternative
over another. 
After full consideration of all comments, this rule proposes to adopt a program similar to the actions now taken by
Canada with respect to imports of U.S. wheat and barley. Therefore, this proposed rule would adopt alternative 3,
requiring importers of Canadian wheat and barley to store such imported grain separately from U.S.-produced grain
until delivered to the end-user. Presently only Canada requires end-use certificates on U.S. grain entering that
country. Therefore, this requirement by the U.S. would be imposed only on imports of wheat and barley originating
in Canada. Although ASCS would prefer to adopt its current rules and policies used to procure commodities for donation
or sale under the Food for Progress Program; programs authorized by Titles II and III of Pub. L. 83-480; and foreign
food assistance programs authorized by section 416(b) of the Agricultural Act of 1949, and amended, as well as for
domestic food assistance programs (

i.e., 

the physical commingling of U.S.-produced grain with non-U.S.-produced grain is allowed, provided that at the time
of delivery to the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) the grain merchant has a sufficient quantity and quality of
U.S.-produced grain available at the location where loading occurs to account for the grain sold to CCC and upon delivery
to CCC such U.S. origin stocks are reduced by the quantity delivered to CCC), the Statement of Administrative Action
approved by Congress with the Act states that the purpose of the U.S. end-use requirement is to ensure that foreign
agricultural commodities do not benefit from U.S. export programs. 
Accordingly, in addition to the identity preservation requirement, this proposed rule would require importers
to complete form ASCS-750, End-Use Certificate for Grain, for each entry of Canadian wheat and barley, and to
submit the certificate to the Kansas City Commodity Office (KCCO), ASCS, within 10 days from the date of entry. 
These regulations allow the importation of Canadian wheat and barley for purposes of resale by the importer. 
Information collected on the certificate would include:

(1) Name, address, and telephone number of the importer, 
(2) Commodity and the class of such commodity being imported, 
(3) Intended use of the commodity, including resale, 
(4) Quantity imported, in net metric tons, rounded to the nearest hundredth of a metric ton, 
(5) Storage location of the commodity, 
(6) Name, address, and telephone number of the end-user, if known, 
(7) Mode of transportation and name of the transportation company used to import the commodity, and 
(8) A certification. 

In addition to the information provided by the importer, the Commissioner of Customs would assist ASCS in administering
an end-use certificate program by informing KCCO when Canadian wheat and barley is imported into the U.S. 

This proposed rule would make the importer responsible for ensuring that all applicable end-users and subsequent
buyers are informed that the commodity being purchased originated in Canada. The importer must inform end-users,
in writing, that the imported commodity must not be used for any purpose other than the use specified on the end-use
certificate. The importer must provide the end-user with a photocopy of the end-use certificate. If the commodity
is intended for resale, any sales contracts entered into between the importer and a subsequent buyer must contain
terms that notify the subsequent buyer that: 

(1) The commodity being purchased originated in Canada; 
(2) The commodity being purchased is deemed ineligible for use under CCC and U.S. Department of Agriculture-assisted
export programs; 
(3) The subsequent buyer shall preserve, on an origin-basis, the identity of the commodity being purchased; 
(4) The commodity may not be commingled or blended with U.S.-produced commodities until such time as the commodity
is delivered to an end-user; 
(5) The end-user or subsequent buyer must file quarterly reports as described below; and 
(6) Any sales contracts entered into between any subsequent buyers must contain the same terms specified herewith.




The importer must provide the subsequent buyer with a copy of the end-use certificate. 



This proposed rule would also require the importer to submit to KCCO, within 10 workdays after delivery of the commodity
to the end-user, a copy of the bill of lading acknowledging receipt of the commodity by the end-user and the date the
commodity was received at the end-user's facility. If the commodity is imported for purposes of resale, the importer
must submit to KCCO, within 10 workdays from date of sale, its subsequent buyer's name, address, and telephone number,
and the quantity sold. 

This proposed rule would require end-users to report to KCCO the status of the imported grain on form ASCS-751,
End-Use Certificate for Grain Quarterly Report, until the commodity is fully used. Subsequent buyers would be required
to report to KCCO the status of the imported grain on form ASCS-751, End-Use Certificate for Grain Quarterly
Report, until the commodity is resold. 

Information called for on the quarterly report would include: 

(1) The name, address, and telephone number of the 
end-user or subsequent buyer, 
(2) The name and address of the importer, 
(3) The End-Use Certificate for Grain serial number, 
(4) The commodity and class of such commodity, 
(5) The storage location of the commodity, 
(6) The date the commodity was received at the end-user's or subsequent buyer's facility, 
(7) The quantity of the commodity received, in net metric tons, rounded to the nearest hundredth of a metric ton, 
(8) The quantity of the commodity used by the end-user or sold to a subsequent buyer, 
(9) The quantity remaining, and 
(10) A certification. 
Quarterly reports must be received in KCCO within 15 workdays following full consumption or resale of the commodity.
For partial resales or partial consumption, submit form ASCS-751 to KCCO within 15 workdays following: 

(1) March 31, 
(2) June 30, 
(3) September 30, and 
(4) December 31. 

Forms ASCS-750, End-Use Certificate for Grain, and ASCS-751, End-Use Certificate for Grain Quarterly
Report, may be obtained from KCCO. This proposed rule also incorporates the statutory requirement that it is a violation
of 18 U.S.C. 1001 for an entity to engage in fraud with respect to or knowingly violate the provisions set forth in the
regulations.

Land Ownership Requirements for Low-Level Waste Sites; Extension of Comment Period

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Advance notice of proposed rulemaking; extension of comment period. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On August 3, 1994 (59 FR 39485), the NRC published for public comment an advance notice of proposed rulemaking to consider
amending its regulations to allow private ownership of Low-Level Radioactive Waste facility sites as an alternative
to the current requirement for Federal or State ownership. The comment period for this advance notice of proposed
rulemaking was to have expired on October 3, 1994. The Nuclear Information and Resource Service has requested a 30-
to 60-day extension of the comment period. They believe that there are many potentially affected individuals, communities,
and organizations, who will need more time, and whose input could be useful in NRC's analysis of this proposal. In view
of NRC's desire to get relevant information which is needed to determine the advisability for rulemaking on the land
ownership issue, the NRC has decided to extend the comment period for an additional 60 days. The extended comment period
now expires on December 2, 1994.

IV. Procedural Determinations 


Executive Order 12866


This rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory
Planning and Review).


Executive Order 12778


The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that, to the extent allowed by law, this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections
(a) and (b) of that section. However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory
programs and program amendments since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM.
Under section 503 and 505 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1253 and 1255) and 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions
on proposed State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.


National Environmental Policy Act


No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).


Paperwork Reduction Act


This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by OMB under the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 

et seq.

).


Regulatory Flexibility Act


The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon corresponding Federal regulations for which
an economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements
previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule
would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the corresponding
Federal regulations.

ACTION: 

Proposed rule; public comment period and opportunity for public hearing.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

OSM is announcing receipt of a proposed amendment and the withdrawal of a previously proposed amendment to the Indiana
regulatory program (hereinafter referred to as the ``Indiana program'') under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation
Act of 1977 (SMCRA). The new proposed amendment consists of changes to the Indiana Surface Mining rules concerning
OSM Regulatory Reform I and III issues, required program amendments, and State initiatives. The primary focus of
the amendments is on hydrology, impoundments, roads, support facilities, and additional miscellaneous issues.
With the submittal of this amendment, Indiana is withdrawing previously proposed amendment 

#

93-6 concerning the same subjects. New proposed amendment 

#

94-5 replaces withdrawn amendment 

#

93-6. The amendment is intended to resolve outstanding issues that remain present in the approved Indiana program
resulting from changes to the Federal program. The amendment would also incorporate changes desired by the State
that address various parts of the State rules.

I. Background on the Indiana Program 



On July 29, 1982, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Indiana program. Background information
on the Indiana program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and the conditions of approval
can be found in the July 26, 1982, 

Federal Register

 (47 FR 32071). Subsequent actions concerning the conditions of approval and program amendments can be found at 30
CFR 914.10, 914.15, and 914.16. 



II. Discussion of the Proposed Amendment 



Since July 29, 1982, (the date of conditional approval of the Indiana program), a number of changes have been made to
the Federal regulations concerning surface coal mining and reclamation operations. Pursuant to the Federal regulations
at 30 CFR 732.17, OSM informed Indiana on May 22, 1985, (Regulatory Reform I), and on September 20, 1989, (Regulatory
Reform III), that a number of Indiana regulations are less effective than or inconsistent with the revised Federal
requirements. 

By letter dated October 15, 1993 (Administrative Record No. IND-1300), the Indiana Department of Natural Resources
(IDNR) submitted to OSM a State program amendment package 

#

93-6 consisting of revisions to 52 sections of the Indiana rules. These revisions address changes to the Indiana
program that were identified in the two letters referred to above, and certain required program amendments. The State
has also proposed additional changes which Indiana believes will further improve the approved State program. The
primary focus of the submittal is on hydrology, impoundments, roads, support facilities, and termination of jurisdiction.
OSM subsequently reviewed the proposed amendments in 

#

93-6 and provided Indiana with a detailed list of comments concerning the amendment. 

By letter dated September 26, 1994 (Administrative Record Number IND-1401), Indiana submitted proposed program
amendment 

#

94-5. In that letter, Indiana stated that 

#

94-5 revises language which was previously submitted in program amendment 

#

93-6, and formally withdrew amendment 

#

93-6.
The following rulemaking actions are being proposed by Indiana:

Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; Ohio 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 USEPA is partially approving and partially disapproving, through ``direct final'' procedure, Ohio's State Implementation
Plan (SIP) revision for implementation of the Stage II vapor recovery program. Section 182(b)(3) of the Clean Air
Act (CAA) requires all States that have ozone nonattainment areas classified as moderate or above to implement a Stage
II vapor recovery program. The Stage II vapor recovery program requires owners and operators of gasoline dispensing
facilities that dispense greater than 10,000 gallons of fuel per month (50,000 gallon per month in the case of an independent
small business marketer) to install and operate gasoline vehicle refueling vapor recovery systems. Vapor recovery
systems control the release of volatile organic compounds (VOC), benzene, and toxics emitted during the refueling
process. The USEPA is partially approving Ohio's Stage II rule package, and disapproving of Paragraph 3745-21-09(DDD)(5),
which grants the Director of the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA) the discretion to suspend the Stage
II vapor recovery program without prior approval of USEPA. 


The USEPA is partially approving the rules since, with the exception of Paragraph 3745-21-09(DDD)(5),
the program satisfies the criteria for approval of Stage II vapor recovery programs. The USEPA is disapproving Paragraph
3745-21-09(DDD)(5) since it fails to satisfy the requirements of Part D of Title I of the CAA by providing
the Director of OEPA the discretion 
to suspend the Stage II program without first obtaining Federal approval. Partial approval of the State of Ohio's
Stage II submittal will incorporate the provisions of the program that satisfy USEPA's approval criteria into the
State's Federally approved SIP. 
In the final rules section of the 

Federal Register

, the USEPA is partially approving and partially disapproving this SIP revision request as a direct final rule without
prior proposal because USEPA views the action as noncontroversial and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed
rationale for the approval is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to
that direct final rule, no further activity is contemplated in relation to this proposed rule. If USEPA receives adverse
public comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent
final rule based on this proposed rule. USEPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties
interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time.

Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; California State Implementation Plan Revision; Kern County
Air Pollution Control District


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is proposing to approve revisions to the California State Implementation Plan (SIP) which concern the control
of volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from solvent metal cleaning operations and gasoline transfer operations.
The intended effect of proposing approval of these rules is to regulate emissions of VOCs in accordance with the requirements
of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA or the Act). EPA's final action on this notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM)
will incorporate these rules into the federally approved SIP. EPA has evaluated each of these rules and is proposing
to approve them under provisions of the CAA regarding EPA action on SIP submittals, SIPs for national primary and secondary
ambient air quality standards and plan requirements for nonattainment areas. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


Applicability


The rules being proposed for approval into the California SIP include: Kern County Air Pollution Control District
(KCAPCD) Rule 410.3, Organic Solvent Degreasing Operations; and Rule 412, Gasoline Transfer into Stationary Storage
Containers, Delivery Vessels, and Bulk Plants. These rules were submitted by the California Air Resources Board
(CARB) to EPA on May 30, 1991. 


Background


On March 3, 1978, EPA promulgated a list of ozone nonattainment areas under the provisions of the Clean Air Act, as amended
in 1977 (1977 CAA or pre-amended act), that included the San Joaquin Valley Air Basin and the Southeast Desert Air Basin.

1

 43 FR 8964, 40 CFR 81.305. Because some portions of these areas were unable to meet the statutory attainment date of
December 31, 1982, California requested under section 172(a)(2), and EPA approved, an extension of the attainment
date to December 31, 1987. However, this extension was not requested for Kern County, and therefore, Kern County's
attainment date remained December 31, 1982. On May 26, 1988, EPA notified the Governor of California, pursuant to
section 110(a)(2)(H) of the pre-amended Act, that KCAPCD's portion of the California SIP was inadequate to attain
and maintain the ozone standard and requested that deficiencies in the existing SIP be corrected (EPA's SIP-Call).
On November 15, 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 were enacted. Public Law 101-549, 104 Stat. 2399, codified
at 42 U.S.C. 7401-7671q. In amended section 182(a)(2)(A) of the CAA, Congress statutorily adopted the requirement
that nonattainment areas fix their deficient reasonably available control technology (RACT) rules for ozone and
established a deadline of May 15, 1991 for states to submit corrections of those deficiencies. 





On March 20, 1991, the San Joaquin Valley Unified Air Pollution Control District (SJVUAPCD) was formed. The SJVUAPCD
has authority over the San Joaquin Valley Air Basin portion of Kern County. Thus, the KCAPCD still exists, but only
has authority over the Southeast Desert Air Basin portion of Kern County. 
Section 182(a)(2)(A) applies to areas designated as nonattainment prior to enactment of the amendments and classified
as marginal or above as of the date of enactment. It requires such areas to adopt and correct RACT rules pursuant to pre-amended
section 172(b) as interpreted in pre-amendment guidance.

2

 EPA's SIP-Call used that guidance to indicate the necessary corrections for specific nonattainment areas. All of
Kern County is classified as serious.

3

 However, the Southeast Desert Air Basin portion of Kern County was not a pre-enactment nonattainment area and, therefore,
was not designated and classified upon enactment of the amended Act. For this reason, KCAPCD was not subject to the
RACT fixup requirement and the May 15, 1991 deadline. However, KCAPCD is still subject to the requirements of EPA's
SIP-Call because the SIP-Call included all of Kern County. The substantive requirements of the SIP-Call are the same
as those of the statutory RACT fixup requirement. 






The State of California submitted many revised RACT rules for incorporation into its SIP on May 30, 1991, including
the rules being acted on in this document. This document addresses EPA's proposed action for Rule 410.3, Organic Solvent
Degreasing Operations, and Rule 412, Gasoline Transfer into Stationary Storage Containers, Delivery Vessels,
and Bulk Plants. These submitted rules were adopted by the KCAPCD on May 6, 1991 and found to be complete on July 10, 1991
pursuant to EPA's completeness criteria that are set forth in 40 CFR part 51, appendix V

4

 and are being proposed for approval into the SIP.





Rule 410.3 controls emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from solvent metal cleaning operations, and
Rule 412 controls VOCs emitted during the transfer of gasoline into storage tanks and delivery vessels. VOCs contribute
to the production of ground level ozone and smog. The rules were adopted as part of each district's efforts to achieve
the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone and in response to EPA's SIP-Call and the section 182(a)(2)(A)
CAA requirement. The following is EPA's evaluation and proposed action for these rules.


EPA Evaluation and Proposed Action


In determining the approvability of a VOC rule, EPA must evaluate the rule for consistency with the requirements of
the CAA and EPA regulations, as found in section 110 and part D of the CAA and 40 CFR part 51 (Requirements for Preparation,
Adoption, and Submittal of Implementation Plans). The EPA interpretation of these requirements, which forms the
basis for today's action, appears in the various EPA policy guidance documents listed in footnote 2. Among those provisions
is the requirement that a VOC rule must, at a minimum, provide for the implementation of RACT for stationary sources
of VOC emissions. This requirement was carried forth from the pre-amended Act.
For the purpose of assisting state and local agencies in developing RACT rules, EPA prepared a series of Control Technique
Guideline (CTG) documents. The CTGs are based on the underlying requirements of the Act and specify the presumptive
norms for what is RACT for specific source categories. Under the CAA, Congress ratified EPA's use of these documents,
as well as other Agency policy, for requiring States to ``fix-up'' their RACT rules. See section 182(a)(2)(A). The
CTG applicable to Rule 410.3 is entitled, ``Control of Volatile Organic Emissions from Solvent Metal Cleaning,''
EPA-450/2-77-022. The CTG documents applicable to Rule 412 are entitled, ``Control of Volatile
Organic Compound Leaks from Gasoline Tank Trucks and Vapor Collection Systems,'' EPA-450/2-78-051,
and ``Control of Volatile Organic Emissions from Bulk Gasoline Plants,'' EPA-450/2-77-035. Further
interpretations of EPA policy are found in the Blue Book, referred to in footnote 2. In general, these guidance documents
have been set forth to ensure that VOC rules are fully enforceable and strengthen or maintain the SIP.
KCAPCD Rule 410.3 includes the following significant changes from the current SIP rule: 



1. Adds an applicability statement, definitions, recordkeeping requirements and test methods.
2. Adds certain operating requirements and equipment requirements.
3. Deletes Executive Officer discretion in determining equivalent control systems. 



KCAPCD Rule 412 contains the following changes from the current SIP rule:
1. Adds definitions, certain operating provisions, recordkeeping and test methods.
2. Deletes certain exemptions and Executive Officer discretion in determining equivalency of storage tank emission
controls.



EPA has evaluated these submitted rules and has determined that they are consistent with the CAA, EPA regulations,
and EPA policy. Therefore, KCAPCD Rule 410.3 and Rule 412 are being proposed for approval under section 110(k)(3)
of the CAA as meeting the requirements of section 110(a) and part D. 
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements.


Regulatory Process


Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
SIP approvals under sections 110 and 301 and part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any
new requirements, it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature
of the Federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory 
flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA
forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region III announces its intent to delete the Suffolk City Landfill from
the National Priorities List (NPL) and requests public comment on this action. The NPL constitutes appendix B of 40
CFR part 300 which is the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP), which EPA promulgated
pursuant to Section 105 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as
amended (CERCLA), 42 U.S.C. 9605. EPA has determined that all appropriate CERCLA response actions have been implemented
and that no further CERCLA response actions are appropriate. Moreover, EPA has determined that all CERCLA response
actions conducted at the Site to date have been protective of public health, welfare, and the environment. The Commonwealth
of Virginia has concurred with these determinations.

I. Introduction 



The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region III announces its intent to delete a site from the National Priorities
List (NPL), Appendix B of the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP), 40 CFR part
300, as amended, and requests comments on this deletion. EPA identifies sites that present significant risks to human
health or the environment and maintains the NPL as the list of the worst of those sites. Sites on the NPL may be remediated
using the Hazardous Substances Superfund. As described in  300.425(e) of the NCP, any sites deleted from the
NPL remain eligible for Fund-financed remedial actions in the unlikely event that conditions at the site warrant
such action. 


EPA plans to delete the Suffolk City Landfill Site in Suffolk, Virginia from the NPL. 

EPA will accept comments on this Site for thirty days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register

. 

Section II of this notice explains the criteria for deleting sites from the NPL. Section III discusses procedures
that the EPA is using for this action. Section IV discusses the Suffolk City Landfill and explains how the Site meets
the deletion criteria. 



II. NPL Deletion Criteria 



Section 300.425(e) of the NCP, 40 CFR 300.425(e), provides that releases may be deleted from or recategorized on the
NPL where no further response is appropriate. In making a determination to delete a release from the NPL, EPA shall
consider, in consultation with the state, whether any of the following criteria have been met: 

(i) Responsible parties or other persons have implemented all appropriate response actions required; 

(ii) All appropriate Fund-financed response under CERCLA has been implemented, and no further action by responsible
parties is appropriate; or 

(iii) The remedial investigation has shown that the release poses no significant threat to public health or the environment
and, therefore, taking of remedial measures is not appropriate. 

Releases may not be deleted from the NPL until the state in which the release was located has concurred on the proposed
deletion. EPA is required to provide the State 30 working days for review of the deletion notice prior to publication
in the 

Federal Register

.

Deletion of a site from the NPL does not itself create, alter, or revoke any individual right or obligations. The NPL
is designed primarily for information purposes and to assist Agency management. 



III. Deletion Procedures 



Section 300.425(e)(4) of the NCP, 40 CFR 300.424(e)(4), sets forth requirements for deletion to assure public involvement
in the decision. During the proposal to delete a release from the NPL, EPA is required to: 

(i) Publish a notice of intent to delete in the 

Federal Register

 and solicit comment through a public comment period of a minimum of 30 calendar days; 

(ii) Publish a notice of availability of the notice of intent to delete in a major local newspaper of general circulation
at or near the release that is proposed for deletion; 

(iii) Place copies of information supporting the proposed deletion in the information repository, described in
 300.430(c)(2)(iii) of the NCP, at or near the release proposed for deletion; and 

(iv) Respond to each significant comment and any significant new data submitted during the comment period and include
this response document in the final deletion package. 

EPA must further place the final deletion package in the local information repository once the notice of final deletion
has been published in the 

Federal Register

. 

This Notice of Intent to Delete, together with a concurrent notice in the local newspaper in the vicinity of the Site,
announce the initiation of a 30-day public comment period. The public is asked to comment on EPA's intention to delete
the Site from the NPL. All documents supporting EPA's decision to delete the Site from the NPL are available for inspection
by the public at the information repository in the vicinity of the Site and the EPA Region III office. 

EPA will accept and evaluate public comments on this Notice of Intent to Delete before making a final decision on the
deletion. EPA will then prepare a Responsiveness Summary which identifies and addresses significant comments received
during the public comment period. 

The final deletion decision is made following consideration of comments received during the comment period. The
deletion occurs when a final deletion notice is published in the 

Federal Register

. Generally, the NPL will reflect deletions in the final update following the notice of deletion. Public notices and
copies of EPA's response to public comments received during the comment period will be made available for inspection
by the public by the Regional Office. 



IV. Basis for Intended Site Deletion 



The Suffolk City Landfill Site, also known as the Hosier Road Landfill Site, is a 67-acre parcel situated east of Hosier
Road (Virginia Route 604) in the City of Suffolk, Virginia. To the north of the Site is a 37-acre borrow area from which
current cover material for the landfill was obtained. Bordering the Site to the east is undisturbed upper reaches
of Pocosin Swamp, and an escarpment that defines the western boundary of the Great Dismal Swamp. To the southeast of
the Site lies a privately-owned road. Two unnamed streams (unnamed streams N and E) are located north and east of the
Site. These streams meet in an area adjacent to and northeast of the Site before emptying into the Pocosin Swamp, located
east of the Site. There are about 40 to 45 residences located within one mile of the Site. Most of these residences are
in areas south of the Site, where groundwater is the primary source of drinking water. 

The City of Suffolk operated an unlined landfill at the Site from approximately 1967 to January 1985. The landfill
received municipal solid waste primarily from the City and, before 1974, Nansemond County. The permit for the operation
of the landfill was reissued in June 1983. The reissued permit required the City to close the landfill when the regional
landfill became operational and to implement a closure plan which had been submitted to the Virginia Department of
Health (VDOH). 

In preparing to implement the closure plan, the City discovered documentation indicating that several tons of debris
that contained pesticides had been disposed of in the landfill in 1970. The disposed pesticides, which were damaged
by a fire at the Dixie Guano Company, included Disulfoton, Cu7 Sulfur, 7 Sulfur, Thimet, and Cyanox. On June 3, 1970,
the Tri-County Health District, the former Nansemond County (now City of Suffolk), State Water Control Board, the
Virginia Department of Agriculture, and the Industrial Hygiene Department decided that the remaining pesticides
would be disposed in a lime-lined trench that would be covered with lime and two feet of soil. The lime would promote
hydrolytic processes that break down the pesticides. According to a June 5, 1970 VDOH memo, the pesticides were treated
with lime and covered with two feet of soil in two trenches of approximately 120 feet long x 25 feet wide x 3 feet deep.



EPA completed a Preliminary Assessment in April 1985 and a Site Inspection in July 1986. As a result of these efforts
and a Hazard Ranking System (HRS) scoring of the Site, EPA proposed to include the Site on the NPL in June 1988 and finalized
the inclusion in February 1990.

In early 1989, the City placed an impermeable tarpaulin plastic liner over the pesticide disposal area to prevent
surface water infiltration through the soil cover. The liner covers an area of approximately 100 feet long x 36 feet
wide. A warning sign is currently posted next to the pesticide disposal area. 

In June 1989, the City and the Virginia Department of Waste Management (VDWM) entered into an Administrative Order
on Consent (AOC) which required the City to conduct a remedial investigation and feasibility study (RI/FS) to determine
the nature and extent of contamination and to develop and evaluate cleanup alternatives. The AOC additionally required
that the City implement a temporary leachate collection system (TLCS). The TLCS has been implemented and is currently
being operated by the City Department of Public Works. The collected leachate has been periodically sampled and transported
to Hampton Roads Sanitation District (HRSD) sewage treatment plant for treatment in accordance with a permit issued
by HRSD. 

During the remedial investigation (RI), surface water, sediment, and groundwater samples were taken at locations
at and around the Site. These samples were analyzed for target pesticides, volatile compounds, semivolatile compounds,
and metals. 

Although pesticides were the focus of the RI, no pesticides were detected in any surface water, sediment, or groundwater
samples, including samples taken from a groundwater monitoring well located immediately downgradient of the pesticide
disposal area (HRW-7). In addition, no organic compounds were detected at levels that presented an unacceptable
risk to human health. 

No metal contamination was detected above levels of concern in seven of the nine monitoring wells. Slightly elevated
levels of arsenic were detected in two wells (HRW-3 and HRW-6) in the northern section of the landfill.
Arsenic concentrations in filtered samples collected from these wells were 71.9 and 55.7  u g/l, respectively,
slightly above the Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) of 50  u g/l established under the Safe Drinking Water Act. 


In the second sampling round, which was conducted in October 1991, the level of chromium detected in an unfiltered
sample from one monitoring well (HWR-3) was 190  u g/l, exceeding the MCL of 100  u g/l. However, chromium
was not detected in the filtered sample taken from this well for the same sampling event. Chromium levels in samples
collected in the first sampling round (May 1991) from this well were also well below the MCL (23.6  u g/l in the unfiltered
sample and below the detection limit in the filtered sample). 

Surface water sampling in unnamed streams N and E showed arsenic and chromium levels well below the Virginia standard
acceptable for the protection of aquatic life. In addition, the levels of these compounds in the stream sediments
are below the average levels in soils of the eastern United States. 


Sampling of benthic community in a nearby stream was conducted to provide further information for the determination
whether the Site has impacted the surrounding areas. The results of the benthic sampling indicated low species diversity
of benthic organisms in a sample taken in the area immediately downgradient of the landfill near the confluence of
the unnamed streams N and E. However, subsequent surface water/sediment sampling at a nearby location in this stream
revealed the absence of contamination, indicating the current Site condition was not likely the cause for the low
benthic species diversity. 


An animal survey in areas around the Site was also conducted. This study consisted of a comparison of animal species
including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish species in areas around the Site to determine whether Site
contamination has potentially impacted the local animal community. The results showed that animal species in different
areas around the Site are similarly diverse except at the benthic location from unnamed stream N in an area northeast
of the Site. 
 
Although onsite groundwater in the northern section of the Site presents slightly elevated risk, the offsite risks
are expected to be significantly reduced from the onsite risk levels. As the groundwater migrates offsite, the arsenic
and metals in the groundwater are adsorbed by the soils in the aquifer. Most of the water in the Columbia aquifer, the
shallow aquifer, discharges into unnamed stream N, where surface water/sediment sampling showed no contamination.

Currently there are no residences in the area where ground-water contamination has been observed. There are no residential
drinking water wells located directly downgradient of the Site. Most residential drinking water wells are located
upgradient of the Site (south of the Site). Groundwater sampling of monitoring wells located along the southeastern
edge of the Site revealed no contamination, indicating no contaminant migration in this direction from the Site.




In September 1992, EPA issued a Record of Decision (ROD) for the Site in which the Agency selected ``No Action.'' EPA
concluded that the Site poses a risk to human health only in the event that contaminated groundwater existing within
certain areas of the Site is consumed. No consumption of this gr
