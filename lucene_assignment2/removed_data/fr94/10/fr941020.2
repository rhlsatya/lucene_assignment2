</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of an amendment of a Privacy Act system of records.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Agency for International Development is adding two general routine uses for release of records. The first is to
the Department of Defense, the U.S. Postal Service and other Federal agencies for the purpose of offsetting Federal
salaries and benefits to recover delinquent debts owed to the U.S. Government. The second is for disclosure from specific
systems of records to consumer reporting agencies to recover delinquent debts owed to the agency.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

USAID's ``Statement of General Routine Uses'' is amended by adding the following:



12. A record in this system of records may be disclosed, as a routine use: To the Defense Manpower Data Center, Department
of Defense and to the U.S. Postal Service, to conduct computer matching programs for the purpose of identifying and
locating individuals who are receiving Federal salaries or benefit payment and delinquent in their repayment of
debts owed to the U.S. Government under certain programs administered by USAID in order to collect the debts under
the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365) by voluntary repayment, or by administrative
or salary offset procedures; and to any other Federal agency for the purpose of effecting administrative or salary
offset procedures against a person employed by that agency or receiving or eligible to receive some benefit payments
from the agency when USAID as a creditor has a claim against that person. Disclosure of information about persons who
are receiving Federal salaries or benefit payments and are delinquent in their repayment of debts owed to the U.S.
Government under certain programs administered by USAID may be made to other Federal agencies, but only to the extent
of determining whether the person is employed by that agency and if so, effecting administrative or salary offset
procedures against the person. 

13. A record in the following systems of records may be disclosed, as a routine use, to consumer reporting agencies:




Claims Records (AID-20)

Anhydrous Sodium Metasilicate From France; Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
action: 

Notice of preliminary results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

In response to a request by the petitioner, the PQ Corporation, the Department of Commerce (the Department) is conducting
an administrative review of the antidumping duty order on anhydrous sodium metasilicate (ASM) from France. This
review covers Rhone Poulenc Chime DeBase (Rhone Poulenc), a manufacturer/exporter of this merchandise to the United
States, and the period January 1, 1993 through December 31, 1993. The firm failed to submit a timely response to our
questionnaire. As a result, we have preliminarily determined to use best information available for cash deposit
and appraisement purposes. 



Interested parties are invited to comment on these preliminary results.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background 



On January 5, 1994, the Department published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 564) a notice of ``Opportunity to Request an Administrative Review'' of the antidumping duty order on ASM from
France. On January 24, 1994, the petitioner, the PQ Corporation, requested an administrative review of Rhone Poulenc,
a manufacturer/exporter of this merchandise to the United States. We initiated the review, covering the period January
1, 1993, through December 31, 1993, on March 14, 1994 (59 FR 11769). The Department is now conducting this review in
accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930 as amended (the Tariff Act).



Scope of the Review



Imports covered by the review are shipments of ASM, a crystallized silicate (Na

2

 SiO

3

) which is alkaline and readily soluble in water. Applications include waste paper de-inking, ore-flotation, bleach
stabilization, clay processing, medium or heavy duty cleaning, and compounding into other detergent formulations.
This merchandise is classifiable under Harmonized Tariff Schedules (HTS) item numbers 2839.11.00 and 2839.19.00.
The HTS item numbers are provided for convenience and Customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive.

The review covers Rhone Poulenc and the period January 1, 1993 through December 31, 1993.



Use of Best Information Available



We mailed the antidumping questionnaire to Rhone Poulenc, the only manufacturer/exporter of this merchandise to
the United States. Rhone Poulenc failed to submit a timely response to our questionnaire. The Department has therefore
decided to use the best information available (BIA) in determining the rate for this firm.

When a company fails to provide the information requested in a timely manner, or otherwise significantly impedes
the Department's review, the Department considers the company uncooperative and generally assigns to that company
the higher of: (1) the highest rate assigned to any company in a previous review or the investigation or (2) the highest
rate for a responding company with shipments during the review period. See 19 CFR 353.37(b) and Final Results of Antidumping
Duty Administrative Review Portable Electric Typewriters from Japan (November 4, 1991, 56 FR 56393). In this case,
for BIA, we assigned to Rhone Poulenc a margin of 60 percent, the highest rate from a prior review. See Final Results
of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, Anhydrous Sodium Metasilicate from France (52 FR 33856, September 8,
1987).

Preliminary Results of the Review



As a result of our review, we preliminarily determine that a margin of 60 percent exists for Rhone Poulenc for the period
January 1, 1993 through December 31, 1993.

Parties to the proceeding may request disclosure within five days of the date of publication of this notice. Any interested
party may request a hearing within 10 days of publication. Case briefs and/or written comments from interested parties
may be submitted not later than 30 days after the date of publication. Rebuttal brief sand rebuttals to written comments,
limited to issues raised in the case briefs and comments, may be filed not later than 37 days after the date of publication.
Any hearing, if requested, will be held 44 days after the date of publication, or the first workday thereafter. The
Department will publish the final results of the administrative review, including the results of its analysis of
issues raised in any such written comments or at a hearing.

Upon completion of this administrative review, the Department will issue appraisement instructions directly to
the Customs Service.

Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective upon publication of the final results of administrative
review for all shipments of ASM from France, entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the
publication date, as provided by section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act: (1) The cash deposit rate for the reviewed company
will be that established in the final results of this administrative review; (2) for exporters not covered in this
review, but covered in previous reviews or the original less-than-fair-value (LTFV) investigation, the cash deposit
rate will continue to be the company-specific rate published for the most recent period; (3) if the exporter is not
a firm covered in this review, previous reviews, or the original LTFV investigation, but the manufacturer is, the
cash deposit rate will be that established for the most recent period for the manufacturer of the merchandise; and
(4) the cash deposit rate for all other manufactures or exporters will be 60 percent. On May 25, 1993, the Court of International
trade in 

Floral Trade Council 

v. 

United States, 

822 F. Supp 766 (1993), and 

Federal-Mogul Corporation and Terrington Company 

v. 

United States, 

822 F. Supp. 822 (1993), determined that once an ``all others'' rate is established for a company, it can only be changed
through an administrative review. The Department has determined that in order to implement these decisions it is
appropriate to maintain the original ``all others'' rate from the LTFV investigation or that rate as amended for correction
of clerical errors or as a result of litigation in proceedings governed by antidumping duty orders for the purposes
of establishing cash deposits in all current and future administrative reviews.

Because this proceeding is governed by an antidumping duty order, the ``all others'' rate for the purposes of this
review will be 60 percent, the ``all others'' rate established in the final notice of the LTFV investigation (46 FR
1667, January 7, 1981).

These requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next administrative
review.

This notice serves as a preliminary reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate
regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review
period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement
of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties.

This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1))
and 19 CFR 353.22.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background 


On December 30, 1993, the Department published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 69343) its intent to revoke the countervailing duty order on non-rubber footwear from Argentina (52 FR 3474;
January 17, 1979). Under 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4)(iii), the Secretary of Commerce will conclude that an order is no longer
of interest to interested parties and will revoke the order if no domestic interested party objects to revocation
and no interested party requests an administrative review by the last day of the fifth anniversary month. 
On January 21, 1994, we received objections filed on behalf of forty U.S. manufacturers of non-rubber footwear, interested
parties within the meaning of 19 CFR 355.2(i)(3). Therefore, because the requirements of 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4)(iii)
have not been met, we will not revoke the order. 
This determination is in accordance with 
19 CFR 355.25(d)(4).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background



On December 30, 1993, the Department published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 69343) its intent to revoke the countervailing duty order on certain stainless steel cooking ware from Taiwan
(52 FR 2141; January 20, 1987). Under 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4)(iii), the Secretary of Commerce will conclude that an order
is no longer of interest to interested parties and will revoke the order if no domestic interested party objects to
revocation and no interested party requests an administrative review by the last day of the fifth anniversary month.

The Department received timely objections to our intent to revoke the countervailing duty order from the Fair Trade
Committee of the Cookware Manufacturers Association, a not-for-profit trade association representing the interests
of a majority of U.S. stainless steel cookware producers, and from Farberware, Inc., Vita Craft Corporation, and
Mirro Company, U.S. producers of the subject merchandise, interested parties within the meaning of 19 CFR 355.2(i)(3).
Because the requirements of 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4)(iii) have not been met, we will not revoke the order.

1. Bee International, Inc. (hereinafter, ``Bee''), a corporation, enters into this Settlement Agreement and Order
(hereinafter, ``Settlement Agreement'') with the staff of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, and agrees to
the entry of the Order described herein. The purpose of the Settlement Agreement is to settle the staff's allegations
that Bee knowingly violated sections 4 (a), (c), and (i) of the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (FHSA), 15 U.S.C.
1263 (a), (c), and (i).



I. The Parties



2. The ``staff'' is the staff of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, an independent regulatory Commission of
the United States established pursuant to section 4 of the Consumer Product Safety Act (CPSA), 15 U.S.C. 2053.

3. Bee is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of California, since 1970. The firm's principal
place of business is located at 2311 Boswell Road, Chula Vista, CA 91914. Bee is an importer and distributor of toys,
novelty items, and confectionery items.



II. Allegations of the Staff



4. On five occasions between October 9, 1991, and February 23, 1994, Bee introduced or caused the introduction into
interstate commerce; or received in interstate commerce and delivered or proffered delivery thereof nine kinds
of toys (337,320 articles) intended for use by children under three years of age, which are identified and described
below:

of the FHSA, 15 U.S.C. 1261(q)(1)(A) (any toy or other article intended for use by children which bears or contains
a hazardous substance); and (b) 16 CFR 1500.18(a)(9) (any toy or other article intended for use by children under 3
years of age which presents a choking, aspiration, or ingestion hazard because of small parts).

9. Bee knowingly introduced or caused the introduction into interstate commerce; or received in interstate commerce
and delivered or proffered delivery thereof for pay or otherwise, the banned hazardous toys identified in paragraph
4 above, in violation of sections 4 (a) or (c) of the FHSA, 15 U.S.C. 1263 (a) or (c).

10. On or about October 16, 1993, Bee exported 108,000 articles of the toy, Plastic Acrobatic Animal W/Candy, Sample
No. R-800-2663, identified in paragraph 4 above as a ``banned hazardous substance'' without notifying
the Commission pursuant to section 14(d) of the FHSA, 15 U.S.C. 1273(d) and the Commission's Procedures For Export
of Noncomplying Products, 16 CFR Part 1019.

11. Bee knowingly failed to file the required notification information the Commission of its intent to export the
Plastic Acrobatic Animal W/Candy, identified in paragraphs 4 and 10 above, in violation of section 4(i) of the FHSA,
15 U.S.C. 1263(i).



III. Response of Bee



12. Bee denies the allegations of the staff set forth in paragraphs 4 through 11 above that it has knowingly introduced
or caused the introduction into interstate commerce; received in interstate commerce and delivered or proffered
delivery thereof for pay or otherwise the banned hazardous toys identified in paragraph 4 above, in violation of sections
4 (a) and (c) of the FHSA, 15 U.S.C. 1263 (a) and (c); and further denies that it failed to comply with the export notification
requirements of the FHSA, in violation of section 4(i) of the FHSA, 15 U.S.C. 1263(i).

14. Upon final acceptance by the Commission of this Settlement Agreement and issuance of the Final Order, Bee agrees
to pay to the Commission a civil penalty in the amount of SIXTY-FIVE THOUSAND AND 00/100 DOLLARS ($65,000.00), under
the terms and conditions set forth in the attached Order incorporated herein, and made a part hereof, by reference.

Intent To Prepare an Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact for a Proposed Public Water Supply
Reservoir on Hunting Run in the County of Spotsylvania, VA



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, DOD.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Revised notice of intent.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

An Environmental Assessment (EA) and Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) will be prepared to evaluate project
alternatives and the public interest review factors for the proposed public water supply reservoir.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 




1. Proposed Action: On October 18, 1991, the Norfolk District Corps of Engineers announced its intent in the 

Federal Register

 to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement to evaluate project alternatives and the public interest review factors
associated with a proposed public water supply reservoir on the Po River. This proposed reservoir would involve the
flooding of 200 acres of wetlands, the reduction of instream flows to 15% of the mean annual flow, impacts to a federally
listed endangered species (dwarf wedgemussel), and flooding of National Park Service property.


After extensive interagency coordination and review, the County of 
Spotsylvania amended its plans and now proposes to construct a reservoir in Hunting Run. The project would also involve
a pump-over from Rapidan River during high flows in the river and an intake structure in the Rappahannock River approximately
0.25 mile downstream of the confluence with the Rappahannock River and Motts Run. The intake structure would withdraw
water from the Rappahannock River that has been released from the proposed Hunting Run Reservoir upstream. The proposed
Hunting Run Reservoir would impact 10.8 acres of vegetted palustrine wetlands, 10.3 acres of primarily unvegetated
shallow riverine habitat, 1.1 acre of deepwater habitat, and 397.8 acres of predominately forested upland. The proposed
reservoir and river withdrawals will provide approximately 8.0 million gallons per day of water for municipal water
supply to meet the County's demand throughout the 2040 planning period.


2. Alternatives. Alternatives which will be investigated include, but are not limited to, the Po River Reservoir
and the expansion of the existing Motts Run Reservoir. Both of these alternatives are addressed in the County's environmental
impact report.


3. Scoping Process. A preapplication scoping meeting was held with State and Federal agencies in September 1988 and
formal agency scoping comments were requested in October 1988. Additional scoping meetings were held with State
and Federal agencies in June and July 1991, April 1992, and May 1994. Substantive issues identified at these meetings
included impacts to wetlands and the reduction of instream flow and its impact on water quality, fisheries, and recreation.
Based on these meetings, the County was encouraged to pursue the Hunting Run Reservoir in lieu of the Po River Reservoir.
The County subsequently concurred and an interagency effort was initiated to determine the minimum instream flows
needed to maintain water quality, fisheries, and recreation for the Po. Rappahannock, and Rapidan Rivers.


4. Public Scoping Meeting: While the Corps of Engineers has not held a public scoping meeting, the public has had several
opportunities to provide comments. Specifically, the County has held numerous public meetings and the Corps published
a Notice of Intent in the 

Federal Register

 and associated public notice and has participated in numerous interest group meetings. At this time, the Corps does
not intend to schedule a public scoping meeting.


5. Environmental Document Availability: On August 12, 1994, the County of Spotsylvania submitted an application
for a Department of the Army permit for a public water reservoir on Hunting Run and associated water intake structures
on the Rappahannock and Rapidan Rivers. Along with the application, the County submitted an environmental impact
report. On August 23, 1994, the Corps issued a public notice on the project with a thirty day comment period. These documents
can be obtained from Mr. Wiggins by calling or writing him at the telephone number and address listed above.

construction of a gravel access road on the north abutment of Bliss Dam. An Environmental Assessment (EA) was prepared
for the application. The EA finds that approving the application would not constitute a major federal action significantly
affecting the quality of the human environment.
Copies of the EA are available for review in the Public Reference Branch, Room 3104, of the Commission's offices at
941 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426.

<DOCTITLE>Wisconsin Public Service Corp., Wisconsin Electric Power Co., and Niagara of Wisconsin Paper Corp; Intent To Prepare
an Environmental Assessment and Conduct Public Scoping Meetings</DOCTITLE>


October 14, 1994.


The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has received applications for license of the existing Grand Rapids
Project No. 2433, the existing White Rapids Project No. 2357, and the existing Chalk Hill Project No. 2394. These projects
are located on the Menominee River in Menominee County, Michigan, and Marinette County, Wisconsin. The FERC has also
received an application for license for the existing Little Quinnesec Falls Project No. 2536. This project is located
on the Menominee River in Marinette County, Wisconsin, and Dickinson County, Michigan.
The FERC staff intends to prepare an Environmental Assessment (EA) on the hydroelectric projects in accordance with
the National Environmental Policy Act.
The staff's EA will objectively consider both site specific and cumulative environmental impacts of the projects
and reasonable alternatives, and will include economic, financial and engineering analyses.
A draft EA will be issued and circulated for review by all of the interested parties. All comments filed on the draft
EA will be analyzed by the staff and considered in a final EA. The staff's conclusions and recommendations will then
be presented for the consideration of the Commission in reaching its final licensing decision.


Scoping Meetings


The FERC will conduct two public scoping meetings. An evening scoping meeting is primarily for public input while
the morning meeting will focus on resource agency concerns. All interested individuals, organizations, and agencies
are invited to attend and assist the staff in identifying the scope of environmental issues that should be analyzed
in the EA. Staff will visit the project sites on November 7 and 8, 1994, and will meet November 7, at 8:30 a.m. (CST) at
the Grand Rapids Project.
Both scoping meetings will be held at the Best Western Riverfront Inn, Peshtigo and Green Rooms, 1821 Riverside Avenue,
Marinette, Wisconsin, on Wednesday, November 9, 1994. The afternoon meeting will be held from 1:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m.,
and the evening meeting will be conducted from 7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m.
Interested individuals, organizations, and agencies are invited to attend either or both meetings and assist the
staff in identifying the scope of the EA.
To help focus discussions at the meetings, a scoping document outlining subject areas to be addressed in the EA will
be mailed to agencies and interested individuals on the FERC mailing list. Copies of the scoping document will also
be available at the scoping meetings.


Objectives


At the scoping meetings the staff will: 
(1) Identify reasonable alternatives that should be evaluated in the EA; (2) Identify significant environmental
issues related to the proposed project; 
(3) Determine the depth of analysis for issues to be addressed in the EA; (4) Identify resource issues that are not important
and do not require detailing analysis; 
(5) Solicit from the meeting participants all available information, especially quantified data, on the resources
at issue; and 
(6) Encourage statements from experts and the public on issues that should be analyzed in the EA, including points
of view in opposition to, or in support of, the staff's preliminary views.


Procedures


The meetings will be recorded by a court reporter and all statements (oral and written) thereby become a part of the
formal record of the Commission proceedings for the above listed projects. Individuals presenting statements at
the meetings will be asked to clearly identify themselves for the record.
Individuals, organizations, and agencies with environmental expertise and concerns are encouraged to attend the
meetings and assist the staff in defining and clarifying the issues to be addressed in the EA.
Participants wishing to make oral comments at the public meeting are asked to keep them to five minutes to allow everyone
the opportunity to speak.
Persons choosing not to speak at the meetings, but who have views on the issues or information relevant to the issues,
may submit written statements for inclusion in the public record at the meeting. In addition, written scoping comments
may be filed with the Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street NE., Washington,
D.C. 20426, until December 9, 1994.
All written correspondence should clearly show either of the following captions on the first page: Grand Rapids Project
No. 2433, White Rapids Project No. 2357, Chalk Hill Project No. 2394, or Little Quinnesec Falls Project No. 2536.
Intervenors_those on the Commission's service list for this proceeding (parties)_are reminded of the Commission's
Rules of Practice and Procedure, requiring parties filing documents with the Commission, to serve a copy of the document
on each person whose name appears on the official service list.
Further, if a party or interceder files comments or documents with the Commission relating to the merits of an issue
that may affect the responsibilities of a particular resource agency, they must also serve a copy of the document on
that resource agency.
If you have any questions please contact Thomas Camp at (202) 219-2832.

CLIA Program; Approval of the American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics for the Specialty of Histocompatibility



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), HHS. 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice announces the approval of the American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics (ASHI) as
an accrediting organization for clinical laboratories under the CLIA program. We have found that the accreditation
process of this organization provides reasonable assurance that the laboratories accredited by it meet the conditions
required by Federal law and regulations for the specialty of histocompatibility. Consequently, laboratories that
voluntarily become accredited by ASHI in lieu of receiving direct Federal oversight and continue to meet ASHI requirements
would meet the CLIA condition level requirements for the specialty of histocompatibility and therefore are not subject
to routine inspection by State survey agencies to determine their compliance with Federal requirements for the specialty
of histocompatibility. They are, however, subject to validation and complaint investigation surveys. 




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
I. Background and Legislative Authority 


On October 31, 1988, the Congress enacted the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA), Public
Law 100-578. CLIA replaced in its entirety section 353 of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA), as enacted by
the Clinical Laboratories Improvement Act of 1967, Public Law 90-174, and made every laboratory in the United
States and its territories that tests human specimens for health reasons subject to the requirements established
by HHS and Federal regulation whether or not it participates in the Medicare or Medicaid program and whether or not
it tests specimens in interstate commerce. New section 353 requires HHS to establish certification requirements
for any laboratory that performs tests on human specimens and to certify through issuance of a certificate that those
laboratories meet the certificate requirements established by HHS. 

Section 6141 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989, Public Law 101-239, amended the Social Security
Act (the Act) to require that laboratories participating in the Medicare program meet the certificate requirements
of section 353 of the PHSA. Subject to specified exceptions, laboratories must have a current unrevoked and unsuspended
certificate to be eligible for payment under the Medicare or Medicaid programs, or both. Laboratories that are accredited
by an accreditation organization approved under section 353 of the PHSA automatically are eligible for Medicare
and Medicaid participation as long as they meet applicable State requirements. 

On February 28, 1992, we published several final rules in the 

Federal Register

 (57 FR 7002-7243) that implemented the amendments to section 353 of the PHSA. The technical and scientific portions
of these rules were drafted with input from The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the Public Health
Service (PHS). Specifically, we established regulations at 42 CFR part 493 that: 

 Require laboratories to pay fees for issuance of applicable certificates and to fund activities that we undertake
to determine compliance with our performance requirements; 

 Specify the performance requirements that apply to laboratories subject to CLIA (some of which were amended
by a subsequent January 19, 1993 rule, 58 FR 5215) and list requirements for laboratories performing certain limited
testing to be eligible for a certificate of waiver; and 

 Set forth the rules for the enforcement of CLIA requirements on laboratories that are found not to meet Federal
requirements. 

On July 31, 1992, we issued additional final rules (57 FR 33992), under authority found in section 353(e)(2) of the
PHSA, that establish that we may approve a private, nonprofit organization as an accreditation organization for
laboratories under the CLIA program if that organization's requirements for its accredited laboratories are equal
to or more stringent than the applicable CLIA program requirements of part 493 of our regulations. Therefore, a laboratory
accredited by an approved organization that meets and continues to meet all of the accreditation organization's
requirements would meet CLIA condition level requirements if it were inspected against CLIA regulations. The regulations
listed in subpart E of part 493 specify the requirements an accreditation organization must meet in order to be approved.
We may approve an accreditation organization under  493.501(d) of our regulations for a period not to exceed
six years. 

In general, the accreditation organization must:

<PARENT> FR941020-2-00032 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 Use inspectors qualified to evaluate laboratory performance and agree to inspect laboratories with the frequency
determined by HHS; 

 Apply standards and criteria that are equal to or more stringent than those condition level requirements established
by HHS when taken as a whole; 

 Provide reasonable assurance that these standards and criteria are continually met by its accredited laboratories;


 Provide HHS, within 30 days of the event, with the name of any laboratory that has had its accreditation denied,
suspended, withdrawn, limited, or revoked; 

 Notify HHS at least 30 days prior to changing its standards; and 

 If HHS withdraws its approval, notify its accredited laboratories of the withdrawal within 10 days of the withdrawal.
A laboratory can be accredited if it meets the standards of an approved accreditation body and authorizes the accreditation
body to submit to HHS records and other information HHS may require. 

Along with requiring the promulgation of criteria for approving an accreditation body and for withdrawing such approval,
CLIA requires HHS to perform an annual evaluation by inspecting a sufficient number of laboratories accredited by
an approved accreditation organization, or by any other means that HHS determines appropriate. Under section 353(o)
of the PHSA, the Secretary may, by agreement, use the services or facilities of any other Federal, State or local public
agency, or any private, nonprofit organization to conduct inspections of laboratories performing testing on human
specimens in the United States and its territories for the purpose of determining compliance with CLIA requirements.




II. Approval of ASHI as an Accrediting Organization for the Specialty of Histocompatibility 



In this notice, we approve ASHI as an organization that may accredit laboratories for purposes of establishing their
compliance with CLIA requirements for the specialty of histocompatibility. HCFA, with the assistance of CDC, has
examined the ASHI application and all subsequent submissions against the requirements under subpart E of part 493
that an accreditation organization must meet in order to be granted approved status under CLIA. We have determined
that ASHI requirements are equivalent to the applicable CLIA requirements for the specialty of histocompatibility
as of October 20, 1994, and grant ASHI approval as an accreditation organization under this subpart through October
20, 2000, for the specialty of histocompatibility. 

As a result of this determination, any laboratory that is accredited by ASHI during this time period for the specialty
of histocompatibility meets the CLIA requirements for laboratories found in part 493 of our regulations and, therefore,
is not subject to routine inspection by a State survey agency to determine its compliance with CLIA requirements for
histocompatibility. The accredited laboratory, however, is subject to validation and complaint investigation
surveys performed by HCFA, or by any other Federal or State or local public agency or nonprofit private organization
that acts in conformance to an agreement for this purpose with the Secretary. The laboratory remains subject to routine
inspections by a State survey agency or an agent of HCFA to determine its compliance with CLIA requirements for any
human specimen testing performed in any specialty other than the specialty of histocompatibility. 



III. Evaluation of ASHI 



The following describes the process we used to determine whether ASHI, as a private, nonprofit organization, provides
reasonable assurance that those laboratories it accredits will meet the applicable requirements of the Federal
law and regulations.

To determine whether we should grant approved status to ASHI as a private, nonprofit organization for accrediting
laboratories under CLIA for testing of human specimens in the specialty of histocompatibility as it requested, we
conducted a detailed and in-depth comparison of ASHI's requirements for its laboratories to those of CLIA and evaluated
whether ASHI's standards are at least as stringent as the requirements of 42 CFR part 493 when taken as a whole. In summary,
we evaluated whether ASHI:
 Provides reasonable assurance to us that it requires the laboratories it accredits to meet requirements that
are equal to or more stringent than the CLIA condition level requirements (for histocompatibility) and would, therefore,
meet the condition level requirements of CLIA if those laboratories had not been granted deemed status and had been
inspected against condition level requirements; and
 Meets the requirements of  493.506, which specifies the Federal review and approval requirements of
private, nonprofit accreditation organizations. As specified in our regulations at  493.506, our review
of a private, nonprofit accreditation organization seeking approved status under CLIA includes, but is not limited
to, an evaluation of:
 Whether the organization's requirements for its accredited laboratories are equal to or more stringent than
the condition level requirements of the CLIA regulations;
 The organization's inspection process to determine:



_The composition of the inspection teams, qualifications of the inspectors, and the ability of the organization
to provide continuing education and training to all of its inspectors;
_The comparability of the organization's full inspection and complaint inspection requirements to ours, including
but not limited to inspection frequency, and the ability to investigate and respond to complaints against its accredited
laboratories;
_The organization's procedures for monitoring laboratories that it has found to be out of compliance with its requirements;
_The ability of the organization to provide us with electronic data and reports that are necessary for effective validation
and assessment of the organization's inspection process;
_The ability of the organization to provide us with electronic data related to the adverse actions resulting from
unsuccessful proficiency testing (PT) participation in HHS approved PT programs, as well as data related to the PT
failures, within 30 days of the initiation of the action;
_The ability of the organization to provide us with electronic data for all its accredited laboratories and the areas
of testing;
_The adequacy of numbers of staff and other resources; and _The organization's ability to provide adequate funding
for performing the required inspections; and



 The organization's agreement with us that requires it to:



_Notify us of any laboratory that has had its accreditation denied, limited, suspended, withdrawn, or revoked by
the accreditation organization, or that has had any other adverse action taken against it by the accreditation organization
within 30 days of the action taken;
_Notify us within 10 days of a deficiency identified in an accredited laboratory where the deficiency poses an immediate
jeopardy to the laboratory's patients or a hazard to the general public;
_Notify us of all newly accredited laboratories within 30 days;

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941020-2-00045 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941020-2-00032 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

_Notify each laboratory accredited by the organization within 10 days of our withdrawal of recognition of the organization's
deeming authority;

_Provide us with inspection schedules, as requested, for the purpose of conducting onsite validation inspections;

_Provide us, the State survey agency or other HCFA agent with any facility-specific data that includes, but is not
limited to, PT results that constitute unsuccessful participation in an approved PT program and notification of
the adverse actions or corrective actions imposed by the accreditation organization as a result of unsuccessful
PT participation;

_Provide us with written notification at least 30 days in advance of the effective date of any proposed changes in its
requirements; and

_Make available, on a reasonable basis, any laboratory's PT results upon the request by any person, with such explanatory
information needed to assist in the interpretation of the results.




Laboratories that are accredited by an accreditation organization must:

 Authorize the organization to release to HCFA all records and information required by HCFA as required at  493.501;

 Permit inspections as required by the CLIA regulations at 42 CFR part 493, subpart Q;

 Obtain a certificate of accreditation as required by  493.61; and

 Pay the applicable fees as required by   493.638 and 493.645.



B. Evaluation of ASHI as an Accreditation Organization Under CLIA



ASHI has formally applied for approval as an accreditation organization under CLIA. We have evaluated the ASHI application
to determine equivalency with our implementing and enforcement regulations, and the deeming/exemption requirements
of the CLIA rules. We also verified the organization's assurance that it requires the laboratories it accredits to
be, and that the organization is, in compliance with the following subparts of 42 CFR part 493 as explained below:



Subpart E_Accreditation by a Private, Nonprofit Accreditation Organization or Exemption Under an Approved State
Laboratory Program



ASHI has submitted, for the specialty of histocompatibility, a comparison of individual accreditation and condition
level requirements, a description of its inspection process, PT monitoring process, and its data management and
analysis system, a listing of the size, composition, education and experience of its inspection teams, its investigative
and complaint response procedures, its notification agreements with HCFA, its removal or withdrawal of laboratory
accreditation procedures, its current list of accredited laboratories, and its announced and unannounced inspection
process. We have determined that ASHI has complied with the general requirements under  493.501, the applicable
parts of  493.506, and the CLIA requirements for approval as an accreditation organization under various subparts
of part 493.



Subpart H_Participation in Proficiency Testing for Laboratories Performing Tests of Moderate or High Complexity,
or Both



ASHI's requirements for PT are more stringent than those of CLIA. All of ASHI's accredited laboratories are required
to participate in a cell exchange or PT program for all tests. CLIA, however, does not require laboratories that perform
histocompatibility testing to participate in an HHS-approved PT program. We have determined that ASHI currently
imposes, and will continue to impose, action upon its accredited laboratories that are unsuccessful in a cell exchange
or PT performance.

<PARENT> FR941020-2-00032 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Subpart J_Patient Test Management for Moderate or High Complexity Testing, or Both


ASHI has revised its requirements to equal the CLIA requirements at   493.1101 through 493.1111 on an
overall basis. We have determined that ASHI's requirements are more stringent in that they require the laboratory
to obtain written authorization within 30 days for verbal orders on all referral testing, whereas CLIA requires the
laboratory to maintain documentation of efforts made to obtain written authorization within 30 days of the oral request.
Also, the test requisition or its equivalent must include the date and time a specimen is collected, and the source
of the specimen.


Subpart K_Quality Control for Tests of Moderate or High Complexity, or Both


The quality control (QC) requirements of ASHI have been evaluated against the high complexity requirements of the
CLIA regulations, as ASHI has determined that it will treat all testing as high complexity. We have determined that
ASHI's requirements, when taken as a whole, are equal to or more stringent than the CLIA requirements. The specific
areas of QC that are more stringent are:
 Procedures are signed, approved and dated by the laboratory director annually;
 Files for all internal and external quality control must be permanent;
 Compliance with all Federal, State and local laws regarding employee health and safety;
 Standards for parentage testing;
 Standards specifically addressing nucleic acid analysis (applicable to major histocompatibility complex
(MHC) testing); and
 Standards specific for flow cytometry (applicable to MHC testing and lymphocyte phenotyping as applied to
transplants).


Subpart M_Personnel for Moderate and High Complexity Testing


We have determined that ASHI's personnel requirements, when taken as a whole, are equal to or more stringent than the
CLIA requirements. ASHI has adopted the director, technical supervisor and clinical consultant requirements and
will recognize all boards that are approved by HHS as means to meet these requirements.
ASHI requires that the laboratory director must be available on site commensurate with workload, which is more stringent
than CLIA.

<PARENT> FR941020-2-00032 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Subpart P_Quality Assurance for Moderate or High Complexity 
Testing, or Both 



We have determined that ASHI's requirements are equal 
to the CLIA requirements of this subpart. ASHI has edited, 
rewritten, and amplified its checklist requirements on 
quality assurance to equate to the CLIA regulation 
requirements. 


Subpart Q_Inspections 



ASHI has made revisions to the frequency of its onsite 
inspection process to a biennial basis, to equate to the 
applicable CLIA requirements at  493.1777. Therefore, we 
have determined that ASHI's requirements are at least equal 
to the requirements of this subpart. The specific areas of 
the inspection process that are more stringent are: 
 ASHI inspectors provide onsite proficiency testing 
samples to be processed during the inspection; and 
 ASHI requires submission of a self-evaluation 
inspection for the intervening year, with an onsite 
inspection, if indicated. 



Subpart R_Enforcement Procedures for Laboratories 



ASHI meets the requirements of subpart R to the extent 
it applies to accreditation organizations. ASHI policy 
stipulates the action taken when ASHI accredited 
laboratories do not comply with its mandatory standards. 
When appropriate, ASHI will deny accreditation to a 
laboratory and report the denial to us within 30 days. ASHI 
also offers an appeals process for laboratories that have 
had a notification of denial of ASHI accreditation. 

Some specific actions ASHI takes in response to non-compliance or violation of mandatory standards include: 
 When an ASHI laboratory fails to maintain satisfactory 
performance in a cell exchange or PT program, the laboratory 
must either (a) successfully participate in two consecutive 
PT events (enhanced PT), submit to a reinspection and 
provide documentation of corrective actions; or (b) cease 
testing. This action is more stringent than the actions 
that we may take under subpart R. CLIA requires only the 
evaluation of a cell exchange program at the time of 
inspection. CLIA does not require PT for the specialty of 
histocompatibility. Therefore, no enhanced PT, nor 
cessation of testing due to unsatisfactory performance is 
required; and 
 When ASHI determines that a serious risk of harm 
(immediate jeopardy) situation exists in a ASHI-accredited 
laboratory, the laboratory must cease testing and 
immediately correct the problem that poses the risk. 
Failure to do so will result in a revocation of 
accreditation. This action is similar to our action for 
immediate jeopardy.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941020-2-00048 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941020-2-00032 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

We have determined that ASHI's laboratory enforcement 
and appeal policies are essentially equivalent to the 
requirements of this subpart as they apply to accreditation 
organizations. 



IV. Federal Validation Inspections and Continuing Oversight 



We may conduct Federal validation inspections of ASHI 
accredited laboratories, as specified in  493.507, on a 
representative sample basis or in response to allegations of 
noncompliance (called complaint inspections). The outcome 
of those validation inspections, performed by us, the State 
survey agency, or a HCFA agent, will be our principal means 
for verifying that the laboratories accredited by ASHI 
remain in compliance with CLIA requirements. This Federal 
monitoring is an on-going process. 



V. Removal of Approval as an Accrediting Organization 



Our regulations at  493.511 provide that we may remove 
the approval of an accreditation organization, such as that 
of ASHI, prior to the end of the effective date of approval. 
If validation inspection outcomes and the comparability or 
validation review produce findings as described at 
 493.509(a), we will conduct a review of an accreditation 
organization's program. We also conduct a review when the 
validation review findings, irrespective of the rate of 
disparity (as defined in  493.2), indicate systemic 
problems in the organization's processes that provide 
evidence that the organization's requirements, taken as a 
whole, are no longer equivalent to the CLIA requirements, 
taken as a whole. 

If we determine that ASHI has failed in practice to 
enforce its standards, or systemic problems exist in its 
inspection process, we may give it a probationary period, 
not to exceed one year, to allow ASHI to conform its 
inspection or enforcement procedures to the CLIA 
requirements. Based on an evaluation of any of the items 
stipulated at  493.511(d), we will make a determination as 
to whether or not ASHI retains its approved status as an 
accreditation organization under CLIA. If we deny approved 
status, ASHI may resubmit its application when it has 
revised its program to address the rationale for the denial, 
demonstrated that it can reasonably assure that its 
accredited laboratories meet CLIA condition level 
requirements, and resubmits its application for approval as 
an accreditation organization in its entirety. If, however, 
ASHI requests reconsideration of an adverse determination in 
accordance with subpart D of part 488 of our regulations, it 
may not submit a new application until a final 
reconsideration determination is issued.

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), HHS.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 

 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In accordance with section 1868(a) of the Social Security Act, this notice requests nominations from medical organizations
representing physicians for individuals to serve on the Practicing Physicians Advisory Council. Four vacancies
will occur on February 28, 1995.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 4112 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA '90) (Public Law 101-508), enacted on November
5, 1990, added a new section 1868 to the Social Security Act (the Act), which established the Practicing Physicians
Advisory Council (the Council). The Council advises the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services
(the Secretary) on proposed regulations and manual issuances related to physicians' services. An advisory committee
created by the Congress, such as this one, is subject to the provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C.
App. 2), and, since this committee advises the Secretary, it is also subject to our regulations in 45 CFR Part 11_Committee
Management. 



Section 1868(a) of the Act provides that the Council must consist of 15 physicians, each of whom must have submitted
at least 250 claims for physicians' services under Medicare in the previous year. At least 11 Council members must
be physicians as defined in section 1861(r)(1) of the Act, that is, State-licensed physicians of medicine or osteopathy.
The other four Council members may include dentists, podiatrists, optometrists, and chiropractors. The Council
must include both participating and nonparticipating physicians, and physicians practicing in rural and underserved
urban areas.

In addition, section 1868(a) of the Act provides that nominations to the Secretary for Council membership must be
made by medical organizations representing physicians. This is an invitation to all medical organizations representing
physicians to submit nominees for membership on the Council. Current members whose terms expire in 1995 will be considered
for reappointment. Final selection from among qualified candidates for each vacancy will be determined by the expertise
required to meet specific agency needs and in a manner to ensure appropriate balance of membership. From these nominations,
the Secretary will appoint the members of the Council. Each nomination must state that the nominee has expressed a
willingness to serve as a Council member and has provided a short resume or description of the nominee's experience.
To permit evaluation of possible sources of conflict of interest, potential candidates will be asked to provide detailed
information concerning financial holdings, consultant positions, research grants, and contracts. 


 Section 1868(b) of the Act provides that the Council meet once each calendar quarter, as requested by the Secretary,
to discuss proposed changes in regulations and manual issuances that relate to physicians' services. 


 Section 1868(c) of the Act provides for payment of expenses and a per diem allowance for Council members at a rate equal
to payment provided to members of other advisory committees. In addition to making these payments, the Department
of Health and Human Services provides management and support services to the Council.

Privacy Act of 1974; Computer Matching Program


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of a Computer Matching Program_HUD and Department of Justice (DOJ).



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), as amended by the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection
Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-503), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Guidelines on the Conduct of Matching Programs
(54 FR 25818 (June 19, 1989)), and OMB Bulletin 89-22, ``Instructions on Reporting Computer Matching Programs
to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Congress and the Public,'' the Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD) is issuing a public notice of its intent to conduct a computer matching program with the Department of Justice
(DOJ) to utilize a computer information system of HUD, the Credit Alert Interactive Voice Response System (CAIVRS),
with DOJ's debtor files. The CAIVRS data base now includes delinquent debt information from the Departments of Agriculture,
Education and Veterans Affairs and the Small Business Administration. This match will allow prescreening of applicants
for debts owed or loans guaranteed by the Federal Government to ascertain if the applicant is delinquent in paying
a debt owed to or insured by the Federal Government. Before granting a loan, a lending agency and/or an authorized lending
institution will be able to interrogate the CAIVRS debtor file which contains the Social Security Numbers (SSNs)
of HUD's delinquent debtors and defaulters and debtor files of the DOJ and verify that the loan applicant is not in default
on a Federal judgment or delinquent on direct or guaranteed loans of participating Federal programs. Authorized
users place a telephone call to the system. The system provides a recorded message followed by a series of instructions,
one of which is a requirement for the SSN of the loan applicant. The system then reports audibly whether the SSN is related
to delinquent or defaulted Federal obligations for HUD or other agency direct or guaranteed loans. As a result of the
information produced by this match, the authorized users may not deny, terminate, or make a final decision of any loan
assistance to an applicant or take other adverse action against such applicant, until an officer or employee of such
agency has independently verified such information.

The DOJ will provide HUD with its debtor files contained in its system of records entitled, Debt Collection Management
System, JUSTICE/JMD-006. HUD is maintaining DOJ's records only as a ministerial action on behalf of DOJ, not
as a part of HUD's HUD/DEPT-2 system of records. DOJ's data contain information on individuals or corporations
who have defaulted on Federal judgments. The DOJ will retain ownership and responsibility for their system of records
that they place with HUD. HUD serves only as a record location and routine use recipient for DOJ's data.



Notice Procedures



HUD will notify individuals at the time of application (ensuring that routine use appears on the application form)
for guaranteed or direct loans that their records will be matched to determine whether they are delinquent or in default
on a Federal debt. HUD and the DOJ will also publish notices concerning routine use disclosures in the 

Federal Register

 to inform individuals that a computer match may be performed to determine a loan applicant's credit status with the
Federal Government.



Categories of Records/Individuals Involved



The debtor records include these data elements: SSN, claim number, program code, and indication of indebtedness.
Categories of records include: Records of claims and defaults, repayment agreements, credit reports, financial
statements, records of foreclosures, and Federal judgment liens.

Categories of individuals include: Former mortgagors and purchasers of HUD-owned properties, manufactured (mobile)
home and home improvement loan debtors who are delinquent or in default on their loans, rehabilitation loan debtors
who are delinquent or in default on their loans, and individuals or corporations against whom judgments have been
filed by DOJ.



Period of the Match



Matching will begin at lease 40 days from the date copies of the signed (by both Data Integrity Boards) computer matching
agreement are sent to both Houses of Congress or at least 40 days from the date this Notice is published in the 

Federal Register

, whichever is later, providing comments are received which would result in a contrary determination. The matching
program will be in effect and continue for 18 months with an option to renew for 12 additional months unless one of the
parties to the agreement advises the other in writing to terminate or modify the agreement.

Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). 
 


 
 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notification of a proposed amendment to an existing system of records. 
 


 
 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) proposes to amend its system of records entitled ``Accounting
Records, HUD/DEPT-2'' in its inventory of systems of records notices subject to the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C.
552a), as amended. Notice of this system was last published at 55 FR 17676, April 26, 1990. 
 


 
 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

HUD/DEPT-2 contains a variety of records relating to HUD's accounting functions. These records are maintained
for the purpose of supporting HUD's administrative management and collection of delinquent debts, including past
due loan payments, overpayments, fines, penalties, fees, damages, interest, leases, sales of real property that
are owed to HUD or to other Federal agencies. Pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), as amended, notice
is given that HUD proposes to modify some of the general routine uses and add new routine uses to this system of records.
The revised routine uses (items (i), (k) and (l)) more specifically identify the categories of users (i.e., other
Federal agencies) to whom records may be disclosed pursuant to authorized and approved computer matching programs
undertaken for debt collection purposes. In addition, HUD is amending other routine uses (items (j), (m), (n), (o),
and (p)) to permit more effective administrative management and collection of delinquent claims and debts owed to
the U.S. Government under any programs administered by HUD. 
 


The amended portion of the system notice is set forth below. Previously, the system and a prefatory statement containing
the general routines used applicable to all HUD systems of records was published in the ``Federal Register Privacy
Act Issuances, 1989 Compilation, Volume I.'' 
 
Title 5 U.S.C. 552a(e) (4) and (11) provide that the public be afforded a 30-day period in which to comment on the new
record system. 
 
The system report, as required by 5 U.S.C. 552a(r), has been submitted to the Committee on Government Operations of
the House of Representatives, the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate, and the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB), pursuant to paragraph 4c of Appendix I to OMB Circular A-130, ``Federal Agency Responsibilities
for Maintaining Records About Individuals'' dated June 25, 1993 (58 FR 36075, July 2, 1993).

Maine Central Railroad Company (MEC) and Portland Terminal Company (PT) filed a notice of exemption under 49 CFR Part
1152 Subpart F_

Exempt Abandonments and Discontinuances

 to abandon and discontinue service over a segment of their Mountain Division line of railroad between milepost 5.76
and milepost 51.11, a distance of approximately 45.35 miles in Cumberland and Oxford Counties, ME. 


 MEC and PT certify that: (1) No local traffic has moved over the line for at least 2 years; (2) overhead traffic, if any,
has been rerouted over other lines; (3) no formal complaint filed by a user of rail service on the line (or by a State or
local government entity acting on behalf of such user) regarding cessation of service over the line either is pending
with the Commission or with any U.S. District Court or has been decided in favor of the complainant within the 2-year
period; and (4) the requirements at 49 CFR 1105.7 (environmental reports), 49 CFR 1105.8 (historic reports), 49 CFR
1105.11 (transmittal letter), 49 CFR 1105.12 (newspaper publication) and 49 CFR 1152.50(d)(1) (notice to governmental
agencies) have been met. 


 As a condition to use of this exemption, any employee adversely affected by the abandonment or discontinuance shall
be protected under 

Oregon Short Line R. Co._Abandonment_Goshen,

 360 I.C.C. 91 (1979). To address whether this condition adequately protects affected employees, a petition for partial
revocation under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) must be filed. 


 Provided no formal expression of intent to file an offer of financial assistance (OFA) has been received, this exemption
will be effective on November 17, 1994, unless stayed pending reconsideration. Petitions to stay that do not involve
environmental issues,

A copy of any petition filed with the Commission should be sent to applicant's representative: John R. Nadolny, Iron
Horse Park, No. Billerica, MA 01862. 


 If the notice of exemption contains false or misleading information, the exemption is void ab initio. 


 MEC and PT have filed an environmental report which addresses the effect, if any, of the abandonment and the discontinuance
on the environmental and historic resources. The Section of Environmental Analysis (SEA) will issue an environmental
assessment (EA) by October 21, 1994. Interested persons may obtain a copy of the EA by writing to SEA (Room 3219, Interstate
Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423) or by calling Elaine Kaiser, Chief of SEA, at (202) 927-6248. Comments
on environmental and historic preservation matters must be filed within 15 days after the EA becomes available to
the public.

appropriate, in a subsequent decision.

 


 
Decided: October 12, 1994.

Notice of aggregate production quotas for 1995.

and II of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA).




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Section 306 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 826) requires the Attorney General to establish aggregate
production quotas for controlled substances in Schedules I and II each year. This responsibility has been delegated
to the Administrator of the DEA pursuant to  0.100 of title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The Administrator,
in turn, has redelegated this function to the Deputy Administrtor pursuant to 59 FR 23637 (May 6, 1994).

On August 4, 1994, a notice of the proposed initial 1995 aggregate production quotas for certain controlled substances
in Schedules I and II was published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 39790). All interested persons were invited to comment on or before September 6, 1994. The following comments
were received.


Two companies commented that the proposed 1995 initial aggregate production quota for amphetamine is insufficient
to provide for the estimated medical, scientific, research and industrial needs of the United States, for export
requirements and the maintenance of reserve stocks. Based on current 1994 manufacturing quotas, the 1995 FDA estimate
of medical need, and export requirements, the DEA increased the 1995 initial aggregate production quota for amphetamine.


A company commented that the proposed initial 1995 aggregate production quota for levo-desoxyephedrine is insufficient
to provide for the estimated medical, scientific, research and industrial needs of the United States, for export
requirements and the maintenance of reserve stocks. After a review of the 1994 manufacturing quota, the 1995 FDA estimate
of medical need and other data, the DEA has determined that no adjustment is necessary at this time.


Two companies commented that the proposed 1995 initial aggregate production quota for methylphenidate is insufficient
to meet the estimated medical, scientific, research and industrial needs of the United States and for the maintenance
of reserve stocks. Based on 1994 manufacturing quotas, 1993 year-end inventories, the 1995 FDA estimate of medical
need and research and development requirements, the DEA adjusted the initial 1995 aggregate production quota for
methylphenidate accordingly.


Pertaining to Sufentanil, one company commented that the proposed 1995 initial aggregate production quota is insufficient
to meet the estimated medical, scientific, research and industrial needs of the United States. The DEA reviewed all
available information and adjusted the initial 1995 aggregate production quota for Sufentanil.


Another company commented that the proposed initial 1995 aggregate production quotas for hydromorphone, oxymorphone
and oxycodone (for conversion) are insufficient to meet the estimated medical, scientific, research and industrial
needs of the United States. After a review of 1994 manufacturing quotas and research and product development requirements,
the DEA has determined that increases are necessary to meet medical, scientific, research and industrial needs of
the United States.


The Office of Management and Budget has determined that notices of aggregate production quotas are not subject to
centralized review under Executive Order 12866. This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles
and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that this matter does not have sufficient
federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.


The Deputy Administrator hereby certifies that this action will have no significant impact upon small entities whose
interest must be considered under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq. The establishment of annual
aggregate production quotas for Schedules I and II controlled substances is mandated by law and by international
treaty obligations. While aggregate production quotas are of primary importance to large manufacturers, their
impact upon small entities is neither negative nor beneficial. Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator has determined
that this actions does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.


Therefore, under the authority vested in the Attorney General by Section 306 of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970
(21 U.S.C. 826), delegated to the Administrator of the DEA by  0.100 of title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations,
and redelegated to the Deputy Administrator, pursuant to 59 FR 23637 (May 6, 1994), the Deputy Administrator hereby
orders that the 1995 initial aggregate production quotas, expressed in grams of anhydrous acid or base, be established
as follows.

Article 16(3) of the NAALC provides for the review of labor law matters in Canada and Mexico by the NAO. ``Labor law''
is defined in Article 49 of the NAALC to include freedom of association, the right to organize, and minimum employment
standards.
The procedural guidelines for the NAO, published in the 

Federal Register

 on April 7, 1994, specify that, in general, the Secretary of the NAO shall accept a submission for review if it raises
issues relevant to labor law matters in Canada or Mexico and if a review would further the objectives of the NAALC. However,
the guidelines permit the NAO to decline to review a submission if, inter alia, the submission or available information
demonstrates that appropriate relief has not been sought under the domestic laws of Canada or Mexico.
Submission 

#

940003 relates to labor law matters in Mexico. A review would also appear to further the objectives of the NAALC, as
set out in Article 1, which include improving working conditions and living standards in each Party's territory;
promoting, to the maximum extent possible, the labor principles set out in Annex 1 of the NAALC, among them freedom
of association, the right to organize, and minimum employment standards; promoting compliance with, and effective
enforcement by each Party of, its labor law; and fostering transparency in the administration of labor law. Regarding
minimum employment standards, however, it appears to the NAO that appropriate relief has not been sought under the
domestic laws of Mexico and that, under the circumstances, review of that issue would not be advisable.
Accordingly, the submission has been accepted for review with respect to the issues of freedom of association and
the right to organize but not the issue of minimum employment standards. The NAO's decision is not intended to indicate
any determination as to the validity or accuracy of the allegations contained in the submission. Further, the decision
not to accept for review the allegations relating to minimum employment standards does not foreclose NAO review at
a future date based on submission of additional information about efforts to obtain appropriate relief under the
domestic laws of Mexico.
The objective of the review will be to gather information to assist the NAO to better understand and publicly report
on the Government of Mexico's promotion of compliance with, and effective enforcement of, its labor law through appropriate
government action, as set out in Article 3 of the NAALC. The review will focus on compliance with, and effective enforcement
of, labor laws that guarantee the right of association and the right to organize freely and prohibit the dismissal
of workers because of efforts to exercise those rights. The review will be completed, and a public report issued, within
120 days, or 180 days if circumstances require an extension of time, as set out in the procedural guidelines of the NAO.

[Case No. 94-OFC-18]



Recommended Decision and Order



In the Matter of 

United States Department of Labor, Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs,

 Plaintiff v. 

State Construction of SE Wisconsin,

 Defendant.




This proceeding was initiated to enforce the contractual obligations imposed by Executive order 11246 (30 FR 12319),
as amended by Executive Order No. 11375 (32 FR 14303) and Executive Order 12086 (43 FR 46501), hereinafter, ``Executive
Order 11246.''

On August 1, 1994, plaintiff, the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, U.S. Department of Labor (hereinafter,
``OFCCP''), filed a complaint in this matter with the Office of Administrative Law Judges against defendant, State
Construction of SE Wisconsin (hereinafter ``State''), alleging violations of Executive Order 11246. Simultaneously
with the filing of the complaint, OFCCP filed a Request for Admissions. The complaint and request for admissions were
sent via Federal Express, which effected delivery on August 2, 1994. The complaint alleges that State, a construction
contractor maintaining its principal place of business in Kenosha, Wisconsin, at all times pertinent hereto has
held a Federal or Federally-assisted construction contract of $10,000 or more, within the meaning of the Executive
Order, and has been subject to the contractual obligations imposed on Government contractors and subcontractors
by the said Executive Order and the implementing regulations issued thereunder.

Following a compliance review of State, commenced by OFCCP on February 18, 1992, OFCCP, on February 27, 1992, issued
to State a Notice of Violation, finding that State had violated its affirmative obligations in thirteen specific
respects and was not in compliance with Executive Order 11246. As a result of said violations, the parties entered
into a Conciliation Agreement on March 10, 1992 in which State agreed to provide OFCCP with personnel activity reports
at six-month intervals, said reports to include information for the relevant six-month period on the number of vacancies
for each craft, the number of contacts State has with linkage and recruitment resources to fill those vacancies, the
number of applications received by State from each of its recruitment sources, the number of hires, and the total number
of applicants and hires by race, sex and ethnicity.

The first personnel activity summary report was due to be filed with OFCCP on August 1, 1992, to cover the period from
January 1, through June 30, 1992, but was filed, untimely, on August 26, 1992. State was notified of deficiencies in
the report in an October 16, 1992 letter to which it responded on November 11, 1992, indicating it had hired 14 trade
employees during the reporting period, and that the 14 hires included two women and one Hispanic. State did not notify
the Milwaukee Urban League, Big Step, Inc., Spanish Center of Racine & Kenosha, the Urban League of Racine &
Kenosha, Inc., Women's Resource Center and Cartage College of these 14 openings and did not request that these sources
supply applicants for any of these positions, in violation of an agreed-to term of the Conciliation Agreement. Also,
computer and other records produced by State in response to the October 16, 1992 letter failed to support State's supplemental
report that it had 14 trade hires, including two women one Hispanic.

On December 11, 1992, OFCCP notified State, by letter, that the November 11, 1992 response was unacceptable and requested
further clarification and information. OFCCP agreed to State's request that State be permitted to file the clarifying
information with its second activity report which was due February 1, 1993, but that report was never filed. This failure
to file the second personnel activity report, the incompleteness of the first personnel activity report, the failure
to notify of openings and its failure to recruit and employ minorities and women during the period from January 1 through
June 30, 1992, all in violation of the Conciliation Agreement were appointed out to State on February 19, 1993.

On July 29, 1993, OFCCP notified State of its determination that the company had violated its obligations under the
Conciliation Agreement and gave State 15 days in which to respond. No response has been received. As of the present
date, State has failed to file an answer to the complaint or admissions as requested.

On August 29, 1994, OFCCP filed a Motion for a Default Judgment and Entry of Sanctions. The Plaintiff cites the regulations
at 41 CFR 60-30.32(c), governing Executive Order 11246, stating that if a defendant fails to request a hearing
within 20 days of the filing of the complaint such failure shall constitute waiver of hearing and all material allegations
of fact shall be deemed to be admitted. Furthermore, if a party fails to respond within 25 days to request for admissions,
the matters of fact stated in the request shall be deemed admitted. 41 CFR 60-30.9(b) Plaintiff cites 

OFCCP

 v. 

Milwaukee Fence,

 91-OFC-3, slip. op. at 3, wherein the Secretary affirmed the administrative law judge's entry of an order
imposing sanctions in a situation similar in all respects to that in the instant case. Furthermore, sanctions are
appropriate where, as here, a contractor has failed to abide by the terms of a conciliation agreement and is in violation
of the Executive Order. Accordingly, I recommend that the Secretary enter a Final Order providing for the following
relief:

1. Cancelling all of the federal and federally assisted contracts and subcontracts of Defendant, its successors,
officers, agents, servants, employees, direct or beneficial owners, division or subdivisions and those persons
in active concert or participation with them; and

2. Declaring Defendant, its officers, agents, subsidiaries and successors to be ineligible to receive any government
contracts or subcontracts or for extensions or other modifications of any existing Government contracts or subcontracts,
for a period of at least 180 days, and thereafter until State has demonstrated to the Deputy Assistant Secretary for
Federal Contract Compliance Programs that it is currently in compliance with the provisions of the Executive Order
and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and that it has undertaken to correct past acts of noncompliance, including
identifying and making whole any victims of its past noncompliance, and that it will carry out employment practices
in compliance with the Executive Order.

National Environmental Policy Act; Cassini Mission



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of availability of draft environmental impact statement.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), as amended (42 U.S.C. 4321 

et seq.

), the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40 CFR Parts
1500 through 1508), and NASA policy and regulations (14 CFR Part 1216, Subpart 1216.3), NASA has prepared and issued
a draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) for the proposed Cassini mission. This planned action would involve
the preparation for and implementation of the Cassini mission, including, but not limited to, launch of the Cassini
spacecraft, its cruise to Saturn, and a variety of scientific operations and investigations focused on Saturn and
its rings and satellites.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The DEIS considers and analyzes the alternatives associated with the proposed Cassini mission and their related
environmental impacts. NASA's baseline proposed action and preferred alternative would involve the launch of the
Cassini spacecraft from Cape Canaveral Air Station, Florida, using a Titan IV (Solid Rocket Motor Upgrade)/Centaur.
The primary launch opportunity is in October 1997, with contingency launch opportunities in December 1997 (secondary)
or March 1999 (backup).




The primary launch opportunity would place the spacecraft into a 6.7-year Venus-Venus-Earth-Jupiter-Gravity-Assist
trajectory to Saturn. The preferred alternative would use three radioisotope thermoelectric generators for onboard
electrical power, and radioisotope heater units to control the thermal environment of the spacecraft and its components.

Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc.,
Relating to Order Service Firms



October 14, 1994.




On June 1, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (``Act''),
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposal to amend CBOE Rule 6.77, ``Stock Execution Services,'' to allow order service firms to take market maker
orders for the purchase or sale of commodity futures contracts and futures options and forward the orders to the appropriate
futures exchange for execution.






Notice of the proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34396 (July 18,
1994), 59 FR 37793 (July 25, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal.


Currently, CBOE Rule 6.77 states that a stock service is a member registered with the Exchange for the purpose of providing
stock execution services to market makers on the CBOE's floor.
 The CBOE proposes to amend CBOE Rule 6.77 to replace the term ``stock service'' with the term ``order service firm''
and to allow order service firms to take orders from CBOE market makers for the purchase or sale of commodity futures
contracts and futures options and forward market makers' orders to the appropriate futures exchange. The execution
of all orders to purchase or sell commodity interests will occur on a futures exchange that has been designated as a
contract market by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``CFTC'').





Accordingly, proposed paragraph (d) of CBOE Rule 6.77 provides that order service firms that accept orders to buy
or sell commodity interests must comply with the Commodity Exchange Act of 1974 (``CEA'') and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder.
 Proposed paragraph (d) also requires order service firms to keep the CBOE's Department of Financial Compliance apprised
of their registration status under the CEA on an ongoing basis, including any financial reporting or capital requirements.





In addition to revising CBOE Rule 6.77, the CBOE proposes to adopt CBOE Rule 6.78, ``Letters of Guarantee Required
of Order Service Firms,'' which requires a member acting as an order service firm to have on file with the Exchange and
in effect an Order Service Firm Letter of Guarantee issued for the service firm by a member of the Options Clearing Corporation
(``OCC''). Under proposed CBOE Rule 6.78(b), the letter of guarantee must provide that the issuing clearing member
accepts financial responsibility for all orders handled by the order service firm on the CBOE floor and for all financial
obligations of the order service firm to the Exchange. In order to limit the potential risk to any single clearing member,
no clearing member will be permitted to guarantee more than three order service firms without the prior written approval
of the Department of Financial Compliance. In considering a request to guarantee more than three such firms, the Department
of Financial Compliance will consider the clearing member's level of excess net capital, additional financial resources,
and such other facts as the Department of Financial Compliance deems appropriate.

The CBOE believes that the proposed rule change will facilitate market making capacity in stock index options. Market
makers in stock index options are subject to the risk that market prices will change before they can liquidate their
positions, and hedge this risk by executing transactions in related commodity interests.
 The CBOE believes that the proposed rule change will facilitate the ability of CBOE market makers in stock index options
to execute hedging transactions by providing them with a more efficient means of effecting such transactions.




The CBOE believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and furthers
the objectives of Section 6(b)(5), in particular, in that it will facilitate the ability of options market makers
for which there are related commodity interests to reduce their exposure to market risk by providing them with a more
efficient means of effecting hedging transactions in such commodity interests.
The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section
6(b)(5), in that it is designed to facilitate transactions in securities and to protect investors and the public interest.
 Specifically, the Commission notes, as it has stated in the past, that many CBOE index option market makers hedge their
positions in index options by purchasing the corresponding futures contract.
 Under the Exchange's current rules, a CBOE market maker who hedges his position with futures contracts must leave
his trading post in order to place a futures order. The proposal will enable CBOE market makers to remain at their trading
posts while placing their futures orders with the order service firm clerks located on the CBOE's floor. Thus, the
proposal should provide the CBOE's index option market makers with an efficient, convenient, and effective means
to place their futures orders, thereby facilitating the market makers' ability to reduce their risks through hedging
transactions and, in turn, helping to maintain the depth and liquidity of the CBOE's market for index options.

<TEXT>
 

In addition, the Commission notes that the proposal contains safeguards designed to ensure that only qualified firms
are permitted to register as order service firms. For example, CBOE Rule 6.77 retains the provisions currently applicable
to stock services and requires firms to apply to the CBOE's Membership Department for registration as an order service
firm. Under CBOE Rule 6.77, the applications will continue to be reviewed by the CBOE's Membership Committee, which
will consider the applicant's financial condition, regulatory history, and other factors in determining whether
to approve the firm's application for registration as an order service firm. The Commission believes, as it has stated
in connection with stock services, that it is appropriate for an options exchange to monitor firms operating on its
floor to ensure the proper operation of floor activities and thus to require Membership Committee approval of order
service firms.
 




The proposal also contains provisions designed to ensure the financial integrity of the order service firms. Specifically,
proposed CBOE Rule 6.78 requires order service firms to obtain a letter of guarantee issued by a member of the OCC. Under
the letter of guarantee, the issuing clearing member accepts financial responsibility for all orders handled by
the order service firm on the CBOE floor and for all financial obligations of the order service firm to the Exchange.
CBOE Rule 6.78 also provides that no clearing member shall be permitted to guarantee more than three order service
firms without the prior written approval of the Department of Financial Compliance. 


In addition, paragraph (d) of CBOE Rule 6.77 makes clear that to the extent an order service firm takes orders for the
purchase or sale of commodity futures contracts and options thereon, it must comply with the CEA and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder. Paragraph (d) also requires order service firms to keep the CBOE's Department of Financial
Compliance apprised of their registration status under the CEA on an ongoing basis, including any financial reporting
or capital requirements. Accordingly, the Commission expects the CBOE to allow only those firms which meet the applicable
requirements of the CEA to register with the Exchange as order service firms. In addition, the Commission expects
the CBOE to carefully monitor the order service firms' compliance with the relevant provisions of the CEA and to revoke
the CBOE registration of any order service firm that fails to satisfy those requirements. 



It is therefore ordered, 

pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (SR-CBOE-94-16) is approved. 

 




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board
Relating to Underwriting Assessment for Brokers, Dealers, and Municipal Securities Dealers</DOCTITLE>



October 13, 1994.



On August 15, 1994, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (``Board'' or ``MSRB'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') a proposed rule change (File No. SR-MSRB-94-12),
pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')

1

, and Rule 19b-4 thereunder. The MSRB filed the proposed rule change to preclude brokers, dealers and municipal
dealers from passing through rule A-13 fees to issuers. The Commission published notice of the proposal in the


Federal Register

 on September 1, 1994.

2

 The Commission has reviewed the comments it received in response to the notice.

3

 For the reasons discussed below, the Commission is approving the proposed rule change.







I. Description



The proposal amends MSRB rule A-13 on Underwriting Assessments for Brokers, Dealers and Municipal Securities
Dealers. The proposal will preclude brokers, dealers and municipal securities dealers (``dealers'') from charging
or otherwise passing through rule A-13 fees to issuers. The proposal will become effective 30 days after publication
of the approval order in the 

Federal Register

.

Rule A-13 requires each dealer to pay to the Board a fee based upon the dealer's participation in ``primary offerings''
of municipal securities (``rule A-13 fees'').

 In addition to rule A-13 fees, the Board charges an initial fee of $100 and an annual fee of $100 under rules A-12
and A-14, respectively, but rule A-13 fees provide the bulk of Board revenues. The amount of rule A-13
fees owed is based upon the par value of the dealer's participation in primary offerings.

5

 No obligation to pay a rule A-13 fee is generated by participation in the following types of primary offerings:
(i) those composed exclusively of securities less than nine months in maturity; (ii) offerings under $1 million in
par value; and (iii) ``limited placement'' offerings, as described in subsection (c)(1) of Exchange Act Rule 15c2-12.

Under the current requirements of rule A-13, if a syndicate or similar account is formed for the purpose of purchasing
securities from an issuer, the managing underwriter is responsible to pay the assessment fee on behalf of each participant
in the syndicate. Payment by the managing underwriter, rather than by individual syndicate members, is solely an
administrative convenience for underwriters and the Board.
Rule A-13 is intended to provide a dealer assessment that roughly reflects each dealer's underwriting activity
in the municipal securities market.
 Since rule A-13 fees are assessments on dealers for the operation of the Board, a dealer's obligation under rule
A-13 should not be charged or otherwise passed through to an issuer as an expense to the issuer of bringing a new
issue to market. As such, the proposal would add paragraph (e) to rule A-13 which states:



* * * (e) Prohibition on Charging Fees Required Under this Rule to Issuers. No broker, dealer or municipal
securities dealer shall charge or otherwise pass through the fee required under this rule to an issuer of municipal
securities.




A commenter supported the Board's perception that, in negotiated underwritings, the subject of rule A-13 fees
sometimes is raised in the context of discussions of expenses to be paid by the issuer of the securities.
 The Commission supports the Board's view that it is misleading for underwriters to characterize rule A-13 fees
in this fashion.
 In this respect, the fees paid to the Board by dealers under rule A-13 should be characterized by dealers to issuers
no differently than the annual fees paid to the Board under rule A-14 and any other ``overhead'' expenses that
are incurred by virtue of the dealer engaging in municipal securities business.

II. Discussion



The proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act, and, specifically, with Section 15B(b)(2)(J)
of the Act.
 Section 15B(b)(2)(J) authorized the MSRB to adopt rules to provide that each municipal securities broker and each
municipal securities dealer pay to the Board such reasonable fees and charges as may be necessary or appropriate to
defray the costs and expenses of operating and administering the Board. The proposed rule change is consistent with
its authority to charge dealers reasonable fees to defray the costs of operating and administering the Board. The
proposed rule change makes clear that the fees levied under rule A-13 are to be paid by dealers and not issuers.





III. Conclusion



For the foregoing reasons, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder applicable to the MSRB and, in particular, Section 15B(b)(2)(J).



It is therefore ordered

, Pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule change as described above be, and hereby is, approved,
and shall be effective November 21, 1994.




For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority, 17 CFR 200.30-3(a)(12).

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc.; Notice of Filing of a Proposed Rule Change Relating
to Revisions to the General Securities Registered Representative (Series 7) Examination, and the Corresponding
Specifications and Content Outline</DOCTITLE>


October 14, 1994.


Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 notice is hereby given that on October 3, 1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'')
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items
I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared primarily by the Phlx. The Commission is publishing this notice
to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance or the Proposed Rule Change


The Phlx proposes, in conjunction with the other self-regulatory organizations (``SROs''), to use a revised version
of the General Securities Registered Representative (``Series 7'') Examination, the corresponding specifications
and content outline.
 The Phlx would adopt the amended Series 7, as well as the corresponding specifications and content outline.






II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, the Phlx included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Phlx has prepared
summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.


A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


The Phlx proposes to use the Series 7 as amended, as the appropriate qualification examination for persons seeking
registration as general securities representatives. The Series 7 examination is generally required under rules
of the self-regulatory organizations (``SROs'') for persons who are engaged in the solicitation, purchase and/or
sale of securities for the accounts of customers. The purpose of the Series 7 examination is to ensure that registered
representatives have the basic knowledge necessary to preform their functions and responsibilities. The Series
7 examination specifications detail the areas covered by the examination and break down the number of examination
questions culled from each area.
Revision of the Series 7 examination, specifications and content outline was initiated in April 1993 by an industry
committee of SROs and representatives from broker-dealers in order to update the examination in view of changes in
the securities industry, including changes in relevant rules and regulations, the development of new securities
products, and changes in the job of registered representatives as firms offer an increasingly wide range of financial
services.
 The examination specifications for the Series 7 have not been revised since 1986.





The industry committee updated the existing statements of the critical functions of registered representatives
to ensure current relevance and appropriateness and drafted statements of tasks expected to be performed by entry-level
registered representatives, and conformed the existing content outline to the task statements. Under the proposed
rule change, the total number of questions in the Series 7 examination will remain 250, and the revised examination
will cover all financial product areas covered on the present Series 7 examination as well as several new products,
including collateralized mortgage obligations (``CMOs''), long term equity anticipation securities (``LEAPS'')
and CAPS, with reduced emphasis on direct participation programs.

<PARENT> FR941020-2-00079 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The other SRO participants will also file the revised specifications for approval by the Commission. The Phlx intends
to commence use of the revised examination, specifications and content outline jointly with the other SROs, upon
approval of the proposed rule changes of all of the other SRO participants.
The statutory basis for the Series 7 examination lies in Section 6(c)(3)(B) of the Act. Under that Section, it is the
Exchange's responsibility to prescribe standards of training, experience and competence for persons associated
with Exchange members and member organizations. Pursuant to this statutory obligation, the Exchange has developed
examinations that are administered to establish that persons associated with Exchange members and member organizations
have attained specified levels of competence and knowledge.


B. 

Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


The Phlx believes that the proposal does not impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.


C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants,
or Others


Comments were neither solicited nor received.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


Within thirty-five days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register 

or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to ninety days of such date if it finds such longer
period to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization
consents, the Commission will:



(A) By order approve the proposed rule change, or
(B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.


IV. Solicitation of Comments


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of the Phlx. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-Phlx-94-50
and should be submitted by November 10, 1994.



For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc.
Relating to Revisions to the General Securities Sales Supervisor (Series 8) Examination, and the Corresponding
Examination Specifications and Content Outline </DOCTITLE>


October 14, 1994.


Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 notice is hereby given that on October 3, 1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'')
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items
I, II and III below, which Items have been prepared by the Phlx. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit
comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.




I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


The Phlx proposes, in conjunction with the other self-regulatory organizations (``SROs''), to adopt and use a revised
version of the General Securities Sales Supervisor (``Series 8'') Examination, examination specifications and
content outline.
 The Phlx proposes to incorporate references to this examination into its rules by adding paragraph (d) to rule 748,
Supervision.




II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, the Phlx included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Phlx has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C
below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.


A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


The General Securities Sales Supervisor (``Series 8'') Examination is an industry-wide qualification examination
for securities sales supervisors. The Series 8 examination is generally required under rules of the self-regulatory
organizations (``SROs'') for persons who are engaged in the supervision of general securities branch offices (

i.e., 

branch office managers) and of general securities registered representatives. The Series 8 examination tests a
candidate's knowledge of securities industry rules and regulations and certain statutory provisions applicable
to general securities sales supervision. The Series 8 examination specifications detail the areas covered by the
examination and break down the number of examination questions culled from each area. The Series 8 content outline
details the subject coverage and question allocation of the examination. The content outline reflects the revised
content of the examination.

Revision of the Series 8 examination, specifications and content outline was recently undertaken by an industry
committee composed of representatives from SROs (the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, the Chicago
Board Options Exchange, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, the National Association of Securities Dealers
and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange) and representatives from broker-dealers, including branch office managers,
compliance personnel and corporate executives, in order to update the examination in view of changes in relevant
laws, rules and regulations, the development of new products, and to reflect various changes in industry practices.
The committee reviewed the examination specifications, content areas and item bank and developed new questions
in new areas.
The revised examination continues to cover the areas of knowledge required to supervise sales activities in securities,
however, the focus of the content of the examination has been shifted to concentrate more closely on supervisory duties.
Accordingly, certain questions have been deleted which deal with routine calculations and basic product knowledge
and questions on new federal and SRO rules and regulations have been incorporated into the exam, as well as questions
on new products, supervision and changes in industry practices. The revised examination and specifications include
coverage of these new areas. The examination will remain a six-hour, two-part, 200 question examination.

The Phlx also proposes to adopt a new paragraph to Phlx Rule 748, Supervision, to expressly incorporate a supervisory
examination into Exchange rules. Specifically, persons delegated supervisory responsibility pursuant to Rule
748 (b) and (c) would be required by proposed paragraph (d) to meet the Exchanges' qualification requirements, including
successful completion of a supervisory examination deemed acceptable by the Exchange. This requirement is substantially
similar to existing provision of other exchanges.
 Currently, Rule 748 requires member or participant organizations to supervise all registered representatives
and each office, department or business activity. In addition, a general partner or principal executive officer
must be designated to assume overall responsibility for internal supervision of the organization and compliance
with securities laws and regulations, including establishing written supervisory procedures delegating supervisory
responsibilities and instituting a supervisory review procedure.




With respect to qualifications for supervisory personnel, Rule 748 merely requires employees with delegated supervisory
responsibility to be ``qualified,'' and persons responsible for any group of employees to ``reasonably discharge''
those duties. The proposed new language is intended to bridge this gap by expressly requiring supervisory personnel
to qualify with the Exchange by successfully completing the appropriate examination, which will be indicated in
the Exchange's memorandum to its membership. The Exchange notes that although options activity and personnel, including
foreign currency options, are also subject to Rule 748, additional supervisory requirements for option accounts
apply.





The other SRO participants will also file the revised examination and specifications for approval by the SEC. The
Exchange intends to implement the new Series 8 content outline and examination jointly with the other SROs after the
Commission has approved the proposed rule changes of all the other SROs.
The statutory basis for the Series 8 Examination lies in Section 6(c)(3)(B) of the Act. Under that Section, it is the
Exchange's responsibility to prescribe standards of training, experience and competence for persons associated
with Exchange members and member organizations. Pursuant to this statutory obligation, the Exchange has developed
examinations that are administered to establish that persons associated with Exchange members and member organizations
have attained specific levels of competence and knowledge.
The addition of new language to Phlx Rule 748 is also consistent with Section 6(b)(5) in that it is designed to promote
just and equitable principles of trade, prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, and protect investors
and the public interest by bolstering the Exchange's supervision rule through a qualification and examination requirement
for supervisory personnel.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The Phlx does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition that is not necessary
or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others



Comments were neither solicited nor received.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action

Federal Register

 or within such other period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:

(A) by order approve the proposed rule change, or

(B) institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450

John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company (``John Hancock''), John Hancock Variable Annuity Account U (``Account
U''), John Hancock Variable Annuity Account V (``Account V''), John Hancock Variable Life Insurance Company (``JHVLICO'',
together, with John Hancock, the ``Companies''), John Hancock Variable Annuity Account I (``Account I'') and any

RELEVANT 1940 ACT SECTIONS:

 Order requested under Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act for exemptions from Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940
Act.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: 

Applicants seek an order permitting the Companies to deduct from the assets of the Accounts the mortality and expense
risk charge imposed under certain variable annuity contracts issued by the Companies (the ``Existing Contracts'')
and under any other variable annuity contracts issued by the Companies which are materially similar to the Existing
Contracts and are offered through any Account on a basis that is similar in all material respects to the basis on which
the Existing Contracts are offered (the ``Other Contracts'', together, with the Existing Contracts, the ``Contracts'').
 The Other Contracts may be either group contracts or individual contracts and may be either variable or combination
fixed and variable contracts.





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Following is a summary of the application, the complete application is available for a fee from the Public Reference
Branch of the SEC.



Applicants' Representations



1. John Hancock, a mutual life insurance company chartered under Massachusetts law, is the principal underwriter
for Accounts U, V and I. John Hancock is a registered broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and a registered
investment advisor under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

2. JHVLICO, a stock life insurance company also chartered under Massachusetts law, is a wholly-owned subsidiary
of John Hancock.

3. Accounts U and V, established as separate accounts of John Hancock under Massachusetts law on January 14, 1985 and
May 11, 1987, respectively, fund classes of variable annuity contracts which differ in certain respects from the
Contracts. Both Accounts are registered with the Commission as unit investment trusts under the 1940 Act and the offer
and sale of interests under the variable annuity contracts funded through the Accounts is registered under the Securities
Act of 1933 (the ``1933 Act''). Applicants incorporate those registration statements into the application by reference.
The application states that the Accounts currently have seven subaccounts. Two additional subaccounts will be added
to Account V with the introduction of the Existing Contracts. Applicants represent that a registration statement
on Form N-4 will be filed with respect to the Existing Contracts funded through Account V. Such registration
statement is incorporated into the application by reference.

<PARENT> FR941020-2-00081 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

4. Account I, a separate account of JHVLICO, was established under Massachusetts law on June 15, 1994. Applicants
state that Account I will register with the Commission as a unit investment trust under the 1940 Act and that the offer
and sale of variable annuity contracts to be funded through Account I will be registered under the 1933 Act. Applicants
incorporate the registration statements into the application by reference. Account I has nine subaccounts.

5. The Other Accounts will be separate accounts of either Company used to fund Other Contracts. Applicants state that
the Other Accounts will register with the Commission under the 1940 Act.

6. The assets of Accounts U and V are, and the assets of Account I will be, invested in shares of John Hancock Variable
Series Trust I (the ``Fund''). The Fund is a diversified, open-end management investment company and was reorganized
as a business trust under Massachusetts law effective April 29, 1988. The Fund is the successor to John Hancock Variable
Series Fund I, Inc., which was incorporated under Maryland law on September 23, 1985. The Fund currently has nine portfolios,
each of which has separate investment objectives and policies.

7. The Existing Contracts are individual combination fixed/variable annuity contracts, issued to plans qualifying
for special tax treatment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the ``Code''). The Existing Contracts will also
be issued to individual persons doing their own retirement planning, and to plans and trusts that do not qualify for
special tax treatment under the Code. The Existing Contracts will be deferred annuity contracts that are deemed to
be ``periodic payment plan certificates'' within the meaning of Section 2(a)(27) of the 1940 Act.

8. The Companies will deduct any premium tax levied by any governmental entity as a result of the Contracts or the Accounts.
Purchase payments received under the Contracts will be allocated, after the deduction of applicable premium taxes,
to any one or more of the subaccounts of the appropriate Account or to a fixed annuity account of either of the Companies
at the discretion of the owner of the Contract. The application states that the applicable premium taxes are determined
by the then current state of residence of the Contract owner. Premium taxes currently range from 0.04% to 5% of purchase
payments or of the amount annuitized. Applicants state that, where permitted by state law, the premium taxes will
be deducted upon annuitization. In all other jurisdictions, the taxes will be deducted upon the death of the annuitant,
surrender or withdrawal as directed by the law of the Contract owner's state of residence.

<TEXT>
 

9. A death benefit, payable in a single sum or under an optional method of settlement, is provided if the annuitant dies
before the maturity, surrender, or termination of a Contract. The death benefit will be the greatest of: 

(a) The amount of the purchase payments made under the Contract reduced by all prior withdrawals and any withdrawal
charges; 

(b) The Accumulated Value of the Contract next determined following receipt by the applicable Company of due proof
of death; or 

(c) Where permitted by state law, the Accumulated Value of the Contract as of any third interval Contract anniversary
preceding the Contract anniversary nearest the Annuitant's 81st birthday, plus the purchase payments made under
the Contract, less any withdrawals and any withdrawal charges imposed since such Contract anniversary.
 Applicants state that the ``stepped-up'' death benefit described in clause (c) above is provided to owners of the
Contracts at no additional cost.





10. The Companies impose an annual Contract fee of $30 on Contracts having an Accumulated Value of less than $10,000.
This fee will be deducted at the beginning of each Contract year after the first year and upon surrender. The application
states that the Companies reserve the right to increase this fee to $50.
 





11. The application states that the Companies furnish certain administrative and clerical services to their respective
Accounts. For these services, the Companies make a daily charge to each Account equal to .35% on an annual basis of the
current value of the net assets of that Account that are attributable to the Contracts. The application states that
this charge is guaranteed and cannot be increased. Each Company represents that the .35% charge has been set at a level
which is not expected to generate revenues that would, together with the revenues from the Contract fee, exceed the
Company's administrative costs with respect to the Contracts. Applicants represent that the Companies will deduct
both the annual Contract fee and the annual administrative charge in reliance upon and in conformity with all of the
requirements of Rule 26a-1 under the 1940 Act.
 





12. A contingent deferred sales charge (the ``Sales Charge'') of up to 8% of the premium payments received is imposed
upon withdrawal or surrender within the first seven years of the Contract. The Sales Charge is a percentage of the amount
of each purchase payment that is withdrawn. The percentage declines depending upon how many years have passed since
the withdrawn purchase payment was originally credited to a Contract owner.

13. The Companies will impose a daily charge equal to an annual effective rate of 1.15% of the value of the net assets
of the Accounts to compensate each Company for its assumption of mortality and expense risks in connection with the
Contracts. Applicants state that approximately .45% of the 1.15% charge is attributable to mortality risk, and approximately
.70% is attributable to expense risk. The application states that the Companies reserve the right to change the proportion
if these estimates change. Applicants represent that the charge for mortality and expense risks will not increase.
If the mortality and expense risk charge is insufficient to cover actual costs of the risks undertaken, the Companies
will bear the loss. Conversely, if the charge exceeds costs, this excess will be profit to the Companies and will be
available for any corporate purpose, including payment of expenses relating to the distribution of the Contracts.

14. Applicants state that the Companies assume a mortality risk inherent in the death benefit provided for in the Contracts.
Where the death benefit is paid prior to the Contract's maturity date, Applicants state that the risk assumed is that
the amount paid will exceed the Contract's Accumulated Value. Additionally, Applicants state that there is also
the risk that no surrender charge will be imposed on a payment under a death benefit or on the payment of a life annuity
to the beneficiary following the death of an owner who is not the annuitant.

15. Applicants state that the Companies also assume an expense risk under the Contracts. According to Applicants,
this is the risk that the charges for administrative services under the Contracts will be insufficient to cover actual
administrative expenses.



Applicants' Legal Analysis and Conditions



1. Applicants request that the Commission, pursuant to Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act, grant the exemptions from Sections
26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act in connection with Applicants' assessment of the daily charge for the mortality
and expense risks under the Contracts. Applicants state that the terms of the relief requested with respect to the
Contracts funded by the Accounts are consistent with the standards enumerated in Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act. Applicants
state that without the requested relief, they would have to request and obtain exemptive relief for each Other Account
funding Contracts. Applicants assert that these additional requests for exemptive relief would present no issues
under the 1940 Act not already addressed in this application. Additionally, Applicants note that the requested relief
is consistent with the authority of the Commission, pursuant to Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act, to issue exemptive orders
to a class or classes of persons or transactions. Finally, Applicants note that, in connection with future contracts
and future separate accounts, the Commission previously has granted exemptive relief, similar to that requested
by Applicants, from the provisions of Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act.

2. Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act, in pertinent part, prohibit a registered unit investment trust
and any depositor thereof or underwriter therefor from selling periodic payment plan certificates unless the proceeds
of all payments (other than sales load) are deposited with a qualified bank as trustee or custodian and held under arrangements
which prohibit any payment to the depositor or principal underwriter except a fee, not exceeding such reasonable
amount as the Commission may prescribe, for performing bookkeeping and other administrative services of a character
normally performed by the bank itself.
3. Applicants assert that the charge for mortality and expense risks is reasonable compensation for the risks assumed.

4. Applicants represent that the charge of 1.15% for the mortality and expense risks assumed by the Companies is within
the range of industry practice with respect to comparable annuity products. Applicants state that this representation
is based upon the Companies' analysis of publicly available information regarding similar variable annuity contracts,
taking into consideration such factors as: the rating of the company; the size of the company; and, the type of retirement
program for which the annuity is intended. Applicants represent that each of the Companies will maintain at its principal
office, available to the Commission, a memorandum setting forth in detail the variable annuity products analyzed
and the methodology and results of the Companies' comparative review.


5. Applicants acknowledge that the Sales Charge may be insufficient to cover all costs relating to the distribution
of the Contracts. To the extent distribution costs are not covered by the Sales Charge, each of the Companies will recover
its distribution costs from the assets of its respective general account. These assets may include gains from either
operations with respect to the Contracts or from charges imposed under the Contracts. Applicants represent that
the Companies have concluded that there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed distribution financing arrangement
will benefit the Accounts and the owners of the Contracts. The basis for such conclusion is set forth in a memorandum
which will be maintained by each Company at its principal office and will be made available to the Commission.

6. The Companies also represent that the Accounts will invest only in management investment companies which undertake,
in the event such company adopts a plan under Rule 12b-1 of the 1940 Act to finance distribution expenses, to have
such plan formulated and approved by either the company's board of directors or the board of trustees, as applicable,
a majority of whom are not interested persons of such company within the meaning of the 1940 Act.



Conclusion



Applicants assert that for the reasons and upon the facts set forth above, the requested exemptions from Sections
26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act are necessary and appropriate in the public interest and consistent with
the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act.






For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority.

General Utilities Corp. (70-8455)



General Public Utilities Corporation (``GPU''), 100 Interpace Parkway, Parsippany, New Jersey, 07054, a registered
holding company, has filed a declaration under Sections 6(a), 7, and 32 of the Act and Rules 53 and 54 thereunder.

GPU proposes to issue and sell for cash from time to time through December 31, 1996 up to 5 million additional shares
of common stock, par value $2.50 per share (``Additional Common Stock''). GPU would issue and sell the Additional
Common Stock to the public from time to time either through (i) one or more negotiated transactions with one or more
underwriters or (ii) one or more agents who regularly engage in the sale or placement of securities pursuant to an agreement,
or (iii) a combination of the above.

In addition, GPU might sell Additional Common Stock to an agent, as principal, for resale directly or indirectly to
the public. It is anticipated that such sales would be made from time to time in one or more market transactions in the
New York Stock Exchange or in regional exchanges in which GPU common stock might be traded, in block transactions in
such exchanges or in fixed-price offers off the floor of such exchanges or other such special-type offers or distributions
made in accordance with the rules of such exchanges.

GPU has a total of 150 million authorized shares of common stock, of which 115,079,626 shares have been issued. In addition,
GPU has 10,703,712 reacquired shares. The Additional Common Stock would be sold either from authorized and unissued
shares or reacquired shares.

The issuance and sale of Additional Common Stock would not be subject to preemptive rights of present stockholders
by virtue of Article 9(a) of the Articles of Incorporation for GPU, which provides no preemptive rights with respect
to an issuance and sale of GPU common stock solely for money and through, 

inter alia

, a public offering or an offering to or through underwriters or dealers.

GPU will utilize the net proceeds of the sale of Additional Common Stock to make cash capital contributions, as authorized
by Commission orders dated March 6, 1992 (HCAR No. 25486) and March 25, 1994 (HCAR No. 26011), to its electric public
utility subsidiary companies_Jersey Central Power & Light Company, Metropolitan Edison Company and Pennsylvania
Electric Company (``Subsidiaries''). The Subsidiaries will use such funds (i) to repay indebtedness, (ii) to redeem
senior securities in accordance with the optional redemption provisions thereof, (iii) for construction, (iv)
for other corporate purposes, or (v) to reimburse their treasuries for funds previously expended therefrom for such
purposes. A portion of such net proceeds might also be used to reimburse GPU for funds previously expended to make capital
contributions, to repay GPU indebtedness, and for other GPU corporate purposes, which include direct or indirect
acquisition of interests in exempt wholesale generators and foreign utility companies.

On June 30, 1994, the consolidated capitalization ratios of GPU were approximately 43.9% for Long-Term Debt, 5.4%
for Preferred Stock, 43.8% for Common Stock, and 6.9% for Short-Term Debt.

The reported closing price of GPU common stock on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Tape on August 15, 1994 was $26.125
per share. If all of the Additional Common Stock were sold at that price, at June 30, 1994, the consolidated capitalization
ratios of GPU would be approximately 43.0% for Long-Term Debt; 5.2% for Preferred Stock; 45.0% for Common Stock; and
6.8% for Short-Term Debt. GPU has targeted a common equity ratio of between 45.0% and 48.0%.

In the quarter that ended June 30, 1994, GPU wrote off (after tax) $191.6 million, or $1.66 per share, as a result of a
decision by the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court that disallowed the recovery from customers by Metropolitan Edison
Company of certain future costs associated with Three Mile Island Unit No. 2 and restructuring charges associated
with a GPU retirement program, and as a result of another Commonwealth Court decision that disallowed deferral of
certain post-retirement benefit costs.

The effect of these write-offs will severely restrict the ability of Metropolitan Edison Company and Pennsylvania
Electric Company to issue senior securities during the next twelve months. GPU believes that restoration of its equity
capitalization, particularly in light of the emerging competitive business environment in the electric utility
industry, is necessary in order to maintain the current credit ratings of the Subsidiaries.



Columbia Gas System, Inc., et al. (70-8471)



Columbia Gas System, Inc. (``Columbia''), a registered holding company, and seventeen wholly-owned distribution,
transmission, exploration and development, and other subsidiary companies,
 all of which are engaged in the natural gas business, have filed an application-declaration under Sections 6, 7, 9(a),
10, 12(b), 12(c), and 12(f) of the Act and Rules 42, 43, 45, and 46 thereunder.

Columbia, and fourteen of the subsidiary companies (``Subsidiaries''),
 seek Commission authorization for the recapitalization of Columbia Gulf, Columbia Development, and Columbia Coal
(``Recapitalization Subsidiaries''), the 1995 and 1996 Long-Term and Short-Term Financing Programs of the Subsidiaries,
and continuation of the Intrasystem Money Pool (``Money Pool'') through 1996.





Prior to July 31, 1991, almost all external financing for Columbia and the Subsidiaries (``System'') had been through
public equity and debt offerings, short-term borrowings from banks, and sales of commercial paper. The proceeds
were provided to the Subsidiaries on comparable terms through purchases of debt or equity, through open-account
advances, or through the Money Pool.

Columbia and Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (``Columbia Transmission''), in consequence of significant
financial difficulties related to the purchase of high-cost gas under long-term contracts, sought protection under
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (``Code'') in July 1991. Thereafter, Columbia negotiated debtor-in-possession
(``DIP'') financing in order to fund the operations of its subsidiaries besides Columbia Transmission. Columbia
Transmission negotiated its own DIP financing.

An order that approved a $275 million Secured Revolving Credit Facility for Columbia (``DIP Facility'') was granted
by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (``Bankruptcy Court'') in September 1991. The Commission
approved the DIP Facility by order dated September 21, 1991 (HCAR No. 25380). Orders approving amendments to the DIP
Facility, which improved its terms and reduced its available amount to $100 million, were granted by the Bankruptcy
Court in May 1993 and in August 1994. The Commission approved the amendments by orders dated June 11, 1993 (HCAR No.
25828) and September 12, 1994 (HCAR No. 26120).

Columbia and the Recapitalization Subsidiaries seek Commission authorization for the recapitalization of Columbia
Gulf, Columbia Development and Columbia Coal on or about December 31, 1994 to establish capital structures that are
more appropriate for current business and economic conditions. The proposed transactions and the goals for the Recapitalization
Subsidiaries were approved by the Bankruptcy Court in July 1994.

With respect to Columbia Gulf, the goal is to bring its long-term debt-equity ratio to 45/55. It is proposed to (i) issue
Installment Promissory Notes (``Installment Notes'') of up to $67 million to Columbia for cash; (ii) reduce the par
value of its common stock from $25 per share to $10 per share (in order to create approximately $90 million in additional
paid in capital; and (iii) pay a dividend of up to $67 million to Columbia out of surplus. The dividend would approximate
the dollar amount of Installment Notes issued. It is stated that the proposed increase in the debt service of Columbia
Gulf can be supported from cash flow from its operations.

With respect to Columbia Development, the goal is to bring its long-term debt-equity ratio to 40/60. It is proposed
for Columbia to make a tax-free capital contribution of up to $62 million of Installment Notes previously issued by
Columbia Development and held by Columbia. The transaction proposed would be similar to that approved by the Commission
by order dated December 11, 1992 (HCAR No. 25703).

With respect to Columbia Coal, the goal is to bring its long-term debt-equity ratio to 40/60. It is proposed that Columbia
make a tax-free capital contribution of up to $12 million of Installment Notes previously issued by Columbia Coal
and held by Columbia.

Sources of funds for the Subsidiaries will include their internal cash flow and Money Pool borrowings. No external
sources are projected to be needed to fund their 1995 and 1996 financing programs while Columbia remains in bankruptcy.

The Subsidiaries plan to finance part of their capital expenditure programs with funds generated from internal sources
and through short-term borrowings from the Money Pool, to the extent Columbia subsidiaries have temporary excess
funds, or from the sale to Columbia, for cash, of common stock at par value and Installment Notes up to the specified
amounts (in million $$):






These amounts allow for contingencies such as higher gas prices, warm weather, amounts of projected tax refunds,
amounts of rate refunds and the variability of capital expenditure programs. To the extent that such contingencies
do not materialize, the requested financing authorizations will not be fully utilized.

The Installment Notes will be unsecured and will be dated the date of their issue. It is proposed that the interest rate
on the Installment Notes will be determined quarterly based upon the three-month average yield on newly issued ``A''
rated 25-30 year utility bonds, per the weekly Bond Market Roundup published by Salomon Brothers, rounded to
the nearest 1/8% per annum (``Benchmark Rate''). The Benchmark Rate would be used for all Installment Notes issued
in the subsequent quarter. The Benchmark Rate was approved by the Commission by order dated September 30, 1994 (HCAR
No. 26062) (``1993 Order'').

It is proposed that a default rate equal to 2% per annum in excess of the stated rate on unpaid principal or interest amounts
would be assessed if any interest or principal payment becomes past due. The principal amount of the Installment Notes
will be repaid over a term not in excess of thirty years. All of the Installment Notes will be purchased by Columbia on
or before December 31, 1996.

The Subsidiaries require short-term funds to meet normal capital requirements. It is proposed that the Subsidiaries
borrow short-term funds from the Money Pool in amounts specified below (in million $$):









Advances from the Money Pool will be limited to a maximum amount outstanding at any one time from January 1, 1995 through
December 31, 1996. It is proposed that the Money Pool, which was last approved by the Commission in the 1993 Order, be
continued through December 31, 1996. All short-term borrowing will be through the Money Pool, with the Service Corporation
as agent. Columbia may invest in the Money Pool but will not borrow from the Money Pool.


When Columbia and the subsidiaries generate cash in excess of their immediate cash requirements, such temporary
excess cash may be invested in the Money Pool. Columbia and investing subsidiaries would be investors (``Investors'')
pursuant to a Money Pool evidence of a deposit. Loans to the Subsidiaries (``Borrowers'') through the Money Pool will
be made pursuant to a short-term grid note. Such short-term grid notes will be due upon demand by the Investors but not
later than April 30, 1997. The loans will be allocated to the Investors based on the proportion of their relative investment
in the Money Pool.




The cost of money on all short-term advances from, and the investment rate for funds invested in, the Money Pool will
be the interest rate per annum equal to its weighted average short-term investment rate. Should there be no Money Pool
investments, the cost of money will be the average Federal Funds rate for the prior month published in the Federal Reserve
Statistical Release. A default rate equal to 2% per annum above the pre-default rate on unpaid principal or interest
amounts will be assessed if any interest or principal payment becomes past due.



CINergy Corp. (70-8477)






CINergy Corp. (``CINergy''), 139 East Fourth Street, Cincinnati, Ohio 45202, a Delaware corporation not currently
subject to the Act, has filed a declaration under sections 6(a), 7, and 12(b) of the Act and rules 45 and 54 thereunder.


CINergy seeks authorization to issue and sell up to eight million shares of its common stock, par value .01, in one or
more issuances, from time to time, prior to December 31, 1995 following the proposed combination of Cincinnati Gas
& Electric Company (``CG&E'') and PSI Resources, Inc. (``PSI'') and the registration of CINergy as a holding
company. The proposed combination of CG&E and PSI is currently before the Commission in file number 70-8427.
CINergy is requesting authorization in the event that a contemplated issuance of eight million shares of PSI common
stock is not consummated prior to the proposed merger of CG&E and PSI. CINergy proposes to sell the shares in one
of four ways: (1) through the solicitation of proposals of underwriters or dealers; (2) through underwriters or dealers
on a negotiated basis; (3) directly to a limited number of purchasers or to a single purchaser; or (4) through agents.




In addition, CINergy requests authority to contribute up to $160 million of the net proceeds from the sale of such shares
to the equity capital of its then electric public-utility subsidiary company, PSI Energy, Inc. (``PSI Energy'').
CINergy states that PSI Energy would use the funds for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of short-term
indebtedness incurred for construction financing.

<ACTION>
action:

 Notice of Application for Exemption under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``Act'').





applicants:

 ML Venture Partners II, L.P. (``MLVP II''), Merrill Lynch Venture Capital Inc. (the ``Management Company''), and
DLJ Capital Corporation (``DLJ Capital'').



relevant act sections:

 Order requested under sections 17(d) and 57(a)(4) of the Act and rule 17d-1 thereunder authorizing transactions
that are otherwise prohibited under section 57(a)(4), under section 57(c) exempting applicants from section 57(a)(1)
of the Act, and under section 6(c) of the Act to amend a prior SEC order.


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary of application:

 Applicants request an order that would permit MLVP II to co-invest with DLJ Capital in shares of Corporate Express,
Inc. and amend a prior order (the ``Prior Order'')
 by modifying a condition of that order.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information:

 The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.


Applicants' Representations


1. MLVP II, a limited partnership organized under the laws of Delaware, is a business development company under the
Act. MLVP II has five general partners, consisting of four individuals (the ``Individual General Partners'') and
one managing general partner, MLVP II Co., L.P. (the ``Managing General Partner''). The Individual General Partners
include three independent general partners (defined to be individuals who are not ``interested persons'' of MLVP
II within the meaning of section 2(a)(19) of the Act) (the ``Independent General Partners'') and one general partner
who is an individual and who is an affiliated person of the Managing General Partner.
2. The Management Company is an indirect subsidiary of Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. (``ML & Co.''). The Management
Company performs or arranges for management and administrative services for MLVP II. MLVP II, the Managing General
Partner, and the Management Company have retained DLJ Capital Management Corporation (the ``Sub-Manager'') to
provide management services in connection with the venture capital investments of MLVP II. The Sub-Manager is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of DLJ Capital, which in turn is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, Inc. (``DLJ'').
DLJ is a subsidiary of the Equitable Companies Inc. The Managing General Partner, the Management Company, and the
Sub-Manager are registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.


A. The Corporate Express Transactions


1. Corporate Express is a privately held distributor of office supplies and products. In 1991, the Management Company,
on behalf of MLVP II, and certain entities managed by DLJ Capital (the ``DLJ Companies'') acquired shares of Corporate
Express. MLVP II could not hold shares of Corporate Express at that time since co-investments with the DLJ Companies
may have violated certain provisions of the Act. In 1992, the SEC issued an exemptive order (the ``Blanket Order'')
 that permitted co-investments between MLVP II and the DLJ Companies. After receiving the Blanket Order, MLVP II made
its initial investment in Corporate Express by acquiring from the Management Company the Corporate Express shares
held on its behalf.

2. In November 1993, Corporate Express purchased Hanson Office Products, a division of Hanson Industries, Inc.,
for $163 million. DLJ Securities Corporation (``DLJ Securities''), a wholly-owned subsidiary of DLJ, participated
in structuring the terms of the acquisition on behalf of Corporate Express. Corporate Express financed the acquisition
through the sales of senior subordinated notes and equity securities. In connection with this financing, Corporate
Express approached its existing shareholders regarding follow-on equity investments, including MLVP II and the
DLJ Companies. In addition, because of the services DLJ Securities provided in the acquisition, Corporate Express
offered DLJ Securities a portion of the financing on the same terms as MLVP II and the DLJ Companies. DLJ Capital subsequently
acquired the investment in Corporate Express on behalf of DLJ Securities. 
3. Consistent with the Blanket Order, the Sub-Manager reviewed MLVP II's funds available for investment and its current
investment in Corporate Express. Following the review, the Sub-Manager recommended that MLVP II invest $1.07 million
in Corporate Express, bringing MLVP II's aggregate investment in it to $3 million. At the same time, DLJ Capital reviewed
the funds available for investment by the DLJ Companies. DLJ Capital determined that the DLJ Companies should invest
an additional $11 million. Corporate Express subsequently informed DLJ Capital and the Sub-Manager that the aggregate
equity investment available to MLVP II and the DLJ Companies would be $9 million. Of this $9 million, MLVP II was allocated
the entire amount is sought to invest and the DLJ Companies were allocated the remaining $7.3 million. 

4. On January 24, 1994, consistent with the terms of the Blanket Order, the Individual General Partners unanimously
approved the follow-on investment by MLVP II in Corporate Express. However, MLVP II was not able to acquire the Corporate
Express securities at that time because the terms of the Blanket Order do not permit MLVP II to co-invest with DLJ Capital,
which currently holds DLJ Securities' investment in Corporate Express. Accordingly, the Management Company agreed
to purchase and hold the 194,545 shares of series B convertible preferred stock offered to MLVP II. The Management
Company will sell these shares to MLVP II if the requested exemptive relief is granted. 



B. Amendment of the Prior Order 



1. As a separate condition made applicable to MLVP II under the Prior Order, MLVP II may not have more than 45% of its assets
invested jointly with all affiliates, except as expressly permitted in an order issued by the SEC or as a higher percentage
may result from appreciation rather than acquisition of assets the ``45% Limit''). The Blanket Order exempts co-investments
made pursuant to that order from the 45% Limit. 
2. MLVP II requests an amendment to the 45% Limit to clarify that the limit does not impact its disposition of portfolio
securities and the distribution of proceeds to MLVP II partners. MLVP II is in the seventh year of its ten year term and
is actively considering exit strategies for its portfolio investments. 



Applicants' Legal Analysis 



A. Corporate Express Transactions 



1. Section 57(a)(4) of the Act prohibits certain affiliated persons specified in section 57(b) from participating
in joint transactions with a business development company in contravention of rules and regulations prescribed
by the SEC. Rule 17d-1 under the Act applies to section 57(a)(4) transactions through section 57(i). Rule 17d-1
prohibits affiliated persons of a registered investment company from entering into joint transactions with the
investment company unless the SEC has granted an order permitting such transaction. 

2. The persons listed in section 57(b)(2) include a person who is, within the meaning the section 2(a)(3)(C) of the
Act, an affiliated person of an investment adviser of a business development company. DLJ Capital owns 100% of the
capital stock of the Sub-Manager, which is an investment adviser to MLVP II. MLVP II believes that the Sub-Manager
is controlled by DLJ Capital. Thus, DLJ Capital is a person specified in section 57(b)(2) and may not engage in a joint
investment with MLV II.

<PARENT> FR941020-2-00083 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

3. Section 57(a)(1) of the Act prohibits certain persons specified in section 57(b) from selling securities to a business
development company. Section 57(c) of the Act provides that the SEC may exempt a person from section 57(a)(1) under
certain circumstances. The Management Company may be a person specified in section 57(b) and thus, sales of securities
on a principal basis by the Management Company to MLVP II are prohibited by section 57(a)(1) and cannot be effected
unless an order is obtained pursuant to section 57(c). 
4. Applicants believe that the proposed co-investment with DLJ Capital and the acquisition by MLVP II of the Corporate
Express securities held by the Management Company on MLVP II's behalf meet the statutory standards set forth in the
Act. 


B. Amendment to the Prior Order 


1. Section 6(c) permits the SEC to exempt any person, security, or transaction from any provisions of the Act if and
to the extent the exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection
of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. 
2. The Prior Order does not indicate whether upon the disposition of portfolio securities MLVP II must observe the
45% Limits. The requested amendment would clarify that the 45% Limit does not impact its disposition of portfolio
securities. MLVP II believes that the requested amendment would place a limit on the extent that capital of MLVP II
can be committed to joint transactions as of the time of an investment while recognizing that the liquidation of investments
should occur in a manner so as to maximize returns to investors. MLVP II believes the requested relief meets the section
6(c) standards. The requested amendment would not affect condition 2(b) of the Blanket Order which limits co-investments
with ``DLJ Investors'' to 25% of MLVP II's initial capital. 


Applicants' Conditions 


Applicants agree that the terms of relief are subject to the following conditions: 
1. The Sub-Manager will review the proposed investment by MLVP II. The Sub-Manager will provide a written report to
the Independent General Partners setting forth its valuation of the investment and its recommendations as to the
acquisition of the investment, based upon its analysis of all factors it considers relevant. 
2. Upon issuance of the order requested, MLVP II may acquire the Corporate Express securities held by the Management
Company on MLVP II's behalf (the ``Securities'') from the Management Company provided that all of the findings and
other actions required in subsections (d)(i) through (iv) of condition one of the Blanket Order
 are met after receipt of the order and before the purchase of the Securities. The purchase price to be paid by MLVP II
for the Securities shall be carrying costs (as described below) plus the lesser of (a) the fair value of the securities
on the date acquired by MLVP II (as determined by the Independent General Partners, who may rely for this purpose on
information proved by the Sub-Manager), or (b) the cost to the Management Company of purchasing the Securities (``Cost'').
To the extent the value of the Securities is determined by the Independent General Partners to be less than Cost plus
carrying costs, the Management Company may determine not to sell the Securities to MLVP II. 




3. Carrying costs shall be calculated from the date the Management Company acquired the proposed investment on behalf
of MLVP II to the date of the acquisition of the proposed investment by MLVP II from the Management Company and shall
consist of interest charges computed at the lower of (a) the prime commercial lending rate charged by Citibank, N.A.,
during the period for which carrying costs are permitted to be paid until MLVP II acquires the Securities or (b) the
effective costs of borrowings by ML & Co. during such period. The effective costs of borrowings by ML & Co.
is its actual ``average costs of funds,'' which it calculates on a monthly basis by dividing its consolidated financing
expenses by the total amount of borrowings during this period. 
4. For the purpose of conditions 2(b), 5, and 6 of the Blanket Order, DLJ Capital shall be considered a DLJ Investor so
long as MLVP II and DLJ Capital both hold securities of Corporate Express. 
5. MLVP II will maintain at its office written records concerning the purchase of Corporate Express series B convertible
preferred stock, including a copy of the written report prepared by the Sub-Manager and written records of the factors
considered by the Independent General Partners in approving such investment. 
6. MLVP II will not have at the time of acquisition of a joint investment more than 45 percent of its assets invested jointly
with all affiliates unless otherwise permitted by an order of the SEC. In addition, MLVP II will not make any new venture
capital investments, other than follow-on investment in existing portfolio companies.

</ACTION>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Incident to the Federal Aviation Drug Enforcement Assistance Act, Section 501(h) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958,
as amended (49 App. U.S.C. 1301, et seq.) directs the Administrator to address certain deficiencies in the aircraft
registration system relating to fictitious addresses. Subsection 3 of  501(h) determines that the use of a
post office box or ``mail drop'' as a return address is a deficiency in the system.



Accordingly, the Administrator will address this deficiency by no longer accepting Aircraft Registration Applications,
AC Form 8050-1, unless a physical location or physical address is shown in the address portion of the Application.
This does not preclude listing a post office box or mail drop as a secondary address for mailing purposes.

In the alternative, if the applicant receives mail at a post office box or ``mail drop,'' the physical location or physical
address may be shown directly underneath the name of the applicant (above the required telephone number) and the post
office box or ``mail drop'' shown in the address portion of the Application.

Requests to furnish a physical location or physical address will be mailed to all current registered owners of aircraft
whose Certificates of Registration bear only a post office box or ``mail drop'' address.

<DOCTITLE>Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC)</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of establishment of the Single Engine-IMC-with passengers ARAC Working Group.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Notice is given of the establishment by the Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee of an ARAC working group to examine
the feasibility of conducting single-engine passenger carrying operations in instrument meteorological conditions
(IMC) under Part 135 of the Federal Aviation Regulations. This notice informs the public of the activities of the ARAC
and seeks the public's participation.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has established an Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC) (56
FR 2190, January 22, 1991; and 58 FR 9230, February 19, 1993). One area that the ARAC deals with is air carrier operations.
Other working groups in this area have dealt with issues such as autopilot takeoff minimum altitudes, fuel requirements,
controlled rest on the flight deck, noise abatement, and flight crewmember flight/rest/duty requirements. The
Single Engine-IMC-with passengers Working Group is being established to evaluate the safety aspects and overall
feasibility of allowing passenger carrying operations in IMC with single engine aircraft. The Single Engine-IMC-with
passengers Working Group will forward its recommendations to the ARAC, which will then determine whether to forward
them to the FAA.


Specifically, the Working Group's task is as follows:
(1) Review the Canadian policy authorizing single engine IMC operations in turbine-powered airplanes and make recommendations
for adoption.
(2) Re-examine existing policies for commercial IMC and/or night operations by single-engine aircraft.
(3) Determine the conditions and/or limitations which should be met before commercial air transport IMC and/or night
operations by single-engine aircraft could be permitted.
(4) When considering the applicability of such operations, include both airplanes and helicopters (both turbine
and reciprocating engines), passenger carriage (FAA), passenger/cargo carriage (JAA).
(5) Consider and dispose of any petitions for rulemaking or exemption on this subject.

<PARENT> FR941020-2-00087 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(6) If, after completing the review, changes are recommended, develop and submit any needed advisory material or
notice of proposed rulemaking in final form.

The Working Group should recommend time line(s) for completion of the task, including the rationale, for consideration
at the meeting of the ARAC to consider air carrier operations issues held following publication of this notice.

The Working Group will give a status report on the task at each meeting of the ARAC held to consider air carrier operations
issues.

The Single Engine-IMC-with passengers Working Group will be comprised of experts from those organizations having
an interest in the tasks assigned. A Working Group member need not necessarily be a representative of one of the member
organizations of the ARAC. Individuals who have expertise in the subject and wish to become a member of the Working
Group should write the person listed under the caption 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT 

expressing that desire, describing their interest in the task, and the expertise they would bring to the Working Group.
The request will be reviewed with the ARAC Assistant Chair for Air Carrier Operations and the Chair of the Single Engine-IMC-with
passengers Working Group, and the individual will be advised whether or not the request can be accommodated.

The Secretary of Transportation has determined that the formation and use of the ARAC are necessary in the public interest
in connection with the performance of duties of the FAA by law. Meetings of the ARAC to consider air carrier operations
issues will be open to the public except as authorized by section 10(d) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Meetings
of the Single Engine-IMC-with passengers Working Group will not be open to the public except to the extent that individuals
with an interest and expertise are selected to participate. No public announcement of Working Group meetings will
be made.
