<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Rural Electrification Administration (REA) is 
amending its regulations on telecommunications standards and 
specification for materials, equipment and construction by 
codifying REA's specification for outside plant housings and 
serving area interface systems. The new specification informs 
manufacturers and users of outside plant housings and serving 
area interface systems of the engineering and technical 
requirements that are considered necessary for satisfactory 
performance in outside plant environments. A significant 
requirement of the specification involves the changing of the 
bonding and grounding system associated with outside plant 
housings from a 14 gauge system to a 6 gauge system. The change 
to the 6 gauge bonding and grounding system will help to assure 
that REA housings will be manufactured in compliance with 
recognized industry safety standards which will result in 
improved electrical protection of outside plant telephone 
equipment, craft personnel, and the public to hazardous voltages.

Background 


REA issues publications titled ``Bulletin'' which serve to guide 
borrowers regarding already codified policy, procedures, and 
requirements needed to manage loans, loan guarantee programs, and 
the security instruments which provide for and secure REA 
financing. REA issues standards and specifications for the 
construction of telephone facilities financed with REA loan 
funds. 
REA has rescinded REA Bulletin 345-26, REA Specification for 
Buried Plant Housings, PE-35, dated July 23, 1976, and REA 
Bulletin 345-77, REA Specification for Serving Area Interface 
Housings, PE-79, dated January 24, 1978. REA is incorporating and updating the information previously contained
in 
those bulletins in 7 CFR 1755.910, REA Specification for Outside 
Plant Housings and Serving Area Interface Systems. 
The specification contains mechanical, electrical, and 
environmental requirements, desired design features, and test 
methods for evaluation of outside plant housings and serving area 
interface systems. 
The test procedures described in the specification are 
required to demonstrate the functional reliability of outside 
plant housings and serving area interface systems. The test 
procedures satisfy the requirements of housings as well as the 
requirements of terminals that may be installed within housings. 
Outside plant housings are fabricated of either metallic or 
nonmetallic materials in different sizes and configurations to 
suit a variety of applications. The purpose of a housing is to 
protect its contents from environmental elements, rodents, 
insects, or vandalism and unauthorized access. Outside plant 
housings accommodate cable splices, bonding and grounding 
connections, cable terminals, cross-connect facilities, load 
coils, and optical and electronic equipment. 
Serving area interface systems serve as the connecting 
terminal between feeder cable and distribution cables.

A significant requirement of 7 CFR 1755.910 involves the 
changing of the bonding and grounding system of outside plant 
housings from a 14 gauge system to a 6 gauge system. The change 
to the 6 gauge bonding and grounding system in the housings will 
help to assure that REA housings will be manufactured in 
compliance with recognized industry safety standards that are 
considered critical to the protection of outside plant telephone 
equipment, craft personnel, and the public. 



Comments 



On September 1, 1993, REA published a proposed rule at 58 FR 
46110 on 7 CFR 1755.910, REA Specification for Outside Plant 
Housings and Serving Area Interface Systems. Comments on this 
proposed rule were due October 1, 1993. Comments and 
recommendations were received from several companies by this 
date. The comments, recommendations and responses are summarized 
as follows: 

One respondent recommended that paragraph (d)(3)(xxx) of this 
section be changed to allow the use of locknuts as well as nuts 
with captive lock washers. 

Response: REA has reviewed the recommendation. The 
requirement for the captive studs and nuts with captive lock 
washers was initiated in a letter to all Telephone Borrowers by 
Mr. Michael M.F. Liu, Acting Administrator, dated April 24, 
1992. Captive studs and nuts with captive lock washers replaced 
the spade clip and terminal as the means for grounding and have 
proven to be very efficient. Because of concern that the locknut 
will become loose after repeated lifting of ground connections on 
cables that require frequent locating, REA will not change the 
requirement in this paragraph. 

One respondent recommended that paragraph (d)(6)(v) be 
modified to add color 4.4GY 6.74/1.5 under the gray-green color. 

Response: REA has reviewed the recommendation and as a result 
of the review will add color 4.4GY 6.74/1.5 under the gray-green 
color as proposed by the commenter. 

Several clarifying and editorial changes in paragraphs 
(d)(3)(v), (d)(3)(vii), and (d)(3)(xiii) were made in response to 
comments from two respondents. These changes did not alter the 
intent or technical requirements of the affected paragraphs.

 1755.910 


REA specification for outside plant housings and 
serving area interface systems. 



(a) 

Scope. 

(1) The purpose of this specification is to 
inform manufacturers and users of outside plant housings and 
serving area interface (SAI) systems of the engineering and 
technical requirements that are considered necessary for 
satisfactory performance in outside plant environments. Included 
are the mechanical, electrical, and environmental requirements, 
desired design features, and test methods for evaluation of the 
product. 

(2) The housing and terminal requirements reflect the best 
engineering judgment available at the present time and may be 
subject to change due to advances in technology, economic 
conditions, or other factors. 

(3) The test procedures described in this section are 
required by REA to demonstrate the functional reliability of the 
product. However, other standard or unique test procedures may 
serve the same function. In such cases, REA shall evaluate the 
test procedures and results on an individual basis. 

(4) The test procedures specified herein satisfy the 
requirements of housings as well as the requirements of terminals 
that may be installed within housings. Some of the requirements 
are interrelated to several tests designed to determine the 
performance aspects of terminals and are directly affected by 
testing required for housings. Therefore, the manufacturer 
should carefully review all the test requirements in order to 
develop a testing schedule that is comprehensive, efficient in 
terms of the number of test specimens required and can be 
accomplished in an orderly and logical sequence. 

(5) The specified tests may require special facilities to 
comply with Federal, State, or local regulatory requirements. 
Some test procedures are potentially hazardous to personnel 
because of the high voltages and mechanical forces involved. 
Safety precautions are necessary to prevent injury.

(b) 

General information. 

(1) Outside plant housings are 
fabricated of either metallic or nonmetallic materials in 
different sizes and configurations to suit a variety of 
applications. The purpose of a housing is to protect its 
contents from environmental elements, rodents, insects, or 
vandalism and unauthorized access. Housings are designed with 
internal brackets for accommodating splicing, bonding and 
grounding connections, cable terminals, cross-connect facilities, 
load coils, and optical and electronic equipment. 

(2) Pedestals are housings primarily intended to house, 
organize, and protect cable terminations incorporating terminal 
blocks, splice connectors and modules, ground lugs and load 
coils. Activities typically performed in a pedestal are cable 
splicing, shield bonding and grounding, inductive loading, and 
connection of subscriber drops. 

(3) Serving area interface (SAI) cabinets are housings 
intended to perform some of the same functions as pedestals but 
are primarily intended to serve as the connecting terminal 
between feeder cable and distribution cables.

usually comparable to that of a rectangular column or cylinder, 
with the shape of any particular housing being left to the 
manufacturer's discretion. Each design is subject to acceptance 
by REA. 
(2) 

Housing types and capacities. 

(i) Housings used in 
outside plant are either the smaller housings generally known as 
pedestals or larger housings known as equipment or splice 
cabinets. Both categories may have designs intended for stake 
mounting, pole mounting, or pad mounting. 
(ii) The classifications of pedestals are the general purpose 
channel Type (H) and the dome Type (M). The Type H pedestal has 
either front only access or back and front access while the Type 
M pedestal has top only access. Pedestals are further designated 
as follows: 





(iii) The minimum volume associated with the pedestal 
designations shall be as shown in the following table:

<TEXT>
 

(iv) Equipment cabinets intended for use as SAI housings shall be assigned size designations according to their maximum
pair termination capacities. The capacity will vary depending on the type of terminating equipment used. SAI cabinets
shall be suffix designated with an ``A'' for pole mounting, ``X'' for pad mounting, and ``S'' for stake mounting. 

(v) Large pair count splice cabinets are classified according to their splice capacity. Approximately 48 cm3 (3.0
in.3) of splice area per pair straight spliced shall be permitted. 

(vi) The minimum volume associated with large pair count splice cabinets shall be as shown in the following table:






(3) 

Design and fabrication requirements for housings. 

(i) Type H pedestal housings may consist of an enclosed channel incorporating an integrally mounted stake that serves
as a backplate, or they may be designed for universal mounting on stakes or poles. The body of the housing shall have
two major components; an upper cover and a base cover. The upper cover shall have a top, front and back plate with the
front cover removable to permit entry and provide increased work space. The base cover shall consist of a front plate
and back plate. The base cover back plate may be an extension of the upper back plate cover. 

(ii) Type M pedestal housings shall consist of a one piece upper sleeve designed to fit over the base cover trapping
air to prohibit water from entering the splice area when installed in locations prone to temporary flooding. Pedestals
designed to be mounted extra high on poles for locations susceptible to deep snow shall have a bottom close-off option
available to prohibit the ingress of birds, rodents and insects.

(iii) The external housing components on all outside plant housings shall provide reasonable protection against
accidental removal or vandalism. Housings shall be equipped with a cover plate retaining bolt and cup washer that
may be opened only with an industry accepted socket type can wrench. Housings may be equipped with provisions to allow
the purchaser to install a padlock.

(iv) Installed housings shall resist the disassembling force of frost heaving applied to the bottom of ground line
cover plates. The base cover must remain stationary to stabilize the contents of the housing cavity.

(v) In an effort to provide protection against dust penetration, blowing snow, rain, and ultraviolet light degradation
of internal components, all mechanical gaps shall be restricted. The use of seals, overlaps, gaskets, and/or dovetailing
is required to assure satisfactory protection of housed equipment. 

(vi) Knockouts, cutouts, or notches designed to accommodate aerial service drops shall not be permitted. A design
option for housings intended to accommodate service drops shall include a separate channel or equivalent in the base
cover to allow future additions of service drops without the removal of gravel or the moisture barrier in the base of
the housing. Service wire channels must be designed to prevent the entry of birds, reptiles, rodents and insects.


(vii) Minimal venting of SAI housings may be necessary to relieve internal pressure and condensation. 

(viii) There shall be no aluminum housing components that will become buried in the soil when the housing is properly
installed. 

(ix) Housing components may be assembled using rivets, welds, glue, bolts and nuts, or other techniques suitable
for the materials involved. 

(x) Housings and their components that require field assembly must be capable of being assembled with tools normally
available to outside plant technicians. 

(xi) Hinged doors on SAI housings and large pair count splice housings shall be equipped with a device that restrains
the doors in the open position. 

(xii) Outside plant housings shall be free of sharp edges, burrs, etc., that could present a safety hazard to personnel
involved in installation and use of the product or to the general public. Surfaces inside housings must not allow pinching
of conductors during installation of cover plates or the opening and closing of doors. 

(xiii) A ground line mark shall be provided, approximately 15 cm (6 in.) below the top edge of the housing base cover
plate on housings intended for ground level mounting. Base cover plates shall have a minimum height of 31 cm (12 in.).

Functional design criteria for binding post terminal blocks used in SAI cabinets

_(1) 

General description.

 A conventional binding post terminal consists of a metallic element or post, one end of which is configured for the
permanent connection of 22, 24, or 26 AWG solid copper conductors and the opposite end is configured for recurring
connections and disconnections of solid copper cross-connect wire using a threaded screw or stud and nut combination
for gripping the wire. 
The terminal is usually housed in a SAI cabinet. However, the 
terminal may receive limited use in smaller pedestal-type 
housings and pole mounted cabinets in the outside plant 
environment.

(2) 

Design and fabrication requirements.

 (i) Terminal 
blocks used in outside plant housings are expected to perform 
satisfactorily for a nominal design life of 30 years. 

(ii) All individual terminals or terminal fields must be 
enclosed and the terminal enclosure must be totally filled with 
an encapsulating grease or gel which prevents connection 
degradation caused by moisture and corrosion. The encapsulant 
must provide complete encapsulation of terminal metallic 
connections and surfaces and totally fill all voids and cavities 
within individual terminal enclosures or terminal field 
enclosures to prevent ingress of moisture. The encapsulant must 
not restrict access to the terminal or restrict craft personnel 
from making connections. The encapsulant must be compatible with 
the standard materials used in cross-connect hardware and wiring. 

(iii) Binding post terminals shall not be susceptible to 
damage under normal use of standard tools used by outside plant 
technicians such as screwdrivers and test set clips. In 
addition, use of other tools such as scissors, diagonal cutters 
and long nose pliers for tightening and loosening screws shall 
not result in damage to the terminal. 

(iv) Terminals shall be designed so that a typical technician 
using customary tools shall be able to terminate cross-connect 
wire on a pair of terminals, or to remove it, without causing an 
electrical short between any two terminals or any other adjacent 
terminals. 

(v) The terminal count sequence shall be indicated using 
numerals of at least 0.25 cm (0.10 in.) in height. 

(vi) A means shall be provided to distinguish feeder 
terminals from distribution terminals. 

(vii) A means shall be provided to identify tip terminals and 
ring terminals in a terminal field. The identification 
convention shall indicate tip on the left with ring on the right 
for horizontal spacing and tip on the top with ring on the bottom 
for vertical spacing. 

(viii) The preferred height of the highest terminal in the 
connector field in a ground mounted SAI unit shall be 168 cm (66 
in.) or less as measured from the top surface of the mounting 
pad. The bottom or lowest terminals in the connector field shall 
be at least 46 cm (18 in.) from the top surface of the pad. 

(ix) Pole mounted aerial units shall be 84 cm (33 in.) or 
less in width. The maximum allowable height of the highest 
terminals in a pole mounted aerial unit is 168 cm (66 in.) as 
measured from the top surface of the standard balcony seat used 
with the interface. For computation purposes, 15 cm (6 in.) 
shall be allowed for the distance between the bottom of the 
interface and the top of the balcony seat. 

(3) 

Auxiliary features.

 (i) SAI cabinets with terminal 
designs which do not permit direct attachment of common test 
instrument clips to terminal pairs without the occurrence of 
shorts shall be equipped with single pair auxiliary test 
contacts. The auxiliary test contacts shall attach to a terminal 
pair and provide a set of secondary terminals which will accept 
typical test instrument clips without the occurrence of shorts. 
Wire used to connect the auxiliary test contacts to the secondary 
terminals shall be 20 gauge minimum stranded conductor copper 
wire with a minimum dielectric strength between conductors of 15 
kv. The test connector shall be functional on all terminal 
pairs. 

(ii) A 25 or 50 pair test connector shall be available which 
can be used to make reliable electrical contact to terminals 
associated with discrete 25 pair binder groups. The multi-pair 
test connector shall be provided with a minimum of 
1.8 m (6 ft) of suitable cabling terminated to a connector, for 
interfacing with test sets common to the industry. The multi-pair test connector shall be functional on all terminal
groups.

and insulate exposed metal parts from accidental shorts from 
tools and wires. A supply of 25 special service markers shall be 
provided with each SAI cabinet. The color of special service 
markers shall be red. 
(iv)(A) A supply of twisted pair cross-connect wire shall be

lateral loading, or axial pullout tests described in paragraphs 
(g)(3)(ii) through (g)(3)(iv) of this section. 

(iii) Select six binding posts at random in a representative 
interface. On each connector, attach any test cord included with 
the unit and then remove the test cord as follows. On binding 
post sample 1, remove the cord normally ten times. On binding 
post sample 2, remove the cord ten times by jerking the test 
leads straight out. In these and the remaining tests, do this 
without releasing any manual attachment mechanisms. On sample 3,

  from horizontal; 
sample 4, upward at 45
  ten times; sample 5, left 45
  ten times; 
sample 6, right 45
  ten times. Check for opens and damage in the 
test cord, clips, and connectors. Failure consists of structural 
damage, open circuits through the connector, or inability of the 
terminal blocks to pass the torsional, lateral loading, axial 
pullout, test connector reliability, or dielectric strength tests 
described in paragraphs (g)(3)(ii) through (g)(3)(v)(B), and 
paragraph (g)(4) of this section. 

(iv) Use craft tools such as scissors, diagonal cutters, and 
long nose pliers to loosen and tighten screws where the binding 
post design does not prohibit the possibility. Failure consists 
of severe structural damage.

Functional design criteria for insulation displacement 
type cross-connect modules used in SAI cabinets

_(1) 

General 
description. 

Cross-connect modules normally consist of multiple 
metallic contact elements that are retained by nonmetallic 
fixtures. The contact elements are spliced with permanent wire 
leads compatible for splicing to 22, 24, or 26 gauge cable on one

and disconnections of plastic insulated cross-connect wire on the 
other side. Cross-connect modules are usually housed in a SAI 
cabinet. However, modules may receive limited usage in smaller 
pedestal-type housings and cabinets in the outside plant 
environment.

(iv) 

Jumper wire pull-out resistance. 

Test modules that have 
received no prior conditioning shall be equipped with 100 38 cm 
(15 in.) jumper connections of the gauges recommended for use 
with the module using the insertion tool recommended by the 
cross-connect module manufacturer. With the test samples 
suitably supported, wires from each sample shall be pulled, one 
at a time, by a tensile machine at a cross-head speed of 
6 centimeters per minute (cm/min) (2.4 inches per minute 
(in./min)). Wires shall be pulled both perpendicular and 
parallel to the plane of the cross-connect field and shall 
withstand a load of at least 1.1 kg (2.5 lb) before pulling out. 

(v) 

Cable conductor pull-out resistance. 

Test modules that 
have received no prior conditioning shall be equipped with 100 
26, 24, and 22 AWG 38 cm (15 in.) cable conductors using the 
insertion tool recommended by the cross-connect module manufacturer. With the test samples suitably supported,
conductors 
from each sample shall be pulled, one at a time, by a tensile 
machine at a cross-head speed of 6 cm/min (2.4 in./min). Wires 
shall be pulled both perpendicular and parallel to the plane of 
the face of the splice module and shall withstand a load of at 
least 1.1 kg (2.5 lb) before pulling out. 

(4) 

Electrical requirements

_(i) 

Dielectric strength. 

A 
housing fully equipped with cross-connect modules shall be tested 
for dielectric strength in accordance with (g)(4) of this 
section. 

(ii) The dielectric strength of a contact within the cross-
connect module to contacts on either side shall be tested. The 
module shall be tested in a dry environment with an ac power 
source capable of supplying 8 kv at a rate of increase of 500 
volts per second, a circuit breaker to open at breakdown, and a 
voltmeter to record the breakdown potential. Cross-connect 
modules shall be prepared in accordance with industry accepted 
splicing techniques with leads trimmed to approximately 38 cm 
(15 in.). The dielectric strength of each contact to the 
contacts on either side shall have an average dielectric strength 
of approximately 5.0 kv. 

(5) 

Operational requirements

_(i) 

Durability. 

In order to 
verify the durability requirements while minimizing the number of 
test housings required to complete the test program, the contacts 
selected for tests shall be separately identified and then 
checked to establish compliance after the various tests have been 
conducted. 

(ii) Twenty-five jumper connections shall be made on each of 
two contacts chosen at random from a representative sample in an 
assembled interface unit. After this test, these and surrounding 
contacts shall be inspected for damage such as cracks or chips in 
metal or plastic parts. Failure consists of structural damage, 
open circuits through the connector, or inability to pass the 
jumper wire pullout tests described in paragraph (i)(3)(iv) of 
this section. 

(iii) Select six contacts at random in a representative 
interface. On each of these contacts attach any test cord 
included with the unit as specified under normal use of that cord 
and then remove the test cord as follows. On sample 1, remove 
the cord normally ten times. On sample 2, remove the clip ten 
times by jerking the test leads straight out. In these and the 
remaining tests, do this without releasing any manual attachment 
mechanisms. On sample 3, remove ten times by jerking downward at 
45
  from horizontal; sample 4, upward 45
  ten times; sample 5, 
left 45
  ten times; sample 6, right 45
  ten times. Check for 
opens and damage in the test cord, clips, and cross-connect 
modules. Failure consists of structural damage, open circuits 
through the connector, or inability of module to pass the test 
connector reliability, jumper wire pullout, and dielectric 
strength tests described in paragraphs (i)(3)(ii), (i)(3)(iv), 
and (i)(4)(ii) of this section.

Disaster Set-Aside Program 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Farmers Home Administration, USDA.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim final rule with request for comments.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) amends its Farmer Programs servicing regulations by adding the Disaster
Set-Aside (DSA) Program. This program will be made available to Farmer Program borrowers who operated a farm or ranch
in a county where a disaster occurred in 1993 and was declared/designated a disaster area in accordance with FmHA regulations.
Under this program, the distressed borrower will have the opportunity to move the next scheduled FmHA annual installment
to the end of the loan term. The intended effect is to service disaster victims in an efficient and timely manner while
keeping them in business.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Classification 


This rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866 and therefore has not been
reviewed by OMB. 


Intergovernmental Consultation 


For the reasons set forth in the final rule related to Notice 7 CFR, part 3015, subpart V (48 FR 29115, June 24, 1983),
and FmHA Instruction 1940-J, ``Intergovernmental Review of FmHA Programs and Activities'' (December 23,
1983), Emergency Loans, Farm Ownership Loans, and Farm Operating Loans are excluded, with the exception of nonfarm
enterprise activity, from the scope of Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with
State and local officials. The Soil and Water Loan Program, however, is subject to the provisions of Executive Order
12372. 


Programs Affected 


These changes affect the following FmHA programs, as listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance:

 

10.404_Emergency Loans 
10.406_Farm Operating Loans 
10.407_Farm Ownership Loans 
10.410_Low Income Housing Loans 
10.416_Soil and Water Loans 


Environmental Impact Statement 


This document has been reviewed in accordance with 7 CFR, part 1940, subpart G, ``Environmental Program.'' FmHA has
determined that this action does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the
human environment, and, in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (Public Law 91-190),
an Environmental Impact Statement is not required.

Civil Justice Reform 


This document has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order (E.O.) 12778. It is the determination of FmHA that
this action does not unduly burden the Federal Court System in that it meets all applicable standards provided in section
2 of the E.O. 


Paperwork Reduction Act 


The information collection requirements contained in these regulations have been approved by the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35 and have been assigned OMB control number [0575-0163]
in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507). The interim final rule does not revise or impose
any new information collection or recordkeeping requirements from those approved by OMB. 


Discussion of Interim Final Rule 


FmHA has chosen to publish this regulation as an interim final rule without first publishing a proposed rule due to
the nature of the program and the eligibility requirements involved. Eighty percent of the 3,151 counties serviced
by FmHA were declared disaster areas in 1993. Due to heavy flooding in the midwest and extreme droughts in the South,
considerably more borrowers were affected by disasters in 1993 than in any of the previous five years. This program
will also help those borrowers who are affected by the 1994 flood disaster in the South if they were also affected by
the previous disasters in 1993. FmHA is considering extending this program in the future to assist borrowers affected
only by the 1994 disaster. In order to prevent massive delinquencies and farm failures, borrowers in a crisis situation
must receive immediate financial assistance. 
It is for this purpose and by the authority granted the Secretary under the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development
Act (CONACT), section 331A (7 U.S.C. 1981a), FmHA has made available the Disaster Set-Aside Program. As provided
in section 331A, the Secretary has the authority to defer principal and interest at the request of the borrower on any
outstanding loan made, insured, or held by the Secretary under the CONACT, subject to the borrower showing that due
to circumstances beyond his/her control, he/she is temporarily unable to continue making payments when due without
unduly impairing his/her standard of living. The set-aside program is designed to assist borrowers in financial
distress who operated a farm or ranch in a county where a disaster occurred in 1993 and was declared/designated a disaster
area as set forth in subpart A of part 1945 of this chapter. 
Under this program, farmer programs borrowers can receive immediate financial relief from their FmHA payment obligations
in a more expedient manner than under subpart S of part 1951. For example, the application process is simple and easy,
unlike the primary loan servicing application under subpart S of part 1951 which requires extensive documentation
by both the borrower and the servicing official. There are no additional security requirements to deter the borrower
from requesting debt set-aside. On the average, the borrower's installments can be set-aside the same day he/she
makes the request, whereas under subpart S of part 1951, it takes an average of 90 days to process an application and
restructure a loan. 
To comply with the statute, the borrower must be temporarily unable to make the payment being set-aside because of
circumstances beyond his/her control. This is demonstrated by requiring that the borrower must have operated a farm
or ranch during 1993 in which a disaster occurred and the county was declared/designated a disaster area, or a contiguous
county, as set forth in subpart A of part 1945 of this chapter; that the borrower be current or not more than 1 installment
behind on any and all farmer program loans, which would assure that all payments prior to the disaster were paid or the
loan restructured; that if no other payments have been due on the loan, the projected farm plan for the disaster year
shows that the payment could have been paid under normal conditions; and that the borrower's actual records for the
disaster year must show that, because of the disaster, the borrower's projected income was reduced to an amount that
would prevent payment of all family living and operating expenses and paying amounts due FmHA and/or other creditors.

FmHA projects that approximately 60,000 borrowers affected by 1993 disasters will request assistance under the
set-aside program. Of these borrowers, the majority have installments that came due January 1, 1994. If these installments
are not paid by January 1, 1995, or otherwise set-aside, the borrower will be two installments behind and will no longer
be eligible to receive disaster set-aside assistance. Borrowers more than one payment behind will be able to receive
more assistance through FmHA's loan servicing program under subpart S of part 1951 of this chapter than through the
debt set-aside program. However, borrowers who cannot obtain servicing through subpart S of part 1951 of this chapter
may be able to cure their delinquency with set-aside assistance alone. The set-aside program will be better for some
borrowers than servicing through subpart S of part 1951 of this chapter since the set-aside will be a faster process,
eligibility requirements are easier to meet, paperwork is less, and some borrowers' financial distress can be resolved
with only one payment deferred. The program will allow some borrowers to use sources other than FmHA to maintain their
farm operation and allow them to work out their financial difficulty over the next year or so. Other borrowers may prefer
to use the year to voluntarily liquidate. This regulation will, therefore, provide options to prevent the foreclosure
of borrowers in both of these instances. However, borrowers who are not eligible for the DSA program, or who need more
extensive servicing, will still have the opportunity to be considered for FmHA's primary loan servicing program
as set forth in subpart S of part 1951 of this chapter.

The set-aside program allows eligible borrowers to move one FmHA annual installment for each loan to the end of the
loan term, thereby quickly eliminating the immediate financial stress. The installment set-aside may be the one
due immediately after the disaster or, if that installment is paid to the neglect of other creditors or family living
and operating expenses, then the next scheduled installment may be set-aside. Borrowers who received primary loan
servicing after the disaster will not be eligible for the disaster set-aside, as restructuring of the account already
resolved the financial distress for the current and next production/marketing period. Borrowers whose farmer program
loans have been accelerated will also not be eligible for disaster set-aside as their financial situation is much
more severe than the borrower who is only one installment behind. These type of borrowers have already been processed
through 1951-S primary and preacquisition preservation loan servicing resulting in no servicing granted.
The disaster set-aside program cannot offer more favorable options than those provided in subpart S of part 1951.

Based on past experience, the Agency has found that a borrower needs a minimum of one to two years to recover from a disaster.
Therefore, in order for an installment to be set-aside, the term remaining on the loan must equal or exceed two years
from the date on which the installment set-aside was due. This requirement automatically eliminates all one-year
loans and any loans that will mature in less than two years. Borrowers with less than two years remaining on the loan
will receive greater benefit from the servicing options available under subpart S of part 1951 of this chapter as restructuring
could possibly provide longer repayment terms for the entire debt. 
The set-aside amount will include unpaid interest and any principal that would be credited to the borrower's account
as if the payment were paid on the due date. This amount will not exceed the annual scheduled installment being set-aside
minus any portion of the installment paid prior to the set-aside addendum being signed. The unpaid interest is set-aside
in order that the remaining amortized installments can be credited properly to principal and interest. Interest
will continue to accrue on any principal amount set-aside at the same rate charged on the non-set-aside portion of
the note. The amount set-aside, including interest accrual on any principal set-aside, will be due on or before the
final due date of the loan. The interest amount set-aside will not accrue interest, as permitted by section 331A of
the CONACT. 
Borrowers who apply for both set-aside and 1951-S servicing, must choose which program they wish to accept.
Borrowers cannot choose both because the options are overlapping servicing tools geared toward borrower financial
stability. The program not chosen will automatically be withdrawn once the borrower either signs the set-aside addendum
or the promissory note(s) restructured under 1951-S, whichever is applicable. This assures the borrower's
eligibility for the program chosen prior to the other request being withdrawn. If the set-aside program is chosen
and any 1951-S request is withdrawn, the borrower will not lose any future servicing rights under subpart S of
part 1951 of this chapter. The borrower may re-apply for 1951-S servicing at any time after the set-aside addendum
is signed. However, if a borrower is offered servicing under subpart S of part 1951 of this chapter while waiting for
notice of eligibility for the set-aside and the time limits for 1951-S servicing expire without timely response
by the borrower, the borrower will lose the rights to 1951-S servicing.

The Agency anticipates that circumstances may arise beyond the borrower's control that could warrant restructuring
the debt prior to the next scheduled installment coming due. In these cases, since the set-aside brings the account
current, the borrower may be considered for a writedown or net recovery buyout as set forth in subpart S of part 1951
and/or granted assistance in accordance with  1941.14 of subpart A of part 1941 of this chapter only if the set-aside
is reversed and the addendum cancelled. If the set-aside is reversed, the account will reflect the current payment
status as if the payment had never been set-aside. 
In the case of entity borrowers, all members of the entity liable for the debt must apply for set-aside in order for FmHA
to consider the application. This procedure is consistent with that under subpart S of part 1951. 
The set-aside program will be available only until July 1, 1995. This timeframe will provide those borrowers who have
already made their payment that was due after the disaster ample time to determine if the loss they incurred from the
disaster will affect their repayment ability for the following year.

Subpart T_Disaster Set-Aside Program 



 1951.951

Purpose. 



This subpart sets forth the policies and procedures for establishing and implementing the Disaster Set-Aside (DSA)
Program. The DSA program is available to Farmer Programs (FP) borrowers, as defined in subpart S of this part, who suffered
losses as a result of a 1993 disaster. FP loans that may be serviced under this subpart include Farm Ownership (FO),
Operating (OL), Soil and Water (SW), Emergency (EM), Economic Emergency (EE), Special Livestock (SL), Economic
Opportunity (EO), Softwood Timber (ST), Recreation (RL), and Rural Housing loans for farm service buildings (RHF).
Nonprogram (NP) farm type loans may be serviced under this subpart for borrowers who also have FP loans. FP borrowers
have until July 1, 1995, to request disaster set-aside and submit a complete application. Partial applications will
not be acceptable. Requests received after July 1, 1995, will not be accepted. 



 1951.952

General. 



DSA is a program whereby borrowers who are current or not more than one installment behind on any and all FP loans may
be permitted to move one Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) scheduled annual installment(s) for each eligible FP
loan to the end of the loan term. The intent of this program is to relieve some of the borrower's immediate financial
stress caused by the disaster and avoid foreclosure by the Government. 



 1951.953

Notification and request for DSA. 



(a) 

Notification. 

The County Supervisor will use Form Letter 1951-T-1 to notify FP borrowers of the availability of the DSA
program and how to apply. All FP borrowers, as defined in  1951.906 of subpart S of this part, who have not been
accelerated and who operated a farm or ranch in a county during 1993 in which a disaster occurred and was declared/designated
as a disaster area or contiguous county, as set forth in subpart A of part 1945 of this chapter, will be notified within
10 days of the effective date of this subpart. However, those borrowers whose FP loan(s) has been accelerated, or restructured
after a 1993 disaster, will not be notified under this paragraph. Notification of the DSA program will not affect the
notification requirements set forth in subpart S of this part. 

(b) 

Request for DSA. 

All FP borrower liable for the debt must provide the County Office with the information described in paragraphs (b)
(1) and (2) of this section on or before July 1, 1995 to request DSA. Borrowers may only be considered for DSA one time.


(1) A written request for DSA signed by all parties liable for the debt, and 

(2) Actual production, income, and expense figures for the production/marketing period in which the 1993 disaster
occurred, unless this information is already in the borrower case file. 

(c) 

Eligibility requirements. 

The County Supervisor will determine whether the borrower meets the following eligibility requirements: 

(1) The borrower's FP loan(s) has not been accelerated. 

(2) The borrower operated a farm or ranch in a county declared/designated a disaster area as set forth in subpart A of
part 1945 of this chapter or a county contiguous to such an area based on a 1993 disaster. The borrower must have been
operating the farm or ranch at the time of the disaster. 

(3) The borrower has acted in good faith as defined in  1951.906 of subpart S of this part. 

(4) All nonmonetary defaults have been resolved. This means that even though the borrower has acted in good faith,
he/she may still be in default for reasons, such as, but not limited to: no longer farming, prior lienholder foreclosure,
bankruptcy, not properly maintaining chattel and real estate security, not properly accounting for the sale of security
as agreed, or not


carrying out any other agreements made with FmHA.

(5) The borrower is current or not more than one installment behind on any and all FP loans at the time the scheduled installment(s)
will be set-aside as reflected on the Finance Office 540 or 582 status reports. 

(6) The borrower's projected income for the disaster year was reduced as a result of the disaster, causing insufficient
income available to pay all family living and operating expenses, debts to other creditors, and FmHA. This determination
will be based on the borrower's actual production and income and expense records for the disaster year. 

(7) The term remaining on the loan(s) receiving DSA equals or exceeds 2 years from the due date of the installment being
set-aside. 

(8) All FP and NP farm type loans will be current after the scheduled installments are set-aside. 

(9) The borrower's FP loan(s) was not restructured under subpart S of this part after the 1993 disaster. 



  1951.954-1951.956

[Reserved] 



 1951.957

Eligibility determination and processing. 



(a) 

Eligibility determination. 

Upon receipt of a DSA request, the County Supervisor will determine whether the borrower meets the eligibility requirements
set forth in  1951.953(c) of this subpart and notify the borrower of the results within 30 days from the date of
the DSA request. The file shall contain documentation to reflect the date of request and the date the borrower was notified
and the addendum signed. 

(1) The borrower shall be provided up to 30 days to sign Exhibit A of this subpart, (available in any FmHA Office). If
Exhibit A is not signed within 30 days and prior to the borrower becoming more than one installment behind, the DSA request
will be withdrawn and the borrower notified of their rights to an appeal review in accordance with subpart B of part
1900 of this chapter. Note: If borrower becomes more than one installment behind, he/she is no longer eligible. 

(2) Pending requests for primary loan servicing will continue to be considered as set forth in subpart S of this part.
However, borrowers cannot accept servicing under both programs. 

(i) Borrowers determined eligible for the DSA program and primary loan servicing in accordance with subpart S of this
part will be required to choose between the two program requests. The choice will be noted in the borrower case file
and initialed by the borrower. 

(ii) Borrowers may choose to proceed with the DSA program prior to a decision being made for primary loan servicing
such as in cases where a decision will not be available on the primary loan servicing application prior to the borrower
becoming more than one installment behind. 

(iii) The application for the program not chosen will automatically be withdrawn at the time the installment(s) is
set-aside or the loan(s) restructured, whichever is applicable. This voluntary withdrawal is not appealable. 

(iv) By signing Exhibit A of this subpart, (available in any FmHA Office), the borrower agrees to the withdrawal of
any pending request for primary loan servicing. The borrower may resubmit a request at any time according to subpart
S of this part. 

(b) 

Processing. 

Installments will be set-aside as set forth in this paragraph. 

(1) All borrowers liable for the debt will sign Exhibit A of this subpart, (available in any FmHA Office), for each loan
installment set-aside. Exhibit A may be modified with the assistance of the Office of the General Counsel to comply
with individual State laws. 

(2) Only one unpaid installment for each FP loan may be set-aside. 

(i) The installment set-aside will be the first scheduled annual installment due immediately after the disaster
occurred, or if that installment is paid current, the next scheduled annual installment. Set-aside will not be granted
on the loan if both of these installments are paid current.

(ii) The amount set-aside will not exceed the annual scheduled installment being set-aside minus any portion of that
installment paid prior to Exhibit A of this subpart, (available in any FmHA Office), being signed by the borrower.
This amount will include the unpaid interest and any principal that would be credited to the account as if the installment
were paid on the due date. 
(iii) Recoverable cost items charged to FO, SW, and RHF loans may be set-aside with the annual installment. Cost items
identified with a loan number different from the parent loan cannot be set-aside. 
(3) Interest will accrue on any principal amount set-aside at the same rate charged the non-set-aside portion. Interest
will not accrue on the interest portion set-aside. 
(4) The amount set-aside, including interest accrual on any principal set-aside, will be due on or before the final
due date of the loan. 
(5) There are no additional security requirements attached to the DSA program. All existing security instruments
will remain in effect. 
(6) The original Exhibit A of this subpart, (available in any FmHA Office), will be stapled to the respective original
promissory note or assumption agreement filed in the County Office operational file. A copy will be stapled to the
copy of the promissory note or assumption agreement filed in position 2 of the borrower's case file. 
(7) Exhibit A of this subpart, (available in any FmHA Office), will be used as the source document to process the DSA
through the Automated Discrepancy Processing System (ADPS). Until automation capabilities are implemented, Exhibit
A should be placed in a pending file and the borrower's account flagged ``51-S.'' The Finance Office borrower
account status reports will reflect the amount(s) set-aside for each loan. 
(8) The National Automated Tracking System (AGCREDIT) will be utilized to document the notification and servicing
scheme associated with this subpart. 
(9) The loan(s) will be considered current after the installment(s) is set-aside and, therefore, debt writedown
or net recovery buyout may not be subsequently approved under subpart S of this part, and loans may not be made under
 1941.14 of subpart A of part 1941 of this chapter, unless the set-aside is reversed as set forth in  1951.958(b)(2)
of this subpart or the borrower becomes delinquent on the non-set-aside portion. 
(c) 

Adverse determination. 

Borrowers who do not meet the requirements for the DSA program will be notified of their appeal rights in accordance
with subpart B of part 1900 of this chapter. If the borrower becomes more than one installment behind on any FP loan while
processing the DSA request, or while an appeal is being considered, and the second installment cannot be paid current
prior to Exhibit A of this subpart, (available in any FmHA Office), being signed, the DSA request will be denied and/or
any associated appeal request withdrawn. Being denied set-aside based on the failure to meet the not-more-than-one-installment-behind
requirement is not an appealable issue, but is reviewable. The letter to the borrower will describe in full detail
all the reasons for the adverse decision. Borrowers denied DSA will continue to be serviced in accordance with subpart
S of this part. 


 1951.958 


Supervision and servicing of borrowers with DSA. 


(a) 

Supervision. 

Borrower supervision will continue as set forth in subpart B of part 1924 of this chapter. 
(b) 

Servicing. 

FP loans will continue to be serviced in accordance with the appropriate servicing regulations. 
(1) Payments applied to the amount set-aside will be processed as a miscellaneous payment on Form FmHA 451-2,
``Schedule of Remittances.'' 
(2) The set-aside will be reversed and Exhibit A of this subpart, (available in any FmHA Office), cancelled if, prior
to the first scheduled installment due date after set-aside, the current borrower needs a writedown in order to develop
a feasible plan or a net recovery buyout in accordance with subpart S of this part or loan assistance set forth in  1941.14
of subpart A of part 1941 of this chapter. The Finance Office must be notified by memorandum of the set-aside reversal
prior to the time assistance is granted. A copy of the memorandum will be attached to Exhibit A and remain stapled to
the promissory note or assumption agreement as indicated in  1951.957(b)(6) of this subpart.

(3) In cases not covered by paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the set-aside will be considered automatically cancelled
whenever a program loan receives primary loan servicing. 

(4) Releases of normal income security will continue as set forth in subpart A of part 1962 of this chapter. 



 1951.959 


Exception authority. 


The Administrator may, in individual cases, make an exception to any requirement or provision of this subpart or address
any omission of this subpart which is not inconsistent with the authorizing statute or other applicable law if it is
determined that application of the requirement or provision or failure to take action in the case of an omission would
adversely affect the Government's interest. The Administrator will exercise this authority upon the request of
the State Director with the recommendation of the Assistant Administrator for Farmer Programs, or upon request initiated
by the Assistant Administrator for Farmer Programs. Requests for exception must be made in writing and supported
with documentation to explain the adverse effect and proposed alternative courses of action, and to show how the adverse
effect will be eliminated or minimized if the exception is granted.

Privacy Act Regulations 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim rule with request for comments. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation (Corporation) issues an interim rule to implement the requirements
of the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a, relating to the receipt and processing of requests for Corporation Privacy Act records,
requests for amendment of records, fees to be charged, procedures to be followed in processing requests for records,
and criminal penalties. Also, the interim rule includes a provision relating to the use of a specific exemption, 5
U.S.C. 552(k)(5), for a system of records. The regulations will assist the public in requesting Privacy Act records.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On May 13, 1994, the Corporation proposed regulations setting forth procedures to be used in requesting access to
and responding to requests for Corporation Privacy Act records. 

See 

59 FR 24988. Essentially, the Corporation proposed regulations that provided that all requests for access to Corporation
Privacy Act records must be in writing and signed by the subject of the record, adequately describe the material sought,
and be sent to the Corporation in McLean, Virginia. The proposed regulations delegated to the Privacy Act Officer
authority to make initial determinations concerning requests for access to records. The proposed regulations provided
procedures for requests for amendment of records and the appeal of an initial adverse determination on a request to
amend a record. Finally, the proposed regulations provided a fee structure. The Corporation did not receive any written
comments in response to the proposed regulations. 



After publication of the proposed rule, the Corporation determined that a specific exemption was appropriate for
a system of records. The Corporation now wishes to adopt a regulation providing for the specific exemption under 5
U.S.C. 552(k)(5) of a system of records pertaining to the personnel security files of the agency. The head of an agency
may promulgate rules to exempt any system of records within the agency from subsections (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)
(G), (H), and (I), and (f) of section 552a of title 5, United States Code, if the system of records is investigatory material
compiled solely for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for Federal civilian
employment, but only to the extent that the disclosure of such material would reveal the identity of a source who furnished
information to the government under an express promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence.


In order to ensure appropriate maintenance and use of Corporation records, as well as orderly and timely access to
Corporation records, it was determined that the regulation should be adopted as an interim rule. However, comments
are sought on this regulation. 

The Corporation now adopts 12 CFR part 1403 as an interim rule.

Annual User Fee for Customs Broker Permit



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Customs Service, Treasury.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of due date for broker user fee.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This is to advise Customs brokers that for 1995 the annual user fee of $125 that is assessed for each permit held by an
individual, partnership, association or corporate broker is due by January 3, 1995. This announcement is being published
to comply with the Tax Reform Act of 1986.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 13031 of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (Pub. L. 99-272) established that
an annual user fee of $125 is to be assessed for each Customs broker permit held by an individual, partnership, association
or corporation. This fee is set forth in the Customs Regulations in  111.96 (19 CFR 111.96).



Section 111.96, Customs Regulations, provides that the fee is payable for each calendar year in each district where
a broker has a permit to do business by the due date which will be published in the 

Federal Register 

annually. 

Section 1893 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-514) provides that notices of the date on which payment is
due of the user fee for each broker permit shall be published by the Secretary of the Treasury in the 

Federal Register 

by no later than 60 days before such due date. This document notifies brokers that for 1995, the due date for payment
of the user fee is January 3, 1995. It is expected that annual user fees for brokers for subsequent years will be due on
or about the 3rd of January each year. This is a change from the previous date of on or about the 15th of the year.

SUMMARY:

 This document contains final regulations regarding property exempt from levy. These regulations reflect changes
made by the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988 (TAMRA) and other public laws to section 6334 concerning
the determination of property exempt from levy. The regulations affect taxpayers whose wages, salary, or other income
are the subject of a levy by the Internal Revenue Service.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



This document contains final regulations amending the Procedure and Administration Regulations (26 CFR part 301)
under section 6334 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). The regulations reflect the amendment of section 6334 by sections
1015(o) and 6236(c) of the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988, Public Law. 100-647, as well as the
Tax Reform Act of 1986, Public Law 99-514, the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, Public Law 97-248,
and the Tax Reform Act of 1976, Public Law 94-455, which had not previously been reflected in the regulations.


On May 27, 1992, a notice of proposed rulemaking relating to property exempt from levy was published in the 

Federal Register 

(57 FR 22189). Written comments responding to this notice were received. No public hearing was requested or held.
After consideration of all the comments, the proposed regulations under section 6334 are adopted as revised by this
Treasury decision. 



Explanation of Revisions and Summary of Comments 



One commentator suggested that the final regulations provide that 

all 

retirement plans be exempt from levy, not only those plans enumerated in section 6334 of the Code. This suggestion
is not adopted. Congress has specifically provided that certain property is exempt from levy. In fact, section 6334(c)
provides that no property is exempt from levy other than property specifically enumerated in the Code. 

The proposed regulations provide that where an individual is paid or receives wages, salary, or other income on a one-
time basis, the exempt amount is computed as if the taxpayer had been paid for the one-week period ending on the day of
payment. One commentator raised questions concerning the application of this ``one time basis'' rule where an individual
was paid on a recurrent, but irregular, basis. Another commentator questioned whether the proposed rule is a correct
interpretation of section 6334(d)(3). This commentator argued that under section 6334(d)(3) the exemption amount
should be calculated using the total time period over which the wages, salary, or other income was earned.
The proposed regulations have been revised to address the concerns of these commentators. Under the final regulations,
when taxpayers are paid on a one-time basis or are paid on a recurrent, but irregular, basis which does not comport with
an established calendar period regularly used by the employer or other person being levied upon, taxpayers are entitled
to the exempt amount for each week to which the payment received is attributable. 

One commentator raised a concern regarding levies that span more than one calendar year where the standard deduction
or the amount of the personal exemption changes by operation of law (such as by indexing or otherwise). Under the proposed
regulations, the exempt amount remains the same in the second year. The commentator stated that this could cause hardship
for employers with automated payroll systems because those employers might have to maintain separate, manual accounts
for those employees who had been levied upon in a preceding year. The commentator suggested that employers should
be required to calculate and use the new exempt amount when a change in the standard deduction amount or personal exemption
amount occurs by operation of law. 

While the suggested change might be beneficial to some employers, the Service and Treasury are concerned that it could
result in a hardship to other employers (particulary smaller employers) who would be required to reexamine the statement
of each employee who files for exemption and recompute a new exempt amount each time a change in the law occurs. In order
to accommodate these conflicting concerns, under the final regulations a taxpayer may submit a new verified statement
to his or her employer to claim a new exempt amount based on law changes effective in the year in which the claim is filed.
This permits a taxpayer to claim an additional exempt amount but avoids burdening businesses with the requirement
to reexamine the statement of each employee who files for exemption and automatically recompute a new exempt amount
based on law changes alone. However, employers who wish to use the new exempt amount can request that their employees
submit new verified statements in order to recompute new exempt amounts based on the changes in the law.

Under the proposed regulations, when payments are made on the basis of a daily pay period, the exempt amount is calculated
on the basis of 360 days. The final regulations provide that the exempt amount is calculated on the basis of 260 days,
the number of work days in a year (assuming a five day work week and 52 work weeks in a year). This change increases the
exempt amount available to a taxpayer who works on a daily pay-period basis. The Service and Treasury believe that
this change is consistent with the requirement of section 6334(d)(3) of the Code. 



Effective Date 



These regulations are effective for levies made on or after July 1, 1989. However, any reasonable attempt to comply
with the statutory amendments addressed by these regulations prior to February 21, 1995 will be considered as meeting
the requirements of these regulations. 



Special Analyses 



It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore,
a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure
Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations,
and therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Code, the notice
of proposed rulemaking was submitted to the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on small business.




Drafting Information 



The principal author of these final regulations is Jerome D. Sekula, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel (General
Litigation), IRS. However, personnel from other offices of the Internal Revenue Service and Treasury Department
participated in their development.

Par. 3. 

Sections 301.6334-2, 301.6334-3 and 301.6334-4 are revised to read as follows: 



 301.6334-2 


Wages, salary, and other income. 



(a) 

In general. 

Under section 6334 (a)(9) and (d) certain amounts payable to or received by a taxpayer as wages, salary, or other income
are exempt from levy. This section describes the income of a taxpayer that is eligible for the exemption from levy (paragraph
(b) of this section) and how exempt amounts are to be paid to the taxpayer (paragraph (c) of this section). Section 301.6334-3
describes that sum that will be exempt from levy for each of the taxpayer's pay periods. Pay periods are described in
 301.6334-3. For the amounts exempt from levy, see  301.6334-3. 

(b) 

Eligible taxpayer income. 

Only wages, salary, or other income payable to the taxpayer after the levy is made on the payor may be exempt from levy
under section 6334(a)(9). No amount of wages, salary, or other income that is paid to the taxpayer before levy is made
on the payor will be so exempt from levy under section 6334(a)(9). The provisions of this paragraph (b) may be illustrated
by the following example: 






Example. 

Delinquent taxpayer A, an individual, is employed by the M Corporation and is paid wages on Friday of each week. Accordingly,
A is paid wages on Friday, February 16, 1990. On Saturday, February 17, A deposits these wages into his personal checking
account at Bank N. On Tuesday, February 20, a notice of levy is served on the M Corporation and also on Bank N. Amounts
payable to A as wages on Friday, February 23, 1990, and any payday thereafter may be exempt from levy under section 6334(a)(9).
No amount of wages A deposited in his account at Bank N on February 17, 1990, is exempt from levy under section 6334(a)(9).





(c) 

Payment of exempt amounts to taxpayer_

(1) 

From wages, salary, or income from other sources where levy on all sources not made. 

In the case of a taxpayer who has more than one source of wages, salary, or other income, the district director may elect
to levy on only one or more sources while leaving other sources of income free from levy. If the wages, salary, or other
income that the district director leaves free from levy equal or exceed the amount to which the taxpayer is entitled
as an exemption from levy under section 6334(a)(9), computed in accordance with  301.6334-3 (and are
not otherwise exempt), the district director may treat no amount of the taxpayer's wages, salary, or other income
on which the district director elects to levy as exempt from levy. In such a case, the district director must notify
the employer or other person upon whom the levy is served that no amount of the taxpayer's wages, salary, or other income
is exempt from levy. The employer or other person upon whom the levy is served may rely on such notification in paying
over amounts pursuant to the levy. In the absence of such notification from the district director, however, the employer
or other person upon whom the levy is served must determine the amount exempt from levy pursuant to  301.6334-3
as if that employer or other person upon whom the levy is served is the only source of wages, salary, or other income.
Amounts not exempt from levy are to be paid to the district director in accordance with the terms of the levy. The provisions
of this paragraph (c)(1) may be illustrated by the following example:

Example. 

Delinquent taxpayer C is an employee of O Corporation and is paid wages totalling $450 on Friday of each week. C also
performs services for P Corporation and is paid a salary of $250 on Friday of each week. On Tuesday, February 20, 1990,
a levy is served on O Corporation with respect to the wages payable to C. A levy is not served on P Corporation. C's filing
status is single and C is entitled to 1 personal exemption. Under  301.6334-3, C is entitled to an exemption
from levy under 6334(a)(9) totalling $101.92 for each weekly pay period. However, because levy has not been made on
C's salary paid by the P Corporation ($250 per week) and that salary exceeds the weekly amount ($101.92) to which C is
entitled as exempt from levy, the district director may treat no amount of C's wages paid by the O Corporation as exempt
from levy. If the district director requires such treatment, the district director must notify O Corporation that
no amount of C's wages is exempt from levy and O Corporation may rely on such notification; in the absence of such notification
O Corporation must treat $101.92 as exempt from levy. 




(2) 

Where sources not levied upon are less than exempt amount. 

If the taxpayer's income upon which the district director does not levy is less than the amount to which the taxpayer
is entitled as exempt from levy, then an additional amount, determined to be exempt from levy pursuant to  301.6334-3,
may be paid to the taxpayer from the sources of wages, salary, or other income upon which levy has been made. In such a
case, the district director must designate those wages, salary, or other income from which the exempt amount is to
be paid to the taxpayer, and must notify the employer or other person upon whom the levy is served of the amount of the
taxpayer's wages, salary, or other income that is exempt from levy. The employer or other person may rely on such notification
in paying over amounts pursuant to the levy. In the absence of such notification from the district director, the employer
or other person upon whom the levy is served must determine the amount exempt from levy pursuant to  301.6334-3
as if that employer or other person upon whom the levy is served is the only source of wages, salary, or other income.
Amounts not exempt from levy are to be paid to the district director in accordance with the terms of the levy. The provisions
of this paragraph (c)(2) may be illustrated by the following example: 






Example. 

Delinquent taxpayer C is an employee of O Corporation and is paid wages totalling $50 on Friday of each week. C also performs
services for P Corporation and is paid a salary of $75 on Friday of each week. On Tuesday, February 20, 1990, a levy is
served on P Corporation with respect to the wages and salary of C. C's filing status is single and C is entitled to 1 personal
exemption. Under  301.6334-3, C is entitled to an exemption from levy under section 6334(a)(9) totalling
$101.92 for each weekly pay period. The district director may notify P Corporation that only $51.92 of C's wages is
exempt from levy and P Corporation may rely on such notification; in the absence of such notification, P Corporation
must treat the entire $75 salary as exempt from levy. 




(d) 

Effective date. 

These provisions are effective with respect to levies made on or after July 1, 1989. However, any reasonable attempt
by a taxpayer to comply with the statutory amendments addressed by these regulations prior to February 21, 1995 will
be considered as meeting the requirements of these regulations. 



 301.6334-3 


Determination of exempt amount. 



(a) 

Individuals paid on weekly basis. 

In the case of any individual who is paid or receives all of his or her wages, salary, and other income on a weekly basis,
the amount of wages, salary, and other income payable to or received by him or her during any week that is exempt from
levy under section 6334(a)(9) is the exempt amount.

(b) 

Term defined. 

The term 

exempt amount 

means an amount equal to_

(1) The sum of_

(i) The standard deduction (including additional standard deductions on account of age or blindness); and 

(ii) The aggregate amount of the deductions for personal exemptions allowed the taxpayer under section 151 in the
taxable year in which such levy occurs; 

(2) Divided by 52. 

(c) 

Written and properly verified statement. 

Unless the taxpayer submits to the employer for forwarding to the district director a written and properly verified
statement (as described in  301.6334-4) specifying the facts necessary to determine the proper amount
under paragraphs (b)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section, paragraphs (b)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section must be applied
as if the taxpayer were a married individual filing a separate return with only 1 personal exemption. 

(d) 

Individuals paid on basis other than weekly

_(1) 

In general. 

In the case of an individual who is paid or receives wages, salary, and other income other than on a weekly basis, the
amount payable to that individual during any applicable pay period that is exempt from levy under section 6334(a)(9)
is the amount that as nearly as possible will result in the same total exemption from levy for such individual over that
period of time other than weekly as that to which the individual would have been entitled under paragraph (b) of this
section if, during such period of time, the individual were paid or received such wages, salary, and other income on
a regular weekly basis. 

(2) 

Specific pay periods other than weekly. 

In the case of wages, salary, or other income paid to an individual on the basis of an established calendar period regularly
used by the employer or other person levied upon for payroll or payment purposes, the exempt amount of wages, salary,
and other income payable to or received by an individual during an applicable pay period other than weekly equals_

<PARENT> FR941021-0-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(i) The sum of_

(A) The standard deduction (including additional standard deductions on account of age or blindness); and 

(B) The aggregate amount of the deductions for personal exemptions allowed the taxpayer under section 151 in the taxable
year in which such levy occurs; 

(ii) Divided by_ 

(A) 260 in the case of a daily pay period; 

(B) 26 in the case of a bi-weekly pay period; 

(C) 24 in the case of a semi-monthly pay period; and 

(D) 12 in the case of a monthly pay period. 

(3) 

Nonspecific pay periods. 

In the case of wages, salary, or other income paid to an individual on a one-time or a recurrent but irregular basis and
which is not paid on the basis of an established calendar period regularly used by the employer or other person levied
upon for payroll or payment purposes, the exempt amount of wages, salary, and other income payable to or received by
an individual equals the exempt amount defined in paragraph (b) of this section multiplied by the number (but not more
than 52) of full weeks (consisting of seven calendar days) to which such payment is attributable. The provisions of
this paragraph (d)(3) may be illustrated by the following example: 






Example. 

Taxpayer A's exempt amount per week (as determined under paragraph (b) of this section) is $100. Taxpayer A is hired
by Corporation X to perform a specific task for Corporation X at a flat fee of $1,500 which is to be paid at the completion
of the task. Taxpayer A completes the task in 10 weeks. The total exempt amount is $1,000 and $500 is subject to levy.





(e) 

Levies continuing into following years. 

The exempt amount is computed on the basis of the standard deduction (including additional standard deductions on
account of age or blindness) for the taxpayer's filing status and the amount of the deduction for a personal exemption
in effect in the taxable year in which the original notice of levy is served. Unless the taxpayer submits a new verified
statement in accordance with  301.6334-4, the exempt amount remains the same for pay periods following
the pay period in which the notice of levy is served even if there is a change in the taxpayer's factual situation or a
change by operation of law (such as by indexing or otherwise) to the standard deduction or personal exemption amounts.


(f) 

Effective date. 

These provisions are effective with respect to levies made on or after July 1, 1989. However, any reasonable attempt
by a taxpayer to comply with the statutory amendments addressed by these regulations prior to February 21, 1995 will
be considered as meeting the requirements of these regulations. 



 301.6334-4 

Verified statements. 



(a) 

In general. 

For purposes of   301.6334-2 and 301.6334-3, the amount of wages, salary, or other income
that is exempt from levy must be determined on the basis of a written and properly verified statement submitted by the
taxpayer to his or her employer for submission to the district director specifying the facts necessary to determine
the standard deduction and the aggregate amount of the deductions for personal exemptions allowed the taxpayer under
section 151 in the taxable year in which the levy is served. In the absence of submission of such statement, the amount
that is exempt from levy must be determined as if the taxpayer were a married individual filing a separate return with
only 1 personal exemption. 

(b) 

Content of statement. 

The statement in paragraph (a) of this section must be a written statement signed under penalty of perjury, and dated,
containing the following information_ 

(1) The filing status of the taxpayer as either: 

(i) Single; 

(ii) Married filing a joint return; 

(iii) Married filing a separate return; 

(iv) Head of household; or 

(v) Qualifying widow or widower with dependent child; 

(2) The name, relationship, and Social Security Number of each individual whom the taxpayer can claim as a personal
exemption on the taxpayer's income tax return; and 

(3) Any additional standard deductions that the taxpayer can claim on account of age (65 or older) or blindness on the
taxpayer's income tax return.

(c) 

Submission of verified statement

_(1) 

Obligation of 
employer. 

An employer upon whom a notice of levy for wages, 
salary, or other income of a taxpayer is served must 
promptly notify the taxpayer of the fact that a notice of 
levy has been served. Unless otherwise indicated on the 
face of the notice of levy, the employer must request the 
taxpayer to provide the employer with a written statement 
signed under penalty of perjury, and dated, containing the 
information set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, and 
this statement must be submitted by the employer to the 
district director. The employer must submit this statement 
to the district director at the time the employer first 
responds to the notice of levy. 

(2) 

Submission by taxpayer. 

The taxpayer must provide 
the employer upon whom the notice of levy has been served 
with a verified statement complying with paragraph (b) of 
this section. Unless the taxpayer provides a verified 
statement, the amount that is exempt from levy must be 
determined as if the taxpayer were a married individual 
filing a separate return with only 1 personal exemption. 

(3) 

Additional statements. 

A taxpayer may submit a 
verified statement to his or her employer at any time. 
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d) of this 
section, such verified statement will be effective for any 
payment of wages, salary, or other income made after the 
date of submission and will replace any previously submitted 
verified statement. The employer must provide the district 
director with the statement on the next occasion on which 
the employer responds to the notice of levy. 

(d) 

Effect of verified statement

_(1) A verified 
statement submitted by an employee is effective upon receipt 
by the employer, and the employer is required to compute the 
exempt amount on the basis of the information contained in 
the verified statement unless notified to the contrary by 
the Internal Revenue Service. 

(2) The Internal Revenue Service may find that a 
verified statement submitted by an employee contains a 
materially incorrect statement, or it may determine, after 
written request to the employee for verification of 
information contained in the verified statement, that it 
lacks sufficient information to determine whether the 
verified statement is correct. If the Internal Revenue 
Service so finds or determines, and notifies the employer in 
writing that the verified statement is defective, upon 
receipt of such notice the employer shall consider the 
verified statement to be defective for purposes of computing 
the exempt amount. 

(3) If the Internal Revenue Service notifies the 
employer that the verified statement is defective, the 
Internal Revenue Service will, based upon its finding, 
advise the employer that the employer is to compute the 
exempt amount as if no verified statement had been submitted 
by the employee or will describe upon what basis the exempt 
amount is to be computed. The Internal Revenue Service will 
also specify which Internal Revenue Service office to 
contact for further information. 

(4) In addition to any notice furnished to the employer 
for the employer's use, the Internal Revenue Service will 
provide the employer with a copy for the employee of each 
notice it furnishes the employer. 

(5) The employer must promptly furnish the employee with 
a copy of any Internal Revenue Service notice with respect 
to a verified statement submitted by the employee. 

(6) Once paragraph (d)(3) of this section applies, the 
employer must continue to compute the exempt amount on the 
basis of the written notice from the Internal Revenue 
Service until the Internal Revenue Service by written notice 
advises the employer to compute the exempt amount on the 
basis of a new verified statement (as described in paragraph 
(d)(7) of this section) and revokes its earlier written 
notice. 

(7) Once paragraph (d)(3) of this section applies, the 
employee may submit a new verified statement together with a 
written explanation of any circumstances of the employee 
which have changed since the Internal Revenue Service's 
earlier written notice, or any other circumstances or 
reasons as justification or support for the claims made by 
the employee on the new verified statement. The employee 
may submit the new verified statement and written 
explanation either_

(i) To the Internal Revenue Service office specified in 
the notice furnished to the employer under paragraph (d)(3) 
of this section; or 

(ii) To the employer, who must forward the new verified 
statement and written explanation to the Internal Revenue 
Service office specified in the notice earlier furnished to 
the employer on the next occasion on which the employer 
responds to the notice of levy. 

(e) 

Effective date. 

These provisions are effective with 
respect to levies made on or after July 1, 1989. However, 
any reasonable attempt by a taxpayer to comply with the 
statutory amendments addressed by these regulations prior to 
February 21, 1995 will be considered as meeting the requirements of these regulations.

This rule amends the regulatory program of the Minerals Management Service (MMS) to state specifically the authority
of MMS to require lessees or operators to conduct archaeological resource surveys and submit reports prior to exploration,
development and production, or installation of lease term or right-of-way pipelines. This rule also standardizes
the definition and use of the term ``archaeological resources'' within MMS's regulatory program. 
 


 
 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Since 1973, the Department of the Interior (DOI) has included a stipulation on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) mineral
lease tracts to notify potential lessees that, where applicable, archaeological resource surveys and reports will
be required. Lessees and operators have, since that time, submitted this information when the stipulation was invoked
by MMS. 
 
 
 


The authority to require this information was identified, in a general fashion, in a final rule published by MMS in
the 

Federal Register

 on April 1, 1988 (53 FR 10596). That rule granted authority to MMS Regions to ensure safety and environmental protection
by requiring OCS lessees and operators to conduct needed surveys and submit reports when seeking approval of their
plans to explore or develop and produce hydrocarbons or to install lease term or right-of-way pipelines. 
 
The MMS Regions issue further guidance in the form of Notices to Lessees and Operators (NTL's). These NTL's provide
detailed information on archaeological resource requirements. 
 
In order to convert the requirements contained in the archaeological lease stipulation into regulations, a proposed
rule was published by MMS on October 12, 1993 (58 FR 52731). The proposed rule sought to grant specific authority to
each MMS Regional Director to require archaeological resource surveys and reports. The proposed rule also made minor
modifications in 30 CFR parts 256 and 280 to standardize the use of the term ``archaeological resource,'' eliminate
use of other terms such as ``cultural resources,'' and provide uniform definitions. The routine requirements for
surveys and reports that were proposed in 30 CFR 250.26 are not located in   250.33 and 250.34. These surveys
and reports, when required, will normally be included in the exploration report or the development and production
report. Since   250.33 and 250.34 pertain to Exploration Plan and Development and Production Plan respectively,
the change will help to clarify the requirements. 
 
The comments received during the public comment period were reviewed, and an analysis was conducted within MMS. The
following is a discussion of the responses to comments received and any resultant text changes. 
 


Narrative Response to Comments 
 


Authority Citation 
 




Comment: 

One commenter suggested that we expand the authority section to include other applicable archaeological resource
legislation.

Response: 

The MMS has used the requirements of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA) 16 U.S.C. 470 et seq., the
Archaeological and Historic Preservation Act 16 U.S.C. 469-469c, and the Archaeological Resources Protection
Act of 1979 (ARPA) 16 U.S.C. 470aa-mm in developing the requirements in the regulations. However, MMS believes
that the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act provides sufficient authority for all requirements in the regulation.


Changes in Definitions




Comment: 

Two commenters suggested that we define the term ``archaeological resource'' to be consistent with the definition
provided in implementing regulations for the ARPA, 16 U.S.C. 470aa-mm, 43 CFR 7.3.


Response: 

We have changed the definition of ``archaeological resource'' to the wording recommended by the commenters with
one exception (with regard to the age criterion), to correspond to the definition provided in 43 CFR 7.3(a) (1) and
(2). The exception was to change the 100-year-old criterion for the age of an archaeological resource to a 50-year-old
criterion so that the MMS regulation is consistent with the NHPA criteria for eligibility to the National Register
of Historic Places. To improve the clarity of the rule, MMS added a definition of significant archaeological resource.


Archaeological Report Standards




Comment: 

One commenter suggested that we include documentation (report) standards in the archaeology rule. Another commenter
suggested that the reports submitted conform to the ``Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines for Archaeology
and Historic Preservation.''


Response: 

The MMS has developed detailed survey and report standards for OCS archaeological surveys based on more than 20 years
experience. These standards are contained in Region-specific NTL's. The MMS has chosen not to include the survey
and report standards in the rule. These standards are very detailed and vary from region to region due to differences
in regional geology and environmental conditions.


Basis for Requiring Archaeological Report




Comment: 

One commenter was concerned that in the proposed rule, the Regional Director would be permitted to make the determination
of whether an archaeological survey/report would be required. Another commenter suggested that we provide improved
guidance about the basis upon which a Regional Director would make the regulatory determination that an archaeological
resource exists in the proposed lease area.


Response: 

This decision as to whether or not a report is required is not made arbitrarily by the Regional Director. The MMS conducts
regional archaeological baseline studies to compile information on the locations of historic shipwrecks and coastal
prehistoric archaeological sites. These data are also used to construct predictive criteria for the occurrence
of unknown sites on the continental shelf.
Using these predictive criteria, MMS can identify portions of the continental shelf having potential for archaeological
resources. These ``archaeologically sensitive'' areas are used as the basis for requiring marine remote sensing
surveys to evaluate the archaeological site potential of individual lease tracts before permitting lease activities.

Information Submitted With the Archaeological Report 




Comment: 

One commenter suggested that a new  250.26(c) be added to require that the reports submitted to the Regional
Director include all the data, artifacts, records, and remains obtained during the investigations conducted pursuant
to 256.26 (a) and (b), pertaining to reporting requirements for the protection of possible or discovered archaeological
resources. 


Response: 

The marine remote sensing survey data collected to evaluate archaeological resources is maintained by the lessee
or right-of-way holder; however, the data must be made available to MMS upon request. The MMS maintains copies of the
archaeological reports prepared from the remote sensing survey data. Because the archaeological surveys conducted
prior to OCS activities are reconnaissance surveys, evidence of potential resources is used to avoid lessee activity
that could harm or disturb artifacts or remains. Thus, artifacts or remains are rarely recovered or disturbed. 


Archaeological Surveys and Grandfathered Leases 




Comment: 

One commenter suggested that MMS should continue its practice of requiring no archaeological surveys for grandfathered
leases. (The commenter's view is that a grandfathered lease is any lease issued by MMS prior to December 1973, the date
the first lease with an archaeological resource stipulation was issued). The commenter also indicated that existing
survey data on older leases should continue to be acceptable to MMS for exploration and most development activities
for as long as the lease remains in force. The commenter believes that although the aforementioned practices are not
specifically addressed or confirmed in the proposed regulations, it is implicit in the provisions thereof that MMS
does not intend for the proposed changes to the regulations to change these existing procedures. It is the commenter's
position that to do otherwise would directly impair existing lease contract rights. 


Response: 

The MMS does not agree that any lease issued prior to the inclusion of an archaeological resource lease stipulation
in December 1973 is grandfathered and exempt from the requirement to protect and preserve resources under either
the existing or proposed regulations. The archaeological stipulations included in OCS leases in December 1973 were
designed to ensure that lessees and other interested parties were aware of the need to protect and preserve archaeological
resources. The absence of an archaeological stipulation in an OCS lease issued prior to December 1973 does not free
the lessee of its obligation to protect and preserve resources. In accordance to  250.33(b)(15) or  250.34(b)(8)(v)(A),
if the Regional Director notifies the lessee that an archaeological resource may exist in the lease area, prior to
commencing any operations, the lessee is required to prepare a report as specified by the Regional Director to determine
the potential existence of any archaeological resource that may be affected by operations. Thus, the regulations
are applicable to any new exploration or development operations except preliminary activities (250.31). If there
are no new activities, production operations will continue with no changes in the status quo. 


Chance Find Clause 




Comment: 

One commenter recommended that treatment of unanticipated discoveries of archaeological resources during operations
be made consistent with DOI procedures by requiring a halt to operations until the Regional Director has told the lessee
how to protect the resource. Other commenters suggested that this clause, commonly called the ``chance finds clause,''
be changed to reflect the fact that not all discoveries made during operations will require protection.

Response:

 In response to these comments, wording changes were made to clarify that not all discoveries made during operations,
including operations conducted within a right-of-way, would require protection. To provide consistency between
sections, the wording of   250.26(b) and 250.159(c)(4) has been changed.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule; approval of amendments and removal of condition of program approval.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Secretary of the Interior is announcing the approval of a proposed amendment to the Wyoming permanent regulatory
program (hereinafter, the ``Wyoming program'') under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA
or the Act), and the removal of the remaining condition of program approval. The amendment addresses the recovery
of costs and expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred in connection with administrative and judicial review
proceedings under the Wyoming program. The amendment is intended to revise the Wyoming program to be consistent with
the corresponding Federal standards and to clarify State operating procedures.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background on the Wyoming Program



On November 26, 1980, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Wyoming program. General background
information on the Wyoming program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and conditions
of approval of the Wyoming program can be found in the November 26, 1980, 

Federal Register

 (45 FR 78637). Subsequent actions concerning Wyoming's program and program amendments can be found at 30 CFR 950.11,
950.12, 950.15, and 950.16.

On January 24, 1994, the Secretary of the Interior approved, with certain exceptions, amendments to the Wyoming program
provisions regarding the recovery of costs and expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred in connection with
administrative review proceedings under the Wyoming program. As a result of this decision, the condition of program
approval at 30 CFR 950.11(c) was modified to require Wyoming to revise section 35-11-437 of the Wyoming
Statutes (W.S.) to be consistent with the Federal requirements at section 525(e) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1275(e)) and
43 CFR 4.1290 through 4.1295 concerning the award of costs and expenses incurred in connection with administrative
and judicial proceedings (see 59 FR 3513). The amendment under consideration in the current rulemaking is intended
to satisfy this condition.



II. Submission of Amendment



By letter dated April 13, 1994 (Administrative Record No. WY-27-01), Wyoming submitted Enrolled Act
No. 4, which was adopted during the 1994 Budget Session of the Wyoming Legislature and signed into law by the Governor
on March 16, 1994, as a proposed amendment to its permanent program. The proposed amendment, which consists of statutory
changes to the Wyoming Environmental Quality Act (EQA), is intended to satisfy the condition of program approval
at 30 CFR 950.11(c), as modified on January 24, 1994 (59 FR 3513). Enrolled Act No. 4 revises W.S. 35-11-437
by (1) amending the introductory language of subsection (f) to change the word ``director'' to ``council,'' and add
the phrase ``or subsequent judicial review proceedings''; (2) repealing paragraphs (f)(i) and (f)(iii) in their
entirety; and (3) repealing subsection (g) in its entirety.

OSM announced receipt of the April 13, 1994, submittal in the May 2, 1994, 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 22571), and, in the same document, opened the public comment period and provided opportunity for a public hearing
on the substantive adequacy of the April 13, 1994, submittal. The public comment period closed on June 1, 1994. A public
hearing was not held because no one requested an opportunity to testify.



III. Secretary's Findings



Set forth below, pursuant to SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17, are the Secretary's findings
concerning the proposed amendment submitted by Wyoming on April 13, 1994.

1. Award of Costs and Expenses: Applicability to Judicial Proceedings and Administrative Proceedings under EQA
Sections Other than W.S. 35-11-437



Wyoming Enrolled Act No. 4 revises W.S. 35-11-437(f), the State counterpart to section 525(e) of SMCRA,
by providing in part that costs and expenses (including attorney's fees) incurred by parties in connection with a
proceeding under the EQA may be assessed against one or more of those parties only if the proceeding is a contested case
proceeding or subsequent judicial review proceeding. In relevant part, the revised statute reads as follows:





At the request of any person, a sum equal to the aggregate amount of all costs and expenses (including attorney's fees)
as determined by the council to have been reasonably incurred by the person for or in connection with his participation
in the proceeding, including any judicial review of agency actions, may be assessed against either party as the court
or the council deems proper. This subsection shall apply only to contested case proceedings or subsequent judicial
review proceedings under the provisions of this act relating to the regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation
operations in accordance with P.L. 95-87, as the law is worded on August 3, 1977.




In the decision announced in the January 24, 1994, 

Federal Register,

 the Secretary did not approve the introductory clause of the first sentence of W.S. 35-11-437(f) (``Whenever
an order is issued under this section,''), the words ``only'' and ``administrative'' in the second sentence of this
subsection (``This subsection shall apply only to administrative contested case proceedings * * *''),
and paragraph (i) of this subsection (``The issues resolved in the contested proceeding are those in the original
complaint that were raised within the statutory time frames under W.S. 35-11-406(p) or within an enforcement
action''). In concert with this action, the Secretary modified the condition of program approval at 30 CFR 950.11(c)
by adding paragraphs (1) and (2) to require Wyoming to clearly authorize the award of costs and expenses incurred in
connection with participation in (1) judicial review proceedings concerning agency actions, and (2) with respect
to awards from the State, any administrative contested case proceedings under the approved program, not just proceedings
concerning enforcement actions under W.S. 35-11-437 or actions taken under W.S. 35-11-406(p).
(See findings 3 and 6, 59 FR 3915-17, January 24, 1994.)

The current submittal repeals paragraph (f)(i) and the disapproved introductory clause discussed above and modifies
the remainder of W.S. 35-11-437(f) to clarify that this subsection applies to contested case proceedings
and subsequent judicial review proceedings under any SMCRA-related provisions of the EQA, not just enforcement
actions under W.S. 35-11-437 or proceedings pursuant to W.S. 35-11-406(p). Therefore, the
Secretary finds that the State has satisfied the requirements of 30 CFR 950.11(c) (1) and (2). Accordingly, he is approving
the proposed amendment and removing 30 CFR 950.11(c) (1) and (2).



2. Award of Costs and Expenses: Eligible Issues [W.S. 35-11-437(f)(i)]



Wyoming Enrolled Act No. 4 revises W.S. 35-11-437(f) by repealing paragraph (i), which provided a participant
in a proceeding is eligible to receive an award of costs and expenses from the State only if the issues resolved in the
contested proceeding were raised in the original complaint and within the statutory timeframes of W.S. 35-11-406(p)
or within an enforcement action.

As discussed in finding 3 of the January 24, 1994, 

Federal Register

 document (59 FR 3515-16), the Secretary did not approve the now-repealed provision because he found it to be
inconsistent with section 525(e) of SMCRA and 43 CFR 4.1290 through 4.1295. In addition, the Secretary modified the
condition of program approval at 30 CFR 950.11(c) by adding a paragraph (3), which, in part, required that Wyoming
revise its statute to remove the provision limiting awards to expenses incurred in connection with proceedings involving
issues raised in the original complaint.

The Secretary finds that Wyoming's repeal of W.S. 35-11-437(f)(i) satisfies the portion of 30 CFR 950.11(c)(3)
discussed above. Therefore, he is approving the proposed amendment and removing the pertinent portion of the program
condition.



3. Award of Costs and Expenses: Cap on Fees and Costs [W.S. 35-11-437(g)]



Wyoming Enrolled Act No. 4 revises W.S. 35-11-437 by repealing subsection (g), which provided that attorney's
fees, expert witness fees or other fees or costs shall not exceed $50.00 per hour.

As discussed in finding 7 of the January 24, 1994, 

Federal Register

 document (59 FR 3517), the Secretary did not approve the now-repealed provision because he found it to be inconsistent
with section 525(e) of SMCRA. In addition, he modified the condition of program approval at 30 CFR 950.11(c) by adding
a paragraph (3), which, in part, required that Wyoming revise its statute to authorize the award of all reasonably
incurred costs and expenses without placing any inflexible limits on the meaning of ``reasonably incurred.''

The Secretary finds that Wyoming's repeal of W.S. 35-11-437(g) and its hourly rate cap satisfies the portion
of 30 CFR 950.11(c)(3) discussed above. Therefore, he is approving the proposed amendment and removing the pertinent
portion of the program condition.



4. Award of Costs and Expenses: General [W.S. 35-11-437(f)]



Wyoming Enrolled Act No. 4 revises W.S. 35-11-437(f) by replacing the term ``director'' in the phrases
``as determined by the director'' and ``as the court or director deems proper'' with the term ``council.''

As discussed in finding 1 of the January 24, 1994, 

Federal Register

 document (59 FR 3514), the Secretary did not approve W.S. 35-11-437(f) to the extent that it referred to
``the Director'' rather than ``the Council'' (the State's administrative review entity) because he found it to be
inconsistent with 43 CFR 4.1291. In addition, he modified the condition of program approval at 30 CFR 950.11(c) by
adding a paragraph (4), which required that Wyoming revise its statute to clarify that, with respect to administrative
review proceedings, petitions for awards of costs and expenses must be filed with and reviewed and decided by the Environmental
Quality Council, not the Director of the Department of Environmental Quality.

The Secretary finds that Wyoming's revisions to W.S. 35-11-437(f) satisfy the requirements of 30 CFR
950.11(c)(4). Therefore, he is approving the proposed amendment and removing the pertinent portion of the condition
of program approval.



5. Award of Costs and Expenses: Requirement for Establishment of Existence of Violation [W.S. 35-11-437(f)(iii)]



Wyoming Enrolled Act No. 4 repeals W.S. 35-11-437(f)(iii), which allowed the award of costs and expenses
from the State only if the person claiming eligibility for such an award establishes the existence of a specific violation
of an applicable statute or rule.

As discussed in finding 5 of the January 24, 1994, 

Federal Register

 decision document (59 FR 3516), the Secretary did not approve W.S. 35-11-437(f)(iii) because he found
it to be inconsistent with section 525(e) of SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 43 CFR 4.1294(b). In addition, he
modified the condition of program approval at 30 CFR 950.11(c) by adding a paragraph (5), which required that Wyoming
revise its statute to eliminate the requirement that the person establish the existence of a specific violation of
applicable statute or rule as a prerequisite for awards from the State.

The Secretary finds that Wyoming's repeal of W.S. 35-11-437(f)(iii) satisfies the requirements of 30
CFR 950.11(c)(5). Therefore, he is approving the proposed amendment and removing the pertinent portion of the condition
of program approval.



IV. Summary and Disposition of Comments



Public Comments



OSM announced receipt of the April 13, 1994, submittal in the May 2, 1994, 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 22571), and, in the same document, opened the public comment period and provided opportunity for a public hearing
on the substantive adequacy of the April 13, 1994, submittal. The public comment period closed on June 1, 1994. A public
hearing was not held because no one requested an opportunity to testify.

<TEXT>
 

Written comments were received from the Powder River Basin Resource Council (PRBRC) (Administrative Record No.
WY-27-12). A summary of these comments and their disposition is set forth below:

1. PRBRC expressed concern that the wording of the phrase ``may be assessed against either party as the court or the
council deems proper'' in W.S. 35-11-437(f) is too broad. The commenter stated that it should be limited
by adding the clause ``in conformity with 43 CFR 4.1290 through 4.1295.'' In addition, PRBRC stated that the phrase
``and shall include all classes of actions in which participants would be eligible for an award of costs and expenses
under 43 CFR 4.1290 through 4.1295'' should be inserted after ``in accordance with P.L. 95-87'' in W.S. 35-11-437(f)
to clarify the classes of actions in connection with which participants would be eligible for awards of costs and expenses.

The Secretary does not agree that the suggested additional language is either necessary or proper. The statutory
language adopted by Wyoming is substantively identical to and therefore consistent with section 525(e) of SMCRA,
which also contains an unmodified ``deems proper'' standard. Furthermore, the Wyoming Department of Environmental
Quality's Rules of Practice and Procedures contain counterparts to 43 CFR 4.1290 through 4.1295. On January 24, 1994,
OSM approved these Wyoming Rules as being consistent with the Federal rules cited by the commenter (see 59 3515). Therefore,
no further statutory revisions are needed.

2. PRBRC opposes deletion of the word ``administrative'' in the phrase ``shall apply only to administrative contested
case proceedings'' in W.S. 35-11-437(f). The commenter argues that the term ``contested case'' should
be deleted instead.

The Secretary does not agree. As discussed in finding 2 of the January 24, 1994, decision document (59 FR 3515), the
Secretary found use of the term ``contested case'' to be consistent with section 525(e) of SMCRA and its implementing
regulations, as interpreted by case law. Deletion of the adjective ``administrative'' merely eliminates a redundancy
since Wyoming's Administrative Procedure Act, at W.S. 16-3-101(b)(ii), effectively defines ``contested
case'' as an administrative proceeding other than rulemaking. Finally, the January 24, 1994, decision document
states that the Secretary's approval is predicated upon Wyoming's interpretation of the term contested case as including
all classes of actions in which participants would be eligible for an award of costs and expenses under 43 CFR 4.1290
through 4.1295. Therefore, there is no need to make the changes sought by the commenter.

3. PRBRC expressed concern that the clause ``as the law is worded on August 3, 1977'', which modifies the phrase ``in
accordance with P.L. 95-87'' in W.S. 35-11-437(f), may cause the State law to become less stringent
than SMCRA as the Act evolves. The Secretary finds that this concern is misplaced. Under 30 CFR 732.17(d), the Director
of OSM must promptly notify the State of any changes in SMCRA that will require an amendment to the State program.

4. PRBRC objected to the provision in W.S. 35-11-437(f) which specifies that a person who did not initiate
a proceeding may receive an award of costs and expenses from the State only if that person's contribution is separate
and distinct from the contribution made by the person initiating the proceeding. The commenter stated that this provision
could cause confusion and could be interpreted as being additive to the requirement that the person make a substantial
contribution to a full and fair determination of the issues. As discussed in finding 4 of the January 24, 1994, decision
document, the Secretary previously approved this provision, noting that the ``separate and distinct'' requirement
is an implicit component of the ``substantial contribution'' requirement, and is not inconsistent with section
525(e) of SMCRA or its implementing regulations (see 59 FR 3516).

Federal Agency Comments


Pursuant to section 503(b) of SMCRA and its implementing regulations at 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), comments were solicited
from various Federal agencies with an actual or potential interest in the Wyoming program. None of these agencies
provided any objection to approval of the submittal.


State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) and Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) Comments


As required by 30 CFR 732.17(h)(4), OSM provided the submittal to the SHPO and ACHP for comment. No comments were received.


Environmental Protection Agency Concurrence


Under 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(ii), OSM must obtain the written concurrence of the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) before approving any provisions of a proposed State program amendment that relate to air
or water quality standards promulgated under the authority of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 

et seq

.) or the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 

et seq

.). None of the provisions of this proposed amendment relate to air or water quality standards. Hence, no concurrence
is needed.


V. Secretary's Decision


Based on the above findings, the Secretary is approving Wyoming's proposed program amendment as submitted on April
13, 1994. Because this amendment fully satisfies the requirements of the condition of program approval at 30 CFR 950.11(c),
he is also removing this condition.
The Federal regulations at 30 CFR part 950 codifying decisions concerning the Wyoming program are being amended to
implement this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State program amendment
process and to encourage States to bring their programs into conformity with the Federal standards without undue
delay. Consistency of State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA.


VI. Procedural Determinations


Compliance with Executive Order 12866


This final rule is exempt from review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory
Planning and Review).

Compliance with Executive Order 12778



The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments
since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA
(30 U.S.C. 1253 and 12550) and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed
State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the requirements
of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.



Compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act



No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).



Paperwork Reduction Act



This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by the Office of Management
and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 

et seq.

).



Compliance With the Regulatory Flexibility Act



The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an
economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Hence, this rule will ensure that existing requirements previously
promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule would have
a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart Federal regulations.

Certifications and Exemptions Under the 
International Regulations for Preventing 
Collisions at Sea, 1972; Amendment



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of the Navy, DOD.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of the Navy is amending its certifications and exemptions under the International Regulations for
Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972 (72 COLREGS), to reflect that the Judge Advocate General of the Navy has determined
Large Harbor Tugs YTB 780 and YTB 789 are vessels of the Navy which, due to their special construction and purpose, cannot
comply fully with certain provisions of the 72 COLREGS without interfering with their special functions as Large
Harbor Tugs. The intended effect of this rule is to warn mariners in waters where 72 COLREGS apply.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

 Pursuant to the authority granted in 33 U.S.C. 1605, the Department of the Navy amends 32 CFR part 706. This amendment
provides notice that the Judge Advocate General of the Navy, under authority delegated by the Secretary of the Navy,
has certified that Large Harbor Tugs YTB 780 and YTB 789 are vessels of the Navy which, due to their special construction
and purpose, cannot comply fully with 72 COLREGS: Rule 21(c), pertaining to the location and arc of visibility of the
sternlight; Rule 24(c), pertaining to the towing lights displayed by power driven vessels when pushing ahead or towing
alongside; Rule 27(b)(i), pertaining to the lights displayed by vessels restricted in their ability to maneuver;
Annex I, section 2(a)(i), pertaining to the height above the hull of the masthead light; and Annex I, section 3(b),
pertaining to the placement of the sidelights, without interfering with their special functions as Large Harbor
Tugs. YTB 780 and YTB 789 are tugs of special construction and functions. They perform towing services for naval vessels.




In the case of these tugs, the mast is hinged and is lowered only when the tugs are actually engaged in towing alongside
or pushing ships having radically flared bows or sponsoned sides and sterns. When the mast is in the lowered position,
the masthead lights, and task lights mounted on this mast, cannot be displayed. During such operations only the pilot
house top-mounted auxiliary masthead light, sidelights, and sternlight will be exhibited. 

The Judge Advocate General of the Navy has also certified that the aforementioned lights are located in closest possible
compliance with the applicable 72 COLREGS requirements.

Moreover, it has been determined, in accordance with 32 CFR parts 296 and 701, that publication of this amendment for
public comment prior to adoption is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to public interest since it is based
on technical findings that the placement of lights on these vessels in a manner differently from that prescribed herein
will adversely affect the vessels ability to perform their military functions.

ACTION: 

Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of the Air Force is revising its Privacy Act Regulation. The revision adds a requirement for appointing
Privacy Act (PA) monitors at HQ USAF and Secretary of the Air Force (SAF) offices; adds alternative of using the unsworn
declaration; changes the fee rates; changes policy on releasing medical records to a subject when there is possible
harm; changes refusal to amend based on opinion or interpretation to a denial with appeal rights; changes list of information
releasable without consent; provides a new balancing test; aligns language on medical records of minors with DoD
guidance; adds computer matching provisions; adds systems; and deletes provision for landfill burials. 


In addition to the above changes, the Department of the Air Force is currently conducting a review of its exemption
rules. Upon completion of the review, the Department of the Air Force will update its exemption rules. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Executive Order 12866 

The Director, Administration and Management, Office of the Secretary of Defense has determined that this Privacy
Act rule for the Department of Defense does not constitute `significant regulatory action'. Analysis of the rule
indicates that it does not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; does not create a serious inconsistency
or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; does not materially alter the budgetary
impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof;
does not raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in Executive Order 12866 (1993).




Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 

The Director, Administration and Management, Office of the Secretary of Defense certifies that this Privacy Act
rule for the Department of Defense does not have significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
because it is concerned only with the administration of Privacy Act systems of records within the Department of Defense.




Paperwork Reduction Act 

The Director, Administration and Management, Office of the Secretary of Defense certifies that this Privacy Act
rule for the Department of Defense imposes no information requirements beyond the Department of Defense and that
the information collected within the Department of Defense is necessary and consistent with 5 U.S.C. 552a, known
as the Privacy Act of 1974. 
The Department of the Air Force previously published its proposed rule on July 28, 1994, at 59 FR 38389. No comments
were received that resulted in a contrary determination, therefore, the Department of the Air Force is publishing
this final rule.

Subpart A - Overview of the Privacy Act Program



 806b.1 

Basic guidelines. 


The Privacy Act of 1974 and this part apply only to information in Air Force systems of records on living United States
citizens and permanent resident aliens. 

(a) An official system of records must be: 
(1) Authorized by law or Executive Order.
(2) Controlled by an Air Force or lower level directive.
(3) Needed to carry out an Air Force mission or function. 




(b) The Air Force does not: 
(1) Keep records on how a person exercises First Amendment rights. EXCEPTIONS are when: The Air Force has the permission
of that individual or is authorized by federal statute; or the information pertains to an authorized law enforcement
activity.
(2) Penalize or harass an individual for exercising rights guaranteed under the Privacy Act. Give reasonable aid
to individuals exercising their rights.




(c) Air Force members: 
(1) Keep paper and electronic records containing personal information and retrieved by name or personal identifier

(b) Disclosing information from a system of records to someone not entitled to the information.
(c) Obtaining someone else's records under false pretenses.




 806b.3 

Personal notes. 


If you keep personal notes on individuals to use as memory aids to supervise or perform other official functions, and

(4) Review all publications and forms for compliance with this part.
(5) Review system notices.
(6) Investigate complaints. 
(7) Staff denial recommendations (at MAJCOMs and FOAs only).




(g) System Managers: 
(1) Decide the need for, and content of systems.
(2) Manage and safeguard the system.
(3) Train personnel on Privacy Act requirements.
(4) Protect records from unauthorized disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
(5) Prepare system notices and reports.
(6) Answer Privacy Act requests.
(7) Keep records of disclosures.
(8) Evaluate the systems annually.




(h) Privacy Act Monitors (PAM): 
(1) Are the focal point in their functional area for general Privacy Act questions and correspondence.
(2) Maintain a list of all systems of records and system managers in their area.
(3) Act as liaison with the Privacy Act Officer.
(4) Maintain statistics for the annual Privacy Act report.





Subpart B - Obtaining Law Enforcement Records and Promises of Confidentiality




 806b.5 

Obtaining law enforcement records. 


The Commander AFOSI; the Chief, Air Force Security Police Agency (AFSPA); MAJCOM, FOA, and base chiefs of security
police; AFOSI detachment commanders; and designees of those offices may ask another agency for records for law enforcement
under 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(7). The requesting office must indicate in writing the specific part of the record desired
and identify the law enforcement activity asking for the record.




 806b.6 

Promising confidentiality. 


Record promises of confidentiality to exempt from disclosure any `confidential' information under subsections
(k)(2), (k)(5), or (k)(7) of the Privacy Act. 





Subpart C - Collecting Personal Information 


 

  806b.7 

How to collect personal information. 


Collect personal information directly from the subject of the record when possible. You may ask third parties when:

(a) You must verify information.
(b) You want opinions or evaluations.
(c) You can't contact the subject. 
(d) The subject asks you. 




 806b.8 

When to give Privacy Act statements (PAS). 


(a) Give a PAS orally or in writing: 
(1) To anyone from whom you are collecting personal information that will be put in a system of records. 
(2) Whenever you ask someone for his or her Social Security Number (SSN). 

Note: 

Do this regardless of how you collect or record the answers. You may display a sign in areas where people routinely furnish
this kind of information. Give a copy of the PAS if asked. Do not ask the person to sign the PAS. 
(3) A PAS must include four items: (i) Authority: The legal authority, that is, the United States Code or Executive
Order authorizing the program the system supports. 
(ii) Purpose: The reason you are collecting the information. 
(iii) Routine Uses: A list of where and why the information will be disclosed outside DoD. 
(iv) Disclosure: Voluntary or Mandatory. (Use Mandatory only when disclosure is required by law and the individual
will be penalized for not providing information.) Include any consequences of nondisclosure in nonthreatening
language.




 806b.9 

Requesting the social security number (SSN). 


(a) Do not deny people a legal right, benefit, or privilege for refusing to give their SSNs unless the law requires disclosure,
or a law or regulation adopted before January 1, 1975, required the SSN and the Air Force uses it to verify a person's
identity in a system of records established before that date. When you ask for an SSN to create a record, tell the individual:

(1) The statute, regulation, or rule authorizing you to ask for the SSN.
(2) The uses that will be made of the SSN.
(3) If he or she is legally obligated to provide the SSN. 
(b) The Air Force requests an individual's SSN and provides the individual information required by law when anyone
enters military service or becomes an Air Force civilian employee. The Air Force uses the SSN as a service or employment
number to reference the individual's official records. When you ask someone for an SSN as identification (ID) to retrieve
an existing record, you do not have to restate this information.
(c) Executive Order 9397, November 22, 1943, authorizes using the SSN as a personal identifier. This order is not adequate
authority to collect an SSN to create a record. When law does not require disclosing the SSN or when the system of records
was created after January 1, 1975, you may ask for the SSN, but the individual does not have to disclose it. If the individual
refuses to respond, use alternative means of identifying records. 
(d) SSNs are personal and unique to each individual. Protect them as FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY (FOUO). Do not disclose them
to anyone without an official need to know.





Subpart D - Giving Access to Privacy Act Records




 806b.10 

Making a request for access. 


Persons or their designated representatives may ask for a copy of their records in a system of records. Requesters
need not state why they want access to their records. Verify the identity of the requester to avoid unauthorized disclosures.
How you verify identity will depend on the sensitivity of the requested records. Persons without access to notary
services may use an unsworn declaration in the following format: `I declare under penalty of perjury (if outside the
United States, add `under the laws of the United States of America') that the foregoing is true and correct. Executed
on (date). (Signature).' 




 806b.11 

Processing a request for access. 


Consider a request from an individual for his or her own records in a system of records under both the Freedom of Information
Act (FOIA) and the Privacy Act regardless of the Act cited. The requester need not cite any Act. Process the request
under whichever Act gives the most information. When necessary, tell the requester under which Act you processed
the request and why.




(a) Requesters should describe the records they want. They do not have to name a system of records number, but they should
at least name a type of record or functional area. For requests that ask for `all records about me,' ask for more information
and tell the person how to review the Air Force systems of records published in the 

Federal Register

 or in AFDIR 37-144
, `Privacy Act Systems of Record' (formerly AFR 4-36).





(b) Requesters should not use government equipment, supplies, stationery, postage, telephones, or official mail
channels for making Privacy Act requests. Privacy Act Officers and system managers process such requests but tell
requesters that using government resources to make Privacy Act requests is not authorized.
(c) Tell the requester if a record exists and how to review the record. If possible, respond to requests within 10 workdays
of receiving them. If you cannot answer the request in 10 workdays, send a letter explaining why and give an approximate
completion date no more than 20 workdays after the first office received the request.
(d) Show or give a copy of the record to the requester within 30 workdays of receiving the request unless the system is
exempt and the Air Force lists the exemption in appendix C of this part; or published as a final rule in the 

Federal Register

. Give information in a form the requester can understand.
(e) If the requester wants another person present during the record review, the system manager may ask for written
consent to authorize discussing the record with another person present.




 806b.12 

Fees. 


Give the first 100 pages free, and charge only reproduction costs for the remainder. Copies cost $.15 per page; microfiche
costs $.25 per fiche. Charge the fee for the first 100 pages if records show that the Air Force already responded to a
request for the same records at no charge. Do not charge fees: 
(a) When the requester can get the record without charge under another publication (for example, medical records).
(b) For search.
(c) For reproducing a document for the convenience of the Air Force.
(d) For reproducing a record so the requester can review it.




 806b.13 

Denying or limiting access. 


Process access denials within five workdays after you receive a request for access. When you may not release a record,
send a copy of the request, the record, and why you recommend denying access (including the applicable exemption)
to the denial authority through the Staff Judge Advocate (SJA) and the Privacy Act officer. The SJA gives a written
legal opinion on the denial. The MAJCOM or FOA Privacy Act officer reviews the file, gets written advice from the SJA
and the functional office of primary responsibility (OPR), and makes a recommendation to the denial authority. The
denial authority sends the requester a letter with the decision. If the denial authority grants access, release the
record. If the denial authority refuses access, tell the requester why and explain pertinent appeal rights. 



(a) Before you deny a request for access to a record, make sure that: (1) The system has an SAF approved exemption.
(2) The exemption covers each document.
(3) Nonexempt parts are segregated.




(b) You may refuse to give out medical records if a physician believes that doing so could harm the person's mental or
physical health. You have these options: (1) Ask the requester to get a letter from a physician to whom you can send the
records. Include a letter explaining to the physician that giving the records directly to the individual could be
harmful. 
(2) Offer the services of a military physician other than one who provided treatment if naming the physician poses
a hardship on the individual. 




(c) Do not delete third-party information from a record when the subject requests access, except as noted in  806b.13(d),
unless the Air Force covers the record with an established exemption (appendix C of this part). Presume that all information
in a file pertains to the subject of the file. 
(d) Do not release third-party personal data (such as SSN and home address). This action is not a denial.
(e) Withhold records compiled in connection with a civil action or other proceeding including any action where the
Air Force expects judicial or administrative adjudicatory proceedings. This exemption does not cover criminal
actions. Do not release attorney work products prepared before, during, or after the action or proceeding.




 806b.14 

Denial authorities. 


These officials or a designee may deny access or amendment of records. Send a letter to SAF/AAIA with the position titles
of designees. You must get SAF/AA approval before delegating this authority to a lower level. Send requests for waiver
with justification to SAF/AAIA. Authorities are: 
(a) DCSs and chiefs of comparable offices or higher level at SAF or HQ USAF.
(b) MAJCOM or FOA commanders.
(c) HQ USAF/DPCP, Pentagon, Washington, DC 20330-5060 (for civilian personnel records).
(d) Commander, Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI), Washington, DC 20332-6001 (for AFOSI records).


 


Subpart E - Amending the Record



 806b.15 

Amendment reasons. 


Individuals may ask to have their records amended to make them accurate, timely, relevant, or complete. System managers
routinely correct a record if the requester can show that it is factually wrong. 




 806b.16 

Responding to amendment requests: 


(a) Anyone may request minor corrections orally. Requests for more serious modifications should be in writing. 
(b) After verifying the identity of the requester, make the change, notify all known recipients of the record, and
inform the individual. 
(c) Acknowledge requests within 10 workdays of receipt. Give an expected completion date unless you complete the
change within that time. Final decisions must take no longer than 30 workdays. 




 806b.17 

Approving or denying a record amendment. 


The Air Force does not usually amend a record when the change is based on opinion, interpretation, or subjective official
judgment. This action constitutes a denial, and requesters may appeal. If the system manager decides not to amend
or partially amend the record, send a copy of the request, the record, and the recommended denial reasons to the denial
authority through the SJA and the Privacy Act officer. SJAs will include a legal opinion.
(a) The MAJCOM or FOA Privacy Act officer reviews the proposed denial, gets a legal opinion from the SJA and written
advice from the functional OPR, and makes a recommendation to the denial authority. 
(b) The denial authority sends the requester a letter with the decision. If the denial authority approves the request,
amend the record and notify all previous recipients that it has been changed. If the authority denies the request,
give the requester the statutory authority, reason, and pertinent appeal rights.




 806b.18 

Seeking review of unfavorable agency determinations. 


Requesters should pursue record corrections of subjective matters and opinions through proper channels to the Civilian
Personnel Office using grievance procedures or the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records (AFBCMR).
Record correction requests denied by the AFBCMR are not subject to further consideration under this part.




 806b.19 

Appeal procedures. 


(a) Individuals may request a denial review by writing to the Secretary of the Air Force through the denial authority
within 60 calendar days after receiving a denial letter. The denial authority promptly sends a complete appeal package
to SAF/AAIA, including: 
(1) Original appeal letter.
(2) Initial request.
(3) Initial denial.
(4) Copy of the record.
(5) Any internal records or coordination actions relating to the denial.
(6) Denial authority's comments on the appellant's arguments.
(7) Legal reviews.




(b) If the denial authority reverses an earlier denial and grants access or amendment, notify the requester immediately.
(c) SAF/AAIA reviews the denial and forwards to SAF/GCA for legal review or staffing to grant or deny the appeal. SAF/GCA
tells the requester the final Air Force decision and explains judicial review rights.
(d) The requester may file a concise statement of disagreement with the system manager if SAF/GCA denies the request
to amend the record. SAF/GCA explains the requester's rights when they issue the final appeal decision. 




(1) The records should clearly show that a statement of disagreement is filed with the record or separately. 
(2) The disputed part of the record must show that the requester filed a statement of disagreement. 
(3) Give copies of the statement of disagreement to the record's previous recipients. Inform subsequent record users
about the dispute and give them a copy of the statement with the record. 
(4) The system manager may include a brief summary of the reasons for not amending the record. Limit the summary to the
reasons SAF/GCA gave to the individual. The summary is part of the individual's record, but it is not subject to amendment
procedures.


 

 806b.20 

Contents of Privacy Act case files. 


Do not keep copies of disputed records in this file. Use the file solely for statistics and to process requests. Do not
use the case files to make any kind of determination about an individual. Document reasons for untimely responses.
These files include: 




(a) Requests from and replies to individuals on whether a system has records about them.
(b) Requests for access or amendment.
(c) Approvals, denials, appeals, and final review actions.
(d) Coordination actions and related papers.


 


Subpart F - Privacy Act Notifications


 806b.21 

When to include a Privacy Act warning statement in publications. 


Include a Privacy Act Warning Statement in each Air Force publication that requires collecting or keeping personal
information in a system of records. Also include the warning statement when publications direct collection of the
SSN from the individual. The warning statement will cite legal authority and the system of records number and title.
You can use the following warning statement: `This part requires collecting and maintaining information protected
by the Privacy Act of 1974 authorized by (U.S.C. citation and or Executive Order number). System of records notice
(number and title) applies.'




 806b.22 

Publishing system notices. 


The Air Force must publish notices in the 

Federal Register

 of new, amended, and deleted systems to inform the public of what records the Air Force keeps and give them an opportunity
to comment. The Privacy Act also requires submission of new or significantly altered systems to the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) and both houses of the Congress before publication in the 

Federal Register

. This includes:




(a) Starting a new system.
(b) Instituting significant changes to an existing system.
(c) Sending out data collection forms or instructions.
(d) Issuing a request for proposal or invitation for bid to support a new system. 




 806b.23 

Timing of notices. 


At least 120 days before the effective start date, system managers must send the system notice to SAF/AAIA on a 5 1/4
or 3 1/2-inch disk in Wordstar (ASCII text file) or Microsoft Word, with a paper copy highlighting any changes
through the MAJCOM or FOA Privacy Act Officer. See Appendix B of this part for a sample system notice.





Subpart G - Protecting and Disposing of Records


 806b.24 

Protecting records. 


Protect information according to its sensitivity level. Consider the personal sensitivity of the information and
the risk of loss or alteration. Most information in systems of records is FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY (FOUO). Refer to AFI
37-131
, `Air Force Freedom of Information Act Program,' for protection methods. 





 806b.25 

Balancing protection. 


Balance additional protection against risk and cost. AF Form 3227, `Privacy Act Cover Sheet', is available for use
with Privacy Act material. For example, a password may be enough protection for an automated system with a log-on protocol.
Classified computer systems or those with established audit and password systems are obviously less vulnerable
than unprotected files or word processors in offices that are periodically empty. Follow AFI 33-202
, `The Air Force Computer Security Program,' for procedures on safeguarding personal information in automated records.





 806b.26 

Disposing of records. 


You may use the following methods to dispose of records protected by the Privacy Act according to records retention
schedules: 




(a) Destroy by any method that prevents compromise, such as tearing, burning, or shredding, so long as the personal
data is not recognizable and beyond reconstruction.
(b) Degauss or overwrite magnetic tapes or other magnetic medium. 
(c) Dispose of paper products through the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office (DRMO) or through activities
who manage a base-wide recycling program. The recycling sales contract must contain a clause requiring the contractor
to safeguard privacy material until its destruction and to pulp, macerate, shred, or otherwise completely destroy
the records. Originators must safeguard Privacy Act material until it is transferred to the recycling contractor.
A federal employee or, if authorized, a contractor employee must witness the destruction. This transfer does not
require a disclosure accounting.


 
 

Subpart H - Privacy Act Exemptions


 806b.27 

Requesting an exemption. 


A system manager who believes that a system needs an exemption from some or all of the requirements of the Privacy Act
should send a request to SAF/AAIA through the MAJCOM or FOA Privacy Act Officer. The request should detail the reasons
for the exemption and the section of the Act that allows the exemption. SAF/AAIA gets approval for the request through
SAF/AA and the Defense Privacy Office.




 806b.28 

Exemption types.


(a) A general exemption frees a system from most parts of the Privacy Act. 
(b) A specific exemption frees a system from only a few parts of the Privacy Act. 




 806b.29 

Authorizing exemptions. 


Only SAF/AA can exempt systems of records from any part of the Privacy Act. Denial authorities can withhold records
using these exemptions only if SAF/AA previously approved and published an exemption for the system in the 

Federal Register

. Appendix C of this part lists the systems of records that have approved exemptions. 




 806b.30 

Approved exemptions. 


Approved exemptions exist under 5 U.S.C. 552a for:
(a) Certain systems of records used by activities whose principal function is criminal law enforcement (subsection
(j)(2)).
(b) Classified information in any system of records (subsection (k)(1)).
(c) Law enforcement records (other than those covered by subsection (j)(2)). The Air Force must allow an individual
access to any record that is used to deny rights, privileges or benefits to which he or she would otherwise be entitled
by federal law or for which he or she would otherwise be eligible as a result of the maintenance of the information (unless
doing so would reveal a confidential source) (subsection (k)(2)).
(d) Statistical records required by law. Data is for statistical use only and may not be used to decide individuals'
rights, benefits, or entitlements (subsection (k)(4)).
(e) Data to determine suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for federal service or contracts, or access to
classified information if access would reveal a confidential source (subsection (k)(5)).
(f) Qualification tests for appointment or promotion in the federal service if access to this information would compromise
the objectivity of the tests (subsection (k)(6)).
(g) Information which the Armed Forces uses to evaluate potential for promotion if access to this information would
reveal a confidential source (subsection (k)(7)).


 


Subpart I - Disclosing Records to Third Parties 


 806b.31 

Disclosure considerations. 


Before releasing personal information to third parties, consider the consequences, check accuracy, and make sure
that no law or directive bans disclosure. You can release personal information to third parties when the subject agrees
orally or in writing. Air Force members consent to releasing their home telephone number and address when they sign
and check the `Do Consent' block on the AF Form 624, `Base/Unit Locator and PSC Directory' (see AFI 37-129
, `Base and Unit Personnel Locators and Postal Directories'). 





(a) Before including personal information such as home addresses, home phones, and similar information on social
rosters or directories, ask for written consent statements. Otherwise, do not include the information.
(b) You must get written consent before releasing any of these items of information: (1) Marital status.
(2) Number and sex of dependents.
(3) Gross salary of military personnel (see  806b.32 for releasable pay information). 
(4) Civilian educational degrees and major areas of study.
(5) School and year of graduation.
(6) Home of record.
(7) Home address and phone.
(8) Age and date of birth.
(9) Present or future assignments for overseas or for routinely deployable or sensitive units.
(10) Office and unit address and duty phone for overseas or for routinely deployable or sensitive units.




 806b.32 

Disclosing information for which consent is not required. 


You don't need consent before releasing any of these items: 
(a) Information releasable under the FOIA. 
(b) Information for use within the Department of Defense by officials or employees with a need to know.
(c) Name.
(d) Rank.
(e) Grade. 
(f) Air Force specialty code (AFSC).
(g) Pay (including base pay, special pay, all allowances except Basic Allowance for Quarters (BAQ) and Variable Housing
Allowance (VHA)). 
(h) Gross salary for civilians.
(i) Past duty assignments. 
(j) Present and future approved and announced stateside assignments. 
(k) Position title.
(l) Office, unit address, and duty phone number.
(m) Date of rank.
(n) Entered on active duty (EAD) date.
(o) Pay date. 
(p) Source of commission.
(q) Professional military education.
(r) Promotion sequence number.
(s) Military awards and decorations.
(t) Duty status of active, retired, or reserve. 
(u) Active duty official attendance at technical, scientific, or professional meetings.
(v) Biographies and photos of key personnel.





 806b.33 

Disclosing other information. 


Use these guidelines to decide whether to release information: (a) Would the subject have a reasonable expectation
of privacy in the information requested? 
(b) Would disclosing the information benefit the general public? The Air Force considers information as meeting
the public interest standard if it reveals anything regarding the operations or activities of the agency, or performance
of its statutory duties. 
(c) Balance the public interest against the individual's probable loss of privacy. Do not consider the requester's
purpose, circumstances, or proposed use. 




 806b.34 

Agencies or individuals to whom the Air Force may release privacy information. 


The Air Force may release information without consent to these individuals or agencies:
(a) Agencies outside the Department of Defense for a Routine Use published in the 

Federal Register

. The purpose of the disclosure must be compatible with the purpose in the Routine Use. When initially collecting the
information from the subject, the Routine Uses block in the Privacy Act Statement must name the agencies and reason.
(b) The Bureau of the Census to plan or carry out a census or survey under 13 U.S.C. 8.
(c) A recipient for statistical research or reporting. The recipient must give advanced written assurance that the
information is for statistical purposes only. 

Note: 

No one may use any part of the record to decide on individuals' rights, benefits, or entitlements. You must release
records in a format that makes it impossible to identify the real subjects. 
(d) The Archivist of the United States and the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) to evaluate records
for permanent retention. Records stored in Federal Records Centers remain under Air Force control.
(e) A federal, state, or local agency (other than the Department of Defense) for civil or criminal law enforcement.
The head of the agency or a designee must send a written request to the system manager specifying the record or part needed
and the law enforcement purpose. The system manager may also disclose a record to a law enforcement agency if the agency
suspects a criminal violation. This disclosure is a Routine Use for all Air Force systems of records and is published
in the 

Federal Register

. 
(f) An individual or agency that needs the information for compelling health or safety reasons. The affected individual
need not be the record subject.
(g) The Congress, a congressional committee, or a subcommittee, for matters within their jurisdictions.
(h) A congressional office acting for the record subject. A published, blanket Routine Use permits this disclosure.
If the material for release is sensitive, get a release statement.
(i) The Comptroller General or an authorized representative of the General Accounting Office on business.
(j) A court order of a court of competent jurisdiction, signed by a judge. 
(k) A consumer credit agency according to the Debt Collections Act when a published system notice lists this disclosure
as a Routine Use.
(l) A contractor operating a system of records under an Air Force contract. Records maintained by the contractor for
the management of contractor employees are not subject to the Privacy Act.




 806b.35 

Disclosing the medical records of minors. 


Air Force personnel may disclose the medical records of minors to their parents or legal guardians. The laws of each
state define the age of majority. 
(a) The Air Force must obey state laws protecting medical records of drug or alcohol abuse treatment, abortion, and
birth control. If you manage medical records, learn the local laws and coordinate proposed local policies with the
servicing SJA.
(b) Outside the United States (overseas), the age of majority is 18. Unless parents or guardians have a court order
granting access or the minor's written consent, they will not have access to minor's medical records overseas when
the minor sought or consented to treatment between the ages of 15 and 17 in a program where regulation or statute provides
confidentiality of records and he or she asked for confidentiality.




 806b.36 

Disclosure accountings. 


System managers must keep an accurate record of all disclosures made from any system of records except disclosures
to DoD personnel for official use or disclosures under the FOIA. System managers may use AF Form 771, `Accounting of
Disclosures'.
(a) System managers may file the accounting record any way they want as long as they give it to the subject on request,
send corrected or disputed information to previous record recipients, explain any disclosures, and provide an audit
trail for reviews. Include in each accounting:




(1) Release date. 
(2) Description of information. 
(3) Reason for release. 
(4) Name and address of recipient. 
(b) Some exempt systems let you withhold the accounting record from the subject.
(c) You may withhold information about disclosure accountings for law enforcement purposes at the law enforcement
agency's request. 




 806b.37 

Computer matching. 


Computer matching programs electronically compare records from two or more automated systems which may include
the Department of Defense, another federal agency, or a state or other local government. A system manager proposing
a match that could result in an adverse action against a federal employee must meet these requirements of the Privacy
Act:
(a) Prepare a written agreement between participants. (1) Secure approval of the Defense Data Integrity Board. 
(2) Publish a matching notice in the 

Federal Register

 before matching begins.
(3) Ensure full investigation and due process.
(4) Act on the information, as necessary. 
(b) The Privacy Act applies to matching programs that use records from: (1) Federal personnel or payroll systems.
(2) Federal benefit programs where matching: (i) Determines federal benefit eligibility, 
(ii) Checks on compliance with benefit program requirements,
(iii) Recovers improper payments or delinquent debts from current or former beneficiaries.
(c) Matches used for statistics, pilot programs, law enforcement, tax administration, routine administration,
background checks and foreign counterintelligence, and internal matching that won't cause any adverse action are
exempt from Privacy Act matching requirements.
(d) Any activity that expects to participate in a matching program must contact SAF/AAIA immediately. System managers
must prepare a notice for publication in the 

Federal Register

 with a Routine Use that allows disclosing the information for use in a matching program. Send the proposed system notice
to SAF/AAIA. Allow 180 days for processing requests for a new matching program.
(e) Record subjects must receive prior notice of a match. The best way to do this is to include notice in the Privacy Act
Statement on forms used in applying for benefits. Coordinate computer matching statements on forms with SAF/AAIA
through the MAJCOM Privacy Act Officer.





Subpart J - Training 


 806b.38 

Who needs training. 


The Privacy Act requires training for all persons involved in the design, development, operation and maintenance
of any system of records. Some persons may need more specialized training. They include information managers, supervisors,
and individuals working with medical, financial, security, and personnel records. 




 806b.39 

Training tools. 


Helpful aids include:
(a) AFH 37-146
, `Privacy Act Training', a self-paced course. 





(b) `The Privacy Act of 1974,' a 32-minute film developed by the Defense Privacy Office. Consult your local audiovisual
library. 
(c) `A Manager's Overview, What You Need to Know About the Privacy Act'. Contact SAF/AAIA for copies. 

Note: 

Formal school training groups that develop or modify blocks of instruction must send the material to SAF/AAIA for
coordination.



Subpart K - Privacy Act Reporting


 806b.40 

Privacy Act Report (RCS: DD-DA&M(A)1379). 


By March 1, of each year, MAJCOM and FOA Privacy Act officers must send SAF/AAIA a report covering the previous calendar
year. The report includes: 
(a) Total number of requests granted in whole.
(b) Total number of requests granted in part.
(c) Total number of requests denied and the Privacy Act exemptions used.
(d) Total number of requests for which no record was found.
(e) Total number of amendment requests granted in whole.
(f) Total number of amendment requests granted in part.
(g) Total number of amendment requests wholly denied.
(h) Specific recommendations for changes to the Act or the Privacy Act Program.

National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Source Categories: Early Reductions Program High-Risk
List Amendment 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On December 29, 1992, the EPA promulgated final regulations implementing the Early Reductions Program under section
112(i)(5) of the Clean Air Act, as amended (CAA). As part of that rulemaking, EPA designated a list of high-risk hazardous
air pollutants and limited the use of offsetting reductions in other hazardous air pollutants as counting towards
the required reductions in high-risk pollutants. An amendment to the high-risk list which would delete acrylic acid
because of EPA's analysis of new toxicological data was proposed in the 

Federal Register

 on June 22, 1994. This final action promulgates this amendment and deletes acrylic acid from the list of high-risk
pollutants as designated by the Early Reductions Program. 



This final action also removes methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) (CAS No. 101688) from the list of high-risk
pollutants. The EPA's listing of MDI as a high-risk pollutant was vacated by the United States Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia Circuit on July 19, 1994.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The information presented in this preamble is organized as follows:

II. Removal of MDI From the High-Risk List 
III. Administrative Requirements 



I. Significant Comments and Summary of the Final Rule 



Based on comments received during the comment period, the EPA is deleting acrylic acid (CAS. No. 79107) from the list
of high-risk pollutants, as proposed. Three commenters submitted letters supporting EPA's proposal, with all commenters
agreeing that acrylic acid does not meet the EPA's criteria for listing acrylic acid as a high-risk pollutant under
the Early Reductions Program. As the commenters appropriately pointed out, the EPA did not propose to revise the criteria
for including a pollutant on the high-risk list. Therefore, the recent revision of the inhalation reference concentration
(RfC) for acrylic acid (April 1, 1994) is sufficient grounds to delete acrylic acid from the list. 

One commenter addressed issues pertinent to EPA's use of the Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS). With respect
to acrylic acid, the commenter commended the EPA for considering additional data that was not previously available
when the RfC for acrylic acid was first included in the IRIS data base. The commenter's specific comments however,
dealt with the EPA's use of IRIS values for cresol isomers in the context of two other proposed rulemakings. Because
this issue is not pertinent to this action, these comments are not addressed here. The commenter has also submitted
them to EPA in response to a request for public comment on two other proposed rulemakings that deal with cresol isomers
and the EPA will consider and respond to them at the time those proposals are finalized. 



II. Removal of MDI From the High-Risk List 



On July 19, 1994, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated EPA's designation of MDI as a high-risk
pollutant for purposes of the Early Reductions Program [Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA) v. EPA, No. 93-1178
(D.C. Cir.)]. The court found that EPA was arbitrary and capricious in not adequately addressing CMA's contentions
that MDI was substantially different than the characteristics of the model pollutant used in the generic modeling
exercise to screen the 189 hazardous air pollutants for inclusion on the high-risk list. In addition, the court found
that it was arbitrary for EPA to include MDI on the list of high risk pollutants without identifying any serious health
effect with which it had ever been associated. 

Therefore, this final rule deletes MDI from the list of high-risk pollutants for the purposes of the Early Reductions
Program in accordance with the court's decision. 



III. Administrative Requirements 



A. Docket 



The docket is an organized and complete file of all the information submitted to or otherwise considered by EPA in the
development of this rulemaking. The principal purposes of the docket are: (1) To allow interested parties to readily
identify and locate documents so they can intelligently and effectively participate in the rulemaking process;
and (2) to serve as the record in case of judicial review (except for interagency review materials [section 307(d)(7)(A)]).




B. Paperwork Reduction Act 



There are no information collection requirements associated with this proposed rule. Therefore, an Information
Collection Request document has not been prepared. 



C. Executive Order 12866 Review 



Under Executive Order 12866 (FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)), EPA must determine whether a regulation is ``significant''
and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the requirements of the Executive
Order. The order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: 

(1) Have an annual affect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal
governments or communities; 

(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;

(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs, or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or 
(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order. Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has been determined that this rule
is a ``non significant regulatory action''. Accordingly, a regulatory impact analysis has not been prepared and
EPA has not submitted the action to OMB for review. 


D. Compliance With Regulatory Flexibility Act 



Under section 605 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.,

 federal agencies are required to assess the economic impact of federal regulations on small entities. Pursuant to
the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small business entities because the impact of this rule is not significant.

List of Communities Eligible for the Sale of Flood Insurance 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This rule identifies communities participating in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). These communities
have applied to the program and have agreed to enact certain floodplain management measures. The communities' participation
in the program authorizes the sale of flood insurance to owners of property located in the communities listed.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The NFIP enables property owners to purchase flood insurance which is generally not otherwise available. In return,
communities agree to adopt and administer local floodplain management measures aimed at protecting lives and new
construction from future flooding. Since the communities on the attached list have recently entered the NFIP, subsidized
flood insurance is now available for property in the community. 




In addition, the Director of the FEMA has identified the special flood hazard areas in some of these communities by
publishing a Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM) or Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). The date of the flood map, if one has
been published, is indicated in the fourth column of the table. In the communities listed where a flood map has been
published, Section 102 of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 4012(a), requires the purchase
of flood insurance as a condition of Federal or federally related financial assistance for acquisition or construction
of buildings in the special flood hazard areas shown on the map. 



The Director finds that the delayed effective dates would be contrary to the public interest. The Director also finds
that notice and public procedure under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are impracticable and unnecessary. 


National Environmental Policy Act



This rule is categorically excluded from the requirements of 44 CFR Part 10, Environmental Considerations. No environmental
impact assessment has been prepared. 


Regulatory Flexibility Act



The Associate Director certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U. S. C. 601 

et seq

., because the rule creates no additional burden, but lists those communities eligible for the sale of flood insurance.




Regulatory Classification



This final rule is not a significant regulatory action under the criteria of section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866
of September 30, 1993, Regulatory Planning and Review, 58 FR 51735. 



Paperwork Reduction Act


This rule does not involve any collection of information for purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501

Cable Television Act of 1992


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Communications Commission.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Commission has adopted a Fourth Order on Reconsideration to revise and adopt further Commission cable rate regulations.
The Fourth Order on Reconsideration addresses issues regarding external cost treatment of Commission cable television
system regulatory fees and franchise fees. It is intended to provide for external cost treatment of Commission cable
television system regulatory fees and permit cable operators to adjust rates for regulated cable services to reflect
Commission regulatory fees and changes in franchise fees upon 30 days' notice without receiving prior franchising
authority or Commission approval, but subject to refund.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This is a synopsis of the Fourth Order on Reconsideration in MM Docket No. 92-266, FCC 94-254, adopted September
30, 1994 and released October 5, 1994.


The complete text of this Fourth Order on Reconsideration is available for inspection and copying during normal business
hours in the FCC Reference Center (room 239), 1919 M Street, N.W., Washington, D.C., and also may be purchased from
the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcription service at (202) 857-3800, 2100 M Street,
N.W., Suite 140, Washington, D.C. 20037.


Synopsis of the Fourth Order on Reconsideration 
I. Franchise Fees 


1. Cable systems are franchised by state or local governments or by a combination thereof or, in certain circumstances,
by other governmental entities such as federal military installations. The payment of fees under the terms of any
franchise is authorized by Section 622(a) of the Communications Act, is limited as to amount by Section 622(b), and
such fees are to be accounted for in the establishment of rates under Section 623(b)(2)(c)(V). 
2. Under the Commission's price cap rules, a cable operator is permitted to adjust its maximum monthly charge for regulated
service tiers to reflect changes in certain categories of external costs, including franchise fees. If an operator's
basic service tier is being regulated in a particular franchise area by the franchising authority or by the Commission,
the operator generally is not allowed under our rules to increase its rates for the basic service tier or related equipment
and installations without first submitting the proposed increase to the franchising authority or the Commission,
as the case may be, for review. Under our rules, a franchising authority reviewing a proposed increase in basic rates
has an initial 30 day period to make its decision. The franchising authority may extend this period for an additional
90 days in a non-cost-of-service case or 150 days in a cost-of-service case. During this period, the operator's proposed
increase is not in effect. When the Commission is regulating basic rates, filings regarding rate increases must be
made 30 days prior to the proposed effective date and such rate increases are effective on the date proposed unless
the Commission issues an order deferring the effective date or denying the rate proposal. With respect to cable programming
service (CPS) rates, an operator must file rate increases for prior review by the Commission if the Commission has
ordered the operator to reduce its CPS rates within the prior 12 months or some other period specified by the Commission
in a particular case. In addition, when a CPS complaint against the operator is pending before the Commission, an operator
must give the Commission 30 days' notice of changes in any rates, including increases in rates attributable to increases
in franchise fees. 
3. On reconsideration, on our own motion, we determine that we should permit adjustments to capped rates to reflect
increases in franchise fees without prior regulatory approval. Since it is the franchising authority which has set
the franchise fee, prior regulatory review appears less necessary from a consumer protection standpoint than it
is for other categories of external costs. This decision supersedes Answer No. 5 in the Questions and Answers released
by the Cable Services Bureau on May 18, 1994 which interpreted the Commission's price cap rules as requiring prior
approval before franchise fee increases could be passed through.

<PARENT> FR941021-0-00013 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

4. Accordingly, as of the effective date of this Order, where the franchising authority is regulating basic rates,
increases in basic rates attributable to increases in franchise fees will not be subject to the prior approval requirements
for proposed rates increases set forth in  76.933(a)-(c) of our rules. However, operators will continue
to be required to abide by the notice provisions of our rules. When the operator provides the notice to the franchising
authority, it must also provide documentation that demonstrates that the rate increase has been properly calculated.
We find it unnecessary to prescribe the precise form of this documentation. The operator need not use FCC Form 1210
since Form 1210 was not specifically designated for use in calculating rate adjustments that reflect changes in franchise
fees. 

5. As under existing rules, where the Commission is regulating basic service tier rates, operators must give the Commission
30 days' advance notice of any such increase attributable to franchise fee increases. Operators must also give subscribers
and franchising authorities 30 days' advance notice of changes in basic rates attributable to increases in franchise
fees as required by our rules. In addition, where the Commission is regulating basic service rates, the operator should
submit with its filing to the Commission the same documentation which it would need to submit if the franchising authority
were regulating basic service rates as outlined above. 

6. The franchising authority or the Commission, as appropriate, may then review the pass-through of increases in
franchise fees and may order a prospective rate reduction and refunds in accordance with our rules in the event the
operator has increased its basic service rates by more than the increase in franchise fees properly allocable to the
basic tier. The burden of demonstrating that any such increases are proper shall remain on the operator as with any
other rate adjustments. The procedures set forth in  76.933 of our rules will apply to a franchising authority
review of rate increases resulting from franchise fee pass-throughs, except that the increased rate attributable
to the increased franchise fee will be treated as an ``existing rate'' for the purposes of  76.933. Thus, franchising
authorities will have an initial 30-day period, beginning on the date the operator provides notice and supporting
documentation, whichever is later, to review the rates. The rate increase will go into effect at the end of this 30-day
period. The franchising authority may extend the period for reviewing rates for an additional 90 days in a non-cost-of-service
case or 150 days in a cost-of-service case by issuing a tolling order within the initial 30-day period. It may further
extend its period for review by issuing an accounting order prior to the expiration of the 90 or 150 day additional period.
See 47 CFR 76.933(a)-(c). However, during these periods the increased rate is in effect. The procedures set
forth in  76.945 will apply to Commission review of rate increases resulting from franchise fee pass-throughs.


7. Franchise fees will continue to be allocated in a manner that is most consistent with the assessment methodology
used by franchising authorities. Under  76.924(f) of our rules, a portion of franchise fees may, in some circumstances,
be allocated to cable programming service tiers. Operators that have had cable programming service rates deemed
unreasonable within the prior 12 months, or some other period specified by the Commission in a particular case, must
submit increases in CPS rates attributable to an increase in franchise fees to the Commission for its review. Rate
justifications relating to franchise fee-related increases in CPS tier rates will be reviewed by the Commission
according to existing rules for Commission review of basic service tier rates. 

8. These rule revisions do not change our rules governing rate adjustments attributable to decreases in external
costs, including franchise fees. Decrease in franchise fees allocable to either the basic service or a CPS tier will
continue to be treated as external cost decreases under our existing rules. Such decreases must be passed through
to subscribers within the periods set forth in our rules for passing through decreases in external costs. The operator
must provide 30 days' notice to subscribers, the local franchising authority and the Commission, as appropriate.
As with franchise fee increases, operators must provide documentation for the amount of the decrease. Consistent
with the rules adopted in the Report and Order and Further Notice of proposed Rulemaking, 8 FCC Rcd 5631 (1993) (Rate
Order), 58 FR 29736, May 21, 1993, our action herein with respect to the pass-through of franchise fees applies only
to the extent there are net increases in the costs imposed on the system operator. Fees may not be passed through to the
extent there are other fee changes that offset the increase.

II. Cable Television System Regulatory Fees



9. Section 9 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, requires the Commission to collect cable system regulatory
fees of $370 per 1,000 subscribers from cable television systems on an annual basis. 47 U.S.C. 159. The statute also
permits the Commission to adjust the amount of the regulatory fees in subsequent years. The purpose of requiring cable
systems to pay regulatory fees to the Commission is to permit the Commission to recover the annual cost of its various
regulatory activities. In a Report and Order released June 8, 1994, in MD Docket No. 94-19, the Commission adopted
implementing rules providing for the payment of regulatory fees in fiscal year 1994 and thereafter. Implementation
of Section 9 of the Communications Act: Assessment and Collection of Regulatory Fees for the 1994 Fiscal Year, MD Docket
No. 94-19, Report and Order, 59 FR 30984 (June 16, 1994). In that Report and Order, we decided to assess the cable
system regulatory fee on an exact per subscriber basis (i.e., $0.37 per subscriber per year or approximately $0.03
per subscriber per month). We provided that regulatory fees be paid on this basis so that cable systems serving less
than 1,000 subscribers would not pay a disproportionately high regulatory fee. The first cable system regulatory
fee payments for fiscal year 1994 were due on August 12, 1994.

10. Cable operators in MD Docket No. 94-19 urged the Commission to permit cable systems to pass regulatory fees
through to subscribers as external costs. In our Report and Order in that docket, we concluded that the pass-through
issue was not within the scope of the docket and should, therefore, be addressed separately.

11. Cable television system regulatory fees are mandated by Congress, collected by the Commission, and are intended
to reimburse the Commission for administering its regulatory responsibilities under the Communications Act of
1934. As such, they are exceptional, newly imposed, governmentally-assessed fees that further the purposes of the
Communications Act. These fees are also beyond the control of the cable operator. Furthermore, the fees are easily
measurable in amount. Consistent with the Commission's prior decision to determine on a case-by-case basis whether
categories of costs should be accorded external cost treatment, we determine that Commission cable television system
regulatory fees should be accorded external cost treatment under our price cap rules governing cable service rates.

12. We further determine that cable system regulatory fees should be directly assigned to the basic service tier.
Direct assignment to the basic service tier is appropriate because the cable system regulatory fees are assessed
on a per subscriber basis and all subscribers receive the basic service tier. Assignment to the basic service tier
is also consistent with the fact that regulatory fees are intended to reimburse the Commission for the costs of regulating
cable service, including Commission oversight of the basic service tier and other regulatory activities such as
rulemaking, the direct regulation of some systems' basic tier rates and review of local franchising authorities'
decisions.

<TEXT>
 

13. We believe that cable operators should be permitted to adjust rates on account of the regulatory fees without prior
regulatory approval, subject to our requirements for 30 days' advance notice. Thus, operators may adjust rates to
reflect the newly imposed regulatory fees, and any subsequent increases in the fees, in the same manner that rates
may be adjusted for increases in franchise fees, as discussed above. Decreases in Commission regulatory fees will
continue to be treated as external cost decreases under our existing rules and must be passed through to subscribers
in accordance with those rules. In addition, fees may not be passed through to the extent that there are other offsetting
fee decreases. 
14. Operators shall recover the annual regulatory fee according to the following schedule. Regulatory fees of $0.37
per subscriber that were due on August 12, 1994 and/or September 9, 1994 for fiscal year 1994 (October 1, 1993-September
30, 1994) shall be recovered from subscribers over a ten month period beginning in December of 1994 and ending in September
of 1995. For the first three months of this ten month period (December 1994-February 1995), operators shall
recover $0.03 per month per subscriber. For the remaining seven months (March 1995-September 1995), operators
shall recover $0.04 per month per subscriber. Operators may provide notice of the entire fiscal year's regulatory
fee pass-through in a single notice so long as that notice states that the fee pass-through will increase from $0.03
in February 1995 to $0.04 in March 1995. Regulatory fees that are assessed for subsequent fiscal years shall be recovered
in twelve monthly installments during the fiscal year following the fiscal year for which the payment was imposed.
For example, operators may begin recovering regulatory fees paid for fiscal year 1995 during the 12 month period from
October 1995 through September 1996. Payments shall be collected in equal monthly installments, except that for
so many months as may be necessary to avoid fractional payments, an additional $0.01 payment per month may be collected.
All such additional payments shall be collected in the last month or months of the fiscal year, so that once collections
of such payments begin there shall be no month remaining in the year in which the operator is not entitled to such an additional
payment. Recovery of regulatory fees paid for fiscal year 1995 and subsequent fiscal years is, of course, subject
to the notice requirements contained in this Order and in our rules. We recognize that operators will not recover the
regulatory fee until after they have paid it. However, operators may not assess interest on the amount charged to subscribers
for regulatory fees in order to avoid the substantial administrative burdens on operators and regulators in determining
and reviewing interest calculations. 
15. The Report and Order released June 8, 1994, implementing regulatory fees on cable television systems, also provided
that, for fiscal year 1994, each Cable Television Antenna Relay Service (CARS) licensee would be assessed a regulatory
fee of $220 per license by the Commission. We decline to provide for the external cost treatment of CARS regulatory
fees. CARS license regulatory fees are assessed on a flat fee basis of $220 per license and should not represent significant
amounts to most operators. We will consider the need to permit external cost treatment of CARS regulatory fees for
small systems upon completion of our cost studies.

Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis




16. Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 601-612, the Commission's final analysis with
respect to the Fourth Order on Reconsideration is as follows:


17. Need and purpose of this action. The Commission, in compliance with Section 3 of the Cable Television Consumer
Protection and Competition Act of 1992, 47 U.S.C. 543 (1992) pertaining to rate regulation, adopts revised rules
and procedures intended to ensure cable subscribers of reasonable rates for cable services with minimum regulatory
and administrative burden on cable entities.


18. Summary of issues raised by the public in response to the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis. There were
no comments submitted in response to the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis. The Chief Counsel for Advocacy
of the United States Small Business Administration (SBA) filed comments in the original rulemaking order. The Commission
addressed the concerns raised by the Office of Advocacy in the Rate Order.


19. Significant alternatives considered and rejected. Petitioners representing cable interests and franchising
authorities submitted several alternatives aimed at minimizing administrative burdens. The Commission responded
to these comments in previous Orders in this docket. Although the Commission is issuing this Order on its own motion,
the Commission has attempted to accommodate commenters' concerns and to reduce administrative burdens by providing
an expedited method to pass through franchise fees and Commission regulatory fees.



IV. Ordering Clauses




20. Accordingly, it is ordered That, pursuant to Sections 4(i), 303(r), and 623 of the Communications Act of 1934,
as amended, 47 U.S.C. 154(i), 303(r), and 543, that,   76.922, 76.924, and 76.933 of the Commission's
rules, 47 CFR 76.922, 76.924, and 76.933 are amended as set forth below.


21. It is further ordered That, this Fourth Order on Reconsideration is effective November 21, 1994.

* * * * *





(e) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, when the franchising authority is regulating basic
service tier rates, a cable operator may increase its rates for basic service to reflect the imposition of, or increase
in, franchise fees or Commission cable television system regulatory fees imposed pursuant to 47 U.S.C. 159, upon
30 days' notice to subscribers and the franchising authority and, where required by  76.958, to the Commission.
For the purposes of paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, the increased rate attributable to Commission regulatory
fees or franchise fees shall be treated as an ``existing rate,'' subject to subsequent review and refund if the franchising
authority determines that the increase in basic tier rates exceeds the increase in regulatory fees or in franchise
fees allocable to the basic tier. This determination shall be appealable to the Commission pursuant to  76.944.
When the Commission is regulating basic service tier rates pursuant to  76.945 or cable programming service
rates pursuant to  76.960, an increase in those rates resulting from franchise fees or Commission regulatory
fees shall be reviewed by the Commission pursuant to the mechanisms set forth in  76.945. A cable operator must
adjust its rates to reflect decreases in franchise fees or Commission regulatory fees within the periods set forth
in  76.922(d)(3)(i) and (iii).



(f) Cable television system regulatory fees assessed by the Commission pursuant to 47 U.S.C. 159 shall be recovered
in monthly installments during the fiscal year following the fiscal year for which the payment was imposed. Payments
shall be collected in equal monthly installments, except that for so many months as may be necessary to avoid fractional
payments, an additional $0.01 payment per month may be collected. All such additional payments shall be collected
in the last month or months of the fiscal year, so that once collections of such payments begin there shall be no month

Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement; Predetermined Indirect Cost Rates



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of Defense (DoD).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Defense is revising the Defense FAR Supplement to implement revisions to OMB Circular A-21
(58 FR 39996) that permit predetermined indirect cost rates for educational institutions to be applicable for a period
of up to four years.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



A. Background




On July 26, 1993, the Office of Management and Budget published revisions to OMB Circular A-21 (58 FR 39996) which
include an increase in the period of time for which predetermined indirect cost rates for educational institutions
may be applicable. Pending revision of the Federal Acquisition Regulation to conform the language to the revised
OMB Circular, the Defense FAR Supplement is amended to permit use of predetermined indirect cost rates for educational
institutions for periods of up to four years.

The Director, Defense Procurement, issued this final DFARS rule by Departmental Letter 94-018, October 18,
1994, to expedite DoD implementation of this revision.



B. Regulatory Flexibility Act



DoD certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act because the rule merely implements OMB Circular A-21 as
it relates to predetermined indirect cost rates for educational institutions.



C. Paperwork Reduction Act



The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because this final rule does not impose any new recordkeeping, information
collection requirements, or collection of information from offerors, contractors, or members of the public which
require the approval of OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501, 

et seq.

Infectious Substances; Confirmation of Effective Date and Compliance Dates



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA), DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; confirmation of effective date and compliance dates.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On September 22, 1994, RSPA published a final rule to extend the compliance dates for classification, hazard communication,
and packaging requirements of the Hazardous Materials Regulations applicable to infectious substances, including
regulated medical waste. The effective date of the rule was September 22, 1994, unless RSPA received, by September
30, 1994, any comments illustrating that an extension of the compliance dates is not in the public interest. RSPA received
two comments opposing the extension, but containing no specific information to support that an extension of the compliance
dates is not in the public interest. Therefore, this document confirms that the compliance dates are extended as set
forth in the September 22, 1994 final rule, and the effective date of that final rule is September 22, 1994.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
On September 22, 1994, RSPA issued a final rule under Docket HM-181G (59 FR 48762) to extend the compliance dates
for classification, hazard 
communication, and packaging requirements for infectious substances, including regulated medical waste (RMW).
In the final rule, RSPA amended 49 CFR 171.14(b) to extend the compliance date from October 1, 1994, to October 1, 1995,
for regulatory requirements applicable to RMW and materials infectious to animals only. This extension was provided
to allow RSPA sufficient time to publish a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), evaluate comments received in response
to the NPRM, and make any necessary changes to the HMR based on the merits of those comments. RSPA stated that, without
an extension of the compliance date, shippers and transporters of these materials would have to comply with regulations
that are likely to be changed in the near future and thereby incur unnecessary costs. For other infectious substances,
i.e., for cultures and stocks of substances infectious to humans, the September 22, 1994 final rule extended the compliance
date from October 1, 1994, to January 1, 1995. The requirements for these materials generally have not been at issue
in comments or petitions filed with RSPA. The principal impacts of the January 1, 1995 compliance date will be a nomenclature
change from the old ``etiologic agent'' hazard class to the new ``Division 6.2'' classification, elimination of
the 50 milliliter exception for cultures and stocks of infectious substances, and expansion of the definition of
infectious substances to cover substances, such as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Lyme disease, which
are not listed in the Centers for Disease Control regulations (42 CFR 72.3). 


In the preamble of the September 22, 1994 rule, RSPA stated that the compliance dates would be extended unless RSPA
received comments by September 30, 1994, that illustrated that an extension of the compliance dates would not be in
the public interest. RSPA received two comments opposed to and one comment in support of extending the compliance
date for provisions applicable to RMW. The comment advocating the extension was submitted by the American Hospital
Association (AHA). The AHA fully supported RSPA's decision to extend the compliance date for RMW and encouraged continued
coordination with other Federal agencies involved in the regulation of infectious substances. The comments opposing
the extension were submitted by a manufacturer of an exemption packaging used for transporting RMW and one of its customers,
a waste transporter. Both commenters requested that the requirements for RMW be implemented without further delay.
The manufacturer stated that it has spent in excess of $2 million developing its packaging, and that large transporters
of RMW have ``done little or nothing to help toward the safety of RMW transportation.'' The waste transporter stated
that, by using the manufacturer's exemption packaging, it has an edge over many of the large transporters that are
not and possibly may elect not to comply with the new requirements. The waste transporter stated that Federal regulations
are necessary if safeguards are to be put in place for the safety and health of the public. Neither commenter provided
any specific data or information suggesting that RMW is being transported unsafely, nor did they demonstrate that
the extension would jeopardize safety or be contrary to the public interest. Based on these comments, and on the lack
of any evidence indicating that a limited extension would adversely affect public health and safety, RSPA has determined
that it is appropriate to extend the compliance dates. Therefore, RSPA is confirming the compliance dates set forth
in the September 22, 1994 final rule.

Spiny Lobster Fishery of the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS publishes this final rule to amend the regulations implementing the Fishery Management Plan for the Spiny Lobster
Fishery of the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic (FMP) to remove the requirement for Federal vessel permits in the commercial
spiny lobster fishery in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) off Florida, make technical corrections and revisions,
and add a prohibition against making false statements to authorized officers. The intended effect of this final rule
is to relieve a restriction in the fishery and to facilitate enforcement.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The spiny lobster fishery is managed under the FMP. The FMP was prepared by the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic Fishery
Management Councils (Councils) and is implemented through regulations at 50 CFR part 640 under the authority of the
Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. 


NMFS published proposed and final rules on July 24, 1992 (57 FR 32956) and November 30, 1992 (57 FR 56516), respectively,
to amend the regulations that implement the FMP (regulatory amendment). The regulatory amendment, among other things,
adopted in the EEZ off Florida, Florida's spiny lobster trap certificate, trap reduction, and trap identification
programs. The regulatory amendment was initiated by the Councils under the FMP's framework procedure for implementing
specified gear and harvest restrictions, and included a provision to discontinue the issuance of Federal commercial
permits for spiny lobster in the EEZ off Florida when Florida's trap certificate, and identification programs were
in place and when Florida designated spiny lobster as a restricted species, thus limiting the sellers of spiny lobster
to individuals who have restricted species endorsements on their Florida saltwater products licenses. Florida's
trap certificate and identification programs were implemented July 1, 1993, and spiny lobster was designated a restricted
species August 1, 1994. The conditions of the regulatory amendment for discontinuing the requirement for Federal
vessel permits for commercial spiny lobster fishing in the EEZ off Florida have been met, and continuation of such
requirement would constitute an unnecessary expense to fishermen and NMFS. Accordingly, this final rule eliminates
that requirement. 
The Federal commercial vessel permit requirement remains in effect for the EEZ other than off Florida. The requirement
for a Federal tail-separation authorization in order to possess a separated spiny lobster tail in or from the EEZ remains
in effect both off Florida and elsewhere. Since possession of spiny lobster tails may be authorized in some instances
when a commercial vessel permit has not been issued, and, since without a permit there would be nothing to endorse,
this final rule changes the ``tail-separation endorsement,'' requirement in the present regulations to a ``tail-separation
permit'' requirement. There are no changes in the criteria for obtaining or using a tail-separation endorsement/permit.

This final rule also changes all references to Florida's ``Department of Natural Resources'' to the ``Department
of Environmental Protection'' to conform to the new/current name; eliminates unnecessary language in the citations
for rules in the Florida Administrative Code; corrects the specific paragraphs in some of those citations; corrects
the address of the Regional Director, NMFS; and adds a prohibition on making a false statement to an authorized officer
concerning the taking, catching, harvesting, landing, purchase, sale, possession, or transfer of a spiny lobster.
The added prohibition is necessary for effective enforcement and conforms the regulations to other fisheries regulations
of the Southeast Region, NMFS. 



Classification 



This final rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866. 

This final rule involves, but does not materially change, a collection-of-information requirement subject to the
Paperwork Reduction Act, namely, applications for commercial vessel and tail-separation permits. This collection
of information was previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget under OMB control number 0648-0205.
This requirement has a public reporting burden estimated to average 15 minutes per response. Send comments regarding
this burden estimate or any other aspect of the collection of information, including suggestions for reducing the
burden, to Edward E. Burgess, NMFS, 9721 Executive Center Drive N. St. Petersburg, FL 33702 and to the Office of Information
and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, Washington, DC 20503 (Attention: NOAA Desk Officer). 

The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA), pursuant to section 553(b)(B) of the Administrative Procedure
Act (APA), finds (1) for good cause, namely, that the conditions specified in the regulatory amendment for eliminating
the Federal vessel permit requirement clearly have been met and a delay in removing this requirement would impose
an unnecessary expense on participants in the fishery, notice and advance opportunity to comment on the elimination
of the requirement for a Federal vessel permit would serve no useful purpose and thus is unnecessary and by imposing
an unnecessary expense would be contrary to the public interest; (2) it is unnecessary to provide notice and advance
opportunity to comment on the technical corrections and revisions to the regulations because no useful purpose would
be served; and (3) it is unnecessary and would be contrary to the public interest to provide notice and advance opportunity
to comment on the prohibition against making false statements to authorized officers because no useful purpose would
be served and the associated delay could impede enforcement. 

Under section 553(d)(1) of the APA, the provisions of the rule which remove the requirement for a Federal vessel permit
may be and are being made immediately effective because they relieve a restriction. With respect to the provisions
of the rule which make technical corrections and revisions, the AA pursuant to section 553(d)(3) delay for 30 days
their effectiveness because they do not affect compliance. With respect to the provisions of this rule which add a
prohibition against making false statements to authorized officers, the AA pursuant to section 553(d)(3) of the
APA, finds that it would be contrary to the public interest to delay for 30 days its effectiveness because it could impede
enforcement of the regulations.

Coastal Migratory Pelagic Resources of the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In accordance with the framework procedure for adjusting management measures of the Fishery Management Plan for
the Coastal Migratory Pelagic Resources (FMP), NMFS changes the total allowable catch for the Atlantic groups of
king and Spanish mackerel and changes the commercial vessel trip limits for Gulf group king mackerel. The intended
effect is to protect king and Spanish mackerel from overfishing and continue stock rebuilding programs while still
allowing catches by important recreational and commercial fisheries dependent on king and Spanish mackerel. 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The fisheries for coastal migratory pelagic resources are regulated under the FMP. The FMP was prepared jointly by
the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic Fishery Management Councils (Councils) and is implemented by regulations at
50 CFR part 642. 



In accordance with the framework procedure of the FMP, the Councils recommended, and NMFS published, a proposed rule
to change certain management measures applicable to the Atlantic groups of king and Spanish mackerel and Gulf group
king mackerel (59 FR 40509, August 9, 1994). That proposed rule (1) described the FMP framework procedures through
which the Councils recommended the changes, (2) specified the recommended changes, and (3) described the need and
rationale for the recommended changes. Those descriptions are not repeated here. 
No comments were received on the proposed rule. 


Partial Disapproval 


The Director, Southeast Region, NMFS, concurs that the Councils' recommendations are necessary to protect the stocks
and prevent overfishing and that they are consistent with the objectives of the FMP, the Magnuson Act, and other applicable
law, except for one of the recommendations. For the Florida west coast sub-zone, the Councils recommended a reduction
in the daily trip limits for king mackerel, applicable to fishing with run-around gillnets, when 90 percent of the
quota is reached. The trip limits were to be reduced from 25,000 lb (11,340 kg) to 15,000 lb (6,804 kg). NMFS finds that
a reduction of the trip limits at that time would be impractical because the remaining 10 percent of the quota (43,250
lb (19,618 kg)) could be exceeded by the trip-limit landings of three vessels. If a substantial number of the 15 vessels
expected to be in the gillnet fishery in that sub-zone were to make one trip under the reduced trip limits, the quota
would be significantly exceeded before the fishery could be closed. A measure that increases the likelihood of a quota
overrun would be inconsistent with national standard 1, which requires that management measures prevent overfishing
while achieving, on a continuing basis, the optimum yield from the fishery. 


Changes from the Proposed Rule 


For the reasons described above, the specification of reduced trip limits applicable to king mackerel harvested
by run-around gillnets in the Florida west coast sub-zone is removed and references to the removed paragraph are corrected.

This final rule is exempt from review under E.O. 12866. 
The Deputy General Counsel of the Department of Commerce certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business
Administration that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
The reasons were published in the proposed rule (59 FR 40509, August 9, 1994). As a result, a regulatory flexibility
analysis was not prepared.

Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 



 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Closure.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for Pacific cod by vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear in the Bering Sea and
Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI). This action is necessary to prevent exceeding the 1994 apportionment of
the Pacific cod total allowable catch (TAC) allocated to vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear in the BSAI.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The groundfish fishery in the BSAI exclusive economic zone is managed by NMFS according to the Fishery Management
Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery
Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels
is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675.


In accordance with  675.20(a)(7)(ii), the Pacific cod TAC for the BSAI was established by the final 1994 initial
specifications of groundfish (59 FR 7656, February 16, 1994) and increased by an apportionment from the reserve (59
FR 21673, April 26, 1994) to 191,000 metric tons (mt). The 1994 Pacific cod TAC allocated to vessels using hook-and-line
or pot gear is 92,040 mt pursuant to  675.20(a)(3)(iv); 59 FR 4009, January 28, 1994; 59 FR 21673, April 26, 1994;
and 59 FR 42776, August 19, 1994. 
The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Director), has determined, in accordance with  675.20(a)(8),
that the 1994 Pacific cod TAC allocated to vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear in the BSAI soon will be reached.
Therefore, the Regional Director has established a directed fishing allowance of 91,540 mt, with consideration
that 500 mt will be taken as incidental catch in directed fishing for other species in the BSAI. The Regional Director
has determined that the directed fishing allowance has been reached. Consequently, NMFS is prohibiting directed
fishing for Pacific cod by vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear in the BSAI, effective from 12 noon, A.l.t., October 17,
1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. 
Directed fishing standards for applicable gear types may be found in the regulations at  675.20(h).

I. Introduction 



OMB Circular A-110 was published in final form on November 29, 1993 (58 FR 62992) with the direction to Federal
agencies that they were to implement the Circular by regulation. For DOE that implementation is taking place through
this rulemaking. Subpart B of the Financial Assistance Rules (10 CFR Part 600) is DOE's implementation of the previous
version of Circular A-110. In this rulemaking, Subpart B will be revised as a modified version of the published
text of Circular A-110, as explained below. 

As part of this rulemaking, DOE is restructuring the Financial Assistance Rules. Current Subpart E, which is DOE's
implementation of the Common Rule on Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements
to State and Local Governments, is being moved to Subpart C. It contains the general administrative rules for awards
to governmental entities and is being moved forward for more prominence. Current Subpart C is being moved to Subpart
D. Current Subpart D is being moved to Subpart E. There are no substantive changes made by this rule in the text of these
three Subparts except for changing the references due to the restructuring. 



II. Changes to 10 CFR Part 600 



Sections 600.2, 600.4, 600.5, 600.7, 600.9, 600.10, 600.14, 600.15, 600.20, 600.25, 600.26, 600.28, 600.29, 600.31,
600.32, and 600.33 of Subpart A are amended to correct the references resulting from this implementation of OMB Circular
A-110 and to make some minor technical changes to revise cross-references, update citations, and reflect DOE
organizational changes. 

The current text of Subpart B is being revised as a modified version of OMB Circular A-110, which was published
in the 

Federal Register

 on November 29, 1993 (58 FR 62992). A discussion of the modifications that were made to A-110 for this implementation
is contained below in the section entitled ``Incorporation of OMB Circular A-110 Into the Financial Assistance
Rules.'' 

Sections 600.200, 600.202, 600.203, 600.206 and 600.207 of Subpart C are amended to correct the references resulting
from this implementation of OMB Circular A-110 and to correct some existing minor errors in citations and grammar.


Sections 600.302, 600.303, 600.306 and 600.314 of Subpart D are amended to correct the references resulting from
this implementation of OMB Circular A-110 and to correct some existing typographical errors. 

Section 600.441 of Subpart E is amended to correct a reference resulting from this implementation of OMB Circular
A-110 and to correct an existing error. 



Incorporation of OMB Circular A-110 Into the Financial Assistance Rules 



In the process of incorporating Circular A-110 into the Financial Assistance Rules, several types of changes
have been made to the text of the Circular as it was published by OMB. Those changes are categorized and discussed below.




A. Provisions Involving Change From Circular to Regulatory Language 



Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-110 is a directive to all Federal agencies. Consequently,
specific agency terms are not used and some of the text is phrased as OMB speaking to Federal agencies. Therefore, portions
of this rulemaking have been rewritten to be phrased as the DOE speaking to affected recipients. For example, the fourth
sentence of the definition of ``program income'' in A-110 begins: ``Except as otherwise provided in Federal
awarding agency regulations * * *.'' In this rulemaking it begins: ``Except as otherwise provided
in this subpart, Program regulations, or the * * *.'' 

Those sections of the rulemaking in which changes were made from the text of A-110 to be more appropriately phrased
as a rulemaking by DOE directed at affected recipients rather than as a circular by OMB directed at Federal agencies
are as follows:

<PARENT> FR941021-0-00020 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The words ``Federal,'' ``Federal Government,'' ``Federal awarding agency(ies)'' were changed to ``DOE'' or ``the
DOE'' in the following sections of the interim final rule: In  600.102, the definitions of the following terms:
Award, closeout, cost sharing or matching, date of completion, disallowed costs, funding period, program income,
project period, recipient, suspension, termination, unobligated balance;   600.110; 600.111(a)
and (b); 600.114(a); 600.115; 600.121(b)(1), (c), and (d); 600.122(c), (d), (e), (e)(1), (f), (h), (h)(1), (i)(1);
600.123 (c) and (c)(2); 600.124(c); 600.125(c), (e)(1), (f), (j), (k), and (m); 600.128; 600.131; 600.132(a), (b),
(c), and (c)(2); 600.133(a)(1) and (2), (b); 600.134(c), (d), (e), (f)(1)(ix), (f)(4), (g), (g)(1), (g)(3), (h),
(h)(2), and (h)(3); 600.136(a), (c) and (d); 600.140; 600.141; 600.144(b), (d), (e), and (e)(1)d; 600.148(c), (d),
and (e); 600.148(c) and (d); 600.151(b), (f), (g), and (h); 600.152(a)(1)(i), (a)(1)(iii), (a)(1)(iv), (a)(2)(i),
(a)(2)(iii), (a)(2)(iv), (a)(2)(v), (b)(1), (b)(2); 600.153(a), (b), (b)(3), (c), (d), (e), and (f); 600.161(a)(1),
(a)(2), and (a)(3); 600.162(a), (a)(1), and (b); 600.171(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), and (g); 600.172(a)(1) and (b);
600.173(a) and (b). 

The word ``circular'' was changed to ``subpart'' in the following sections:   600.100; 600.102; 600.104;
600.114(a); 600.123(a)(7); 600.125(e); 600.144(e)(1); and 600.148(e). 

The phrases ``Federal awarding agency regulations'' or ``Federal awarding agency'' were changed to the appropriate
terminology to integrate the Circular into the DOE rules, such as ``contracting officer,'' ``program regulations,''
``terms and conditions of the award,'' ``Subpart,'' or some combination of the four in the following sections: the
definition of ``program income'' in   600.101; 600.124(b), (d), (e), (f), and (h); 600.125(c)(6), (e),
(e)(4), and (f); 600.126(b); 600.152(a)(1)(ii), (a)(2)(v), and (b)(3). 

The words ``shall'' or ``shall be authorized to'' that refer to Federal agency or recipient were changed to ``will''
when referring to DOE or the recipient, as appropriate, in the following sections:   600.115; 600.122(c)(3),
(e)(2), (f), (h) and (j); 600.132(c); 600.134(g); and 600.152(a)(2)(i). 



B. Agency Options 



Circular A-110 contains a number of opportunities for Federal agencies to exercise options as to what policies
they want to follow. The list and description of the options that DOE has selected are as follows: 


</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941021-0-00099 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941021-0-00020 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In  600.101 Definitions, DOE has decided to include commercial organizations in the definition of ``recipient.''


In  600.104 Subawards, the applicability of this subpart to commercial organizations is included to be consistent
with existing DOE policy as provided in the current subpart B. 

In  600.123(a)(6) under Cost sharing, ``when required by the Federal awarding agency'' is deleted to reflect
that DOE is requiring cost-sharing contributions to be shown in the approved budget. 

In  600.123(b) under Cost sharing, ``only with the prior approval of the Federal awarding agency'' is deleted
to reflect that DOE is permitting unrecovered indirect costs to be included in cost sharing. 

In  600.124(f) under Program income, ``If authorized by Federal awarding agency'' is deleted and replaced
with ``Unless program * * * provide otherwise'' to reflect that DOE is permitting incidental costs
to be deducted from program income unless there are contravening program regulations. 

In  600.125 (c)(5) under Revision of budget and program plans, ``if approval is required by the Federal awarding
agency'' is deleted and replaced by ``If required by program regulations'' to reflect that DOE is permitting rebudgeting
between direct and indirect costs without prior approval, unless program regulations provide otherwise. 

In  600.125(c)(6) under Revisions of budget and program plan ``the Federal awarding agency'' is deleted and
replaced by ``program regulations or the terms and conditions of award'' to reflect that the prior approvals included
in the Circulars and regulations cited in the subparagraph are required unless specifically waived in DOE program
regulations or in the specific award document. 

In  600.125(e) pertaining to prior approval requirements, ``Federal awarding agencies are authorized, at
their option'' and ``Circular and OMB Circulars A-21 and A-122'' are deleted and replaced by ``program
regulations may'' and ``subpart and its Appendices'' to reflect that DOE is choosing to limit the waivers of prior
approvals to those contained in program regulations or in this implementation of Circular A-110 and not extending
it to waive prior approval requirements contained in the cost principal Circulars A-21 and A-122. 

In  600.125(f) on rebudgeting, ``The Federal awarding agency may, at its option'' is deleted and replaced by
``Program regulations may'' to reflect that DOE is choosing to allow unrestricted rebudgeting by a recipient (provided
the uses are consistent with the original appropriation) unless program regulations provide otherwise. 

In  600.125(i) regarding imposing other prior approval requirements, ``unless a deviation has been approved
by OMB'' is deleted and replaced by ``Except in accordance with the deviation procedures in  600.4 or as may be
provided for in program regulations'' and ``by the DOE'' to reflect that there may be program regulations that need
to be considered in understanding what prior approval requirements may exist for a particular financial assistance
program. Additionally, ``may'' has been changed to ``will'' to more emphatically state what DOE policy is. 

In  600.125(l) on budget request formats, the entire text is deleted and replaced by ``Requests for budget revisions
may be made by letter'' to reflect DOE policy that the use of budget forms are not required (although, of course, they
may be used) for requesting budget revisions. 

In  600.126 (c) and (d) on Non-Federal audits, the entire text is deleted and replaced with the language shown
to reflect DOE policy that the Contracting Officer has wide discretion in determining the nature of the audits needed
for hospitals not covered by A-133 and commercial organizations. In addition, subparagraph (e) is added to
address audits of individuals who are financial assistance recipients.

<TEXT>
 

In  600.130 Property Standards, ``or program regulations'' is added to reflect that there may be program regulations
that need to be considered in understanding property management requirements. 

In  600.132 Real property (introductory paragraph), the entire text is deleted and replaced with the language
shown to reflect that the provisions of this section address real property use and disposition. 

In  600.133(b) Exempt property, the text has been deleted and replaced with the language shown to reflect that,
with regard to exempt property, DOE shall retain the right to issue disposition instructions within 120 days of receipt
of a request for disposition of unneeded equipment or receipt of final inventory. If DOE fails to issue such instructions
within that time period, title to equipment vests in the recipient without further obligation to the Federal Government.


In  600.136(c) pertaining to intangible property, ``Unless waived by the Federal awarding agency, the Federal
Government'' has been deleted and replaced with ``DOE'' to reflect the DOE policy that DOE retains the indicated rights
in data. 

In  600.137 Property trust relationship, ``Agencies may require'' has been deleted and replaced with ``shall''
to reflect that liens will be recorded on personal or real property acquired or improved with Federal funds. 

In  600.152(a)(2)(ii) regarding Financial reports, ``Federal awarding agencies may require'' has been deleted
and replaced with ``Recipients shall'' to reflect that recipients will forecast cash requirements on the SF-272.


In  600.153 regarding record retention and access, ``unless such requirements are established in program
regulations'' has been added to reflect that there may be program regulations that need to be considered in understanding
record retention and access requirements. 



C. Cross-References



Those portions of this rulemaking that have added cross-references to the text of A-110 are as follows: 

In   600.101 Definitions (under the definition of ``Suspension''), 600.113 Debarment and Suspension,
600.144(d) Procurement Procedures, and 600.162(d) Enforcement, a reference to 10 CFR Part 1036, DOE's implementation
of the non-procurement debarment and suspension executive orders, has been added.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941021-0-00101 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941021-0-00020 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The text of  600.103 Deviations has been deleted and a cross-reference to DOE's deviation provisions in  600.4
has been added. The deleted text entails directions to Federal agencies about the degree to which OMB will permit deviations
from the provisions of the Circular. These provisions are binding upon Federal agencies by virtue of their inclusion
in Circular A-110 and do not need to be provided for in agency implementing regulations. DOE deviation provisions
in  600.4 make reference to the fact that OMB approval may be needed for certain types of deviations. Additional
cross-references to the deviation provisions of  600.4 are in   600.125(d) and (i) on Budget and
project reviews, and  600.140 Procurement standards. 

In  600.121(b) on Financial Management Standards, references to  600.121(f) and  600.181 are
added to identify exceptions to the financial management provisions of this subparagraph. 

Section 600.149 has been added to cross-reference the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act provisions in  600.116.




D. Provisions From the Current Financial Assistance Rules 



In this rulemaking implementing OMB Circular A-110, the basic approach is to replace the current text of Subpart
B of 
10 CFR part 600 with the appropriately modified text of Circular A-110. However, certain portions of Subpart
B have been retained and integrated into the A-110 language. They are as follows: 

In  600.112 on application forms, subparagraphs (a), (b) and (c) are deleted and replaced with the provisions
which are carried over from 10 CFR 600.102. These sections are being added to provide detailed application and budgetary
forms information to recipients. Subparagraph (d) has been slightly reworded and included under  600.112(a)
of this rulemaking. 

Section 600.114(b) regarding special restrictive conditions is carried over from 10 CFR 600.105(c) and concerns
the issue of a recipient placing special restrictive conditions on subawards, which is not addressed in Circular
A-110. 

Section 600.121(f) on financial management system requirements is carried over from  600.109 and concerns
the issue of the financial management system required for individual recipients of awards, which is not addressed
in Circular A-110. 

The language at the end of  600.122(h)(2) on Payments beginning with ``Before withholding any payment'' is
carried over from  600.112(g)(3) and provides 30 days notice, and an opportunity to cure the noncompliance
or indebtedness within that time period, before withholding of payment occurs. Such a provision is not addressed
in Circular A-110. 

Sections 600.123(j), (k), and (l) cost-sharing provisions are carried over from   600.107(a), (b),
and (c). The provisions of   600.123(j) and (k) are continued because of the concern that the requirements
for cost sharing be specifically stated (so that all applicants clearly understand the provisions they are operating
under) and justified (so that any required cost sharing is really a program need). Section 600.123(l) is continued
to address program income, patent rights, rights in data and foregone fees in the context of cost sharing, provisions
which are not included in Circular A-110. 

The language at the end of  600.125(e)(4) on pre-award costs, beginning with ``For continuation awards,''
is carried over from  600.103(g)(2)(ii). This language permits costs incurred more than 90 days before the
beginning of a continuation award to be charged to that continuation year, without the need to receive prior approval
from DOE, should the award be made. As always, pre-award costs are incurred at the recipient's risk that the award may
not be made. This is, in effect, a waiver of Section 

XXX

.25(e)(1) of OMB Circular A-110, and is a permitted agency option under Section 

XXX

.25(e) of the Circular.

Sections 600.125(n) and (o) pertaining to budget and project changes are carried over from   600.114(e)(3),
(4), and (5). These provisions provide more procedural detail for DOE recipients in dealing with budget and project
revisions than is included in Circular A-110. 

Sections 600.127(b) and (c) allowable cost provisions are carried over from   600.103(f) and (h). Section
600.127(b) provides more detail about DOE evaluation of indirect cost requests than is provided in Circular A-110.
Section 600.127(h) states the DOE policy of opposition to paying fees or profits on financial assistance awards with
the exception of Small Business Innovation Research Awards. This subject is not addressed directly in Circular A-110,
although the second Response under the Comments and Responses in the preamble to the Circular states: ``Generally
fees and profits are not paid to recipients unless authorized by legislation.'' 

Section 600.144(f) under Procurement procedures is carried over from  600.119(e) and addresses payments
of interest penalties on dealings between recipients and subrecipients, a subject not addressed in OMB Circular
A-110. 

The final paragraph of Section 151(d) on program reporting is a combination of provisions carried over from   600.115(b)(3)
and (f). This language lists specific performance reporting forms that DOE has developed, has received OMB clearance
to use and may use as the Contracting Officer sees fit. 

Section 600.151(i) on program reporting is carried over from  600.115(i) and states provisions regarding
performance reporting requirements on subawards not addressed in OMB Circular A-110. 

Section 600.153(h) on record retention requirements is carried over from  600.124(c) and states provisions
regarding record retention for program income which was not addressed in OMB Circular A-110. 

The segment of the subpart titled ``Additional Provisions'' was added as a location for rules for types of recipients
not otherwise covered in this subpart. The provisions of  600.181 are carried over from  600.125. 



E. Miscellaneous Changes 


Further miscellaneous changes of this regulatory implementation of A-110 from the text of Circular A-110
as published that have not been included above are as follows: 

In  600.104 Subawards, the sentence beginning ``Thus, this subpart is'' was added to clarify the applicability
of these provisions to subrecipients. It does not change the policy of the Circular. 

In  600.111(b) pertaining to public notice requirements, ``shall'' is changed to ``will, whenever practical,''
because of the possibility that awards may need to be made without sufficient lead time to provide the notification.


The last sentence of  600.121(a) regarding financial requirements for research awards has been added for emphasis.


The last sentence of  600.121(b)(4) reiterates  600.121(a). 

In  600.122(f) on payment, ``awardee's'' was changed to ``recipient's'' to be consistent with DOE usage. 

The phrase ``as defined in OMB Circular A-129, ``Managing Federal Credit Programs'''' in  600.122(h)(2)
is deleted as an unnecessary cross-reference that may also restrict the applicability of this provision unnecessarily.


Section 600.123(a) under Cost sharing or matching has been rewritten to improve the syntax.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941021-0-00103 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941021-0-00020 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In  600.123(f) under Cost sharing or matching, ``expendable equipment'' has been deleted because it is an example
that does not fit the subject of the paragraph. 
Section 600.124(a) under Program income has been rewritten to improve the syntax. 
In  600.124(b)(1), (2) and (3), ``program'' has been deleted to reflect that DOE is limiting the use of program
income to the project on which it is earned, not more generally to undefined programs. 

Section 600.124(d) has been rewritten to improve the syntax and to add the applicability to commercial organizations.

Section 600.125(a) on budget plans has been rewritten to improve the syntax. 
Section 600.125(e)(2) on budget period extensions has been rewritten to improve the syntax. 
In   600.128, 600.151(b), and 600.161(a)(3), ``grant'' was changed to ``award'' to be consistent with
DOE usage. 
In  600.134(c) under Equipment, ``Federal awarding agency which funded the original project'' has been deleted
and replaced with ``DOE.'' The word ``awarding'' between ``Federal'' and ``agencies'' has been deleted as unnecessary.


In  600.134(g) under Equipment, the following has been added: ``Equipment with a current per-unit fair market
value of less than $5000 may be retained, sold or otherwise disposed of with no further obligation to the awarding agency.''
This makes explicit what is intended but not directly stated in Circular A-110. This policy, it should be noted,
is consistent with Section 

XXX

.32(e)(1) of the A-102 Common Rule. 
Section 600.134(h) under Equipment and its subparagraphs have been renumbered from Circular A-110, in which
it was listed as Section 

XXX

.34(g)(4). Subparagraph (g)(4) was a different subject from the rest of the paragraph (g). Also, the language ``the
recipient shall apply the standards of this section, as appropriate'' was deleted and replaced by ``the provisions
of 600.134(g)(1) apply'' to give a more precise cross-reference to the applicable standards. 

In  600.144(a)(2) under Procurement procedures, ``for the Federal Government'' is deleted as an inappropriate
standard for financial assistance. 

In  600.151(h) pertaining to performance reports, ``applicable'' was added to emphasize that not all provisions
of 5 CFR Part 1320 apply in requesting performance data. 
Section 600.152(a)(1)(i) under Financial reporting has been rewritten to improve syntax. 
In  600.153(b)(4) pertaining to record retention requirements, ``etc. as'' is deleted and replaced by ``and
related records, for which retention requirements are'' to provide more specific examples. 
In  600.153(g) pertaining to record retention requirements, the first sentence in the A-110 text was
deleted because it had the appearance of a subparagraph title, which the rest of the subparagraphs did not have. 
In  600.153(g) (1) and (2), ``awarding'' was deleted and replaced by ``responsible for negotiating the recipient's
indirect cost rate'' in (g)(1) and ``cognizant'' in (g)(2) to emphasize the role of cognizant agencies in indirect
cost rate negotiation. 
Appendix A, No. 8 has been rewritten to more accurately state the circumstances under which Executive Orders 12549
and 12689 apply. 



III. Explanation for ``Interim Final'' Rulemaking 





</TEXT>

As the foregoing preamble discussion indicates, the vast majority of the provisions of the interim final rule issued
today follow the provisions of revised OMB Circular A-110. 

For the reasons that follow, DOE has determined that none of the provisions of the interim final rule need to be proposed
for public comment. The final version of revised OMB Circular A-110 resulted from a lengthy public comment process
involving all of the Executive agencies including DOE. In 1987, an interagency task force recommended that OMB Circular
A-110, ``Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements With Institutions of Higher Education,
Hospitals and Other Non-Profit Organizations'' be combined with OMB Circular A-102, ``Uniform Requirements
for Grants and Agreements with State and Local Governments,'' as a consolidated ``common rule.'' In November, 1988,
a proposed consolidated ``common rule'' was published by OMB in the 

Federal Register

, 53 FR 44716. That proposal elicited a substantial number of adverse comments. Subsequently, in August 1992, a revised
proposal, developed by another interagency task force which also included DOE, was published for public comment.
57 FR 39018. The revised proposal drew over 200 comments from a wide variety of sources. 


All relevant comments were considered in the final revision of OMB Circular A-110 when it was issued for government-wide
use on November 29, 1993, 58 FR 62992. The revised circular states that Federal agencies responsible for awarding
and administering grants and other agreements to recipients described therein shall adopt the language in the circular
unless other provisions are required by Federal statute or exceptions or deviations are approved by OMB. 

As noted above, OMB Circular A-110 identifies certain areas where agencies have options, but the available
options are explicitly limited. These areas are discussed in section I.B. of this Preamble under Supplementary Information.
For the most part, the provisions of the interim final rule discussed in that preamble section represent a continuation
or a technical clarification of existing policy under 10 CFR part 600. To the extent that there are changes in existing
policy, they are either the choice of the most permissive available option under OMB Circular A-110 (e.g.,  600.123(b)
permitting unrecovered indirect costs to be included in cost sharing) or a purely procedural change (e.g.,  600.125
limiting prior approval requirements for revisions of budget and program plans.) 



Given the extensive public comment process on the OMB circular, DOE's participation in the resolution of comments,
and the lack of discretion to change the policies in the circular, DOE concluded that a notice of proposed rulemaking
for its implementing rules would be unnecessary, impracticable, and contrary to public policy.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941021-0-00105 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941021-0-00020 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

There is no obligation to issue a proposed rule with respect to those provisions of today's regulations that are procedural,
interpretative, or non-substantive clarifications. 

With respect to the provisions of today's rule that exercise the options that are allowable under OMB Circular A-110,
DOE has reached a similar conclusion because those substantive policies represent the most permissive option permitted
under the circular. 

Finally, to the extent that existing policies are being continued, DOE also relies on its discretion to reissue existing
regulations, with minor technical editing, without proposing them for public comment. 



IV. Review Under Executive Order 12612 



Executive Order 12612 requires that regulations, rules, legislation, and any other policy actions be reviewed for
any substantial direct effects on States, on the relationship between the Federal Government and the States, or in
the distribution of power and responsibilities among various levels of Government. If there are sufficient substantial
direct effects, then the Executive Order requires preparation of a federalism assessment to be used in all decisions
involved in promulgating and implementing a policy action. Today's interim final rule will revise certain policy
and procedural requirements. However, DOE has determined that this rulemaking will not have a substantial direct
effect on the institutional interests or traditional functions of States. 



V. Regulatory Review 



Today's regulatory action has been determined not to be a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order
12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review,'' (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993). Accordingly, today's action was not subject
to review under the Executive Order by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. 



VI. Review Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act 



This interim final rule was reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164,
which requires preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis for any regulation that will have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities; i.e., small businesses, small organizations, and small
governmental jurisdictions. DOE has concluded that the interim final rule would only affect small entities as they
apply for and receive financial assistance, and does not create additional economic impact on small entities as a
whole. DOE certifies that this interim final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities and, therefore, no regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared. 



VII. Review Under the Paperwork Reduction Act 



No information collection or recordkeeping requirements are imposed upon the public by this interim final rulemaking.
Accordingly, no OMB clearance is required under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 USC 3501, et seq., or OMB implementing
regulations at 5 CFR Part 1320. 



VIII. Review Under the National Environmental Policy Act 



DOE has concluded that this rule falls into a class of actions (categorical exclusion A5) that are categorically excluded
from NEPA review because they would not individually or cumulatively have significant impact on the human environment,
as determined by the Department's regulations (10 CFR Part 1021, Subpart D) implementing the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321, 4331-4335, 4341-4347 (1976)). Therefore, this rule does not require
an environmental impact statement or an environmental assessment pursuant to NEPA. 



IX. Review Under Executive Order 12778 



Section 2 of Executive Order 12778 instructs each agency to adhere to certain requirements in promulgating new regulations
and reviewing existing regulations. These requirements, set forth in sections 2(a) and (b)(2), include eliminating
drafting errors and needless ambiguity, drafting the regulations to minimize litigation, providing clear and certain
legal standards for affected conduct, and promoting simplification and burden reduction. Agencies are also instructed
to make every reasonable effort to ensure that the regulation specifies clearly any preemptive effect, effect on
existing Federal law or regulation, and retroactive effect; describes any administrative proceedings to be available
prior to judicial review and any provisions for the exhaustion of such administrative proceedings; and defines key
terms. DOE certifies that today's interim final rule meets the requirements of sections 2 (a) and (b) of Executive
Order 12778. 



X. Public Comments 



Interested persons are invited to participate in this rulemaking by submitting data, views, or arguments with respect
to the changes set forth in this notice. Three copies of written comments should be submitted to the address indicated
in the 

ADDRESSES 

section of this notice. All comments received will be available for public inspection in the DOE Reading Room, Room
1E-190, Forrestal Building, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, D.C. 20585, between the hours of 9
a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. All written comments received by the date given in
the 

DATES 

section will be fully considered. Any information considered to be confidential must be so identified and submitted
in writing, one copy only. The DOE reserves the right to determine the confidential status of the information and to
treat it according to our determination. 

The Department has concluded that this interim final rule does not involve a substantial issue of fact or law and that
the interim final rule should not have substantial impact on the nation's economy or a large number of individuals
or businesses. Therefore, pursuant to Pub. L. 95-91, the DOE Organization Act, and the Administrative Procedure
Act (5 U.S.C. 553), the Department does not plan to hold a public hearing on this interim final rule.

and agreements awarded to institutions of higher education, hospitals, and other non-profit and commercial organizations.
It also establishes rules governing subawards to institutions of higher education, hospitals, and non-profit and
commercial organizations (including grants and cooperative agreements administered by State, local and Indian
Tribal governments). 



600.101

(3) Other amounts becoming owed under programs for which no current services or performance is required. 



Accrued income 

means the sum of: 

(1) Earnings during a given period from services performed by the recipient, and goods and other tangible property
delivered to purchasers, and 

(2) Amounts becoming owed to the recipient for which no current services or performance is required by the recipient.




Acquisition cost of equipment 

means the net invoice price of the equipment, including the cost of modifications, attachments, accessories, or
auxiliary apparatus necessary to make the property usable for the purpose for which it was acquired. Other charges,
such as the cost of installation, transportation, taxes, duty or protective in-transit insurance, shall be included
or excluded from the unit acquisition cost in accordance with the recipient's regular accounting practices. 



Advance 

means a payment made by Treasury check or other appropriate payment mechanism to a recipient upon its request either
before outlays are made by the recipient or through the use of predetermined payment schedules. 



Award

Date of completion 

means the date on which all work under an award is completed or the date on the award document, or any supplement or amendment
thereto, on which DOE sponsorship ends.

a useful life of more than one year and an acquisition cost of $5000 or more per unit. However, consistent with recipient
policy, lower limits may be established. 



Excess property 

means property under the control of any Federal awarding agency that, as determined by the head thereof, is no longer
required for its needs or the discharge of its responsibilities. 



Exempt property 

means tangible personal property acquired in whole or in part with Federal funds, where the Federal awarding agency
has statutory authority to vest title in the recipient without further obligation to the Federal Government. An example
of exempt property authority is contained in the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act (31 U.S.C. 6306), for
property acquired under an award to conduct basic or applied research by a non-profit institution of higher education
or non-profit organization whose principal purpose is conducting scientific research. 



Federal awarding agency 

means the Federal agency that provides an award to the recipient. 



Federal funds authorized

a given period that require payment by the recipient during the same or a future period. 



Outlays or expenditures 

means charges made to the project or program. They may be reported on a cash or accrual basis. For reports prepared on
a cash basis, outlays are the sum of cash disbursements for direct charges for goods and services, the amount of indirect
expense charged, the value of third party in-kind contributions applied and the amount of cash advances and payments
made to subrecipients. For reports prepared on an accrual basis, outlays are the sum of cash disbursements for direct
charges for goods and services, the amount of indirect expense incurred, the value of in-kind contributions applied,
and the net increase (or decrease) in the amounts owed by the recipient for goods and other property received, for services
performed by employees, contractors, subrecipients and other payees and other amounts becoming owed under programs
for which no current services or performance are required. 



Personal property 

means property of any kind except real property. It may be tangible, having physical existence, or intangible, having
no physical existence, such as copyrights, patents, or securities. 



Prior approval 

means written approval by a contracting officer evidencing prior consent. 



Program income 

means gross income earned by the recipient that is directly generated by a supported activity or earned as a result
of the award (see exclusions in   600.124 (e) and (h)). Program income includes, but is not limited to,
income from fees for services performed, the use or rental of real or personal property acquired under federally-funded
projects, the sale of commodities or items fabricated under an award, license fees and royalties on patents and copyrights,
and interest on loans made with award funds. Interest earned on advances of DOE funds is not program income. Except

educational associations, and health centers. The term shall include commercial organizations which are recipients,
subrecipients, or contractors or subcontractors of recipients or subrecipients. The term does not include government-owned
contractor-operated facilities or research centers providing continued support for mission-oriented, large-scale
programs that are government-owned or controlled, or are designated as federally-funded research and development
centers. 



Research and development

 means all research activities, both basic and applied, and all development activities that are supported at universities,
colleges, and other non-profit institutions. ``Research'' is defined as a systematic study directed toward fuller
scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied. ``Development'' is the systematic use of knowledge
and understanding gained from research directed toward the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or
methods, including design and development of prototypes and processes. The term research also includes activities
involving the training of individuals in research techniques where such activities utilize the same facilities
as other research and development activities and where such activities are not included in the instruction function.




Small award

 means a grant or cooperative agreement not exceeding the small purchase threshold fixed at 41 U.S.C. 403(11) (currently
$25,000). 



Subaward

 means an award of financial assistance in the form of money, or property in lieu of money, made under an award by a recipient
to an eligible subrecipient or by a subrecipient to a lower tier subrecipient. The term includes financial assistance
when provided by any legal agreement, even if the agreement is called a contract, but does not include procurement
of goods and services nor does it include any form of assistance which is excluded from the definition of ``award''
above. 



Subrecipient

 means the legal entity to which a subaward is made and which is accountable to the recipient for the use of the funds provided.
The term may include foreign or international organizations (such as agencies of the United Nations). 



Supplies

and inventions of a contractor conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the performance of work under a funding
agreement (``subject inventions''), as defined in 37 CFR Part 401, ``Rights to Inventions Made by Nonprofit Organizations
and Small Business Firms Under Government Grants, Contracts, and Cooperative Agreements.'' 



Suspension

 means an action by DOE that temporarily withdraws DOE sponsorship under an award, pending corrective action by the
recipient or pending a decision to terminate the award by the DOE. Suspension of an award is a separate action from suspension
under DOE regulations implementing E.O.'s 12549 and 12689, ``Debarment and Suspension'' (see 10 CFR Part 1036).

for financial reports prepared on a cash basis, means the amount of obligations incurred by the recipient that have
not been paid. For reports prepared on an accrued expenditure basis, they represent the amount of obligations incurred
by the recipient for which an outlay has not been recorded.

means the portion of the funds authorized by DOE that has not been obligated by the recipient and is determined by deducting
the cumulative obligations from the cumulative funds authorized.

approved negotiated indirect cost rate. 




Working capital advance 

means a procedure whereby funds are advanced to the recipient to cover its estimated disbursement needs for a given
initial period. 



 600.102 

Effect on other issuances.



For awards subject to this Subpart, all administrative requirements of codified program regulations, program manuals,
handbooks and other nonregulatory materials which are inconsistent with the requirements of this Subpart shall
be superseded, except to the extent they are required by statute, or authorized in accordance with the deviations
provision in  600.4.



 600.103 

Deviations. 



The deviation provisions of  600.4 apply to this Subpart. 



 600.104 

Subawards.



Unless sections of this Subpart specifically exclude subrecipients from coverage, all DOE recipients, including
State, local and Indian tribal governments, shall apply the provisions of this Subpart to subrecipients performing
work under awards if such subrecipients are institutions of higher education, hospitals, other non-profit organizations
or commercial organizations. Thus, this Subpart is applicable to those types of organizations regardless of the
type of recipient receiving the primary award. State and local government subrecipients are subject to the provisions
of 10 CFR part 600, Subpart C, ``Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements to State
and Local Governments.'' 




Pre-Award Requirements 



 600.110 

Purpose.



Sections 600.111 through 600.117 prescribe 
forms and instructions and other pre-award matters to be used in applying for DOE awards. 



 600.111 

Pre-award policies. 



(a) Use of Grants and Cooperative Agreements, and Contracts. In each instance, the DOE shall decide on the appropriate
award instrument (i.e., grant, cooperative agreement, or contract). The Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement
Act (31 U.S.C. 6301-08) governs the use of grants, cooperative agreements and contracts. A grant or cooperative
agreement shall be used only when the principal purpose of a transaction is to accomplish a public purpose of support
or stimulation authorized by Federal statute. The statutory criterion for choosing between grants and cooperative
agreements is that for the latter, ``substantial involvement is expected between the executive agency and the State,
local government, or other recipient when carrying out the activity contemplated in the agreement.'' Contracts
shall be used when the principal purpose is acquisition of property or services for the direct benefit or use of the
Federal Government. 

(b) Public Notice and Priority Setting. DOE will, whenever practical, notify the public of its intended funding priorities
for discretionary grant programs, unless funding priorities are established by Federal statute. 



 600.112 

Forms for applying for Federal assistance. 



(a) General. An application for an award shall be on the form or in the format specified in a program rule, in the solicitation,
or in these regulations (see Section 600.10). When the SF-424 form is not used, DOE shall indicate whether the
application is subject to review by the State under E.O. 12372. DOE may also require applicants to complete_

(1) The Notice of Energy RD&D Project (DOE Form 538) if the application is for a research, development, or demonstration
project; or 

(2) The Federal Assistance Management Summary Report 
(DOE F 4600.5) or the Federal Assistance Milestone Plan 
(DOE F 4600.3) as a baseline plan in accordance with the terms and conditions of award if required by program rule or
the solicitation. If a solicitation other than a program rule requires the use of one or both of these forms, the solicitation
shall contain an explanation of how the information to be provided relates to the objectives of the program.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941021-0-00116 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941021-0-00020 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(b) Budgetary information. DOE may request and the applicant shall submit the minimum budgetary information necessary
to evaluate the costs of the proposed project. 
(1) Applicants for research awards, other than State, local, or Indian tribal governments, will use DOE budget forms
ERF 4620.1 and ERF 4620.1A. All other applicants shall use the budget formats established in the solicitation or program
regulations. 
(2) DOE may, subsequent to receipt of an application, request additional information from an applicant when necessary
for clarification or to make informed preaward determinations. 
(c) Continuation and renewal applications. DOE may require that an application for a continuation or renewal award
(see  600.31 (b) and (c)) be made in the format or on the forms authorized by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.



 600.113 


Debarment and suspension. 


Recipients shall comply with the nonprocurement debarment and suspension common rule implementing E.O.'s 12549
and 12689, ``Debarment and Suspension,'' 10 CFR Part 1036. This common rule restricts subawards and contracts with
certain parties that are debarred, suspended or otherwise excluded from or ineligible for participation in Federal
assistance programs or activities. 


 600.114 


Special award conditions. 


(a) If an applicant or recipient has a history of poor performance, is not financially stable, has a management system
that does not meet the standards prescribed in this Subpart, has not conformed to the terms and conditions of a previous
award, or is not otherwise responsible, DOE may impose additional requirements as needed, without regard to the deviation
provisions of  600.4. Such applicant or recipient will be notified in writing as to the nature of the additional
requirements, the reason why the additional requirements are being imposed, the nature of the corrective action
needed, and the time allowed for completing the corrective actions. Reconsideration of the additional requirements
may be requested at any time. Any special conditions shall be promptly removed once the conditions that prompted them
have been corrected. 
(b) A recipient may place a special restrictive condition, as specified in paragraph (a) of this section, in a subaward.
In any such case, the recipient must notify DOE in writing within 15 days of the subaward. DOE shall decide whether to
notify OMB and other interested parties. 


 600.115 


Metric system of measurement. 


The Metric Conversion Act, as amended by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act (15 U.S.C. 205) declares that the
metric system is the preferred measurement system for U.S. trade and commerce. The Act requires each Federal agency
to establish a date or dates in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, when the metric system of measurement
will be used in the agency's procurements, grants, and other business-related activities. Metric implementation
may take longer where the use of the system is initially impractical or likely to cause significant inefficiencies
in the accomplishment of federally-funded activities. DOE will follow the provisions of E.O. 12770, ``Metric Usage
in Federal Government Programs.'' 



 600.116 


Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. 


Under the Act (Pub. L. 94-580 codified at 42 U.S.C. 6962), any State agency or agency of a political subdivision
of a State which is using appropriated Federal funds must comply with Section 6002. Section 6002 requires that preference
be given in procurement programs to the purchase of specific products containing recycled materials identified
in guidelines developed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (40 CFR Parts 247-254). Accordingly,
State and local institutions of higher education, hospitals, and non-profit organizations that receive direct
Federal awards or other Federal funds shall give preference in their procurement programs funded with Federal funds
to the purchase of recycled products pursuant to the EPA guidelines. 



 600.117 


Certifications and representations. 


Unless prohibited by statute or codified regulation, each Federal awarding agency is authorized and encouraged
to allow recipients to submit certifications and representations required by statute, executive order, or regulation
on an annual basis, if the recipients have ongoing and continuing relationships with the agency. Annual certifications
and representations shall be signed by responsible officials with the authority to ensure recipients' compliance
with the pertinent requirements. 


Post-Award Requirements 


Financial and Program Management 


 600.120 


Purpose of financial and program management. 


Sections 600.121 through 600.128 prescribe standards for financial management systems, methods for making payments
and rules for satisfying cost sharing and matching requirements, accounting for program income, budget revision
approvals, making audits, determining allowability of cost, and establishing fund availability. 



 600.121 


Standards for financial management systems. 


(a) Recipients shall relate financial data to performance data and develop unit cost information whenever practical.
For awards that support research, it should be noted that it is generally not appropriate to develop unit cost information.


(b) Except for the provisions of 600.121(f) and 600.181, recipients' financial management systems shall provide
for the following:

(1) Accurate, current and complete disclosure of the financial results of each federally-sponsored project or program
in accordance with the reporting requirements set forth in  600.152. If a DOE award requires reporting on an
accrual basis from a recipient that maintains its records on other than an accrual basis, the recipient shall not be
required to establish an accrual accounting system. These recipients may develop such accrual data for their reports
on the basis of an analysis of the documentation on hand. 
(2) Records that identify adequately the source and application of funds for federally-sponsored activities. These
records shall contain information pertaining to Federal awards, authorizations, obligations, unobligated balances,
assets, outlays, income and interest. 
(3) Effective control over and accountability for all funds, property and other assets. Recipients shall adequately
safeguard all such assets and assure they are used solely for authorized purposes. 
(4) Comparison of outlays with budget amounts for each award. Whenever appropriate, financial information should
be related to performance and unit cost data. As discussed in paragraph (a) of this section, unit cost data is generally
not appropriate for awards that support research. 
(5) Written procedures to minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds to the recipient from the U.S. Treasury
and the issuance or redemption of checks, warrants or payments by other means for program purposes by the recipient.
To the extent that the provisions of the Cash Management Improvement Act (CMIA) (Pub. L. 101-453) govern, payment
methods of State agencies, instrumentalities, and fiscal agents shall be consistent with CMIA Treasury-State Agreements
or the CMIA default procedures codified at 31 CFR Part 205, ``Withdrawal of Cash from the Treasury for Advances under
Federal Grant and Other Programs.'' 
(6) Written procedures for determining the reasonableness, allocability and allowability of costs in accordance
with the provisions of the applicable Federal cost principles and the terms and conditions of the award. 
(7) Accounting records including cost accounting records that are supported by source documentation. 
(c) Where the Federal Government guarantees or insures the repayment of money borrowed by the recipient, the Contracting
Officer, at his or her discretion, may require adequate bonding and insurance if the bonding and insurance requirements
of the recipient are not deemed adequate to protect the interest of the Federal Government. 
(d) The Contracting Officer may require adequate fidelity bond coverage where the recipient lacks sufficient coverage
to protect the Federal Government's interest. 
(e) Where bonds are required in the situations described in   600.121 (c) and (d), the bonds shall be obtained
from companies holding certificates of authority as acceptable sureties, as prescribed in 31 CFR Part 223, ``Surety
Companies Doing Business with the United States.'' 
(f) Individuals whose financial management systems do not meet the minimum standards of  600.121 (b) shall
maintain a separate bank account for deposit of award or subaward funds. Disbursements by the recipient or subrecipient
from this account shall be supported by source documentation such as canceled checks, paid bills, receipts, payrolls,
etc. 


600.122 


Payment. 


(a) Payment methods shall minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds from the United States Treasury
and the issuance or redemption of checks, warrants, or payment by other means by the recipients. Payment methods of
State agencies or instrumentalities shall be consistent with Treasury-State CMIA agreements or default procedures
codified at 31 CFR Part 205. 
(b) Recipients will be paid in advance, provided they maintain or demonstrate the willingness to maintain: 
(1) Written procedures that minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds and disbursement by the recipient,
and 
(2) Financial management systems that meet the standards for fund control and accountability as established in  600.121.
Cash advances to a recipient organization shall be limited to the minimum amounts needed and be timed to be in accordance
with the actual, immediate cash requirements of the recipient organization in carrying out the purpose of the approved
program or project. The timing and amount of cash advances shall be as close as is administratively feasible to the
actual disbursements by the recipient organization for direct program or project costs and the proportionate share
of any allowable indirect costs. 
(c) Whenever possible, advances shall be consolidated to cover anticipated cash needs for all awards made by the DOE
to the recipient. 
(1) Advance payment mechanisms include, but are not limited to, Treasury check and electronic funds transfer. 
(2) Advance payment mechanisms are subject to 
31 CFR Part 205. 
(3) Recipients may submit requests for advances and reimbursements at least monthly when electronic fund transfers
are not used. 
(d) Requests for Treasury check advance payment shall be submitted on SF-270, ``Request for Advance or Reimbursement,''
or other forms as may be authorized by OMB. This form is not to be used when Treasury check advance payments are made to
the recipient automatically through the use of a predetermined payment schedule or if precluded by special DOE instructions
for electronic funds transfer. 
(e) Reimbursement is the preferred method when the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section cannot be met. DOE
may also use this method on any construction agreement, or if the major portion of the construction project is accomplished
through private market financing or Federal loans, and the Federal assistance constitutes a minor portion of the
project. 
(1) When the reimbursement method is used, DOE shall make payment within 30 days after receipt of the billing, unless
the billing is improper.

(2) Recipients are authorized to submit requests for reimbursement at least monthly when electronic funds transfers
are not used. 

(f) If a recipient cannot meet the criteria for advance payments and DOE has determined that reimbursement is not feasible
because the recipient lacks sufficient working capital, DOE may provide cash on a working capital advance basis.
Under this procedure, DOE advances cash to the recipient to cover its estimated disbursement needs for an initial
period generally geared to the recipient's disbursing cycle. Thereafter, DOE reimburses the recipient for its actual
cash disbursements. The working capital advance method of payment will not be used for recipients unwilling or unable
to provide timely advances to their subrecipient to meet the subrecipient's actual cash disbursements. 

(g) To the extent available, recipients shall disburse funds available from repayments to and interest earned on
a revolving fund, program income, rebates, refunds, contract settlements, audit recoveries and interest earned
on such funds before requesting additional cash payments. 

(h) Unless otherwise required by statute, DOE will not withhold payments for proper charges made by recipients at
any time during the project period unless paragraph (h)(1) or (h)(2) of this section apply. 

(1) A recipient has failed to comply with the project objectives, the terms and conditions of the award, or DOE reporting
requirements. 

(2) The recipient or subrecipient is delinquent in a debt to the United States. Under such conditions, the Federal
awarding agency may, upon reasonable notice, inform the recipient that payments shall not be made for obligations
incurred after a specified date until the conditions are corrected or the indebtedness to the Federal Government
is liquidated. 
Before withholding any payment, DOE shall notify the recipient that payments shall not be made for obligations incurred
after a specified date, which shall ordinarily be no sooner than 30 days from the date of the notice, until the recipient
corrects the noncompliance or pays the indebtedness to the Federal government. 

(i) Standards governing the use of banks and other institutions as depositories of funds advanced under awards are
as follows. 

(1) Except for situations described in paragraph (i)(2) of this section, DOE shall not require separate depository
accounts for funds provided to a recipient or establish any eligibility requirements for depositories for funds
provided to a recipient. However, recipients must be able to account for the receipt, obligation and expenditure
of funds. 

(2) Advances of Federal funds shall be deposited and maintained in insured accounts whenever possible. 

(j) Consistent with the national goal of expanding the opportunities for women-owned and minority-owned business
enterprises, recipients are encouraged to use women-owned and minority-owned banks (a bank which is owned at least
50 percent by women or minority group members). 

(k) Recipients shall maintain advances of Federal funds in interest bearing accounts, unless paragraph (k) (1),
(2) or (3) of this section apply. 

(1) The recipient receives less than $120,000 in Federal awards per year. 

(2) The best reasonably available interest bearing account would not be expected to earn interest in excess of $250
per year on Federal cash balances. 

(3) The depository would require an average or minimum balance so high that it would not be feasible within the expected
Federal and non-Federal cash resources. 

(l) For those entities where CMIA and its implementing regulations do not apply, interest earned on Federal advances
deposited in interest bearing accounts shall be remitted annually to the HHS Payment Management System through an
electronic medium such as the FEDWIRE Deposit system. Recipients which do not have this capability should use a check.
The address is the Department of Health and Human Services, Payment Management System, P.O. Box 6021, Rockville,
MD 20852. Interest amounts up to $250 per year may be retained by the recipient for administrative expense. State universities
and hospitals shall comply with CMIA, as it pertains to interest. If an entity subject to CMIA uses its own funds to pay
pre-award costs for discretionary awards without prior written approval from the Federal awarding agency, it waives
its right to recover the interest under CMIA. 

(m) Except as noted elsewhere in this Subpart, only the following forms shall be authorized for the recipients in requesting
advances and reimbursements. Federal agencies shall not require more than an original and two copies of these forms.


(1) SF-270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement. Each Federal awarding agency shall adopt the SF-270
as a standard form for all nonconstruction programs when electronic funds transfer or predetermined advance methods
are not used. Federal awarding agencies, however, have the option of using this form for construction programs in
lieu of the SF-271, ``Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs.'' 

(2) SF-271, Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs. Each Federal awarding
agency shall adopt the SF-271 as the standard form to be used for requesting reimbursement for construction
programs. However, a Federal awarding agency may substitute the SF-270 when the Federal awarding agency determines
that it provides adequate information to meet Federal needs.

(n) The DOE may convert a recipient from advance payment to reimbursement whenever the recipient no longer meets the
criteria for advance payment specified in paragraph (b) of this section. Any such conversion may be accomplished
only after the DOE has advised the recipient in writing of the reasons for the proposed action and has provided a period
of at least 30 days within which the recipient may take corrective action or provide satisfactory assurances of its
intention to take such action. 

(o) With prior DOE approval and in accordance with written DOE instructions, a recipient may assign to a bank, trust
company or other financing institution, including any Federal lending agency, reimbursement by Treasury check
due from DOE under the following conditions: 

(1) The award provides for reimbursement totaling $1,000 or more; 

(2) The assignment covers all amounts payable under 
the award that have not already been paid; 

(3) Reassignment is prohibited; and 

(4) The assignee files a written notice of award payment assignment and a true copy of the instrument of assignment
with DOE. Any interest costs resulting from a loan obtained on the basis of an assignment are unallowable charges to
DOE award funds or any required cost sharing. 

(p) Recipients shall observe the requirements of this section in making or withholding payments to subrecipients
except that the forms used by recipients are not required to be used by subrecipients when requesting advances or reimbursement.




 600.123 

Cost sharing or matching. 



(a) All cost sharing or matching contributions, including cash and third party in-kind, shall meet all of the following
criteria. 

(1) Are verifiable from the recipient's records. 

(2) Are not included as contributions for any other federally-assisted project or program. 

(3) Are necessary and reasonable for proper and efficient accomplishment of project or program objectives. 

(4) Are allowable under the applicable cost principles. 

(5) Are not paid by the Federal Government under another award, except where authorized by Federal statute to be used
for cost sharing or matching. 

(6) Are provided for in the approved budget.

(7) Conform to other provisions of this Subpart, as applicable. 
(b) Unrecovered indirect costs may be included as part of cost sharing or matching. 

(c) Values for recipient contributions of services and property shall be established in accordance with the applicable
cost principles. If DOE authorizes recipients to donate buildings or land for construction/facilities acquisition
projects or long-term use, the value of the donated property for cost sharing or matching shall be the lesser of either
paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section. 

(1) The certified value of the remaining life of the property recorded in the recipient's accounting records at the
time of donation. 

(2) The current fair market value. However, when there is sufficient justification, DOE may approve the use of the
current fair market value of the donated property, even if it exceeds the certified value at the time of donation to
the project. 

(d) Volunteer services furnished by professional and technical personnel, consultants, and other skilled and unskilled
labor may be counted as cost sharing or matching if the service is an integral and necessary part of an approved project
or program. Rates for volunteer services shall be consistent with those paid for similar work in the recipient's organization.
In those instances in which the required skills are not found in the recipient organization, rates shall be consistent
with those paid for similar work in the labor market in which the recipient competes for the kind of services involved.
In either case, paid fringe benefits that are reasonable, allowable, and allocable may be included in the valuation.


(e) When an employer other than the recipient furnishes the services of an employee, these services shall be valued
at the employee's regular rate of pay (plus an amount of fringe benefits that are reasonable, allowable, and allocable,
but exclusive of overhead costs), provided these services are in the same skill for which the employee is normally
paid. 

(f) Donated supplies may include such items as office supplies, laboratory supplies or workshop and classroom supplies.
Value assessed to donated supplies included in the cost sharing or matching share shall be reasonable and shall not
exceed the fair market value of the property at the time of the donation. 

(g) The method used for determining cost sharing or matching for donated equipment, buildings and land for which title
passes to the recipient may differ according to the purpose of the award, if either paragraph (g)(1) or (2) of this section
apply. 

(1) If the purpose of the award is to assist the recipient in the acquisition of equipment, buildings or land, the total
value of the donated property may be claimed as cost sharing or matching. 

(2) If the purpose of the award is to support activities that require the use of equipment, buildings or land, normally
only depreciation or use charges for equipment and buildings may be made. However, the full value of equipment or other
capital assets and fair rental charges for land may be allowed, provided that DOE has approved the charges. 

(h) The value of donated property shall be determined in accordance with the usual accounting policies of the recipient,
with the following qualifications. 

(1) The value of donated land and buildings shall not exceed its fair market value at the time of donation to the recipient
as established by an independent appraiser (e.g., certified real property appraiser or General Services Administration
representative) and certified by a responsible official of the recipient. 

(2) The value of donated equipment shall not exceed the fair market value of equipment of the same age and condition
at the time of donation. 

(3) The value of donated space shall not exceed the fair rental value of comparable space as established by an independent
appraisal of comparable space and facilities in a privately-owned building in the same locality. 

(4) The value of loaned equipment shall not exceed its fair rental value. 

(i) The following requirements pertain to the recipient's supporting records for in-kind contributions from third
parties.

(1) Volunteer services shall be documented and, to the extent feasible, supported by the same methods used by the recipient
for its own employees. 

(2) The basis for determining the valuation for personal service, material, equipment, buildings and land shall
be documented. 

(j) DOE shall specify in the solicitation or in the program rule, if any, any cost sharing requirement. The award document
shall be specific as to whether the cost sharing is based on a minimum amount for the recipient or on a percentage of total
costs. 

(k) If DOE requires that a recipient provide cost sharing which is not required by statute or which exceeds a statutory
minimum, DOE shall state in the program rule or solicitation the reasons for requiring such cost sharing, recommended
or required levels of cost sharing, and the circumstances under which the requirement for cost sharing may be waived
or adjusted during any negotiation. 

(l) Whenever DOE negotiates the amount of cost sharing, DOE may take into account such factors as the use of program
income (see  600.124), patent rights, and rights in data. Foregone fee or profit shall not be considered in establishing
the extent of cost sharing. 


 600.124 

Program income. 



(a) The standards set forth in this section shall be used to account for program income related to projects financed
in whole or in part with DOE funds. 

(b) Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, program income earned during the project period shall be retained
by the recipient and, in accordance with program regulations or the terms and conditions of the award, shall be used
in one or more of the following ways. 

(1) Added to funds committed to the project and used to further eligible project objectives. 

(2) Used to finance the non-DOE share of the project. 

(3) Deducted from the total project allowable cost in determining the net allowable costs on which the share of costs
is based. 

(c) When DOE authorizes the disposition of program income as described in paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section,
program income in excess of any limits stipulated shall be used in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section.


(d) In the event that the program regulations or the terms and conditions of the award do not specify how program income
is to be used, paragraph (b)(3) of this section shall apply automatically to all projects or programs except research.
For awards that support research, paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall apply automatically unless the award indicates
another alternative in the terms and conditions, the recipient is subject to special award conditions, as indicated
in  600.114, or the recipient is a commercial organization. 

(e) Unless program regulations or the terms and conditions of the award provide otherwise, recipients shall have
no obligation to the Federal Government regarding program income earned after the end of the project period. 

(f) Unless program regulations or the terms and conditions of the award provide otherwise, costs incident to the generation
of program income may be deducted from gross income to determine program income, provided these costs have not been
charged to the award. 

(g) Proceeds from the sale of property shall be handled in accordance with the requirements of the Property Standards
(See   600.130 through 600.137). 

(h) Unless program regulations or the terms and condition of the award provide otherwise, recipients shall have no
obligation to the Federal Government with respect to program income earned from license fees and royalties for copyrighted
material, patents, patent applications, trademarks, and inventions produced under an award. However, Patent and
Trademark Amendments (35 U.S.C. Chapter 18) apply to inventions made under an experimental, developmental, or research
award. 



 600.125 

Revision of budget and program plans. 




(a) The budget plan is the financial expression of the project or program as approved during the award process. It includes
the sum of the Federal and non-Federal share when there are cost sharing requirements. It shall be related to performance
for program evaluation purposes whenever appropriate. 

(b) Recipients are required to report deviations from budget and program plans, and request prior approvals for budget
and program plan revisions, in accordance with this section. 

(c) For nonconstruction awards, recipients shall request prior approvals from the DOE for one or more of the following
program or budget related reasons. 

(1) Change in the scope or the objective of the project or program (even if there is no associated budget revision requiring
prior written approval). 

(2) Change in a key person specified in the application or award document. 

(3) The absence for more than three months, or a 25 percent reduction in time devoted to the project, by the approved
project director or principal investigator. 

(4) The need for additional Federal funding. 

(5) If required by program regulations, the transfer of amounts budgeted for indirect costs to absorb increases in
direct costs, or vice versa. 

(6) The inclusion, unless waived by program regulations or the terms and conditions of award, of costs that require
prior approval in accordance with OMB Circular A-21, ``Cost Principles for Institutions of Higher Education,''
OMB Circular A-122, ``Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations,'' or 45 CFR Part 74 Appendix E, ``Principles
for Determining Costs Applicable to Research and Development under Grants and Contracts with Hospitals,'' or 48
CFR Part 31, ``Contract Cost Principles and Procedures,'' as applicable. 

(7) The transfer of funds allotted for training allowances (direct payment to trainees) to other categories of expense.

(8) Unless described in the application and funded in the approved awards, the subaward, transfer or contracting
out of any work under an award. This provision does not apply to the purchase of supplies, material, equipment or general
support services. 
(d) No other prior approval requirements for specific items may be imposed unless a deviation has been approved in
accordance with  600.4. 
(e) Except for requirements listed in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(4) of this section, program regulations may waive
cost-related and administrative prior written approvals required by this Subpart and its Appendices. Such waivers
may include authorizing recipients to do any one or more of the following. 
(1) Incur pre-award costs 90 calendar days prior to award without prior approval or more than 90 calendar days with
the prior approval of DOE. All pre-award costs are incurred at the recipient's risk (i.e., DOE is under no obligation
to reimburse such costs if for any reason the recipient does not receive an award or if the award is less than anticipated
and inadequate to cover such costs).
(2) Initiate a one-time extension of the expiration date of the final budget period of the project of up to 12 months
unless one or more of the following conditions apply. 
(i) The terms and conditions of award prohibit the extension. 
(ii) The extension requires additional Federal funds. 
(iii) The extension involves any change in the approved objectives or scope of the project. 
(iv) The extension is being exercised merely for the purpose of using unobligated balances. 
For one-time extensions, the recipient must notify the DOE in writing with the supporting reasons and revised expiration
date at least 10 days before the expiration date specified in the award. 
(3) Carry forward unobligated balances to subsequent funding periods. 
(4) For awards that support research, unless the terms and conditions of award provide otherwise, the prior approval
requirements described in paragraph (e) of this section are automatically waived (i.e., recipients need not obtain
such prior approvals) unless one of the conditions included in  600.125(e)(2) applies.
(5) For continuation awards within a multiple year project in support of research, prior to receipt of continuation
funding, preaward expenditures by recipients are not subject to the limitation or approval requirements of  600.125(e)(1).
Nevertheless, incurrence by the recipient does not impose any obligation on DOE if a continuation award is not subsequently
made, or if an award is made for a lesser amount than the recipient expected. 
(f) Program regulations may restrict the transfer of funds among direct cost categories or programs, functions and
activities for awards in which DOE's share of the project exceeds $100,000 and the cumulative amount of such transfers
exceeds or is expected to exceed 10 percent of the total budget as last approved by DOE. However, no program regulation
shall permit a transfer that would cause any Federal appropriation or part thereof to be used for purposes other than
those consistent with the original intent of the appropriation. 
(g) All other changes to nonconstruction budgets, except for the changes described in paragraph (j) of this section,
do not require prior approval. 
(h) For construction awards, recipients shall request prior written approval promptly from the Contracting Officer
for budget revisions whenever paragraph (h) (1), (2) or (3) of this section apply. 
(1) The revision results from changes in the scope or the objective of the project or program. 
(2) The need arises for additional Federal funds to complete the project. 
(3) A revision is desired which involves specific costs for which prior written approval requirements may be imposed
consistent with applicable OMB cost principles listed in  600.127.

(i) Except in accordance with the deviation procedures in 600.4 or as may be provided for in program regulations, no
other prior approval requirements for specific items will be imposed by DOE. 

(j) When DOE makes an award that provides support for both construction and nonconstruction work, DOE may require
the recipient to request prior approval from DOE before making any fund or budget transfers between the two types of
work supported. 

(k) For both construction and nonconstruction awards, recipients shall notify DOE in writing promptly whenever
the amount of Federal authorized funds is expected to exceed the needs of the recipient for the project period by more
than $5000 or five percent of the Federal award, whichever is greater. This notification shall not be required if an
application for additional funding is submitted for a continuation award. 

(l) Requests for budget revisions may be made by letter. 

(m) Within 30 calendar days from the date of receipt of the request for budget revisions, DOE shall review the request
and notify the recipient whether the budget revisions have been approved. If the revision is still under consideration
at the end of 30 calendar days, DOE shall inform the recipient in writing of the date when the recipient may expect the
decision. 

(n) DOE approval or disapproval of a request for a budget or project revision shall be in writing and signed by a DOE Contracting
Officer. 

(o) A request by a subrecipient for prior approval shall be addressed in writing to the recipient. The recipient shall
promptly review such request and shall approve or disapprove the request in writing within 30 days from the date of
the recipient's request for the revision. A recipient shall not approve any budget or project revision which is inconsistent
with the purpose or terms and conditions of the DOE award. If the revision requested by the subrecipient would result
in a change to the recipient's approved budget or approved project which requires DOE prior approval, the recipient
shall obtain DOE approval before approving such revision.



 600.126

Non-Federal audits.



(a) Recipients and subrecipients that are institutions of higher education or other non-profit organizations shall
be subject to the audit requirements contained in OMB Circular A-133, ``Audits of Institutions of Higher Education
and Other Non-Profit Institutions.'' 

(b) State and local governments shall be subject to the audit requirements contained in the Single Audit Act 
(31 U.S.C. 7501-7) and Federal awarding agency regulations implementing OMB Circular A-128, ``Audits
of State and Local Governments.'' 

(c) The Contracting Officer may audit, or cause to be audited, awards to hospitals not covered by the audit provisions
of OMB Circular A-133 whenever and in the degree of detail he/she deems necessary. The Contracting Officer shall
rely on available audit reports in determining the need for and scope of such audits. The hospital has similar authority
in auditing subrecipients. 

(d) The Contracting Officer may audit, or cause to be audited, awards to commercial organizations whenever and in
the degree of detail he/she deems necessary. The Contracting Officer shall rely on available audit reports in determining
the need for and scope of such audits. The commercial organization has similar authority in auditing subrecipients.


(e) The Contracting Officer may audit, or cause to be audited, awards to individuals whenever and in the degree of detail
he/she deems necessary. The Contracting Officer shall rely on available audit reports in determining the need for
and scope of such audits.



 600.127

Allowable costs.



(a) 

General. 

For each kind of recipient, there is a set of Federal principles for determining allowable costs. Allowability of
costs shall be determined in accordance with the cost principles applicable to the entity incurring the costs. Thus,
allowability of costs incurred by State, local or federally-recognized Indian tribal governments is determined
in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-87, ``Cost Principles for State and Local Governments.''
The allowability of costs incurred by non-profit organizations is determined in accordance with the provisions
of OMB Circular A-122, ``Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations.'' The allowability of costs incurred
by institutions of higher education is determined in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-21, ``Cost
Principles for Educational Institutions.'' The allowability of costs incurred by hospitals is determined in accordance
with the provisions of Appendix E of 45 CFR Part 74, ``Principles for Determining Costs Applicable to Research and
Development Under Grants and Contracts with Hospitals.'' The allowability of costs incurred by commercial organizations
and those non-profit organizations listed in Attachment C to Circular A-122 is determined in accordance with
the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 48 CFR Part 31. 

(b) 

Indirect costs. 

Unless restricted by Federal statute or program rule, DOE shall provide for the reimbursement of appropriate indirect
costs. 

(1) DOE shall include an amount for indirect costs in an award only if the applicant requests reimbursement of such
costs and_

(i) Submits evidence that a cognizant Federal agency has been assigned to establish indirect cost rates for the applicant
and indicates or provides evidence that_

(A) A current agreement containing an applicable approved indirect cost rate(s) covering all or part of the budget
period for which DOE may provide funding has been established; or 

(B) An indirect cost proposal has been submitted to the cognizant agency in order to establish an applicable approved
indirect cost rate(s) covering all or part of the budget period for which DOE may provide funding; or

(C) An indirect cost proposal covering all or part of the budget period and applicable to the activities for which DOE
may provide funding will be submitted to the cognizant agency for approval no later than three months after the beginning
date of the initial budget period of the DOE award or, for subsequent budget periods, in accordance with any schedule
established by the cognizant agency; or 
(ii) If not assigned to a cognizant agency, the applicant includes, in the application, data that is current, complete,
accurate, and sufficient to allow the Contracting Officer to determine a rate(s) for indirect costs. If the total
approved budget will not exceed $100,000 or if the amount requested for indirect costs does not exceed $5,000, DOE
may waive the requirement for negotiation of a rate and, in lieu thereof, provide a reasonable allowance for such costs.

(2) Indirect cost proposals shall be prepared and submitted in accordance with the applicable Federal cost principles
and instructions from the cognizant agency or from DOE, as appropriate. 
(3) If a subaward under an award or subaward provides for the payment of indirect costs, the recipient or subrecipient
shall be responsible for negotiating appropriate indirect costs, using the cost principles applicable to the subrecipient
or contractor, unless the subrecipient or contractor has negotiated an applicable rate directly with DOE or another
Federal department or agency. DOE may review and audit the procedures a recipient or subrecipient uses in conducting
indirect cost negotiations. 
(c) 

Fee or profit. 

No increment above cost may be paid to a recipient or subrecipient under a DOE award or subaward, except for SBIR recipients
as provided in  600.181(d)(3). A fee or profit may be paid to a contractor providing goods or services under a
contract with a recipient or subrecipient. 


 600.128 

Period of availability of funds.


Where a funding period is specified, a recipient may charge to the award only allowable costs resulting from obligations
incurred during the funding period and any pre-award costs authorized by DOE. 


Property Standards 


 600.130 

Purpose of property standards.


Sections 600.131 through 600.137 set forth uniform standards governing management and disposition of property
furnished by the Federal Government or whose cost was charged to a project supported by a Federal award. Recipients
shall observe these standards under awards and shall not impose additional requirements, unless specifically required
by Federal statute or program regulations. The recipient may use its own property management standards and procedures
provided it observes the provisions of   600.131 through 600.137. 


 600.131 

Insurance coverage.


Recipients shall, at a minimum, provide the equivalent insurance coverage for real property and equipment acquired
with DOE funds as provided to property owned by the recipient. Federally-owned property need not be insured unless
required by the terms and conditions of the award. 


 600.132 

Real property.


Unless otherwise provided by statute or program regulations, the requirements concerning the use and disposition
of real property acquired in whole or in part under awards are as follows. 
(a) Title to real property shall vest in the recipient subject to the condition that the recipient shall use the real
property for the authorized purpose of the project as long as it is needed and shall not encumber the property without
approval of DOE. 
(b) The recipient shall obtain written approval by DOE for the use of real property in other federally-sponsored projects
when the recipient determines that the property is no longer needed for the purpose of the original project. Use in
other projects shall be limited to those under federally-sponsored projects (i.e., awards) or programs that have
purposes consistent with those authorized for support by DOE. 
(c) When the real property is no longer needed as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the recipient shall
request disposition instructions from DOE or its successor Federal awarding agency. DOE will give one or more of the
following disposition instructions. 
(1) The recipient may be permitted to retain title without further obligation to the Federal Government after it compensates
the Federal Government for that percentage of the current fair market value of the property attributable to the Federal
participation in the project. 
(2) The recipient may be directed to sell the property under guidelines provided by DOE and pay the Federal Government
for that percentage of the current fair market value of the property attributable to the Federal participation in
the project (after deducting actual and reasonable selling and fix-up expenses, if any, from the sales proceeds).
When the recipient is authorized or required to sell the property, proper sales procedures shall be established that
provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible return. 
(3) The recipient may be directed to transfer title to the property to the Federal Government or to an eligible third
party provided that, in such cases, the recipient shall be entitled to compensation for its attributable percentage
of the current fair market value of the property. 


 600.133 

Federally-owned and exempt property.

(a) 

Federally-owned property.

 
(1) Title to federally-owned property remains vested in the Federal Government. Recipients shall submit annually
an inventory listing of federally-owned property in their custody to DOE. Upon completion of the award or when the
property is no longer needed, the recipient shall report the property to DOE for further Federal agency utilization.

(2) If DOE has no further need for the property, it shall be declared excess and reported to the General Services Administration,
unless DOE has statutory authority to dispose of the property by alternative methods (e.g., the authority provided
by the Federal Technology Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 3710 (i)) to donate research equipment to educational and non-profit
organizations in accordance with E.O. 12821, ``Improving Mathematics and Science Education in Support of the National
Education Goals.'') Appropriate instructions shall be issued to the recipient by DOE. 
(b) 

Exempt property. 

When statutory authority exists, DOE may vest title to property acquired with Federal funds in the recipient without
further obligation to the Federal Government and under conditions DOE considers appropriate. For example, under
31 U.S.C. 6306, DOE may so vest title to tangible personal property under a grant or cooperative agreement for basic
or applied research in a nonprofit institution of higher education or in a nonprofit organization whose primary purpose
is conducting scientific research. Such property is ``exempt property.'' Program regulations or the terms and conditions
of award may establish provisions for vesting title to exempt property. Should such conditions not be established
and the recipient has no need for the equipment, the recipient shall request disposition instructions from DOE. If
DOE does not issue disposition instructions within 120 calendar days of receipt of the request, title to the property
shall vest in the recipient without further obligation to the Federal Government. If, at the end of the project, DOE
fails to issue disposition instructions within 120 calendar days of the receipt of a final inventory, title to the
property shall vest in the recipient without further obligation to the Federal Government. 


 600.134 

Equipment. 


(a) Title to equipment acquired by a recipient with Federal funds shall vest in the recipient, subject to conditions
of this section. 
(b) The recipient shall not use equipment acquired with Federal funds to provide services to non-Federal outside
organizations for a fee that is less than private companies charge for equivalent services, unless specifically
authorized by Federal statute, for as long as the Federal Government retains an interest in the equipment. 
(c) The recipient shall use the equipment in the project or program for which it was acquired as long as needed, whether
or not the project or program continues to be supported by Federal funds and shall not encumber the property without
approval of DOE. When no longer needed for the original project or program, the recipient shall use the equipment in
connection with its other federally-sponsored activities, in the following order of priority: 
(1) Activities sponsored by DOE, then 
(2) Activities sponsored by other Federal agencies. 
(d) During the time that equipment is used on the project or program for which it was acquired, the recipient shall make
it available for use on other projects or programs if such other use will not interfere with the work on the project or
program for which the equipment was originally acquired. First preference for such other use shall be given to other
projects or programs sponsored by DOE that financed the equipment; second preference shall be given to projects or
programs sponsored by other Federal awarding agencies. If the equipment is owned by the Federal Government, use on
other activities not sponsored by the Federal Government shall be permissible if authorized by DOE. User charges
shall be treated as program income. 
(e) When acquiring replacement equipment, the recipient may use the equipment to be replaced as trade-in or sell the
equipment and use the proceeds to offset the costs of the replacement equipment subject to the approval of DOE. 
(f) The recipient's property management standards for equipment acquired with Federal funds and federally-owned
equipment shall include all of the following.

(1) Equipment records shall be maintained accurately and shall include the following information.

(i) A description of the equipment.

(ii) Manufacturer's serial number, model number, Federal stock number, national stock number, or other identification
number.

(iii) Source of the equipment, including the award number.

(iv) Whether title vests in the recipient or the Federal Government.

(v) Acquisition date (or date received, if the equipment was furnished by the Federal Government) and cost.

(vi) Information from which one can calculate the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the equipment
(not applicable to equipment furnished by the Federal Government).

(vii) Location and condition of the equipment and the date the information was reported.

(viii) Unit acquisition cost.

(ix) Ultimate disposition data, including date of disposal and sales price or the method used to determine current
fair market value where a recipient compensates DOE for its share.

(2) Equipment owned by the Federal Government shall be identified to indicate Federal ownership.

(3) A physical inventory of equipment shall be taken and the results reconciled with the equipment records at least
once every two years. Any differences between quantities determined by the physical inspection and those shown in
the accounting records shall be investigated to determine the causes of the difference. The recipient shall, in connection
with the inventory, verify the existence, current utilization, and continued need for the equipment.

(4) A control system shall be in effect to insure adequate safeguards to prevent loss, damage, or theft of the equipment.
Any loss, damage, or theft of equipment shall be investigated and fully documented; if the equipment was owned by the
Federal Government, the recipient shall promptly notify DOE.

(5) Adequate maintenance procedures shall be implemented to keep the equipment in good condition.

(6) Where the recipient is authorized or required to sell the equipment, proper sales procedures shall be established
which provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible return.

(g) When the recipient no longer needs the equipment, the equipment may be used for other activities in accordance
with the following standards. Equipment with a current per-unit fair market value of less than $5000 may be retained,
sold or otherwise disposed of with no further obligation to the awarding agency. For equipment with a current per unit
fair market value of $5000 or more, the recipient may retain the equipment for other uses provided that compensation
is made to the original Federal awarding agency or its successor. The amount of compensation shall be computed by applying
the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the original project or program to the current fair market value
of the equipment. If the recipient has no need for the equipment, the recipient shall request disposition instructions
from DOE. DOE shall determine whether the equipment can be used to meet DOE's requirements. If no requirement exists
within DOE, the availability of the equipment shall be reported to the General Services Administration by DOE to determine
whether a requirement for the equipment exists in other Federal agencies. DOE will issue instructions to the recipient
no later than 120 calendar days after the recipient's request and the following procedures shall govern.

(1) If so instructed or if disposition instructions are not issued within 120 calendar days after the recipient's
request, the recipient shall sell the equipment and reimburse DOE an amount computed by applying to the sales proceeds
the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the original project or program. However, the recipient shall
be permitted to deduct and retain from the Federal share $500 or ten percent of the proceeds, whichever is less, for
the recipient's selling and handling expenses.

(2) If the recipient is instructed to ship the equipment elsewhere, the recipient shall be reimbursed by the Federal
Government by an amount which is computed by applying the percentage of the recipient's participation in the cost
of the original project or program to the current fair market value of the equipment, plus any reasonable shipping
or interim storage costs incurred.

(3) If the recipient is instructed to otherwise dispose of the equipment, the recipient shall be reimbursed by DOE
for such costs incurred in its disposition.

(h) DOE reserves the right, at the end of a project, to transfer the title to the Federal Government or to a third party
named by DOE when such third party is otherwise eligible under existing statutes. Such transfer shall be subject to
the following standards.

(1) The equipment shall be appropriately identified in the award or otherwise made known to the recipient in writing.

(2) DOE shall issue disposition instructions within 120 calendar days after receipt of a final inventory. The final
inventory shall list all equipment acquired with award funds and federally-owned equipment. If DOE fails to issue
disposition instructions within the 120 calendar day period, the provisions of  600.134(g)(1) apply.

(3) When DOE exercises its right to take title, the equipment shall be subject to the provisions for federally-owned
equipment.



 600.135 

Supplies and other expendable property.



(a) Title to supplies and other expendable property shall vest in the recipient upon acquisition. If there is a residual
inventory of unused supplies exceeding $5000 in total aggregate value upon termination or completion of the project
or program and the supplies are not needed for any other federally-sponsored project or program, the recipient shall
retain the supplies for use on non-Federal sponsored activities or sell them, but shall, in either case, compensate
the Federal Government for its share. The amount of compensation shall be computed in the same manner as for equipment.

(b) The recipient shall not use supplies acquired with Federal funds to provide services to non-Federal outside organizations
for a fee that is less than private companies charge for equivalent services, unless specifically authorized by Federal
statute as long as the Federal Government retains an interest in the supplies.



 600.136 

Intangible property.



(a) The recipient may copyright any work that is subject to copyright and was developed, or for which ownership was
purchased, under an award. DOE reserves a royalty-free, nonexclusive and irrevocable right to reproduce, publish,
or otherwise use the work for Federal purposes, and to authorize others to do so.

(b) Recipients are subject to applicable regulations governing patents and inventions, including government-wide
regulations issued by the Department of Commerce at 37 CFR Part 401, ``Rights to Inventions Made by Nonprofit Organizations
and Small Business Firms Under Government Grants, Contracts and Cooperative Agreements.''
(c) DOE has the right to: 

(1) Obtain, reproduce, publish or otherwise use the data first produced under an award.

(2) Authorize others to receive, reproduce, publish, or otherwise use such data for Federal purposes.

(d) Title to intangible property and debt instruments acquired under an award or subaward vests upon acquisition
in the recipient. The recipient shall use that property for the originally-authorized purpose, and the recipient
shall not encumber the property without approval of DOE. When no longer needed for the originally authorized purpose,
disposition of the intangible property shall occur in accordance with the provisions of  600.134(g).



 600.137 

Property trust relationship.



Real property, equipment, intangible property and debt instruments that are acquired or improved with Federal funds
shall be held in trust by the recipient as trustee for the beneficiaries of the project or program under which the property
was acquired or improved. Recipients shall record liens or other appropriate notices of record to indicate that personal
or real property has been acquired or improved with Federal funds and that use and disposition conditions apply to
the property.



Procurement Standards

 600.140



Purpose of procurement standards.



Sections 600.141 through 600.148 set forth standards for use by recipients in establishing procedures for the procurement
of supplies and other expendable property, equipment, real property and other services with Federal funds. These
standards are furnished to ensure that such materials and services are obtained in an effective manner and in compliance
with the provisions of applicable Federal statutes and executive orders. No additional procurement standards or
requirements shall be imposed by DOE upon recipients, unless specifically required by Federal statute or executive
order or in accordance with the deviation procedures of  600.4.



 600.141



Recipient responsibilities.



The standards contained in this section do not relieve the recipient of the contractual responsibilities arising
under its contract(s). The recipient is the responsible authority, without recourse to DOE regarding the settlement
and satisfaction of all contractual and administrative issues arising out of procurements entered into in support
of an award or other agreement. This includes disputes, claims, protests of award, source evaluation or other matters
of a contractual nature. Matters concerning violation of statute are to be referred to such Federal, State or local
authority as may have proper jurisdiction. 



 600.142



Codes of conduct.



The recipient shall maintain written standards of conduct governing the performance of its employees engaged in
the award and administration of contracts. No employee, officer, or agent shall participate in the selection, award,
or administration of a contract supported by Federal funds if a real or apparent conflict of interest would be involved.
Such a conflict would arise when the employee, officer, or agent, any member of his or her immediate family, his or her
partner, or an organization which employs or is about to employ any of the parties indicated herein, has a financial
or other interest in the firm selected for an award. The officers, employees, and agents of the recipient shall neither
solicit nor accept gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors, or parties to subagreements.
However, recipients may set standards for situations in which the financial interest is not substantial or the gift
is an unsolicited item of nominal value. The standards of conduct shall provide for disciplinary actions to be applied
for violations of such standards by officers, employees, or agents of the recipient. 



 600.143



Competition.



All procurement transactions shall be conducted in a manner to provide, to the maximum extent practical, open and
free competition. The recipient shall be alert to organizational conflicts of interest as well as noncompetitive
practices among contractors that may restrict or eliminate competition or otherwise restrain trade. In order to
ensure objective contractor performance and eliminate unfair competitive advantage, contractors that develop
or draft specifications, requirements, statements of work, invitations for bids and/or requests for proposals
shall be excluded from competing for such procurements. Awards shall be made to the bidder or offeror whose bid or offer
is responsive to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the recipient, price, quality and other factors considered.
Solicitations shall clearly set forth all requirements that the bidder or offeror shall fulfill in order for the bid
or offer to be evaluated by the recipient. Any and all bids or offers may be rejected when it is in the recipient's interest
to do so. 



 600.144



Procurement procedures. 



(a) All recipients shall establish written procurement procedures. These procedures shall provide for, at a minimum,
that paragraphs (a)(1), (2) and (3) of this section apply. 

(1) Recipients avoid purchasing unnecessary items. 

(2) Where appropriate, an analysis is made of lease and purchase alternatives to determine which would be the most
economical and practical procurement. 

(3) Solicitations for goods and services provide for all of the following. 

(i) A clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for the material, product or service to be procured.
In competitive procurements, such a description shall not contain features which unduly restrict competition.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941021-0-00129 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941021-0-00020 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(ii) Requirements which the bidder/offeror must fulfill and all other factors to be used in evaluating bids or proposals.


(iii) A description, whenever practicable, of technical requirements in terms of functions to be performed or performance
required, including the range of acceptable characteristics or minimum acceptable standards. 

(iv) The specific features of ``brand name or equal'' descriptions that bidders are required to meet when such items
are included in the solicitation. 

(v) The acceptance, to the extent practicable and economically feasible, of products and services dimensioned in
the metric system of measurement. 

(vi) Preference, to the extent practicable and economically feasible, for products and services that conserve natural
resources and protect the environment and are energy efficient. 

(b) Positive efforts shall be made by recipients to utilize small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's
business enterprises, whenever possible. Recipients of DOE awards shall take all of the following steps to further
this goal. 

(1) Ensure that small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises are used to the fullest
extent practicable. 

(2) Make information on forthcoming opportunities available and arrange time frames for purchases and contracts
to encourage and facilitate participation by small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises.

(3) Consider in the contract process whether firms competing for larger contracts intend to subcontract with small
businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises. 

(4) Encourage contracting with consortiums of small businesses, minority wned firms and women's business enterprises
when a contract is too large for one of these firms to handle individually. 

(5) Use the services and assistance, as appropriate, of such organizations as the Small Business Administration
and the Department of Commerce's Minority Business Development Agency in the solicitation and utilization of small
businesses, minority-owned firms and women's business enterprises. 

(c) The type of procuring instruments used (e.g., fixed price contracts, cost reimbursable contracts, purchase
orders, and incentive contracts) shall be determined by the recipient but shall be appropriate for the particular
procurement and for promoting the best interest of the program or project involved. The ``cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost''
or ``percentage of construction cost'' methods of contracting shall not be used. 

(d) Contracts shall be made only with responsible contractors who possess the potential ability to perform successfully
under the terms and conditions of the proposed procurement. Consideration shall be given to such matters as contractor
integrity, record of past performance, financial and technical resources or accessibility to other necessary resources.
In certain circumstances, contracts with certain parties are restricted by DOE's implementation, in 10 CFR Part
1036, of E.O.'s 12549 and 12689, ``Debarment and Suspension.'' 

(e) Recipients shall, on request, make available for DOE, pre-award review and procurement documents, such as request
for proposals or invitations for bids, independent cost estimates, etc., when any of the following conditions apply.


(1) A recipient's procurement procedures or operation fails to comply with the procurement standards in this Subpart.


(2) The procurement is expected to exceed the small purchase threshold fixed at 41 U.S.C. 403 (11) (currently $25,000)
and is to be awarded without competition or only one bid or offer is received in response to a solicitation. 

(3) The procurement, which is expected to exceed the small purchase threshold, specifies a ``brand name'' product.


(4) The proposed award over the small purchase threshold is to be awarded to other than the apparent low bidder under
a sealed bid procurement. 

(5) A proposed contract modification changes the scope of a contract or increases the contract amount by more than
the amount of the small purchase threshold. 

(f) By agreement of the recipient or subrecipient and the contractor, if consistent with the recipient's or subrecipient's
usual business practices and applicable state and local law, any contract to which this section applies may provide
for the payment of interest penalties on amounts overdue under such contract except that_

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941021-0-00130 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941021-0-00020 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(1) In no case shall any obligation to pay such interest penalties be construed to be an obligation of the Federal government,
and 
(2) Any payment of such interest penalties may not be made from DOE funds nor be counted toward meeting a cost sharing
requirement of a DOE award. 


 600.145 

Cost and price analysis. 


Some form of cost or price analysis shall be made and documented in the procurement files in connection with every procurement
action. Price analysis may be accomplished in various ways, including the comparison of price quotations submitted,
market prices and similar indicia, together with discounts. Cost analysis is the review and evaluation of each element
of cost to determine reasonableness, allocability and allowability. 


 600.146 

Procurement records. 


Procurement records and files for purchases in excess of the small purchase threshold shall include the following
at a minimum: 
(a) Basis for contractor selection, 
(b) Justification for lack of competition when competitive bids or offers are not obtained, and 
(c) Basis for award cost or price. 


 600.147 

Contract administration. 


A system for contract administration shall be maintained to ensure contractor conformance with the terms, conditions
and specifications of the contract and to ensure adequate and timely follow up of all purchases. Recipients shall
evaluate contractor performance and document, as appropriate, whether contractors have met the terms, conditions
and specifications of the contract. 


 600.148 

Contract provisions. 


The recipient shall include, in addition to provisions to define a sound and complete agreement, the following provisions
in all contracts. The following provisions shall also be applied to subcontracts. 
(a) Contracts in excess of the small purchase threshold shall contain contractual provisions or conditions that
allow for administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in instances in which a contractor violates or breaches
the contract terms, and provide for such remedial actions as may be appropriate. 
(b) All contracts in excess of the small purchase threshold shall contain suitable provisions for termination by
the recipient, including the manner by which termination shall be effected and the basis for settlement. In addition,
such contracts shall describe conditions under which the contract may be terminated for default as well as conditions
where the contract may be terminated because of circumstances beyond the control of the contractor. 
(c) Except as otherwise required by statute, an award that requires the contracting (or subcontracting) for construction
or facility improvements shall provide for the recipient to follow its own requirements relating to bid guarantees,
performance bonds, and payment bonds unless the construction contract or subcontract exceeds $100,000. For those
contracts or subcontracts exceeding $100,000, DOE may accept the bonding policy and requirements of the recipient,
provided the DOE has made a determination that the Federal Government's interest is adequately protected. If such
a determination has not been made, the minimum requirements shall be as follows. 
(1) A bid guarantee from each bidder equivalent to five percent of the bid price. The ``bid guarantee'' shall consist
of a firm commitment such as a bid bond, certified check, or other negotiable instrument accompanying a bid as assurance
that the bidder shall, upon acceptance of his bid, execute such contractual documents as may be required within the
time specified. 
(2) A performance bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price. A ``performance bond'' is
one executed in connection with a contract to secure fulfillment of all the contractor's obligations under such contract.

(3) A payment bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price. A ``payment bond'' is one executed
in connection with a contract to assure payment as required by statute of all persons supplying labor and material
in the execution of the work provided for in the contract. 
(4) Where bonds are required in the situations described herein, the bonds shall be obtained from companies holding
certificates of authority as acceptable sureties pursuant to 31 CFR part 223, ``Surety Companies Doing Business
with the United States.'' 
(d) All negotiated contracts (except those for less than the small purchase threshold) awarded by recipients shall
include a provision to the effect that the recipient, DOE, the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their
duly authorized representatives, shall have access to any books, documents, papers and records of the contractor
which are directly pertinent to a specific program for the purpose of making audits, examinations, excerpts and transcriptions.

(e) All contracts, including small purchases, awarded by recipients and their contractors shall contain the procurement
provisions of Appendix A to this Subpart, as applicable. 


 600.149 

Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). 


Recipients' procurements shall comply with applicable requirements of RCRA, as described at Section 600.116 of
this Subpart. 


Reports and Records 


 600.150 

Purpose of reports and records. 


Sections 600.151 through 600.153 set forth the procedures for monitoring and reporting on the recipient's financial
and program performance and the necessary standard reporting forms. They also set forth record retention requirements.

 600.151 

Monitoring and reporting program performance. 


(a) Recipients are responsible for managing and monitoring each project, program, subaward, function or activity
supported by the award. Recipients shall monitor subawards to ensure subrecipients have met the audit requirements
as delineated in  600.126. 
(b) The terms and conditions of the award will prescribe the frequency with which the performance reports shall be
submitted. Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, performance reports shall not be required more frequently
than quarterly or less frequently than annually. Annual reports shall be due 90 calendar days after the award year;
quarterly or semi-annual reports shall be due 30 days after the reporting period. DOE may require annual reports before
the anniversary dates of multiple year awards in lieu of these requirements. The final performance reports are due
90 calendar days after the expiration or termination of the award. 
(c) If inappropriate, a final technical or performance report shall not be required after completion of the project.

(d) When required, performance reports shall generally contain, for each award, brief information on each of the
following. 
(1) A comparison of actual accomplishments with the goals and objectives established for the period, the findings
of the investigator, or both. Whenever appropriate and the output of programs or projects can be readily quantified,
such quantitative data should be related to cost data for computation of unit costs. 
(2) Reasons why established goals were not met, if appropriate. 
(3) Other pertinent information including, when appropriate, analysis and explanation of cost overruns or high
unit costs. 



DOE may specify in the award that the recipient provide this information on the Federal Assistance Program/Project
Status Report (DOE F 4600.6), the technical reporting formats, or the Federal Assistance Management Summary Report.
DOE may require that the Federal Assistance Management Summary Report be used as a performance report only when such
use is authorized by program rule or the need for this form is explained in the solicitation. The requirements of this
section concerning reporting frequency and deadlines shall apply to the Federal Assistance Management Summary
Report. (See also Section 600.112 with regard to use of this form as part of the award application.) 


(e) Recipients shall not be required to submit more than the original and two copies of performance reports. 
(f) Recipients shall immediately notify DOE of developments that have a significant impact on the award-supported
activities. Also, notification shall be given in the case of problems, delays, or adverse conditions which materially
impair the ability to meet the objectives of the award. This notification shall include a statement of the action taken
or contemplated, and any assistance needed to resolve the situation. 
(g) DOE may make site visits, as needed. 
(h) DOE shall comply with applicable clearance requirements of 5 CFR Part 1320 when requesting performance data from
recipients. 
(i) Recipients may place performance reporting requirements on subawards consistent with the provisions of this
section and shall require interim reporting in accordance with  600.151(f). 


 600.152 

Financial reporting. 


(a) The following forms or such other forms as may be approved by OMB are authorized for obtaining financial information
from recipients. 
(1) SF-269 or SF-269A, Financial Status Report. 
(i) Recipients shall use the SF-269 or SF-269A to report the status of funds for all nonconstruction projects
or programs, except that DOE has the option of not requiring the SF-269 or SF-269A when the SF-270,
Request for Advance or Reimbursement, or SF-272, Report of Federal Cash Transactions, is determined to provide
adequate information to meet DOE needs. However, a final SF-269 or SF-269A shall be required at the completion
of the project when the SF-270 is used only for advances. 
(ii) The terms and conditions of award shall prescribe whether the report shall be on a cash or accrual basis. DOE may
require accrual reporting only if such reporting is required by program statute or rule. If the award requires accrual
information and the recipient's accounting records are not normally kept on the accrual basis, the recipient shall
not be required to convert its accounting system, but shall develop such accrual information through best estimates
based on an analysis of the documentation on hand.

(iii) DOE shall determine the frequency of the Financial Status Report for each project or program, considering the
size and complexity of the particular project or program. However, the report shall not be required more frequently
than quarterly or less frequently than annually. A final report shall be required at the completion of the agreement.

(iv) DOE shall require recipients to submit the SF-269 or SF-269A (an original and no more than two copies)
no later than 30 days after the end of each specified reporting period for quarterly and semi-annual reports, and 90
calendar days for annual and final reports. Extensions of reporting due dates may be approved by the DOE upon request
of the recipient. 

(2) SF-272, Report of Federal Cash Transactions. 

(i) When funds are advanced, each recipient shall submit the SF-272 and, when necessary, its continuation sheet,
SF-272a. DOE will use this report to monitor cash advanced to recipients and to obtain disbursement information
for each agreement with the recipients. 

(ii) Recipients shall forecast Federal cash requirements in the ``Remarks'' section of the report. 
(iii) When practical and deemed necessary, DOE may require recipients to report in the ``Remarks'' section the amount
of cash advances received in excess of three days. Recipients shall provide short narrative explanations of actions
taken to reduce the excess balances. 

(iv) Recipients shall be required to submit not more than the original and two copies of the SF-272 15 calendar
days following the end of each quarter. DOE may require a monthly report from those recipients receiving advances
totaling $1 million or more per year. 

(v) DOE may waive the requirement for submission of the SF-272 for any one of the following reasons: 

(A) When monthly advances do not exceed $25,000 per recipient, provided that such advances are monitored through
other forms contained in this section; 

(B) If, in the contracting officer's opinion, the recipient's accounting controls are adequate to minimize excessive
Federal advances; or, 

(C) When electronic payment mechanisms provide adequate data. 

(b) When DOE needs additional information or more frequent reports, the following shall be observed: 
(1) When additional information is needed to comply with legislative requirements, DOE shall issue instructions
to require recipients to submit such information under the ``Remarks'' section of the reports. 
(2) When DOE determines that a recipient's accounting system does not meet the standards in Section 600.121, additional
pertinent information to further monitor awards may be obtained upon written notice to the recipient until such time
as the system is brought up to standard. DOE, in obtaining this information, shall comply with report clearance requirements
of 5 CFR Part 1320. 
(3) Contracting officers are encouraged to shade out any line item on any report if not necessary. 
(4) DOE may accept the identical information from the recipients in machine readable format or computer printouts
or electronic outputs in lieu of prescribed formats. 
(5) Computer or electronic outputs may be provided to recipients when that expedites or contributes to the accuracy
of reporting. 



 600.153 

Retention and access requirements for records. 



(a) This section sets forth requirements for record retention and access to records for awards to recipients. DOE
shall not impose any other record retention or access requirements upon recipients, unless such requirements are
established in program regulations. 
(b) Financial records, supporting documents, statistical records, and all other records pertinent to an award shall
be retained for a period of three years from the date of submission of the final expenditure report or, for awards that
are renewed quarterly or annually, from the date of the submission of the quarterly or annual financial report, as
authorized by DOE. The only exceptions are the following: 
(1) If any litigation, claim, or audit is started before the expiration of the 3-year period, the records shall be retained
until all litigation, claims or audit findings involving the records have been resolved and final action taken. 
(2) Records for real property and equipment acquired with Federal funds shall be retained for 3 years after final disposition.

(3) When records are transferred to or maintained by DOE, the 3-year retention requirement is not applicable to the
recipient.

(4) Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocations plans, and related records, for which retention requirements
are specified in  600.153(g). 

(c) Copies of original records may be substituted for the original records if authorized by DOE. 

(d) DOE shall request transfer of certain records to its custody from recipients when it determines that the records
possess long term retention value. However, in order to avoid duplicate recordkeeping, DOE may make arrangements
for recipients to retain any records that are continuously needed for joint use. 

(e) DOE, the Inspector General, Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives,
have the right of timely and unrestricted access to any books, documents, papers, or other records of recipients that
are pertinent to the awards, in order to make audits, examinations, excerpts, transcripts and copies of such documents.
This right also includes timely and reasonable access to a recipient's personnel for the purpose of interview and
discussion related to such documents. The rights of access in this paragraph are not limited to the required retention
period, but shall last as long as records are retained. 

(f) Unless required by statute, DOE shall place no restrictions on recipients that limit public access to the records
of recipients that are pertinent to an award, except when DOE can demonstrate that such records shall be kept confidential
and would have been exempted from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) if the records
had belonged to DOE. 

(g) Paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section apply to the following types of documents, and their supporting records:
indirect cost rate computations or proposals, cost allocation plans, and any similar accounting computations of
the rate at which a particular group of costs is chargeable (such as computer usage chargeback rates or composite fringe
benefit rates). 

(1) 

If submitted for negotiation.

 If the recipient submits to the Federal agency responsible for negotiating the recipient's indirect cost rate or
the subrecipient submits to the recipient the proposal, plan, or other computation to form the basis for negotiation
of the rate, then the 3-year retention period for its supporting records starts on the date of such submission. 

(2) 

If not submitted for negotiation.

 If the recipient is not required to submit to the cognizant Federal agency or the subrecipient is not required to submit
to the recipient the proposal, plan, or other computation for negotiation purposes, then the 3-year retention period
for the proposal, plan, or other computation and its supporting records starts at the end of the fiscal year (or other
accounting period) covered by the proposal, plan, or other computation. 

(h) If, by the terms and conditions of the award, the recipient or subrecipient_

(1) Is accountable for program income earned or received after the end of the project period or after the termination
of an award or subaward, or 
(2) If program income earned during the project period is required to be applied to costs incurred after the end of the
project period or after termination of an award or subaward, the record retention period shall start on the last day
of the recipient's or subrecipient's fiscal year in which such income was earned or received or such costs were incurred.
All other program income records shall be retained in accordance with  600.153(b). 


Termination and Enforcement 


 600.160 

Purpose of termination and enforcement. 


Sections 
600.161 and 600.162 set forth uniform suspension, termination and enforcement procedures. 


 600.161 

Termination. 


(a) Awards may be terminated in whole or in part only if paragraph (a) (1), (2) or (3) of this section apply. 
(1) By DOE, if a recipient materially fails to comply with the terms and conditions of an award. 
(2) By DOE with the consent of the recipient, in which case the two parties shall agree upon the termination conditions,
including the effective date and, in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated. 
(3) By the recipient upon sending to DOE written notification setting forth the reasons for such termination, the
effective date, and, in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated. However, if DOE determines
in the case of partial termination that the reduced or modified portion of the award will not accomplish the purposes
for which the award was made, it may terminate the award in its entirety under either paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this
section. 
(b) If costs are allowed under an award, the responsibilities of the recipient referred to in Section 600.171(a),
including those for property management as applicable, shall be considered in the termination of the award, and provision
shall be made for continuing responsibilities of the recipient after termination, as appropriate. 


 600.162 

Enforcement. 


(a) Remedies for noncompliance. If a recipient materially fails to comply with the terms and conditions of an award,
whether stated in a Federal statute, regulation, assurance, application, or notice of award, DOE may, in addition
to imposing any of the special conditions outlined in  600.114, take one or more of the following actions, as
appropriate in the circumstances. 
(1) Temporarily withhold cash payments pending correction of the deficiency by the recipient or more severe enforcement
action by DOE. 
(2) Disallow (that is, deny both use of funds and any applicable matching credit for) all or part of the cost of the activity
or action not in compliance. 
(3) Wholly or partly suspend or terminate the current award. 
(4) Withhold further awards for the project or program. 
(5) Take other remedies that may be legally available. 
(b) Hearings and appeals. In taking an enforcement action, DOE shall provide the recipient an opportunity for hearing,
appeal, or other administrative proceeding to which the recipient is entitled under any statute or regulation applicable
to the action involved. 
(c) Effects of suspension and termination. Costs of a recipient resulting from obligations incurred by the recipient
during a suspension or after termination of an award are not allowable unless the awarding agency expressly authorizes
them in the notice of suspension or termination or subsequently. Other recipient costs during suspension or after
termination which are necessary and not reasonably avoidable are allowable if paragraph (c) (1) and (2) of this section
apply. 
(1) The costs result from obligations which were properly incurred by the recipient before the effective date of suspension
or termination, are not in anticipation of it, and in the case of a termination, are noncancellable. 
(2) The costs would be allowable if the award were not suspended or expired normally at the end of the funding period
in which the termination takes effect. 
(d) Relationship to debarment and suspension. The enforcement remedies identified in this section, including suspension
and termination, do not preclude a recipient from being subject to debarment and suspension under 10 CFR part 1036.

After-the-Award Requirements 


 600.170 

Purpose. 



Sections 600.171 through 600.173 contain closeout procedures and other procedures for subsequent disallowances
and adjustments. 


 600.171 

Closeout procedures. 


(a) Recipients shall submit, within 90 calendar days after the date of completion of the award, all financial, performance,
and other reports as required by the terms and conditions of the award. DOE may approve extensions when requested by
the recipient. 
(b) Unless DOE authorizes an extension, a recipient shall liquidate all obligations incurred under the award not
later than 90 calendar days after the funding period or the date of completion as specified in the terms and conditions
of the award or in agency implementing instructions. 
(c) DOE shall make prompt payments to a recipient for allowable reimbursable costs under the award being closed out.

(d) The recipient shall promptly refund any balances of unobligated cash that DOE has advanced or paid and that is not
authorized to be retained by the recipient for use in other projects. OMB Circular A-129 governs unreturned
amounts that become delinquent debts. 
(e) When authorized by the terms and conditions of the award, DOE shall make a settlement for any upward or downward
adjustments to the Federal share of costs after closeout reports are received. 
(f) The recipient shall account for any real and personal property acquired with Federal funds or received from the
Federal Government in accordance with   600.131 through 600.137. 
(g) In the event a final audit has not been performed prior to the closeout of an award, DOE shall retain the right to recover
an appropriate amount after fully considering the recommendations on disallowed costs resulting from the final
audit. 


 600.172 

Subsequent adjustments and continuing responsibilities. 


(a) The closeout of an award does not affect any of the following. 
(1) The right of DOE to disallow costs and recover funds on the basis of a later audit or other review. 
(2) The obligation of the recipient to return any funds due as a result of later refunds, corrections, or other transactions.

(3) Audit requirements in  600.126. 
(4) Property management requirements in   600.131 through 600.137. 
(5) Records retention as required in  600.153. 
(b) After closeout of an award, a relationship created under an award may be modified or ended in whole or in part with
the consent of DOE and the recipient, provided the responsibilities of the recipient referred to in paragraph 600.173(a),
including those for property management as applicable, are considered and provisions made for continuing responsibilities
of the recipient, as appropriate. 


 600.173 

Collection of amounts due. 


(a) Any funds paid to a recipient in excess of the amount to which the recipient is finally determined to be entitled
under the terms and conditions of the award constitute a debt to the Federal Government. If not paid within a reasonable
period after the demand for payment, DOE may reduce the debt by paragraph (a) (1), (2) or (3) of this section. 
(1) Making an administrative offset against other requests for reimbursements. 
(2) Withholding advance payments otherwise due to the recipient. 
(3) Taking other action permitted by statute. 
(b) Except as otherwise provided by law, DOE shall charge interest on an overdue debt in accordance with 4 CFR Chapter
II, ``Federal Claims Collection Standards.''

Additional Provisions 



 600.180 


Purpose. 



The purpose of ``Additional Provisions'' is to provide additional rules for certain types of recipients which are
otherwise covered by 10 CFR Part 600, Subpart B when they are performing under Small Business Innovation Research
grants. 



 600.181 


Special provisions for small business innovation research grants. 



(a) 

General

. This section contains provisions applicable to the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program. This codifies
six class deviations pertaining to the SBIR program. 

(b) 

Provisions Applicable to Phase I SBIR Awards

. Phase I SBIR awards may be made on a fixed obligation basis, subject to the following requirements: 

(1) While proposed costs must be analyzed in detail to ensure consistency with applicable cost principles, incurred
costs are not subject to regulation by the standards of cost allowability; 

(2) Although detailed budgets are submitted by a recipient and reviewed by DOE for purposes of establishing the amount
to be awarded, budget categories are not stipulated in making an award; 

(3) Prior approval from the DOE for rebudgeting among categories by the recipient is not required. Prior approval
from DOE is required for situations involving sole source or single bid procurements as provided in  600.181(d)(2).
Prior approval from DOE is also required for any variation from the requirement under the SBIR program that no more
than one-third of Phase I work can be done by sub-contractors or consortium partners; 

(4) Pre-award expenditure approval is not required; 

(5) Payments are to be made in the same manner as other financial assistance (see  600.122), except that, when
determined appropriate by the cognizant program official and contracting officer, a lump sum payment may be made.
If a lump sum payment is made, the award must be conditioned to require the recipient to return to DOE amounts remaining
unexpended at the end of the project if those amounts exceed $500; 

(6) Recipients will certify in writing to the Contracting Officer at the end of the project that the activity was completed
or the level of effort was expended. Should the activity or effort not be carried out, the recipient would be expected
to make appropriate reimbursements; 

(7) Requirements for periodic reports may be established for each award so long as they are consistent with  600.151;


(8) Changes in principal investigator or project leader, scope of effort, or institution, require the prior approval
of DOE. 

(c) Provision Applicable to Phase II SBIR Awards. Phase II SBIR awards may be made for a single budget period of 24 months.


(d) Provisions Applicable to Phase I and Phase II SBIR Awards. 

(1) The prior approval of the cognizant DOE Contracting Officer is required before the final budget period of the project
period may be extended without additional funds. 

(2) A recipient or subrecipient must receive the prior written approval of the awarding party before entering into
any sole source contract or a contract where only one bid or proposal is received when the value of the contract is expected
to exceed $25,000 in the aggregate. 

(3) A fee or profit may be paid to SBIR recipients.

by Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR Part 5). Under Section 102 of the Act, each contractor shall be required
to compute the wages of every mechanic and laborer on the basis of a standard work week of 40 hours. Work in excess of the
standard work week is permissible provided that the worker is compensated at a rate of not less than 11/2 times the basic
rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours in the work week. Section 107 of the Act is applicable to construction
work and provides that no laborer or mechanic shall be required to work in surroundings or under working conditions
which are unsanitary, hazardous or dangerous. These requirements do not apply to the purchases of supplies or materials
or articles ordinarily available on the open market, or contracts for transportation or transmission of intelligence.

 Coast Guard, DOT. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Coast Guard is issuing an interim final rule (IFR) that establishes minimum standards for overfill devices and
requires the phased-in installation and use of devices on the cargo tanks of certain tank vessels that carry oil or
oil residue as primary cargo. Regulations addressing minimum standards for and concerning the use of overfill devices
are required by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90). The purpose of the interim regulations is to reduce the likelihood
of spills when oil is loaded as cargo.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:





Request for Comments



The Coast Guard encourages interested persons to participate in the rulemaking by submitting written data, views,
or arguments. Persons submitting comments should include their names and addresses, identify the rulemaking (CGD
90-071a) and the specific section of this rule to which each comment applies, and give the reason for each comment.
Please submit two copies of all comments and attachments in an unbound format, no larger than 8 by 11 inches, suitable
for copying and electronic filing. Persons wanting acknowledgment of receipt of comments should enclose a stamped,
self-addressed postcard or envelope.

The Coast Guard will consider all comments received during the comment period. It may change this rule in view of the
comments.



Drafting Information



The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Randall Crenwelge, Project Manager, and Pamela Pelcovits,
Project Counsel, OPA 90 Staff.



Regulatory History



Section 4110 of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90) (Pub. L. 101-380) adds a statutory note following 46 U.S.C.
3703 requiring, in part, the establishment of minimum standards for overfill warning devices and requirements concerning
the use of overfill devices on certain tank vessels.

To meet the statutory requirements, the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) entitled, ``Overfill
Devices,'' in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 4040; January 12, 1993). The Coast Guard received 32 letters commenting on the proposal.

In response to some comments, the Coast Guard published a notice (58 FR 54315; October 21, 1993) and held a public meeting
at U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters on November 17, 1993. Twenty-eight people attended the meeting, and a list of the
attendees and audio tapes of the meeting are available in the public docket for the rulemaking (CGD 90-071a)
at the address listed under 

ADDRESSES

. Statements made at the meeting have been treated like written comments in the preamble.



Background and Purpose



Detailed information on overfill spills and devices is found in the preamble to the NPRM.

An overfill spill occurs when too much oil is pumped or gravitated into a cargo tank during a transfer operation (e.g.,
from a facility to a tank vessel or from one tank vessel to another). Human error is the most often reported cause of this
type of spill. Many overfill spills are small; however, some reported overfill spills have involved large quantities
of oil.

Coast Guard regulations require vessel owners and operators to follow pollution prevention procedures during oil
transfer operations (33 CFR parts 155 and 156). Existing regulations do not require devices on cargo tanks to detect
and warn of impending overfills.



Discussion of Comments and Changes



Location of Regulations



One comment objected to the proposed placement of the regulations in 33 CFR subchapter O as too cumbersome and confusing
due to cross references, applicability sections, exceptions, and definitions. The comment recommended a comprehensive
reorganization of the regulations based on statutory authorities. A reorganization of 33 CFR subchapter O is outside
the scope of the rulemaking; however, the interim regulations amending 33 CFR subchapter O have been drafted to be
as clear and concise as possible.



Applicability



In the NPRM, the Coast Guard proposed requiring overfill devices on tank vessels with a cargo capacity of more than
40 cubic meters (M

3

) (approximately 250 barrels, 1 barrel = 42 U.S. gallons). One comment suggested that the threshold was inappropriate
and that additional ``small vessels'' should be excluded from the regulations. The comment stated that current oil
transfer procedure requirements found in 33 CFR parts 155 and 156 are adequate to prevent overflow spills from smaller
tank vessels because these vessels have simple oil transfer systems. The comment also stated that the cost of installing
and maintaining overfill devices would be a significant financial burden to the company submitting the comment.

The Coast Guard reviewed spill data from tank vessels for the years 1989, 1990, and 1991 and found that tank overflow
spills occurred infrequently aboard vessels with cargo carrying capacities of less than 1,000 M

3

 (approximately 6,290 barrels). Specifically, a total of 279 cargo tank overflow spills were recorded during the


3-year period. Of those overfill spills, 215 cargo tank overflow incidents occurred from tank barges. Only four of
the 215 overflows were from barges with a cargo capacity of less than 1,000 M

3

, resulting in 0.6 M

3

 (159 gallons) oil spilled. During the same period, 64 similar incidents occurred aboard tankships. Of these incidents,
only two occurred from tankships with a cargo capacity of less than 1,000 M

3

, resulting in 0.4 M

3

(106 gals) oil spilled.

In response to this comment and its review of available data, the Coast Guard has raised the applicability threshold
in  155.480(a) to a cargo capacity of 1,000 M

3

. The Coast Guard requests comments concerning this change. The data on which the Coast Guard made its decision is available
in the docket for review.

One comment specified that the phase-in requirements proposed in 33 CFR 155.480(c) did not cover Canadian tank barges
because they are not subject to the requirements of the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) and the International Load Line
Conventions. The Coast Guard did not intend for Canadian barges which operate in U.S. waters to be treated differently
from U.S. flag barges under the regulations. The Coast Guard expects that overfill devices will be installed on such
Canadian tank barges at their next scheduled drydocking or internal tank examination.

One comment recommended that tank vessels required to be equipped with double hulls within the next 5 years under the
double hull requirements of OPA 90 should be excluded from the overfill device requirements. The comment contends
that many of these vessels will be phased out of service in 5 years and that the costs of upgrading overfill devices on
these vessels would not be recovered within 5 years. The Coast Guard agrees and has added  155.480(e) to reflect
the exemption of vessels that under 46 U.S.C. 3703a(c) can not operate on the navigable waters or Exclusive Economic
Zone of the United States after the year 2000, unless equipped with a double hull.

One comment requested that the regulations not apply to open-hopper barges which are limited to carrying non-hazardous
oil-field waste material. Because such cargo operations are not covered by 33 CFR parts 155 and 156, the requirements
for overfill devices do not apply to these barges.

One comment at the public meeting requested that the regulations not apply to tank vessels which carry only asphalt.
Participants at the public meeting noted that because of the density of asphalt, vessels carrying this product are
usually not fully loaded. Also, the participants reported no overfill spills from asphalt carriers. Currently,
technology is not available to provide a cost-effective means of overfill detection for asphalt carriers. Therefore,
the Coast Guard has decided to exempt tank vessels that are dedicated to carrying asphalt as cargo from the overfill
device requirements. This change is reflected in  155.480(f). The Coast Guard requests comments concerning
the exemption of tank vessels carrying asphalt from this interim rulemaking.

One comment asked the Coast Guard to require overfill devices to be activated during all types of cargo transfers,
including internal transfers from tank to tank and cargo discharges. Although overfill incidents do occur during
internal cargo transfers and discharges, these incidents are infrequent and do not result in large spills into the
water. Tank vessel owners and operators are encouraged to use overfill devices for all transfer operations, but the
regulations continue to apply only during loading.

Two comments asked that the regulations not apply to deck tanks used to store barge generator and pump fuel, or oil slops.
The regulations only require installation of overfill devices on cargo tanks. Deck tanks used for slops and barge
generator and pump fuel are not covered by the regulations.

Seven comments stated that high viscosity oils prevent overfill devices from functioning properly. The Coast Guard
finds that heavy oils are just as likely to overflow from cargo tanks as lower viscosity oils. Vessel owners and operators
must choose overfill devices best suited for the oil they carry and, in accordance with 33 CFR 155.750(e)(2), 46 CFR
39.20-7(b)(3), and 46 CFR 39.20-9(b)(3), they must test their equipment prior to each cargo loading.
If a method of overfill detection is not technologically available for a particular type of high temperature service
oil, such as Number 6 oil, the owner or operator of a vessel, on a case by case basis, may request an alternative means
of compliance in accordance with 33 CFR 155.120(c) of this regulation. The Coast Guard requests comments concerning
the application of alternative means of compliance with the interim regulations for vessels carrying high temperature
service oils.

One State agency requested that the Coast Guard require overfill devices on vessels which carry non-petroleum oils
as cargo. A barge company submitted a comment recommending the continued exclusion of vessels carrying non-petroleum
oil cargoes. In the NPRM, the Coast Guard explained that it is interested in addressing overfill spills of MARPOL Annex
I oils because these products represent the most significant risk. They are the most frequently transported cargoes
with the greatest volume transported and spilled. Non-petroleum oils are not MARPOL Annex I oils. The Coast Guard
may extend the regulations to additional oils in the future, but for now will not impose overfill device regulations
on tank vessels which exclusively carry non-petroleum oils.
In accordance with 33 CFR 155.1015, this rule does not apply to foreign tank vessels engaged in innocent passage in
the territorial sea. These vessels do not engage in cargo loading operations in U.S. waters and, therefore, the Coast
Guard is not exercising jurisdiction over these vessels for this interim rulemaking.


Minimum Standards for Overfill Devices: Tankers


One comment from an industry association recommended that only one overfill alarm instead of two, as proposed in the
NPRM, should be required in each tank. The comment argued that the standards for vapor recovery equipment should not
be applied automatically to overfill devices because of the particular nature of vapor recovery. For vapor recovery
systems, the potential for cargo tank overpressure and rupturing of vapor recovery piping dictated a two-alarm system.
The Coast Guard agrees that one overfill alarm per cargo tank is sufficient and  155.480 has been revised to reflect
this. This change also applies to cargo tanks with closed loading systems.


Minimum Standards For Overfill Devices: Barges


Much of the discussion in the NPRM concerning standards for overfill devices dealt with barges. Twelve comments responded
to the question posed in the NPRM on whether a high level indicating device, such as a stick gauge, would be an adequate
overfill warning device on a barge. Six comments, all from the barge industry, favored the use of stick gauges.
At the public meeting, representatives from the barge industry stated that most barges currently have no overfill
devices. In most cases, the level of liquid in a barge is determined by the use of sounding tapes, ullage measuring devices,
or inspection ports. Several participants at the meeting expressed the view that adding an overfill alarm system
for each tank would be extremely expensive for barge owners and operators. Barge owners and operators currently using
stick gauges as well as the vapor recovery systems would incur significant costs if an additional alarm system were
required.

Barge industry representatives contended that the visual signal provided by high level indicating devices is, in
some ways, superior to the audible signal provided by overfill alarms, which only sound when an overfill is about to
occur. High level indicating devices, when properly installed and utilized, provide the person-in-charge (PIC)
of the loading operation with a continuous reading of how the later stages of the loading operation are progressing.
The Coast Guard will allow the owners and operators of tank barges to select one of three alternatives: (1) an overfill
alarm on each tank which includes circuitry to sufficiently identify which individual tanks overfill system is alarming,
(2) an automatic shutdown system for the entire barge and transfer facility, or (3) a high level indicating device
installed on each tank, such as a stick gauge.
Two of the comments also recommended that the Coast Guard allow portable stick gauges, which would be moved from tank
to tank, as the tanks were sequentially topped off. This recommendation assumes that tanks will always be sequentially
topped off, which may not be the case. Accordingly, the Coast Guard will require that when stick gauges are used, they
must be permanently installed on each tank.
Six comments stated that a stick gauge was inadequate to warn of an imminent spill when the PIC was off the barge or performing
other duties. These comments favored alarms and automatic shutdown systems. However, the Coast Guard finds that
audible alarms are just as ineffective as stick gauges if the PIC is not in the immediate vicinity of the transfer operation.
The Coast Guard encourages the use of systems which automatically shut down the transfer pumps before an overfill
spill occurs; however, the Coast Guard does not require these systems to be used, for several reasons. The requirement
would be cost-prohibitive for some owners and operators; it would require additional maintenance; and extra people
would be needed to perform this maintenance. Additionally, industry standards for the necessary shoreside and barge
interface would need to be developed. Developing these standards would be time-consuming.
Over the next 5 years, the Coast Guard will monitor the effectiveness of high level indicating devices. If at the end
of this period, the Coast Guard determines that the overfill spill record of tank barges equipped with these devices
is not essentially as good or better than the overfill spill record of other tank vessels covered by the regulations,
the Coast Guard may remove the provision in the regulation allowing use of high level indicating devices as substitutes
for overfill alarms.
Two comments recommended requiring only one overfill alarm on a tank instead of two as required by the NPRM, because
only one alarm is needed to alert the PIC to act to prevent an overfill. The Coast Guard has decided to allow as an option,
the use of one high level indicating alarm or one alarm with an independent visual or audible device installed on each
tank, which must function as an overfill device for each tank on a tank barge. Its purpose is to warn the PIC that immediate
action must be taken to prevent a tank overfill and oil spill during loading operations. Section 155.480 has been revised
to reflect this.

Some comments recommended technical specifications for the overfill devices. Presently, the Coast Guard does not
find a need to develop technical specifications for overfill devices. Many of the devices that meet the requirements
of the regulations are already in service as high level indicating devices aboard tank vessels. The Coast Guard finds
that cross referencing its performance criteria to those provided in the vapor control regulations is the most efficient
manner of setting these regulatory requirements. Vessel owners and operators should utilize devices which conform
to the flag state or classification society inspection criteria and are most suitable for their vessels' operating
environments.


Training


Four comments stated that trained, professional tankermen are essential on board tank barges to prevent oil spills,
and that the Coast Guard should establish requirements to improve PIC performance rather than require new equipment.
One comment stated that only qualified people who have received proper training should be allowed to use the required
overfill warning devices. The Coast Guard strongly encourages owners, operators, and tankermen's services to provide
complete and adequate training in the proper use of high level indicating devices, but the setting of training requirements
exceeds the scope of this rulemaking.
Another comment stated that tankermen on unmanned barges may not be as familiar with the barge as tankermen on manned
barges. Tankermen on a manned barge are often assigned to that barge on a long-term basis. They become intimately familiar
with their barges; whereas, tankermen on unmanned barges are temporarily assigned to a barge only for a loading or
unloading operation. Regardless of whether a barge is manned or unmanned, it is the duty of the tankerman to conduct
safe and pollution-free transfer operations.
At this time, the Coast Guard regulations in 33 CFR 156.120 do not require specific training for the PIC to perform an
oil transfer operation; however, each individual is required to meet the qualifications for a PIC found in 33 CFR 155.710,
and each vessel owner and operator must keep a list with names of each person currently designated as PIC for transfer
operations.
While the Coast Guard agrees that the competency and training of tankermen is crucial to spill prevention, it finds
that additional specific training requirements are not appropriate for this rulemaking; however, changes to these
requirements have been proposed in a separate rulemaking (54 FR 42624; October 17, 1989).

Inspection



One comment recommended that all equipment should be subject to an annual inspection. Overfill devices will be subject
to examination during the annual tank vessel examination for foreign flag vessels or the inspection for certification
and reinspections of U.S. flag vessels and Canadian tank barges. In addition, 33 CFR 156.120 requires the PIC of an
oil transfer operation to test each overfill device for proper operation prior to each transfer of cargo.



Phase-In



Two comments from tank barge operators expressed support for the timetable for phasing in the installation of each
overfill device at regularly scheduled cargo tank internal examinations.

One comment recommended a 2-year time limit for installations on barges. The Coast Guard considered accelerating
the phase-in period but decided that the costs associated with gas-freeing a vessel and taking the vessel out of service
would be prohibitive.

Another comment asked if a grace period for overfill device inspection would be granted for vessels undergoing a cargo
tank internal examination immediately after the effective date of the regulations. The effective date of the regulations
is 90 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

. The Coast Guard expects that vessel repairs or cargo tank internal examinations can be completed within 90 days.
Therefore, vessels which are being repaired or examined would not be subject to these regulations until, as in the
case of a U.S. flag vessel, the vessel's next cargo tank internal examination.



Tank Level and Pressure Monitoring Devices



One comment suggested that this rulemaking be combined with standards for equipment detecting leaks in cargo tanks
also required under section 4110 of OPA 90 (CGD 90-071). The Coast Guard disagrees. Overfill devices are used
to detect overfills while transferring, discharging, or loading cargo. They have a completely different function
when compared with tank level or pressure monitoring devices which serve to detect leaks in cargo tanks.



Maximum Cargo Level of Oil



Two vessel operators objected to limiting the amount of cargo in a cargo tank to 98.5 percent of the cargo tank volume.
The Coast Guard has not changed the requirement in the interim regulations. Both the vapor control system regulations
(46 CFR 39.30- 1(e)) and these regulations reflect the Coast Guard's position that filling a tank more than 98.5
percent poses too high of a risk that there will be a tank overflow. Therefore, the rule continues to establish a 98.5
percent level as the maximum level of fill. This rule has been revised to be consistent with the rules for vapor control
systems, to specify that a tank may not be filled higher than either 98.5 percent or the level at which the overfill alarms
are set, for those cases where shutdown must be initiated at a level below 98.5 percent to ensure that an overfill does
not occur.



Assessment



This rule is a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and has been reviewed by the
Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is significant under the ``Department of Transportation Regulatory
Policies and Procedures'' (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). Although it does not require an assessment of costs and
benefits under section 6(a)(3) of Executive Order 12866, an assessment has been prepared and is available in the docket
for inspection or copying where indicated under ``ADDRESSES.'' The Assessment is summarized as follows.

The Coast Guard assumes that tankship and tank barge owners and operators will purchase one high quality, float-type
overfill device for each cargo tank. The Coast Guard also assumes that 25 percent of all vessels covered by this rulemaking
already have some acceptable form of overfill device installed. Costs for the purchase and installation of the single
alarm system required on the remaining tankships are estimated at $3,125 per tank, or $43,750 for a tankship with 14
cargo tanks. Costs for the purchase and installation of the high level indicating system required on the remaining
tank barges are estimated at $1,650 per tank, or $13,200 for a tank barge with eight cargo tanks.

The total cost of overfill devices to the industry is calculated first by estimating cost by vessel type and use for
an average size vessel, and then by aggregating the costs for all vessels engaged in the trade. The analysis includes
self-propelled and non-self-propelled tank vessels. Total costs, including present value costs, are estimated
separately by vessel type, use, flag, and route.

Assuming a 5-year life for alarm devices and a 15-year life for high level indicating devices, the present value cost
of compliance through 2015 to tank vessel owners and operators is projected to range between $103.1 million and $113
million, distributed as follows: (1) to U.S. tank barges and tankships (commercial or privately owned), $51.8 million;
(2) to foreign flag tankships, $49.2 to $59.1 million; and (3) to U.S. Government tankships, $2.1 million. The present
value of the cost of compliance to the U.S. is $53.9 million through the scope of this analysis (2015). The regulation
will affect approximately 1,615 inland and coastal barges, 147 U.S. flag (commercial or privately owned) tankships,
375-450 foreign flag tankships, and 23 U.S. Navy and U.S. Maritime Administration (MARAD) vessels. Enforcement
costs to the Federal Government are estimated at $785,000 per year.

The analysis indicates that if the entire cost of the implementation of the regulation were passed on to consumers,
the retail price of domestically consumed petroleum products would increase approximately .019 dollars per ton
or .000007 dollars per gallon; and the retail price of U.S. petroleum products in export markets would rise by approximately
.112 dollars per ton or .0004 dollars per gallon. Export markets will be impacted more heavily because 48 million tons
of oil are exported every year versus 850 million tons of oil transported per year in domestic markets.

According to Coast Guard records, approximately 73,000 gallons of oil and petroleum products were spilled in U.S.
waters from cargo tank overflows in 1989. The Coast Guard hopes that this regulation will prevent 100 percent of these
oil spills or save approximately 73,000 gallons of oil from spilling per year. Nevertheless, it is expected that some
failures will occur. For comparison, four models are presented: one in which it is assumed high level indicating devices
are 60 percent effective and alarms are 80 percent effective (60%-80%); and one on which stick gauges are 80 percent
effective and alarms are 100 percent effective (80%-100%). Each of these models is presented in two cases, Case
I and II. Case I assumes that there are 500 applicable foreign vessels, Case II assumes 600.

The present value of the quantified direct benefits from the installation of overfill warning devices on tankships
and tank barges is 634,021 gallons of oil not spilled, assuming a 60%-80% model, calculated through 2015 and
at a 7 percent discount rate. Assuming an 80%-100% model, benefits increase to 836,489 gallons of oil not spilled.

The RA estimates four cost-benefit ratios for this rulemaking, depending on case (Case I or II) and effectiveness
(60%-80% or 80%-100%). The ratios are defined in terms of ``net present value,'' which is the ``present
value'' of costs ($117.1 to $127 million) per ``present value'' of benefits (634,021 to 836,489 gallons of oil not
spilled). The cost to benefit ratio for tankships and tank barges is between $140 and $200 per gallon of oil not spilled
for this rulemaking. In other words, the rulemaking results in a cost of $140 to $200 to prevent the spillage of 1 gallon
of oil.

One comment stated that the benefits of other rules need to be reassessed according to the benefits claimed from this
rule. In particular, the comment stated that because this rule will reduce the number of oil spills, the benefits claimed
for the rulemaking entitled, ``Discharge Removal Equipment for Vessels Carrying Oil'', (58 FR 67988), would be less.
The comment indicated that the interrelationships of the OPA 90 rulemakings should be assessed as each rule is proposed.
The Coast Guard is preparing a programmatic regulatory impact analysis (RIA) which will consider the interrelationship
of all OPA 90 rulemakings, however it is considered to be impractical to re-examine this RIA in its entirety for each
rulemaking. Where there are obvious and significant interrelationships, the Coast Guard has taken these factors
into account.



Small Entities



Based on the comments received and to lessen the burden on small entities, the Coast Guard has revised the regulations
to apply only to tank vessels with a cargo carrying capacity of more than 1,000 M

3

. This covers 21 tankships and 391 tank barges which are owned and operated by small companies. They would have been
included in the rulemaking as it was originally proposed.

In addition, the Coast Guard has permitted the alternative of high level indicating devices for tank barges. This
is a less expensive option and will be much less costly for the smaller entities contained within the tank barge industry.
Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

) that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Collection of Information



This rule contains collection-of-information requirements. The Coast Guard has submitted the requirements to
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C.
3501 

et seq.

), and OMB has approved them. The section numbers are   155.750 (Contents of transfer procedures) and
156.150 (Declaration of inspection), and the corresponding OMB approval numbers are 2115-0120 and 2115-0506.
Section 156.120 is being amended to reflect this new collection of information requirements.



Federalism



The Coast Guard has analyzed this rule under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has
determined that the rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism
Assessment. One comment requested that State and municipalities be allowed to adopt stricter requirements than
these Federal regulations. Because tank vessels move between U.S. ports in the national marketplace and between
U.S. and foreign ports in the international marketplace, standards for overfill devices should be of national scope
to avoid unreasonably burdensome variations.



Environment



The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this rule and concluded that preparation of an Environmental
Impact Statement is not necessary. An Environmental Assessment (EA) and a Finding of No Significant Impact are available
in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under 

ADDRESSES.

 The EA discusses the action, subsequent expected environmental impacts, and overall need for the action. These regulations
are not expected to result in a significant impact on the quality of the human environment because overfills tend to
result in relatively small spills. Therefore, the Coast Guard has issued a Finding of No Significant Impact which
was placed in the docket for the rulemaking.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



I. Introduction



1. By this Report and Order, the Commission takes the next step in the process of licensing the world's first commercial
low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites capable of providing both voice and data mobile satellite services (MSS) on a global
basis. The satellites are to operate in the 1610-1626.5/2483.5-2500 MHz bands that were recently allocated
both internationally and domestically to MSS.
 This new mobile satellite service_the ``MSS Above 1 GHz'' or ``Big LEO'' satellite service_has the potential to provide
not only a variety of new services to users in the United States, but to provide integrated communication services
to all parts of the world, including those that are now grossly underserved. In a 

Notice of Proposed Rulemaking

 (

Notice

), adopted in January 1994,
 the Commission proposed rules and policies to govern the service. Thirty-three parties filed comments in response
to the 

Notice

 and 18 parties filed reply comments.
 Since the pleading cycle closed, four of the applicants filed a Joint Proposal and Supplemental Comments (Joint Proposal).
 A fifth applicant sent a letter to the Chairman (FCC) on September 14, 1994 regarding the Joint Proposal.
 In this 

Report and Order,

 we adopt many of the proposals in the 

Notice,

 adopt others with modification, and defer action on several issues where a decision is premature. We also adopt many,
but not all, of the terms of the Joint Proposal. We believe our decision will promote participation by the greatest
number of applicants in an expeditious time frame.
 It will create a new industry providing enormous economic benefit to the United States, and any other country that
chooses to participate in the service.










2. All six applicants who filed applications by the cut-off date, as detailed below, will be provided with an opportunity
to file amended applications that conform with the rules adopted today. Given the importance of proceeding quickly
with licensing systems in this revolutionary service, amended applications must be filed by November 16, 1994 in
order to receive continued consideration. As is our usual practice in the satellite area, each applicant must request
construction, launch and operating authority to retain its status in this processing group. All amendments must
be accompanied by the appropriate fee for applications for launch and operating authority for LEO satellite systems,
if that fee has not yet been submitted. Applicants will be provided until January 31, 1996, at their option, in which
to make a complete financial showing.






3. As described in the Notice,

 the Big LEO service can offer an almost limitless number of services, including ubiquitous voice and date mobile services
position location services, search and rescue communications, disaster management communications, environmental
monitoring, paging services, facsimile transmission services, cargo tracking, and industrial monitoring and
control.
 Domestically, this service will help meet the demand for a seamless, nationwide and eventually global communications
system that is available to all and that can offer a wide range of voice and data telecommunication services. In addition
to enhancing the competitive market for mobile telecommunication services in areas served by terrestrial mobile
services, this new mobile satellite service will offer Americans in rural areas that are not otherwise linked to the
communications infrastructure immediate access to a feature-rich communications network. Moreover, Big LEO systems
can extend these benefits throughout the world, and can provide those countries that have not been able to develop
a nationwide communication service an ``instant'' global and national telecommunication infrastructure.
 This network can be used to provide both basic and emergency communications to their entire populations. Big LEO systems
may prove to be critical component in the development of the global information highway.






4. The Big LEO service also has the potential to stimulate significant economic growth both in the United States and
abroad. A potential multi-billion dollar industry will be created, generating opportunities for economic growth
in a variety of markets. First, the estimated costs to construct the applicants' space segments range from $97 million
to over $2 billion each. The manufacturing costs for the ground segment, which include both user units and gateway
stations, are expected to be hundreds of millions of dollars more. Thus, manufacturing these systems may lead to a
substantial investment in the United States economy and create a significant number of high paying jobs in the areas
of research and development, production, marketing and service administration. As the services become available,
additional growth opportunities will be created. One of the applicants, for example, expects that by 2001 the demand
for user transceivers will be 1.3 million in the United States and 4.7 million worldwide.
 If so, this will create a major global industry whose function will be to provide users with mobile units and services.
As demand grows and as markets develop, additional employment opportunities will be created. Customer purchases
of transceivers and user service charges will generate additional investment in the economies of the host countries.
Finally, the enhanced communications services offered by this industry will, of themselves, create a broad secondary
economic growth. Immediate access to an advanced global communications infrastructure can increase the efficiency
of existing businesses and create new ones.





5. The United States has led the world in developing and implementing satellite technology. We expect many of the economic,
cultural and other gains we have seen in the fixed-satellite industry to be reflected in the new mobile satellite industry.
The Big LEO proposal before us represent an opportunity for the United States to continue its leadership role in promoting
global development through enhanced communication infrastructures and services. We intend to license these systems
as quickly as possible so that this opportunity is not lost.

II. Background


6. As described in the 

Notice

,
 this proceeding was initiated in late 1990, when Ellipsat Corporation (Ellipsat)
 and Motorola Satellite Communications, Inc. (Motorola) filed applications to construct LEO satellite systems
in the 1610-1626.5/2483.5-2500 MHz bands and the 1610-1626.5 MHz band, respectively.
 At the time these applications were filed, there was no frequency allocation in these bands for MSS. The banks were
allocated to, among other services, the radiodetermination satellite service (RDSS), which encompasses satellite
radionavigation and radiolocation services.
 The Motorola and Ellipsat systems were intended to provide voice and data MSS in addition to RDSS. Both applicants
requested waivers of the U.S. Table of Frequency Allocations, 47 CFR  2.1, to permit non-conforming MSS operations
in the bands.









7. The Commission placed the Ellipsat and Motorola proposals on public notice and established a June 3, 1991 cut-off
date for filing applications to be considered concurrently with them.
 In response, Constellation Communications, Inc. (Constellation), Loral Cellular Systems Corp., now doing business
as Loral Qualcomm Partnership (LQP), TRW, Inc. (TRW), and AMSC Subsidiary Corporation (AMSC) filed applications.
Constellation, LQP, and TRW proposed to construct LEO satellite systems. AMSC proposed to add additional frequencies
onto its authorized geostationary satelliteorbit (GSO) system.
 The LEO applicants proposed two basic LEO system architectures. TRW, LQP, Ellipsat, and Constellation proposed
a code division multiple access (CDMA) architecture. CDMA systems can share the same frequencies when operating
under certain technical constraints.
 Motorola proposed a time division multiple access/frequency division multiple access (TDMA/FDMA) architecture.
TDMA/FDMA systems must operate on separate dedicated frequencies.
 AMSC's proposed GSO system could use either CDMA or narrowband FDMA techniques.







8. The World Administrative Radio Conference (WARC-92), allocated frequencies for MSS in February 1992.
 Specifically, the 1610-1626.5 MHz band was allocated on a co-primary basis with other radio services for MSS
Earth-to-space operations and the 2483.5-2500 MHz band was allocated on a co-primary basis for space-to-Earth
operations.
 In addition, a secondary allocation was made for MSS space-to-Earth operations in the 1613.8-1626.5 MHz segment
of the 1.6 GHz band. Shortly thereafter, the Commission proposed an identical domestic allocation and subsequently
adopted that allocation in December 1993.







9. The Commission conducted a negotiated rulemaking from January through April 1993 to assist it in developing technical
rules for the MSS Above 1 GHz service. The Negotiated Rulemaking Committee's (the Committee's) work included technical
matters relating to compatibility among the proposed MMS systems (inter-system sharing issues), compatibility
between MSS and other services in the band or in adjacent bands (inter-service sharing issues), and the operations
of MSS feeder links and intersatellite links. The Committee reached consensus on many issues, but did not reach a consensus
regarding a technical method by which all proposed systems could be accommodated within the 1610-1626.5/2483.5-2500
MHz bands.

10. In January 1994, the FCC adopted the 

Notice 

proposing, among other things, a LEO design requirement, a requirement that systems be capable of serving all areas
of the world (except for the polar regions) for at least 75% of each day, a requirement that systems be capable of serving
all areas of the United States at all times. and a requirement that applicants demonstrate sufficient current assets
or irrevocably committed financing to meet construction and launch costs for the entire system. We also proposed
a spectrum sharing plan that could accommodate up to five systems. We indicated that if mutual exclusivity could not
be resolved, we would consider awarding licenses by auction, lottery or comparative hearing.






III. Discussion



A. Licensing Procedures



1. Qualification Requirements



11. As discussed in the 

Notice, 

unless otherwise proscribed by rule, statute or treaty, the Commission has traditionally adopted qualification
requirements for each satellite service that reflect the nature of and entry opportunities for the particular service
being licensed. Where entry opportunities for a particular service are limited, our threshold qualification requirements
for that service are designed to ensure that those awarded licenses can expeditiously implement state-of-the-art
systems that further the public interest. If applicants are unable to meet the basic qualifying criteria, their applications
are dismissed without additional hearing.

a. 

Technical qualifications_

i. Orbit considerations. 12. In the 

Notice, 

we proposed to require MSS Above 1 GHz systems to operate in non-geostationary orbits.
 Because of their lower altitude orbits, LEO systems ``can shorten the transmission time between two earth stations,
serving to reduce or eliminate the time delay that may now be present in [GSO] satellite-delivered telephone service.''
 We also stated that the Communications Act specifically requires us ``to encourage the provision of new technologies
and services to the public.''
 We noted that LEO satellite systems, which cover higher latitudes than GSO satellites, and provide a variety of low
power links to and from terrestrial equipment, represent such a new technology. We also noted that the inherently
global nature of LEO systems offers a broad range of public interest benefits for the United States, including increased
possibilities of U.S. leadership in developing and implementing satellite technology, and enhanced U.S. global
competitiveness in telecommunication. We suggested that the unique features of LEO systems would foster social
and economic benefits throughout the world.







13. We requested comment on the potential for MSS Above 1 GHz systems to generate social, economic, and technical benefits,
both domestically and globally, and the extent to which these benefits are realizable with LEO and GSO satellites.
We also asked applicants to specify the extent to which their proposed systems will foster these goals and the manner
in which their services are planned to be offered. Prospective customers were asked to specify their anticipated
use or uses of MSS Above 1 GHz systems, including a discussion of whether equivalent services can be provided by LEO
and GSO facilities and whether, and the extent to which, alternative terrestrial services are available.

14. AirTouch Communications (AirTouch), Constellation, Ellipsat, LQP, Motorola, Novacom Inc. (Novacom), and
TRW support our proposal to require MSS Above 1 GHz systems to operate in LEO orbits. The range of technical benefits
to the United States and world communities by LEO systems includes virtually instantaneous voice transmissions,
broader geographic coverage, use of low power handheld transceivers and small antennas. AMSC, Comsat, Mobile Communications
(Comsat), Mobile Datacom Corporation (Mobile Datacom), and Newcomb Communications, Inc. (Newcomb) do not support
our proposal. They argue that there will be no significant qualitative or quantitative difference in the time delay
experienced by users of GSO and non-GSO systems and that GSO systems are capable of providing services to most of the
Earth. They further argue that LEO technology is subject to shadowing outages,
 is more complex, and is unproven.





15. We adopt our proposed LEO design requirement. First, AMSC has not convinced us that our assumption regarding the
time delay in high altitude GSO systems was in error. While system processing times associated with non-GSO satellite
handoffs may be marginally longer than the 18 milliseconds noted by LQP, AMSC has not shown that a GSO system's typical
voice transmission delay of some 250 milliseconds, or even longer for multiple hops, is not noticeable to users.

16. Further, LEO systems are significantly superior in their coverage capabilities. While GSO systems can provide
coverage to most of the world, this coverage is limited in areas of high latitude, including parts of Alaska. AMSC concedes
that GSO systems can provide only ``near'' total coverage of the Earth. Although GSO systems are capable of providing
acceptable services across most of the Earth's surface, LEOs are capable of providing truly global coverage. LEO
technology, for example, may enable residents of remote parts of Alaska to have individual telephone access for the
first time. There is nothing in the record to suggest that provision of such broad geographical service reduces the
capacity of LEO systems to serve more concentrated areas, as AMSC suggests. The public interest would be best served
by the technology that offers the broadest potential coverage.

17. The use of handheld transceivers also is facilitated by LEO systems. LEO satellites' lower power levels alleviate
the need for large antennas aboard the spacecraft and reduce transceiver weight and volume, enhancing their portability.
By contrast, AMSC suggests that handheld transceivers are not contemplated by GSO systems.
 Its immediate plans do not include handheld capability, though its second generation system is expected to support
them.
 As we embark on the promise of new mobile technologies, we find it in the public interest to permit the timely deployment
of personal communications services that include the broad use of handheld transceivers.






18. One risk cited by AMSC is the increased possibility that the satellites in the LEO constellation will collide with
other objects in space. We do not view this as stifling LEO technology. Both the likelihood of collisions and future
mitigation methods are being discussed in domestic and international fora. However, the record in this proceeding
does not support a finding that space collisions will become a significant problem for LEO systems. We also acknowledge
that the reception shadowing associated with LEO satellite movement relative to the Earth's surface (which AMSC
suggests would adversely affect signal quality during voice communications) may add to the operational challenges
confronting LEO MSS technology. There is no showing, however, that shadowing is more of a problem with LEO technology
than it is with GSO technology.

19. Advocates of both GSO and LEO systems argue that their technology will offer economic and social benefits, domestically
and globally. The essential advantage of GSO systems is their proven capability to provide telecommunication services.
Intelsat and Inmarsat are but two examples. These successes, however, are not sufficient to preclude embracing a
new and potentially more efficient technology, notwithstanding its substantial risks and costs. On the contrary,
the Commission has a mandate to encourage new technologies and services.
 While both LEO and GSO systems portend substantial opportunities for employment growth and export of U.S. technologies
worldwide, LEO systems have greater potential to serve more uniformly the United States and international locations
with smaller, more ubiquitous and lower power equipment. This leads us to conclude that the primary use of the subject
spectrum should be by LEO systems. We therefore adopt Section 25.143(b)(2)(i) as proposed in the Notice.





20. Most commenters agree that it would be difficult for GSO and LEO systems to operate MSS services together in this
band. Indeed, this was a significant factor in our decision to propose limiting the 1610-1626.5/2483.5-2500
MHz band to LEO systems Notwithstanding our decision to adopt a LEO design requirement, we would consider authorizing
a GSO system in these bands upon a showing that its operations would not cause interference to or affect LEO operations.
Similarly, the provision of radiodetermination satellite services (RDSS) by either LEO or GSO systems would be permissible
if fully compatible with licensed LEO MSS systems.






ii. Global vs. regional coverage. 21 In our 

Notice,

 we discussed the geographic coverage we would require these satellite systems to provide. In view of our interest
in furthering the creation of the global information infrastructure, we proposed to require each MSS Above 1 GHz applicant
to demonstrate that its proposed system is capable of providing mobile satellite service to all areas of the world,
with the exception of the polar regions, for at least 75% of every 24 hour period. Specifically, we proposed that Big
LEO satellite systems be designed so that at least one satellite would be visible above the horizon at an elevation
angle of at least 5
  for at least 18 hours each day at latitudes less than 80
 .






22. The commenters generally support this requirement. They disagree, however, on the extent to which systems must
offer service in or near the polar regions. The majority, including the system applicants, agree that there is little
need for a requirement to serve unpopulated areas. They argue that the additional costs associated with such service
would not be justified. For example, TRW suggests that service up to 80
  northern and southern latitudes may not be necessary, because there are no populated areas that far north or
south and the economic costs of requiring such service are high. Ellipsat favors requirements of 55
  Southern Latitude and 75
  degrees Northern Latitude, to cover all but the most remote population centers. The parties to the Joint Proposal
modify their previous positions by suggesting a coverage requirement of up to 70
  North Latitude and 55
  South Latitude.

23. As noted, LEO systems are capable of providing service to all points on Earth. We recognize, however, the need to
balance system cost against geographical service area. We agree with the commenters that it is sufficient, given
projected need and alternative service options, to require service only to populated areas. We therefore require
that Big LEO systems be capable of serving locations as far north as 70
  latitude and as far south as 55
  latitude. This will allow coverage to populated areas that cannot be reached by GSO systems. While ships and
airplanes may traverse the polar regions beyond these latitudes, they are not necessarily deprived of service because
the LEO satellites may, in fact, be visible.

iii. Continuous coverage of the fifty states. 24. We indicated in the 

Notice

 that the public interest would be served if LEO systems provided efficient and ubiquitous voice service to users throughout
the United States. We therefore proposed to require each LEO system to have at least one satellite at an elevation angle
of at least 5
  at any given time in all areas of the United States.

25. Several commenters note that we proposed to require global ``mobile satellite services'' in proposed Section
25.143(b)(2)(ii) and domestic ``voice'' service in proposed Section 25.143(b)(2)(iii). Our expectation is that
LEO system operators will have market incentives to offer more than merely voice services, but for purposes of consistency
we will revise proposed Section 25.143(b)(2)(iii) to read ``mobile satellite services.'' Further, in the Joint
Proposal, the parties agree that Big LEO systems should be capable of covering all fifty states, Puerto Rico and the
U.S. Virgin Islands. We will amend Section 25.143(b)(2)(iii) to reflect this coverage. 



b. Financial qualifications. 

26. In light of the enormous costs involved in constructing and launching a satellite system, we have always considered
financial ability a significant factor in determining whether an applicant is qualified to hold a license. Historically,
the Commission has fashioned financial requirements for satellite services on the basis of entry opportunities
in the particular service being licensed. This stems from our repeated experience that licensees without sufficient
available resources spend a significant amount of time attempting to raise the necessary financing and that those
attempts often end unsuccessfully.
 Consequently, where a grant to an under-financed applicant may preclude a fully capitalized applicant from implementing
its plans, and service to the public may be consequently delayed, we have required a stringent financial showing to
ensure that the public interest would be served.
 We have required a less stringent financial showing where grant to an under-financed applicant will not prevent another
from going forward. For example, we required only a detailed business plan in the radiodetermination satellite service,
where all applicants could be accommodated and future entry was possible.
 In contrast, we required evidence of full, irrevocable financing in the domestic-fixed satellite service, where
applications to implement space stations regularly exceed the number of available orbital locations for those satellites.

27. The Negotiated Rulemaking Committee could not agree to a method by which all six proposed systems could be licensed.
Further, the sharing plan we proposed in the 

Notice, 

and which we adopt today,
 does not accommodate all pending applicants and leaves little or no spectrum available for expansion of existing
systems or the development of future MSS systems within the United States. Consequently, consistent with our past
practice, we seek to ensure that those applicants awarded Big LEO licenses have the financial ability to proceed.




28. The domestic fixed-satellite standard was developed to serve the public interest by deterring warehousing and
inefficient use of valuable orbit spectrum resources. Given the same public interest concerns here, we proposed
in the Notice 

a financial standard for the Big LEO service identical to the one used in the domestic fixed-satellite service, noting
that a lesser standard could allow permittees to tie up scarce spectrum resources while preventing other qualified
entities from providing service to the public.
 Thus, we proposed to require Big LEO applicants to provide evidence of current assets, operating revenues, or irrevocably
committed debt or equity financing sufficient to meet the estimated costs of constructing and launching all planned
satellites, and operating the system for the first year.






29. The four parties to the Joint Proposal suggest using a less stringent financial standard that requires an applicant
to show ``financial preparedness, including reliance on projected revenues and future public offerings'' in order
to be granted a construction permit. Within one year from the date of the grant of a license, each permittee would be
required to demonstrate that it meets the domestic fixed-satellite service financial standard with respect to 25%
of the total constellation construction and launch costs. LQP, in contrast, argues that this proposed relaxation
of financial standards must be balanced against the concern that only viable applicants be licensed.





30. We conclude that although more relaxed approaches may be used for some satellite services, a strict financial
requirement is warranted for the Big LEO service. The proposed Big LEO systems will cost between $97 million and $2
billion to implement. These are, by far, the most expensive satellite systems to date. As we indicated in the 

Notice, 

our experience with the satellite industry has proven that arranging financing for any space station system, even
one significantly less costly than a Big LEO system, is extremely difficult, even after a construction permit has
been granted.
 Consequently, adopting a lesser financial standard than the domestic fixed-satellite standard, such as the one
suggested in the Joint Proposal, could tie up spectrum for years, with contrary to the public interest. While system
implementation milestone requirements
 will provide a mechanism by which to revoke the licenses of those entities that are not capable of going forward, this
process takes considerable time and can delay qualified entities from implementing systems and providing service
to the public.
 Because all pending Big LEO applicants cannot be accommodated and because there appears to be no room for future entry,
granting an under-financed space station applicant a license may preclude an applicant that possesses the necessary
financial resources from implementing its plans, and consequently service to the public may be delayed. Accordingly,
we conclude that a financial demonstration identical to the one used in the domestic fixed-satellite service, as
proposed in the 

Notice, 

should be adopted for the Big LEO service.






31. Applicants relying on internal financing need not set aside specific funds for their systems. Rather, as in the
domestic fixed-satellite service, we require only a demonstration of current assets or operating income sufficient
to cover system costs. The availability of internal funds sufficient to cover a system's costs provides adequate
assurance at the time the Commission acts on the application that the system can be built and launched. Current assets_which
includes cash, inventory, and accounts receivable_provide a general measure of a company's ability to finance the
project itself or to raise funds from lenders and equity investors on the basis of its on-going operations. Highly
capitalized companies possess more collateral and, thus, are in a better position to borrow money than thinly capitalized
companies.
32. Further, ``irrevocably'' committed external financing is financing that has been approved and does not rest
on contingencies which require action by either party to the loan or equity investment. In other words, the instrument
of financing must demonstrate that the lender has already determined that the applicant is creditworthy and, absent
a material change in circumstances, is prepared to make the loan immediately upon grant of a Commission authorization.
 This is not to preclude applicants from relying on operating revenues from the initial operations of their systems
to finance the remainder of their systems. Nevertheless, to ensure that the system is completed in a timely manner
if revenues are not available as soon as anticipated, we require a commitment that a lender is prepared to finance the
entire cost of the system. 




33. Some of the applicants argued in their comments
 that a more relaxed standard is supported by our use of a less stringent financial requirement in the radiodetermination
satellite service (RDSS) and the non-voice, non-geostationary (NVNG) service. These parties argue that the unproven
nature of the RDSS and NVNG services led to the adoption of a financial standard that permitted applicants to finance
the systems as they are built and deployed, and that similar considerations apply in the Big LEO service. Our primary
reason for the ``relaxed'' standard in the RDSS and NVNG services, however, was that all pending applicants could
be accommodated and future entry was possible.
 Consequently, a grant to an under-financed applicant would not preclude another qualified entity from going forward.
The financial qualification standard adopted for RDSS and NVNG services is therefore inappropriate for Big LEOs.

<TEXT>
 

34. Some of the applicants also argue that we should require only a demonstration of partial financing. They contend
that applicants that have the financing to meet construction and launch costs for the number of satellites needed
to provide limited domestic and global service will be able to finance the remainder of their systems with the operating
income from these services. Such a position, however, would not promote the global availability of this service.
A system that relies too heavily on operating income from its first satellites for its completion could easily become
stalled before it is able to provide domestic or global service that meets our service requirements.
 Any applicant that cannot demonstrate the capability to launch more than a limited number of satellites should not
be considered for licensing at the expense of potential entrants that could provide global service and continuous
domestic service.





35. Ellipsat comments that we should require applicants relying on internal funds to demonstrate a management ``commitment''
to expend those funds for the Big LEO project. Ellipsat argues that this requirement would put companies with greater
capital assets on an even footing with smaller applicants who must rely on ``irrevocable'' outside loan commitments
to establish their financial qualifications. As we stated in adopting the domestic-fixed satellite standard, we
will not require management to set aside specific funds for the system. We will, however, require applicants relying
on internal assets to provide a balance sheet demonstrating current assets or operating income sufficient to meet
the space segment costs together with evidence of a management commitment to the project. This does not require an
unalterable commitment that the funds will be expended regardless of market conditions. Rather, consistent with
our approach to credit arrangements provided by outside sources, management of the corporation providing the funding
must commit that absent a material change in circumstances, it is prepared to expend the necessary funds.
 Those applicants relying on financing from parent corporations must make the same showing with respect to the parent
corporation's commitment.





36. AMSC urges that, given the short life of LEO satellites, we should require the applicants to demonstrate the financial
capability to build an entire constellation and a fleet of replacement satellites. Although some of the proposed
systems use satellites with a short life, a requirement to demonstrate full funding for these before the first generation
is built would be exceptionally onerous and unnecessary. We are confident that after constructing and operating
a full fleet of satellites, a licensee would have ample incentive and resources to implement replacement satellites,
unless there is insufficient demand. In that case, however, the public would not be harmed by discontinuation of the
licensee's service.

37. We recognize that applicants may be able to provide the service requirements adopted today with fewer satellites
than proposed in the pending applications. In such a case, an applicant has the option of course, to modify its pending
application to specify only those satellites necessary to meet our minimum requirements, and its financial and technical
showing would need to cover only such a constellation. It could then apply to expand its constellation as originally
envisioned, as it attains the financial capability to do so.

38. Consequently, to meet the public interest objective of ensuring prompt initiation of this new satellite service,
we adopt our proposed rule that requires each Big Leo applicant to demonstrate the ability to build and launch all satellites
for which it has applied, which includes those satellites necessary to fulfill our service requirements, and to operate
its system for one year after launch of the first satellite in its constellation. In doing so, however, we shall modify
our eligibility requirements somewhat in an effort to achieve greater participation by the applicants in this processing
group.

39. First, consistent with our paramount objective of securing early implementation of these satellite services,
we shall adopt a rule, consistent with our proposal in the Notice, that will enable applicants who can now demonstrate
their financial qualifications to receive priority in obtaining license grants. Thus, any applicant who can submit
a complete, amended application on or before November 16, 1994, and demonstrates financial capability under the
standards set forth in the rule adopted in this proceeding, will be processed immediately. Assuming sufficient spectrum
is available to award licenses to all such financially and otherwise qualified applicants, we will grant licenses
to these applicants. Given the national and other public interest benefits of ensuring the United States' global
leadership in providing these important new satellite services, we also plan to process these applications on an
expedited basis, with action anticipated by January 31, 1995. Making these grants promptly will enable such fully
qualified applicants to begin immediately the time-consuming process of satellite construction, thereby significantly
assisting in United States' efforts to complete the international coordination process and achieving our statutory
and public interest objective of bringing new and innovative services to the public at the earliest possible time.

40. We also wish, however, to accord some processing priority to other applicants in this group who may need more time
to establish their financial qualifications, and who have all devoted significant time, effort and resources towards
establishing the Big LEO service both domestically, in the Negotiated Rulemaking, and internationally. For example,
until feeder link frequencies can be assigned to a particular system, which will not likely occur until after the next
World Radio Conference to be held in November 1995 (WRC-95), it may be difficult for some of these applicants
to finalize financial arrangements for their systems. Consequently, in an effort to afford an additional opportunity
for entry by such applicants, we will allow applicants who cannot meet our financial qualifications requirement
at this time an additional period of time to establish their qualifications. Specifically, we will require these
applicants to file amended applications by November 16, 1994 to ensure their continued consideration, but we will
allow them until January 31, 1996_two months after the completion of WRC-95_to demonstrate compliance with
the financial standard adopted today.

41. Under our two-tiered eligibility rule, applicants who make a decision to defer their financial showing until
January, 1996, will not jeopardize their status in the current processing group. Specifically, new applications
for Big LEO systems will not be considered until after action on the six pending applications is completed. Nevertheless,
such applicants will not be accorded the same processing priority as those applicants who are willing and able to demonstrate
their financial qualifications far sooner, by November 16, 1994, and whose expeditious grants will better enable
us to achieve early and successful international coordination and implementation of this service. Because the spectrum
sharing plan we adopt today accommodates up to five systems,
 we also recognize that applicants choosing not to make a financial showing until January 1996, may find their applications
are mutually exclusive situations. Nevertheless, we believe a very significant likelihood exists that our financial
eligibility rule will result in more of these applicants obtaining grants and that, in the intervening time frame
until January 1996, events may occur that avoid mutual exclusivity altogether.





42. If it turns out that all six applicants are able to establish their financial qualifications by the November 16,
1994 deadline for amended applications, or alternatively, that all six applicants defer their financial showings
until January 1996 and all are then deemed financially qualified, we will implement the auction procedure described
below, paras. 88-97, to award licenses. If, however, some grants have been made prior to January 1996, and a mutually
exclusive situation arises then, the auction procedure outlined below cannot be used. However, given the uncertainty
that such a situation will ever arise, we will not at this time decide how to process any such remaining mutually exclusive
applications. Presumably, however, such grants would be awarded through an auction mechanism that is appropriate
in the circumstances. We have decided, however, to defer any final decision on that issue at this time.

a. Background. 

43. As we discussed in the 

Notice,

 the six applicants proposed two system designs (LEO and GSO) and two system architectures (CDMA and TDMA/FDMA). A
CDMA architecture would permit multiple systems to share the same frequencies. A TDMA/FDMA architecture would operate
bi-directionally in a portion of the 1.6 GHz band only and would require each system to operate on discrete frequency
band segments. The Committee's work plan called for the Committee to develop rules that would maximize multiple entry
and avoid or resolve mutual exclusivity among the six applications. The applicants, however, could not develop a
set of technical parameters and sharing criteria that could accommodate all proposed systems. In the 

Notice

, we proposed a sharing plan that could accommodate up to four CDMA systems and one TDMA/FDMA system.
 The plan was based, in part, upon partial settlement proposals filed by two groups of LEO applicants after the Negotiated
Rulemaking was concluded.
 The plan proposed to assign licensees implementing CDMA systems in the United States to 11.35 MHz of shared bandwidth
at 1610-1621.35 MHz. It proposed to assign a TDMA/FDMA system operating in the United States to 5.15 MHz of dedicated
bandwidth at 1621.35-1626.5 MHz. If only one CDMA system is implemented, the plan proposed to adjust the domestic
assignment for that system to 8.25 MHz at 1610-1618.25 MHz, leaving the freed 3.15 MHz of spectrum available
for possible reassignment to the TDMA/FDMA licensee or for new entry. We also tentatively concluded that CDMA systems
would be provided with equal amounts of downlink and uplink spectrum, unless CDMA system proponents could demonstrate
an unequal assignment was warranted.





b. 

The basic plan

. 44. All five applicants proposing LEO systems agree that our plan provides a basis for accommodating five LEO systems.
None takes issue with the framework of the plan: up to four CDMA systems can share 11.35 MHz of bandwidth in the 1.6 GHz
band and that one TDMA/FDMA system can operate over 5.15 MHz of dedicated bandwidth. Constellation, for example,
states that 11.35 MHz can ``support competitive CDMA systems operating in a sharing environment.''
 Motorola supports awarding a single TDMA/FDMA license in 5.15 MHz of bandwidth.
 LQP, TRW, and Ellipsat all agree that both LEO transmission techniques can be accommodated, with CDMA systems operating
on shared spectrum. Indeed, the four proponents of the Joint Proposal, supported by LQP, explicitly agree to an 11.35
MHz/5.15 MHz spectrum split.





45. Despite its general agreement that its system could be accommodated in 11.35 MHz of shared spectrum, Constellation
contends in its comments that all five LEO applicants should be given equal options to use the spectrum. Specifically,
it argues that adoption of rules requiring four LEO applicants share spectrum, while allowing the remaining applicant
to have exclusive use of its own band segment or assigning prime spectrum to one applicant and impaired spectrum to
another, would violate the doctrine enunciated in 

Ashbacker Radio Corp. v. FCC

, 326 U.S. 327 (1945) (

Ashbacker

). We do not agree that a rule requiring sharing by applicants proposing CDMA systems, and that permits other applicants
to have exclusive spectrum, implicates 

Ashbacker

. Such a rule is merely a reasonable exercise of our rulemaking authority, based upon the technical characteristics
of the systems involved. We also note that the CDMA applicants agreed to a band sharing plan. Indeed, Constellation
agrees that its system can be accommodated in a shared band. Consequently, we adopt the plan's basic framework.





46. Despite their general support for the plan, all LEO applicants request some modifications or clarifications.
The requests center around three issues: (1) what portion of the 2.4 GHz MSS downlink band will be available to the CDMA
licensees; (2) whether MSS operations in the lower 6 MHz of the 1.6 MHz band will be impaired by GLONASS, the Russian
Global Navigation Satellite System, and radioastronomy serviced (RAS) operations in that band; and (3) whether
the 11.35 MHz CDMA assignment will be automatically reduced to 8.25 MHz should only one CDMA system become operational.
We discuss these in turn.

c. 

Downlink assignment. 

47. In the 

Notice

, we assumed that CDMA systems assigned to share the 1.6 GHz uplink spectrum would require a corresponding amount of
2.4 GHz downlink spectrum. We requested comment on this assumption. All CDMA operators strongly disagree, arguing
in their comments and in the Joint Proposal that CDMA applicants should be allowed to share the entire 16.5 MHz of 2.4
GHz downlink spectrum allocated to MSS. They argue that the systems must operate over the entire bandwidth to achieve
maximum capacity at minimum cost. According to the CDMA proponents, if the number of satellites transmitting in any
segment of the 2.4 GHz band is minimized, the satellites' cost can be substantially reduced. They also argue that the
2.4 GHz band is already constrained by international and domestic power flux density (pfd) limits and other existing
services, which limits the number of users that can be served, and that any limitations on bandwidth will further affect
system capacity.

48. We are convinced that the entire 16.5 MHz of spectrum allocated domestically and internationally at 2483.5-2500
MHz should be assigned to Big LEO system downlinks in the United States. There is no compelling reason to restrict use
of this band. Indeed, assignment of the entire band should provide operators with sufficient flexibility to coordinate
their operations with other Big LEO systems in the band and to accommodate other users in the band or in adjacent bands
with little or no corresponding loss of capacity. Consequently, we will provide CDMA operators with access to the
entire allocated 2.4 GHz band. Moreover, only satellite systems using CDMA will be permitted in this band.

d. 

Interim plan.

 49. As we discussed in the 

Notice

, interference problems between MSS and certain proposed applications on GLONASS, the Russian Global Navigation
Satellite System, will not permit co-frequency co-system coverage in the United States and internationally in the
1610-1616 MHz band. Specifically, if GLONASS is used in conjunction with the U.S. Global Positioning System
(GPS) to provide aircraft precision approach and terminal communications, as contemplated by the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA), MSS would not be able to operate in the shared band because of the potential for MSS mobile terminal
interference into GLONASS mobile receivers.
 We indicated in the 

Notice

 that we had initiated inter-agency and international negotiations regarding the use of GLONASS and were encouraged
that even if GLONASS were ultimately used to provide services incompatible with MSS, the GLONASS final frequency
plan would be changed to bands below 1606 MHz only, making the 1610-1616 MHz band available for MSS operations.
 We recognized, however, that a GLONASS transition to bands below 1606 MHz may not be completed when the first MSS satellites
are launched in the late 1990's. In that case, we stated we would need to develop a transitional plan for MSS migration
into the vacated 1610-1616 MHz band ``with MSS licensees operating on less than the full amount of their assigned
spectrum during the initial phases of their operation.''
 







50. The applicants agree in their Joint Proposal that if GLONASS is not moved in a timely manner, the Big LEO licensees
should share the burden of any spectrum loss. They argue, however, that we need not develop a transitional plan now,
but, rather, that we should allow the parties to negotiate and reach such an agreement in the event GLONASS compromises
MSS operations. Both Motorola and LQP argue in their comments that an interim plan would impede MSS by suggesting to
GLONASS equipment manufacturers and other countries that they need not plan for the change in GLONASS frequencies
and may lead to the view that revision of the GLONASS frequency plan is optional. 

51. Our ongoing discussions with other agencies and with the Russian Federation continue to clarify the GLONASS issue.
While we are confident that GLONASS will be moved to bands below 1606 MHz, we do not know when a full transition will occur.
At our most recent bilateral discussions, the Russian Federation suggested that a GLONASS migration may not begin
until 1998 and may not be completed until 2005.
 We do not know whether GLONASS operations, before a migration to the final frequency configuration, will affect MSS
CDMA systems operating in the lower frequency portion of the 1.6 GHz band, domestically or internationally. This
depends upon two related factors: (1) the extent to which domestic and international civil aeronautical agencies
and organizations (such as ICAO) use GLONASS to provide approach and terminal communications that are incompatible
with MSS operations and (2) the extent to which out-of-band emission limitations may be needed for MSS transmissions.
 Nevertheless, a portion of the 1.6 GHz MSS frequency band may not be available for first-generation domestic MSS operations.
At this time, the most likely worst-case scenario is that the 1610-1612 MHz band segment assigned to CDMA systems
in our sharing plan may not be available for initial operations in the United States.
 This is based on the launch and operation schedules outlined in the various applications.







52. We agree with the applicants that the burden of the potential 2 MHz shortfall should be shared among all 1.6/2.4
GHz MSS licensees. We believe, however, that a transitional plan is warranted. Such a plan will allow system launch
to begin without potential delay and without the uncertainty associated with allowing the licensees to attempt to
devise an interim plan on an 

ad hoc

 basis, as the Joint Proposal suggests.
 In adopting an interim plan, we emphasize that we remain optimistic that the plan will not need to be implemented. Indeed,
as provided in the Joint Proposal, all Big LEO operators will be authorized to construct systems capable of operating
across the entire band allocated for that system architecture, that is, 1610-1626.5 MHz for CDMA systems and
1616-1626.5 MHz for bi-directional FDMA/TDMA systems. Further, even if the transitional plan is implemented,
MSS operators will be permitted to expand into the unused 1.6 GHz MSS frequencies immediately after the GLONASS migration
is completed. We believe that any necessary transition among LEO licensees can be completed within six months of that
date.

53. Our interim plan is based upon the most recent system designs presented to us in the context of the Negotiated Rulemaking.
Four of the CDMA applicants propose to build systems using narrowband 1.25 MHz transmission channels while one_TRW_proposes
wider 5 MHz channels. If the entire 11.35 MHz assignment designated for CDMA systems were available, the narrowband
licensees would be able to operate over 9 transmission channels, while the wider band operator would be able to operate
over two. If MSS cannot be provided in the 1610-1612 MHz portion of the CDMA band segment because of GLONASS considerations,
two narrowband channels would be lost and one wideband channel would be lost. Allowing CDMA licensees to shift frequencies
by 1.25 MHz into the designated TDMA/FDMA band at 1621.35-1626.5 MHz would provide both narrowband and wideband CDMA
licensees with access to one additional channel. Consequently, until the entire 1610-1626.5 MHz band is available
for MSS operations, we will provide CDMA operators with the option of operating in the 1621.35-1622.60 MHz band
segment. In their way, all Big LEO operators will bear some of the necessary operating constraints_the narrow band
CDMA operators by the net loss of one channel, the wideband CDMA operators by the loss of one channel or by the need to
retune the center frequencies on both of its channels once GLONASS is fully moved,
 and the FDMA/TDMA licensee by the loss of operating bandwidth. Nevertheless, we are optimistic that these measures
will not be necessary or, if they are, that the effect on the MSS industry will not be significant given their short term
nature and the anticipated incremental implementation of Big LEO service. 





e. 

Conditions to the plan_

i. Reduction in spectrum for single CDMA system: 54. Another issue raised by the LEO applicants is our proposed modification
to the plan in the event only one CDMA licensee goes forward.
 In this unlikely scenario, we proposed to reduce the bandwidth assigned to that system automatically from 11.35 MHz
to 8.25 MHz. We stated that an 8.25 MHz assignment, or one-half of the available 1.6 GHz MSS allocation, should be sufficient
to support a viable system. We noted that the remaining 3.1 MHz of spectrum would be made available to an operational
FDMA/TDMA system upon a showing of need or, if this demonstration could not be made, to a new entrant. The four parties
to the Joint Proposal suggest that if one CDMA and one FDMA/TDMA system become operational, the 3.1 MHz of spectrum
should be available to both of these licensees upon a showing of need and should not be made available to new entrants.
In their comments, the CDMA operators argued that an automatic spectrum reduction for a CDMA system with no possibility
of adjustment would penalize a CDMA licensee for the failure of another operator to launch a system, that it does not
consider the efficiency of the system or whether the CDMA system is sharing spectrum with a foreign system, that it
does not give CDMA operators a corresponding opportunity to gain access to bands above 1621.35 MHz upon failure or
inefficient spectrum use by the FDMA/TDMA licensee, and that it will seriously impair CDMA operations. They further
argued that even if GLONASS is moved, the lower frequency portion of the band is subject to more interservice sharing
constraints because of protected radio astronomy operations. 




55. The CDMA proponents correctly state that uncertainties are present in the lower portion of the band that are not
present in the upper portion. As noted, GLONASS is now operating in 1610-1616 MHz band and we do not know exactly
when it will be moved or the limitations its operations will impose on MSS operations. Further, the radioastronomy
service (RAS) operates on a co-primary basis in the 1610.6-1613.8 MHz band. The agreement reached by the Negotiated
Rulemaking Committee regarding sharing between RAS and MSS imposes restrictions on MSS operations provides certain
operating constraints on MSS mobile earth terminals in geographic areas near RAS sites.
 If RAS sharing proves burdensome or if GLONASS is not fully moved in a timely fashion, an assignment of 8.25 MHz for each
of the two LEO system architectures may not prove equivalent. Further, we do not know if, and the extent to which, foreign
systems will impact U.S. systems' operations across the entire band. Consequently, we will defer any decision with
respect to the 3.1 MHz between 1618.25 and 1621.35 MHz until, and if, either of those contingencies arises. At that
time, we will have a clearer notion of the extent of any inter-service sharing constraints in the lower portion of the
1.6 GHz band. We will not, however, limit our consideration for assignment of this band to the two licensed systems,
as the parties to the Joint Proposal urge. We do not think it is advisable at this time to preclude new entrants from access
to this band. Rather, we will make the decision with respect to the 3.1 MHz, if necessary, in the context of a rulemaking,
based upon the circumstances that have developed at that time. 





ii. Other potential scenarios. 56. Although not specifically address in the 

Notice, 

the four parties to the Joint Proposal have developed a plan in the event that only one system retains a construction
permit. In this scenario, the Joint Proposal would provide that that system, whether TDMA/FDMA or CDMA, would be given
access to the entire 16.5 MHz of bandwidth. 
57. We need not decide now on a course of action to be taken in the event that only one Big LEO system is implemented, whether
it is a CDMA or TDMA/FDMA system. If and when that occurs, we will weigh a variety of factors in a rulemaking, including
our preference for multiple entry, constraints on the assigned spectrum due to international coordination agreements,
system efficiency, and system loading, when considering a spectrum adjustment for that system.

f. 

System amendments. 

58. Several of the commenters question whether applicants will be permitted to change their system designs when amendments
are filed. TRW, for example, asks us to clarify that a change in transmission techniques from CDMA to TDMA/FDMA following
adoption of service rules will not constitute a major amendment under Commission rules. This concern apparently
stems from Section 25.116(c) of our rules, which provides, in general, that any pending application is to be considered
a newly filed application if it is amended by a major amendment after a ``cut-off'' date. The rule contains several
exceptions, including instances where the amendment resolves frequency conflicts with other pending applications,
but does not create new or increased frequency conflicts.






59. We have repeatedly emphasized that MSS Above 1 GHz applicants who filed by the cut-off date will be afforded an opportunity
to amend their applications, if necessary, to bring them into conformance with any requirements and policies that
are adopted for satellite systems in these bands.
 Thus, a change from a GSO system configuration to a LEO system configuration to meet our satellite system design requirement
or a change in coverage patterns to conform with our satellite visibility requirements would be permitted without
affecting a particular application's status in this processing group. However, a change that is not necessary to
bring the application into conformance with our rules and which would increase frequency conflicts, such as a change
from a CDMA to a TDMA/FDMA architecture, would render the application a newly filed application to be considered in
a future processing group.
 We recognize that if all six of the pending applicants are found qualified under our Big LEO rules, our five-system
sharing plan will not be able to accommodate all of them. We discuss in a succeeding section of this 

Report and Order 

the procedures that will apply to applicants in these circumstances and that we will follow to decide among the mutually
exclusive applications.








g. Inter-system coordination. 

60. Several commenters also suggest that we institute formal, but not necessarily codified, procedures or guidelines
for CDMA inter-system coordination in the context of adopting a domestic sharing plan. Some suggest that we use the
initial sharing proposal submitted to the Negotiated Rulemaking Committee by the CDMA applicants as the basis for
a domestic framework. Indeed, the three CDMA applicants participating in the Joint Proposal agree to coordinate
their systems in accordance with this framework expeditiously and in good faith.

61. We applaud the CDMA applicants for their good faith efforts to develop a framework for coordination. We have decided,
however, not to incorporate these procedures in the Commission's rules. Historically, we have left domestic and
separate international system inter-system coordination to the satellite licensees themselves, since they are
in the best position to weigh the technical and economic trade-offs inherent in any coordination agreement.
 This approach has proven successful. Since the CDMA applicants have represented that sharing is feasible, we expect
that good faith efforts to resolve any outstanding coordination issues expeditiously in accordance with the Joint
Proposal will commence after this 

Report and Order 

is issued. If the parties believe that any entity is not negotiating in good faith or if an impasse is reached on any issue,
we will, upon request, become involved in the process and, if necessary, will devise a solution.





62. Another coordination issued raised by some of the commenters is whether and the extent to which a guardband is necessary
between CDMA and TDMA/FDMA systems and, if so, which architecture would bear the burden. The parties to the Joint Proposal
have agreed to develop an emissions mask between the CDMA and TDMA/FDMA band segments that spreads the burden between
them. LQP, in contrast, suggests that an emissions mask may override the allocations made at WARC-92 because
a mask will, in essence, protect Motorola's secondary downlink transmissions in the 1.6 GHz band.

<PARENT> FR941021-0-00022 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

63. We need not resolve this matter now. Rather, while we recognize that secondary services cannot, as a general matter,
claim interference protection from harmful interference from stations of a primary service,
 we will leave the parties free to negotiate a guardband agreement once the technical parameters of their amended system
proposals are finalized. If the parties negotiate an agreement that protects secondary operations, we will accept
that solution. If the parties cannot agree, however, we will become involved and will look to the Table of Frequency
Allocations to determine where any operational constraints are appropriately placed. 





3. Plan If Mutual Exclusivity Is Not Resolved 



64. We do not intend to continue our already-prolonged attempt to resolve this proceeding by compromise in the event
that mutual exclusivity among the Big LEO applicants is not eliminated by amendments submitted by the November 16,
1994 filing deadline, as there is little reason to suppose that further pursuit of that elusive goal would be useful.
In the 

Notice, 

we discussed three alternative procedures_comparative hearing, lottery, and auction_for resolving this proceeding
in the event that the proposed sharing plan did not resolve mutual exclusivity and called for comment concerning the
feasibility and/or legal availability of each of them. If an auction or lottery
 was employed, we proposed to divide the spectrum into paired 2.0625 MHz uplink and downlink segments, with eight paired
segments available for licensing. We proposed to limit each successful bidder or lottery winner to an award of up to
four 2.0625 MHz paired segments, noting that this should provide ample spectrum to support a Big LEO system while allowing
for at least two licensees.
 We conclude that we can lawfully resolve this proceeding by means of an auction and that, of the three, an auction would
better serve the public interest. 






a. 

Comparative hearing

. 65. We continue to believe that the prospect of delay in the initiation of service weighs heavily against use of a comparative
hearing, particularly in light of the need for prompt participation by U.S. licensees in international coordination.
 Whether conflict between Big LEO applications could be resolved through a comparative hearing in less time than is
typically consumed in comparative hearings involving applications for broadcast licenses_as TRW, the only commenter
advocating use of comparative hearings as a fall-back procedure, contends_is largely beside the point. Even under
the most optimistic assumptions, selection of Big LEO licensees through a comparative hearing is likely to take considerably
longer than the use of a lottery or competitive bidding. 





66. We also believe that a comparative hearing would be inadvisable for other reasons. The Commission has previously
stated that comparative hearings would be inconsistent with our aim of affording flexibility to satellite licensees.
 As a general matter, moreover, we are reluctant to substitute our judgment for the wisdom of the marketplace by dictating
outcomes based on assessment of the relative merits of applicants' service proposals. We doubt whether we would be
able to resolve all conflicts among LEO applications based on findings that certain of the applications are demonstrably
technically superior to others. As previously noted, satellite design decisions involve complex trade-offs between
engineering, marketing, and financial considerations, which are difficult to evaluate without reference to the
functioning of the marketplace.
 These design decisions are also modified to accommodate regulations, marketplace and financial constraints and
uncertainties as these uncertainties become more clearly defined in time. 






b. 

Lottery

. 67. Constellation is the only applicant that recommends use of a lottery in the event that we cannot accommodate all
qualified applicants. It states that it favors this procedure only because it believes that auctions would create
unacceptable international ramifications. LQP and TRW, in contrast, maintain that none of the factors listed in
the Conference Report on Section 309(i) that would support the use of a lottery procedure is present here.
 LQP, Motorola, and TRW also contend that a lottery would be inappropriate because the pending applications involve
technically diverse, non-fungible proposals. LQP and TRW argue that it would be unfair to the existing applicants,
who have invested large sums of money in research and development for their proposals, to choose winners by the luck
of the draw. TRW warns that a random selection process here would discourage planning and innovation by future applicants.
Motorola objects that the results of a lottery would bear no relation to the best use of the available spectrum and would
bestow insufficient spectrum or unusable combinations of spectrum-segments upon the winning applicants. 





68. We will not use a lottery in this case because we have concluded that awarding Big LEO licenses through the use of
competitive bidding procedures would better serve the public interest. Most importantly, an auction would be an
economically efficient means of allocation. A well-designed auction produces an outcome approximating allocation
to highest-valued use, which we believe promotes spectrum efficiency and other public interest considerations.
 Use of competitive bidding procedures would provide participants with the incentive to conceive innovative, cost-effective
and spectrum efficient uses for the spectrum-blocks to be assigned and to estimate accurately their potential commercial
value. Further, a lottery may produce a haphazard outcome. Although such an outcome might be partially redressed
through resale, that would entail further transaction costs. We do not believe that an auction would have significant
adverse international ramifications, as discussed below.

c. 

Competitive bidding.

 69. 

Legality.

 Having decided that it would best serve the public interest to use competitive bidding in the event that the sharing
plan does not resolve mutual exclusivity, we next respond to arguments concerning our legal authority to do so. Section
309(j) (1) and (2) of the Communications Act, as amended, 47 U.S.C.  309(j) (1), (2), permits auctions where
mutually exclusive applications for initial licenses or construction permits are accepted for filing by the Commission
and where the principal use of the spectrum will involve or is reasonably likely to involve the receipt by the licensee
of compensation from subscribers in return for enabling those subscribers to receive or transmit communications
signals.
 TRW, however, asserts that ``the entire thrust and substance'' of the legislation authorizing the Commission to
assign licenses by auction is ``geared toward'' licensing for the personal communication service (PCS) service
and that the underlying legislative purposes ``simply do not apply to * * * an inherently global * * *
satellite service [for which] there are currently no more than six applications.'' However, nothing in Section 309(j)
precludes the use of auctions for satellite services, and the scope of our Section 309(j) authority to use auctions
clearly is not limited to PCS licensing.
 Indeed, we have decided to use auctions for many services besides PCS.
 Nor does Section 309(j) withhold authority to use auctions for licensing international satellite systems or specify
a minimum number of competing applications for a class of licenses that must be on file in order for licenses to be assigned
by competitive bidding.







70. Constellation, Motorola and LQP contend that the statute forbids us from conducting an auction until we have used
every means to attempt to eliminate mutual exclusivity. Motorola and LQP cite commentary in the House Report and in
a letter from Congressman Dingell to then-Chairman Quello as evidence that Congress ``clearly had the Big LEO proceeding
in mind when it added this language to the bill'' and that it believed that mutual exclusivity could be avoided in this
proceeding. Further, TRW and COMSAT cite this commentary as proof that Congress enacted Subsection 309(j)(6)(E)
to prevent the Commission from using an auction to assign Big LEO licenses.

71. Nothing on the face of Subsection 309(j)(6)(E), or in its legislative history, indicates that we are prohibited
from granting Big LEO licenses by auction. The text of the Section merely provides that the Commission should continue
to use techniques that avoid mutual exclusivity among applicants. Similarly, the commentary in the House Report
states that it generally serves the public interest for the Commission to use engineering solutions and other mechanisms
to avoid or eliminate mutual exclusivity and that the Commission should continue to do so in the Big LEO licensing proceeding.
The Report does not assert, however, that if the Commission is unsuccessful in resolving mutual exclusivity, the
legislation bars the Commission from auctioning Big LEO licenses. Rather, we construe the provision to mean that
the Commission is obliged to attempt to eliminate mutual exclusivity. Indeed, if the Commission could avoid mutual
exclusivity in every instance in which it arises, no need would exist for the Commission's auction authority. In the
course of this proceeding, we have proposed several spectrum sharing plans to that end.
 We do not think that it would serve the public interest to continue this effort in the event that the six applications
before us, as amended in response to this 

Report and Order,

 are mutually exclusive.

72. Regardless of our general authority to conduct an auction in the Big LEO service, TRW contends that we may not auction
the allocated 2.4 GHz band downlink frequencies because the pending applications for these frequencies are not mutually
exclusive. According to TRW, all four applicants desiring to use the 2.4 GHz band could do so on a shared basis using
the CDMA technology that all of them propose.
 Similarly, since the same four applicants are the only ones proposing to use the lower six MHz of 1.6 GHz band, TRW argues
that we cannot use auctions to assign authorizations for that frequency range either. As TRW sees it, the only portion
of the Big LEO spectrum that we can auction consistently with the mutual exclusivity proviso of Subsection 309(j)(1)
is the sector of the 1.6 GHz band between 1616-1626.5 MHz, where both Motorola and the CDMA proponents have competing
applications on file.





73. We do not agree with TRW that Subsection 309(j)(1) bars us from using an auction to award licenses for the lower portion
of the 1.6 GHz band. There is simply not enough spectrum in the band to accommodate all pending applications. While
we recognize that there are certain portions of the spectrum in which sharing among CDMA systems is possible (

i.e., 

the 1610-1616 MHz and the 2483.5-2500 MHz bands), these frequencies cannot in themselves accommodate
all proposed CDMA systems, including AMSC's. Consequently, these bands cannot be separated from the rest of the MSS
frequencies in determining whether mutual exclusivity exists and whether auctions can be employed. Moreover, we
are not proposing to conduct an auction until after the applicants have had an opportunity to amend their applications
to conform with our rules. If our spectrum sharing plan does not then accommodate the systems of all qualified applicants,
the plan will not be implemented. Rather, the 1.6 GHz band spectrum would be segmented and the qualified applicants
will be required, in order to preserve their eligibility, to apply for a separate license for each segment that they
want to use. Consistent with the mutual exclusivity prerequisite of Subsection 309(j)(1), in the event that only
a single eligible application is filed for a particular segment within the filing window, the segment will be assigned
to the applicant requesting it. We would not assign the license for a segment through competitive bidding unless two
or more eligible applications for it were on file. Winners would be permitted to employ their choice of CDMA or TDMA/FDMA
architectures.
74. We do agree with TRW that there is no need to assign 2.4 GHz band authorizations by competitive bidding. Because
CDMA systems must use 1.6 GHz uplink and corresponding 2.4 GHz downlink frequencies to operate, we proposed in the


Notice 

to pair 1.6 GHz and 2.4 GHz spectrum blocks for auctioning.
 All applicants requesting authority to use the 2.4 GHz band concede that they can share it using CDMA technology, however.
We therefore conclude that would be more appropriate to license all winners of auctioned 1.6 GHz spectrum blocks to
operate in the space-to-Earth transmission direction in the 2483.5-2500 MHz band on a shared basis using CDMA
techniques.





75. TRW contends that dividing sharable spectrum into segments and assigning a license for each segment to the highest
bidder, as we proposed in the 

Notice, 

rather than assigning co-extensive licenses for the entire bandwidth to as many as could share it, would be ``spectrum-inefficient''
and therefore ``manifestly contrary to the auction legislation.'' Constellation likewise asserts that assigning
licenses for discrete segments of the Big LEO spectrum by competitive bidding would probably eliminate any chance
of CDMA sharing, as auction winners would probably not consent to share use of their licensed segments with competing
service providers. Constellation, accordingly, contends that such a licensing procedure would not promote efficient
spectrum use. Similarly, LQP asserts that assigning Big LEO licenses by auction would deter multiple entry and competition.
76. We do not agree that auctioning the 1.6 GHz band in band segments would disserve the statutory objectives of promoting
competition and efficient spectrum use. First, it is not clear that using an auction licensing mechanism would discourage
spectrum sharing. Applicants who obtain licenses for band segments by competitive bidding could negotiate post-auction
sharing agreements among themselves and request license modifications, as TRW acknowledges in its comments.
 If, in fact, the potential economic value of some or all of the available 1.6 GHz band could best be realized through
frequency sharing, licensees will have an incentive to enter into such mutually beneficial sharing agreements,
no matter how they acquire their licenses. Second, there is no evident reason to conclude that competitive bidding
would impede competition. Our auction rules will ensure that there will be at least two providers. Further, by dividing
the available bandwidth into relatively small segments and allowing bidders to acquire several segments and aggregate
them, the number of initial licensees and the amounts of spectrum held by particular licensees will be determined
largely by market forces.





77. We recognize it is possible that an auction might result in fewer licensees than could otherwise have been accommodated
using a sharing plan. As discussed above, however, we have been unable to develop a sharing plan that avoids mutual
exclusivity, assuming all applicants are deemed qualified. If mutual exclusivity cannot be avoided by sharing,
implementing an auction may achieve countervailing public interest benefits. As we have explained, assigning spectrum
rights to those who place the highest value on them generally serves the public interest because it ensures an award
to the highest-valued use.

78. We do not agree with LQP that using auctions is contrary to our established policy of favoring multiple entry in
new satellite services. We have ensured that our competitive bidding framework will result in at least two licensees,
thereby ensuring the benefits of a competitive market structure.
 Moreover, insofar as our policy permits marketplace incentives to determine the number of service providers, the
policy is fully consistent with our ``open skies'' satellite policy, which was based on similar considerations.







79. TRW also suggests that we may not lawfully use an auction to assign Big LEO licenses because of the statutory mandate
concerning promotion of economic opportunity. TRW claims, for instance, that the statute requires the Commission,
consistent with the public interest and the characteristics of the proposed service, to ``prescribe * * *
bandwidth assignments that promote * * * economic opportunity for a 

wide variety 

of applicants'' (emphasis added),
 which is impossible here given the number of Big LEO licenses that can be awarded. TRW further asserts we cannot meet
the statute's requirements to afford opportunity for small businesses, businesses owned by members of minority
groups or women, and rural telephone companies, since there are no representatives of those ``designated entity''
(DE) classes among the existing applicants, that it is virtually impossible for a company qualifying as a small business
to raise enough capital to finance construction and operation of a Big LEO system, and that it would be a daunting task
to devise a system of viable set-asides for designated entities without drastically impairing the ability of other
applicants to implement service.

80. Subsection 309(j)(3) requires the Commission to seek to promote ``economic opportunity and competition,''
among other goals, ``by disseminating licenses among a wide variety of applicants, including [DEs],'' and Subsection
309(j)(4)(D) directs us to ensure, when prescribing regulations governing auction procedures or eligibility to
apply for licenses to be assigned by auction, that DEs are given an opportunity to participate in the provision of spectrum-based
services. The statute, however, directs the Commission, in specifying auction procedures, to pursue other objectives,
aside from ensuring opportunity for DEs. Among these are the goals of promoting ``the development and rapid deployment
of new technologies, products, and services for the benefit of the public, including those residing in rural areas,
without administrative or judicial delays''and of promoting ``efficient and intensive use of the electromagnetic
spectrum.'' 47 U.S.C.  309(j)(3). In the 

Notice

, we tentatively concluded auctions would further these objectives and we affirm these conclusions on this 

Report and Order.


 The statute also implicitly leaves it to the Commission to strike a balance in the public interest among the statutory
objectives.
 Here, only six applications are being considered. No one disputes TRW's assertion that none of the applicants qualifies
as small, minority-owned or women-owned.
 It therefore would appear that to disseminate Big LEO licenses to DEs we would have to open a new filing window for Big
LEO applications.
 While in some circumstances it might be feasible to take such an approach, we believe that it is not the case here. To
ensure that this needed service is made available as quickly as possible, particularly to rural residents not otherwise
served by the telecommunications infrastructure, and to preserve the opportunity for the United States to continue
its leadership role in promoting global development through an enhanced global information infrastructure, we
are committed to awarding licenses by January 31, 1995.
 Opening a new filing window would make that goal impossible. Potential new applicants would need a reasonable amount
of time, traditionally three months from the date of publication in the 

Federal Register

, in which to develop and submit system proposals.
 Opening a new filing window also would be inequitable to the pending applicants, who filed their proposals well before
Section 309(j) was enacted and who have spent considerable time and expense participating in this proceeding. In
light of these considerations, we believe that an auction to award Big LEO licenses is an appropriate exercise of our
discretion.











81. 

Other considerations

. In the 

Notice

, we recognized that although auctions appear advantageous for many reasons, the approach might have unintended
consequences internationally. In particular, we noted that other countries may look to our lead in imposing these
costs on Big LEO systems.
 Given the number of countries that may be served by Big LEO systems, we stated that these costs may be considerable and
may preclude a U.S.-owned system from serving other countries. We noted, however, that these costs may not in fact
be significant in countries that seek to ensure that voice MSS is available within its borders. We further noted that
applicants will pay no more than that which they determine is consistent with their expected revenues from providing
service in that country. Nevertheless, we recognize that the international nature of the Big LEO service raises concerns
that are not applicable to the domestic-only services for which auctions are implemented and requested comment on
this issue.




82. Motorola, Constellation, LQP, TRW, and COMSTAT all contend that an auction is inadvisable because it would set
a bad example for foreign governments. If foreign governments were to use auctions to assign spectrum rights, they
maintain, the cost of providing global MSS would be driven up, possibly to such an extent that Big LEO operators would
be unable to provide worldwide service. TRW asserts that the consequent cost increases might deter most potential
entrants, to the impairment of competition, or might even make it infeasible for anyone to provide Big LEO service.
COMSAT speculates that foreign governments might conduct auctions in a manner that places U.S. companies at a disadvantage.
83. The comments have provided no concrete evidence, however, that an auction would have these harmful effects. We
have concluded elsewhere that, as a general matter, the public interest is served by awarding licenses to those who
assign the highest value to them.
 In light of these substantial public interest benefits, the commenters' mere recitals of the concerns we raised in
the 

Notice

 do not persuade us that auctions are inadvisable.




84. We doubt, first, that our choice of licensing method for the Big LEO service will determine foreign licensing practices
as much as the commenters predict. Foreign officials already know that we recently obtained a statutory mandate for
assigning spectrum licenses by competitive bidding and have decided to assign licenses of enormous aggregate commercial
value for a variety of new services by that means. We assume that those responsible for assigning spectrum rights in
other countries will conduct spectrum auctions if that would best serve the interests that they are obligated to promote,
regardless of what we choose to do in this proceeding. Further, even if auctions are implemented, applicants will
bid no more at an auction than that which they determine is economically feasible.
85. Conversely, TRW contends that if we assign Big LEO licenses at auction and foreign authorities issue such licenses
to others free of charge, the U.S. licensees would be at a competitive disadvantage in the global market. Constellation
similarly maintains that by assigning the licenses at auction the Commission ``would create an incentive for U.S.
companies to develop LEO technology through foreign based systems that did not have to spend significant amounts
of capital for operating licenses.'' TRW also contends that companies who purchase MSS licenses in the United States
at auction might encounter unfair competition from INMARSAT because the INMARSAT Convention and the Communications
Satellite Act might be construed to require that COMSAT be allowed to access INMARSAT capacity from the U.S. without
paying for spectrum use.
86. We do not believe the prospect that auctions will be conducted only in the United States would disadvantage U.S.
licensees globally. We have not yet decided whether, and the terms on which, foreign providers, including INMARSAT,
will be able to provide domestic service. We envision that reciprocal bilateral arrangements on a country-by-country
basis will be negotiated. In reaching and implementing these arrangements, we will consider at that time whether
foreign entities not subject to U.S. auctions would have the economic incentive and ability to offer domestic service
at significantly lower rates than Big LEO operators who purchased spectrum. Further, under this scenario, both U.S.
and foreign operators appear able to receive licenses free of charge in a foreign country. We fail to see how this would
put U.S. operators at a ``global disadvantage.'' Finally, contrary to Constellation's argument, we see no reason
to suppose that applicants who could compete successfully as providers of Big LEO service in the U.S. market would
lose interest in developing systems in the United States merely because it would be necessary to purchase licenses.
If it would be undesirable to serve the U.S. market at high spectrum prices, the prices paid at an auction should fall
until serving the U.S. market is commercially desirable.

87. Consequently, we conclude that we have the statutory authority to award Big LEO licenses through an auction process.
We will implement competitive bidding procedures in the event that all six pending applicants file amendments on
November 16, 1994 that meet all requirements, including financial requirements, for the Big LEO service, but their
applications are still mutually exclusive.
 We place applicants on notice that if an auction needs to be held it will be scheduled as quickly as possible. Given the
importance of proceeding with Big LEO licensing, preparation time for the applicants will necessarily be circumscribed.





d. 

Competitive bidding procedure. 

88. 

Segmentation. 

As proposed in the Notice, we will divide the 1.6 GHz band spectrum into eight 2.0625 MHz segments.
 We recognize that Constellation and LQP assert that a 2.0625 MHz block is ``unworkable'' because it is inconsistent
with some of the applicants' channelization plans, which proposed 1.25 MHz channels. Further, LQP asserts that any
auction of discrete bandwidth segments within the 1.6 GHz band would inevitably result in some applicants getting
unusable, disjointed spectrum blocks. We do not believe these concerns warrant a change in the proposed spectrum
blocks. First, two of the six applicants do not propose to use 1.25 MHz channels. Moreover, any anomalies in spectrum
awards can be corrected in post-auction transactions, as we intend (as explained 

infra

) to allow the licensees to aggregate and disaggregate spectrum through resale.





89. 

Bandwidth cap. 

To ensure that there are at least two Big LEO providers, we will not permit any applicant to acquire more than four 2.0625
MHz band segments in the 1.6 GHz band, 

i.e., 

no more than 8.25 MHz, at auction.
 We would also deny permission for a post-auction transaction that would result in an accumulation in excess of that
limit in the absence of a compelling showing of justification for a waiver.





90. 

Competitive Bidding Design. 

In determining the procedures to be employed if an auction of Big LEO licenses is necessary, we are guided by the principles
developed in PP Docket No. 93-253, the proceeding instituted to implement Section 309(j) of the Communications
Act. The 

Second Report and Order 

in that proceeding
 established the criteria to be used in selecting the auction design method to use for each particular actionable service.
The Commission received voluminous comment on auction design issues. Generally, we concluded that awarding licenses
to those parties who value them most highly will foster Congress' policy objectives. In this regard, we noted that
since a bidder's ability to introduce valuable new services and to deploy them quickly, intensively, and efficiently
increases the value of a license to that bidder, an auction design that awards licenses to those bidders with the highest
willingness to pay the most tends to promote the development and rapid deployment of new services and the efficient
and intensive use of the spectrum. In articulating our auction design principles we agreed with the weight of the comments
in that proceeding_many of which were supported by academic auction design experts_that: (1) licenses with strong
value interdependencies should be auctioned simultaneously; (2) multiple round auctions generally will yield
more efficient allocations of licenses and higher revenues, especially where there is substantial uncertainty
as to value because they provide bidders with information regarding other bidders' valuations of licenses; and (3)
since they may be relatively expensive to implement and time-consuming, simultaneous and/or multiple round auctions
may become less cost-effective as the value of licenses decreases.







91. Based on the foregoing, we concluded that where the licenses to be auctioned are interdependent and their value
is expected to be high, simultaneous multiple round auctions would best achieve the Commission's goals for competitive
bidding.
 We indicated that compared with other bidding mechanisms (such as sequential and sealed bid auctions), simultaneous
multiple round bidding will generate the most information about license values during the course of the auction and
provide bidders with the most flexibility to pursue back-up strategies. Thus, we concluded that simultaneous multiple
round bidding is most likely to award interdependent licenses to the bidders who value them most highly. We also indicated
that this method will facilitate efficient aggregation of licenses across spectrum bands, thereby resulting in
vigorous competition among several strong service providers who will be able rapidly to introduce a wide variety
of services highly valued by end users.
 In addition, we concluded that because of the superior information and flexibility it provides, this method is likely
to yield greater revenues than other auction designs. Thus, we found that the use of simultaneous multiple round auctions
would generally be preferred.








92. Because, however, simultaneous multiple round bidding is likely to be more administratively complex and costly
both for bidders and for the FCC than sequential or single round bidding, we indicated that we would use this auction
design only where license values are interdependent and the expected value of the licenses to be auctioned is high
relative to the costs of conducting a simultaneous multiple round auction.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941021-0-00165 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941021-0-00022 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

93. If it becomes necessary to employ competitive bidding procedures to award Big LEO licenses, we will conduct a single
simultaneous multiple round auction to award licenses in those 2.065 MHz bands for which two or more applications
have been filed.
 Each of the characteristics that lead to selection of this auction design are present here. We expect that there will
be a high degree of interdependence in the values of Big LEO licenses. Licenses may be interdependent either because
they are substitutes or because they are worth more as part of a package than individually. We would expect there to
be some substitutability among these licenses. There may be important ways in which they might be complements as well.
Though all will be nationwide licenses, a single entity will be able to aggregate up to four licenses. It is reasonable
to assume that the value that a bidder places on one license will to at least some degree depend upon whether it will be
able to acquire other licenses. We also expect that the value of Big LEO licenses will be high relative to the costs of
conducting a simultaneous multiple round auction, in part because as the Commission gains experience with simultaneous
multiple round auctions, the costs associated with implementing them may fall.





94. 

Procedural, Payment and Penalty Issues.

 Through our July 1994 auction of nationwide licenses to provide Personal Communications Services in the 900 MHz band
(narrowband PCS), we have gained some experience with simultaneous multiple round auctions. It appears that the
rules we adopted concerning the procedures to be used in conducting auctions, the schedule for payment for licenses,
and the penalties to be paid for bid withdrawal, default or disqualification, have worked well.
 In the event that it becomes necessary to employ competitive bidding in Big LEO licensing, we will conduct auctions
as specified under those rules. If such an auction is required, we will issue a Public Notice explaining further the
administrative details of the auction, but we generally expect the auction will be conducted similarly to the nationwide
narrowband PCS auction.





95. In order to reduce the risk of defaults and to ensure that the Commission has a ready source of funds to satisfy any
bid withdrawal or default penalties, we will impose a requirement that, to be qualified to participate in the Big LEO
auction, applicants must submit an upfront payment to the Commission prior to the auction.
 Consistent with our auction rules for Personal Communications Services, we have decided to set the upfront payment
at approximately two cents per MHz of spectrum per person residing in the proposed service area ($0.02 per MHz-pop).
 Because Big LEO systems must be able to provide service to all areas of the fifty states, $0.02 per MHz-pop would amount
to approximately $10 million per 2.0625 MHz segment.
 For simplicity, we will round this to the nearest million, and require an upfront payment of $10 million.








96. 

Resale, aggregation and disaggregation.

 Aside from imposing the 8.25 MHz cap on aggregation, we will not restrict auction winners from reselling 1.6 GHz band
spectrum-rights. They would be free not only to resell 2.065 MHz segments but also to reassign any smaller portion
of 1.6 GHz band spectrum. Affording such flexibility enhances beneficial incentives.
 Although we do not think that such post-auction transactions would be likely to entail unjust enrichment,
 applications for consent to assignment of Big LEO spectrum authorizations obtained by auction will be subject to
the disclosure and close-scrutiny policies delineated in the Second Report and Order in the auction rulemaking.









97. 

Assignment of 2.4 GHz band.

 As previously noted, all auction winners will be authorized to operate over the entire 2483.5-2500 MHz band,
with the stipulation that operation in that band must be in the CDMA mode and must be used for downlink transmissions.



B. Interservice Sharing



98. In the 

Notice,

 we recognized that Big LEO systems will be required to share the 1.6/2.4 GHz and adjacent frequency bands with a number
of existing services. In the 1.6 GHz range, the 1610-1626.5 MHz band is allocated to the aeronautical radionavigation
service (ARNS) on a co-primary basis, and a segment of the band, at 1610.6-1613.8 MHz, is allocated to the radioastronomy
service (RAS) on a co-primary basis. In the 2.4 GHz range, the 2483.5-2500 MHz band is allocated for co-primary
use by the broadcast auxiliary service, by the terrestrial fixed-service and by industrial, scientific and medical
(ISM) operations. Adjacent bands are allocated to the aeronautical radionavigation satellite service, the instructional
television fixed service (ITFS) and the multi-channel multi-point distribution service (MMDS).

99. The Negotiated Rulemaking Committee was comprised of Big LEO applicants and representatives of most parties
potentially affected by Big LEO services, and analyzed extensively interservice sharing at 1.6/2.4 GHz. We used
the Committee's recommendations as the primary basis the proposals in our 

Notice.

 We sought comment on those proposals as well as those areas where a representative of an affected interest did not participate
in the Committee, or where the Committee could not reach a consensus on an interservice sharing issue.



1. Radio Astronomy Service



100. As noted above, the 1610.6-1613.8 MHz frequency band is allocated to the RAS on a co-primary basis.
 RAS operations involve the reception of radio waves of cosmic origin,
 and are responsible for amassing a substantial portion of information about the universe that has been acquired in
the last sixty years. Because the RAS involves only radio reception, it cannot interfere with other services operating
in the same frequency band. However, it can receive harmful interference from other services. As a co-primary service,
the RAS is entitled to protection from harmful interference. Ensuring this protection is complicated by the nature
of cosmic radiation emissions, which are similar to random noise emissions and have extremely low power flux density
levels at the Earth. Further, there is a potential for both in-band and out-of-band interference.

a. 

In-band interference to the RAS.

 101. The Committee was able to agree on procedures that would permit sharing between Big LEOs and the RAS. The Committee's
task was made somewhat easier by the fact that radio astronomy observations are usually conducted in remote areas
and are not always continuous. The Committee's proposal, developed cooperatively with the Committee on Radio Frequencies
(CORF),
 would establish fixed-radius protection zones around the sixteen radio astronomy sites in the United States and
technical requirements for MSS downlink transmissions. Based on this recommendation, we proposed to establish
protection zones around radio astronomy sites in the United States as a means of preventing MSS transmissions from
interfering with RAS observations in the 1610.6-1613.8 MHz band.
 To that end, we also proposed that ``all 1.6/2.4 GHz MSS systems shall be capable of determining the position of MSS
user transceivers accessing the space segment through either internal radiodetermination calculations or external
sources such as LORAN-C or GPS.''









102. Big LEO parties generally agree with the fixed-radius protection zone approach. However, both TRW and Constellation
question whether it is necessary to require all MSS systems to be capable of determining the position of their user
terminals.
 They contend that a position location requirement need not be imposed on those MSS systems that elect to use beacon-actuated
protection systems as a means for avoiding harmful interference to RAS observations.






103. As we stated in the Notice, the Committee decided that a beacon actuated protection system might provide an alternative
to fixed radius protection zones. Under such a system, a beacon would transmit a signal when RAS observations were
in progress. Upon receipt of this signal, an MSS control center would automatically assign the MSS terminal to a communications
channel outside of the shared MSS-RAS frequency band. The Committee concluded, however, that several theoretical
and practical concerns must be addressed before a beacon system can be implemented.
 CORF continues to support that position.








104. Because beacon actuated protection systems are not yet fully developed, we will adopt our original proposal
that requires MSS operators to protect RAS observations in the 1610.6-1613.8 MHz band using the fixed-radius
protection zone method. Nevertheless, because we expect that more efficient solutions will be developed, we will
permit MSS licensees to use smaller geographic protection zones in lieu of the specified areas upon a showing that
MSS operations will not cause harmful interference to an RAS observatory during periods of observation.
 We will, however, as proposed, allow beacon-actuated protection zones to be used in lieu of fixed protection zones
if a coordination agreement is reached between a mobile-satellite system licensee and the Electromagnetic Spectrum
Management Unit (ESMU) on the specifics of beacon operations.''
 Should any of the Big LEO licensees show at a later time, and coordinate with the ESMU, that certain other methods can
be used in lieu of the fixed-radius protection zone, we will allow MSS system operators to employ these methods. In
the interim, however, position determination of MSS user transceivers is necessary to accomplish fixed-radius
zone protection. Therefore, we adopt as part of  25.213(a)(1), the MSS user transceiver position determination
requirement as proposed in the Notice.







105. In the Notice, we also proposed that MSS user transceivers be capable of terminating operations as soon as practicable
upon entering an RAS protection zone.
 LQP argues that our proposal would require that calls initiated outside of an RAS protection zone be terminated as
soon as the MSS user transceiver moves within the protection zone, which, according to LQP, would be inordinately
complex and costly.
 LQP suggests that our rules should permit the call to be switched successfully to frequencies outside of the RAS bands
(during RAS observations) before operations are terminated to that unit.









106. We believe that LQP's suggestion is reasonable. Allowing calls initiated prior to entering an RAS protection
zone to continue until a non-RAS frequency is found will ensure continuity of service to the MSS user. Further, we believe
that other requirements that we are adopting, such as the notification requirement that is described below, will
ensure that RAS operations are not affected adversely. Therefore, we modify proposed  25.213(a)(1)(v) as
suggested by LQP.

<TEXT>
 

107. We also proposed in the Notice to require that the ESMU notify MSS licensees in the 1610.6-1613.8 MHz band
of radio astronomy observations.
 This requirement was proposed to ensure that MSS operations terminate as soon as possible after an MSS user transceiver
enters a RAS protection zone where observations are being made. CORF suggests that it could meet this requirement
by providing MSS operators with schedules of RAS observations.
 TRW disagrees, stating that CORF should be required to provide notification ``of periods of actual radio astronomy
observations rather than a general schedule.''
 We agree with TRW that it would not be overly burdensome for the ESMU to notify the small number of licensed in-band Big
LEO operators of periods of actual RAS observations. This will help ensure that no interference is caused to RAS observations
in the event that a schedule is changed.







108. In a related matter, Motorola notes that the Committee suggested that RAS observations not be scheduled during
peak MSS/RDSS traffic periods to the extent possible.
 CORF does not object to this proposal.
 RAS observations are usually carried out in remote areas and are not continuous. Even during peak MSS traffic periods,
the majority of MSS traffic should not occur in RAS observation areas. We do not therefore believe that adherence to
this provision will be burdensome to RAS. Consequently, we include this provision in our rules in  25.213(a)(4).








109. Finally, TRW requests that we agree to solicit public comment before we require MSS systems to protect additional
RAS sites beyond the sixteen sites specified in the rules.
 In bands shared by two or more services on a co-primary basis, new facilities in either service must be coordinated
among affected operators. As provided for in proposed rule  25.213(1)(a)(viii), which we adopt, we will solicit
comment with respect to protection from additional RAS sites.





b. 

Out-of-band interference to RAS from primary MSS uplinks at 1.6 GHz.

 110. In the Notice, we also recognized that MSS uplink operations in the 1613.8-1626.5 MHz portion of the band
could cause unacceptable out-of-band interference into RAS operations at 1610.6-1613.8 MHz. We also noted
the Committee's suggestion to establish fixed protection zones similar to, but smaller than, those recommended
for in-band emissions, although we did not propose a rule in this regard.





111. CORF suggested several alternatives to our proposals:






(1) To require that the power flux density (pfd) level reaching RAS sites from a mobile user terminal operating anywhere
in the 1610-1626.5 MHz band not exceed the pfd from a mobile user terminal operating within the RAS 1610.6-1613.8
MHz band segment at the edge of the protection zone applicable for that site, or


(2) To prohibit mobile terminal operations within the 1613.8-1615.8 MHz band during RAS observations within
protection zones of 100 km or 30 km around RAS sites depending upon the type of observatory involved.






112. The MSS parties generally oppose restrictions on out-of-band emissions for the purpose of protecting RAS. For
example, Constellation argues that MSS out-of-band levels should not be unilaterally defined by the radio astronomy
community without any regard to the impact those levels would have on other services.
 TRW states that it could agree to CORF's suggestions if a compliant mobile user terminal were not required to undertake
further coordination with the RAS. TRW notes, however, that CORF's out-of-band protection proposals would relegate
MSS to co-primary or even lower status in frequency bands that are not allocated to the RAS.''
 Only LQP generally agrees with CORF's suggestion. According to LQP, there is sufficient 1.6 GHz band spectrum to switch
MSS users near RAS sites from potentially interfering channels to channels separated from RAS observations.










113. We have considered the impact of this proposal on Big LEO licensees and conclude they would not be unduly burdened
by protecting RAS observations from out-of-band MSS emissions. It appears that less than one percent of the MSS consumer
use would be affected by CORF's alternative proposals for protecting RAS from out-of-band MSS emissions.
 Further, those affected would not be denied communications. They would simply be assigned to another uplink channel
by the MSS network control center. We do not believe that the CORF proposals relegate the MSS to co-primary or even lower
status. The RAS is seeking protection in bands only in the 1610.6-1613.8 MHz band, which is allocated to the RAS.
Therefore we adopt CORF's proposals to protect RAS, during observations, from out-of-band emissions caused by Big
LEO systems. If Big LEO operators cannot meet the power density levels necessary to protect RAS from harmful interference,
we will require that Big LEO operations be terminated within the protection zones specified in  25.213(a)(1)(iii).

c. 

Out-of-band interference to RAS from secondary downlinks in the 1.6 GHz band. 

114. In the Notice, we proposed to codify the Committee's recommendations to eliminate potential harmful out-of-band
interference to RAS from secondary MSS downlinks operating at 1613.8-1626.5 MHz.
 The Committee recommended that such operations be restricted to frequencies separated by the upper edge of the RAS
band by at least 2.2 MHz, that MSS downlink emissions be filtered aboard the spacecraft, that frequencies be selectively
controlled and that an analysis and testing program be conducted in cooperation with the radio astronomy community.
Based on its deliberations, the Committee proposed that we adopt rules governing use of the 1613.8-1626.5 MHz
band that limit out-of-band emissions so that they do not exceed ^238 dB(W/m2/Hz) during observations at non-VLBA
sites and ^198 dB(W/m2/Hz) during observations at VLBA sites.





115. Motorola argues that the limits proposed in the Notice are too rigid and would unduly constrain MSS operations.
 In support, Motorola contends that those limits were devised originally using assumptions that are not applicable
to Big LEO operations. For example, Motorola notes that the calculations assumed an immobile, continuous interference
source, whereas secondary MSS downlink LEO operations would present an intermittent source. Further, Motorola
notes that although the Committee reached a consensus on a recommendation regarding limits, it did not agree on a proposed
rule to govern Big LEO MSS operations. Motorola asserts that instead of adopting specific protection limits applicable
to MSS secondary downlinks, the Commission should only restate the general obligation that secondary services not
cause harmful interference to primary services. 





116. LQP and TRW disagree with Motorola. LQP states that our proposal is reasonable and should be adopted.
 TRW asserts that Motorola's proposal does not adequately consider the needs of the RAS. It states, however, that if
secondary downlinks are limited to the 1621.35-1626.5 MHz band, thereby creating a 7.5 MHz guardband between
RAS and secondary MSS, Motorola's proposals would be acceptable.
 






117. We recognize the need to protect RAS observations from secondary MSS downlink operations. At this juncture,
however, we need not consider specific limits on Big LEO MSS secondary downlinks. Secondary services by definition
shall not cause harmful interference nor claim protection from primary services.
 This provision applies to protection of primary services from both in-band and out-of-band emissions and would apply
to secondary MSS downlinks regardless of specified pfd levels. Thus, we see no reason to codify specific pfd limits
as proposed in the Notice. We will instead modify proposed  25.213(a)(2) to note that secondary MSS downlinks
shall not cause harmful interference to primary RAS operations in the 1610.6-1613.8 MHz band. Further, operators
of secondary downlinks will be required to take whatever steps necessary to resolve interference complaints by radio
astronomers. We expect that an applicant proposing to operate MSS downlinks in the 1613.8-1626.5 MHz band will
be able to demonstrate in its application that it has sufficient satellite out-of-band emission attenuation to protect
adjacent band U.S. RAS operations based upon the frequency separation inherent in the frequency assignment scheme
adopted here. 




118. Finally, Cornell University, Arecibo Observatory, notes its concern that MSS downlink transmissions at 1.6
GHz could have a ``disastrous effect'' on passive space research in the 1610-1667 MHz band.
 LQP, in support of Cornell, notes that the Commission must limit MSS downlink transmissions to the 5.15 MHz proposed
in the Commission's Notice, that is, to 1621.35-1626.5 MHz.
 Motorola responds that ``the 1613.8-1660 MHz band is not allocated to the RAS on a primary or secondary basis''
and thus is not entitled to protection from secondary MSS downlinks operating outside that band.

119. There is no RAS allocation in the 1613.8-1660 MHz band and the service is therefore not entitled to protection
in these bands. Consequently, we will not limit MSS transmissions in order to protect RAS as suggested by Cornell University
and LQP. In any case, we do not believe that RAS observations above 1634 MHz would be affected by secondary MSS downlinks
in the 1621.35-1626.50 MHz band given the frequency separation.



d. 

Spurious emissions into the 4990-5000 MHz from primary downlinks in the 2483.5-2500 MHz band. 

120. The Commission recognized that second harmonic spurious emissions from primary MSS downlink transmissions
in the 2483.5-2500 MHz band could cause unacceptable interference to RAS operations in the 4990-5000
MHz band. It concluded and we proposed in  25.213(a)(3) that MSS downlink out-of-band spectral power flux density
(spfd) levels should be limited to ^241 dB)W/m2/Hz) in the 4990-5000 MHz band.




121. We will adopt the rules as proposed. Although Constellation argues that it opposes any such codification of the
radio astronomy community's definition of ``unacceptable'' interference,
 we note that Constellation participated in the Committee and its deliberations and agreed to the Committee's Report
that included this recommendation. More importantly, as stated in the 

Notice, 

we believe that these limits can be readily met through proper amplifier device selection and operating conditions
in combination with post-amplifier filtering.






2. Aeronautical Radionavigation Satellite Service and Radionavigation-Satellite Service




122. The U.S. Global Positioning System (GPS) can operate under the radionavigation-satellite (space-to-Earth)
service (RNSS) allocation in the 1565.2-1585.6 MHz band. GPS is a space-based positioning, velocity, and time
system whose space segment, when fully operational, will be composed of 21 operational satellites in six orbital
planes. GLONASS, the Russian Global Navigation Satellite System, can operate under the same service allocation
in the 1597-1610 MHz bands.
 Additionally, GLONASS can operate under the aeronautical radionavigation service (ARNS) allocation in the 1610-1616
MHz band pursuant to RR 732 of the international Radio Regulations.
 The GLONASS system will include 24 operational satellites in three orbital planes. The user segment of both the GPS
and GLONASS systems will consist of antennas and receiver-processors that can receive both GPS and GLONASS signals
to provide positioning, velocity, and precise timing to the user. The Committee addressed ARNS/RNSS-MSS sharing
and developed specific recommendations in that regard. We based the sharing proposals in the 

Notice 

on the Committee's recommendations and on requirements embodied in the International Radio Regulations.





a. 

In-band interference to ARNS and MSS uplinks in the 1610-1626.5 MHz band. 

123. Pursuant to international Radio Regulations, MSS stations may not cause harmful interference to or claim protection
from stations operating under RR 732. Further, international Radio Regulation RR 731F provides that MSS earth stations
operating with MSS space stations cannot radiate an equivalent isotropically radiated power (e.i.r.p.) density
greater than ^15 dB(W/4KHz) in that portion of the band used by systems operating in accordance with RR 732, and ^3 db
(W/4KHz) in bands not so used.




124. The Committee concluded that GLONASS receivers operating on-board high altitude aircraft could be protected
against interference from MSS operations operating in accordance with RR 731E.
 It also concluded that protection would not be possible if GLONASS is used for aircraft approach and terminal communications,
as is contemplated by the FAA.
 The Committee recommended and we proposed in  25.213(c)(1) to codify the uplink e.i.r.p. limits contained
in RR 731E. The Committee had stated that this limit is needed to allow the proposed Big LEO systems to be implemented,
although it acknowledged that it will not protect GLONASS if GLONASS is used to provide aircraft approach and terminal
communications as a component of a ``sole means'' GNASS. The Committee also examined several methods to improve the
ARNS/RNSS-MSS sharing environment. One was to reconfigure GLONASS so that it would operate only on frequencies
below 1610 MHz.
 Another method for improving sharing possibilities, it noted, would be to modify GLONASS receiver standards to reduce


band MSS. Alternatively, it suggested that the U.S. GPS be enhanced to lessen or eliminate reliance on GLONASS altogether.
Further, the Committee recommended, and we proposed in Section 25.213(c)(2), that to protect operations of GLONASS
receivers on-board aircraft, MSS terminals should be prohibited from being used on civil aircraft.

125. Aeronautical Radio, Inc., and the Air Transport Association of America (ARINC/ATA), Rockwell International
Corporation (Rockwell), and the FAA argue that both GLONASS and GPS operations, as potential components of the GNSS,
must be protected during all phases of flight over the United States. To that end, they proffer additional limitations
on Big LEO operations. ARINC/ATA argues that the Commission should clarify that the RR 731E limitation of -15
dB (W/4kHz) for MSS mobile terminals should apply only after GLONASS moves to frequencies below 1610 MHz. Until then,
they contend, the limit should be -78.5 dB (W/MHZ).
 Similarly, Rockwell states that the RR 731E limit is insufficient for protecting GLONASS operations at 1610-1616
MHz. Rockwell claims that the RR 731E power density level is about 140 dB above the maximum interference level that
can be tolerated by a typical GLONASS receiving system. Rockwell asserts that shared use of this band segment is impractical
absent significant constraints on either MSS or GLONASS. Therefore, it maintains that MSS operation should not be
permitted in the 1610-1616 MHz band segment until GLONASS operations are shifted to frequencies below 1610
MHz.
 The FAA states that the Commission indicated that use of the 1610-1616 MHz band by MSS is premised upon moving
GLONASS below 1610 MHz. It maintains that the e.i.r.p. density specified in RR 731E is too high to protect in-band GLONASS
for anything but high altitude enroute communications.








126. Several of the MSS applicants also disagree that more restrictive limits should be placed on MSS uplinks pending
a GLONASS frequency shift. Constellation states that more realistic interference criteria and models must be developed
before any requirements other than the RR 731E uplink e.i.r.p. density limit can be adopted.
 Ellipsat contends that no additional requirements should be adopted because the aviation community has not provided
a legitimate basis for overly stringent requirements on MSS uplinks. Further, Ellipsat maintains that even if GLONASS
becomes a component of the GNSS, the aviation community has not provided a showing that GNSS performance would be impaired
if degradation were to occur to the small number of GLONASS satellites that would operate above 1610 MHz.
 Motorola claims that the proposed limits advocated by the aviation community are based on flawed assumptions and
unsound analysis. Additionally, Motorola asserts that the protection the aviation parties claim as necessary is
based on the erroneous assumption that corrupting a single measurement from a GLONASS satellite will cause unacceptable
degradation in the ability to navigate.

127. Several MSS applicants also state that, to afford new MSS systems flexibility in how they protect ARNS/RNSS,
the Commission should modify proposed rule  25.213(c)(1), which, in addition to the uplink limits contained
in RR 731F, requires all MSS operations in the 1.6 GHz band to be coordinated with systems operating pursuant to RR 732.
Motorola argues that rules embodied in the International Radio Regulations are adequate for ensuring coordination
with and protection of other services.
 Constellation contends that footnote RR 731E establishes the only enforceable interference criteria (

i.e.,

 a maximum e.i.r.p. density of ^15 dB (W/4kHz) from MSS transmitters) that can be incorporated into the Commission's
rules at this time. Motorola, in contrast, suggests that the e.i.r.p. value set forth in  25.213(c)(1) be interpreted
as a coordination trigger rather than an absolute limit.
 LQP states that the proposed rule requires MSS systems to protect GLONASS beyond the limits specified in RR 731E.







128. We do not believe it is necessary to protect GLONASS operations beyond the provisions of RR 731E and the obligation
to coordinate MSS systems under current International Telecommunications Union (ITU) procedures. RR 731E states
clearly that MSS stations shall not cause interference to, nor claim protection from ARNS stations operating in accordance
with RR 732. In addition, under ITU Resolution 46, Big LEO licensees would be subject to whatever limits or conditions
agreed upon during the coordination process. GLONASS would likely be part of the coordination negotiations. Accordingly,
we reject the aviation community's requests that additional limits be placed on MSS operations pending a GLONASS
move, particularly absent definitive technical characteristics and requirements of a future GNSS system, and a
definitive statement as to GLONASS's role in the GNSS.
 Further, imposing additional constraints on Big LEO use of the 1610-1616 MHz band could jeopardize the applicants'
ability to implement their systems. This could deprive the United States and those countries who choose to participate
in offering services the potential benefits that Big LEOs could bring. Conversely, we do not believe the limits in
RR 731E should be relaxed, as Motorola suggests. It is clear ^15 dB(W/4kHz) is a limit and not a threshold for coordination.
Therefore, we adopt the e.i.r.p. limits embodied in RR 731E in Section 25.213(c)(1) with the requirement that coordination
of MSS mobile earth terminals must be undertaken according to the provisions of Resolution 46 (WARC-92).




129. We also adopt our proposed rule that prohibits operation of Big LEO terminals on-board civil aircraft unless
the terminal has a direct connection to the aircraft's Cabin Communication System. However, we agree with Constellation
and others that this is a transceiver operating provision and is not necessarily a sharing requirement. Therefore,
since this provision is contained in  25.136(a) of our rules, it need not be repeated in  25.213. Consequently,
we do not adopt proposed rule  25.213(c)(2) and refer licensees to  25.136(a).
b. 

Out-of-band interference to ARNS/RNSS in the 1559-1610 MHz band.

 130. 

Protection of GPS from out-of-band emissions from primary uplinks in the 1610-1626.5 MHz band.

 The Committee concluded that out-of-band emissions by MSS uplinks in the 1610-1626.5 MHz band could potentially
interfere with GPS operations near 1575 MHz. The Committee found, however, that sharing is possible if appropriate
limits are put on out-of-band emissions from MSS user transceivers.
 The Committee recommended, and we proposed, that MSS user transceivers limit out-of-band emissions (for broadband
noise emissions) so as not to exceed an e.i.r.p. density of ^70 dBW/1MHz averaged over any 20 millisecond (ms) period
in any portion of the 1574.397-1576.443 MHz band. For any discrete spurious emissions in the same band (

i.e.,

 bandwidth less than 600 Hz), the user transceiver e.i.r.p. density is not to exceed ^80 dbW.

131. ARINC/ATA agrees that the proposed limits will protect GPS.
 The FAA, however, recommended that the protection bandwidth for GPS ``be established at least 20 MHz wide (

i.e.,

 1575.42+/^10 MHz).''
 No technical analysis was provided to support this recommendation.






132. TRW, Ellipsat, and LQP contend that the proposed out-of-band emission limits should be relaxed.
 They contend that relaxing the limits will allow for reasonably priced user terminals and will adequately protect
GPS from out-of-band emissions from these terminals. Constellation, in contrast, supports the proposed limits.
It states that the protection level of GPS receivers is reasonable given the frequency separation between the lower
end of the MSS band at 1610 MHz and GPS signals at 1575.42 MHz.







133. We believe that the proposed out-of-band emission limits for MSS user transceiver operations in the 1610-1626.5
MHz band are appropriate to protect GPS operations near 1575 MHz. Both the aviation and MSS parties participated in
the Committee's deliberations that resulted in a consensus on an out-of-band emission limit for protecting GPS.
No party has demonstrated that a modification of those limits is now warranted. The MSS parties do not demonstrate
that the limits are overly restrictive or that significant additional costs would be incurred by building transceivers
to meet the limits. Similarly, the aviation parties have not shown that additional protection bandwidth for GPS is
necessary. We therefore adopt proposed  25.213(b) with minor editorial changes.

134. 

Protection of GLONASS from out-of-band emissions from primary uplinks in the 1610-1626.5 MHz band.

 The Committee also addressed potential MSS out-of-band interference to GLONASS operations below 1610 MHz, but did
not reach a consensus. It did, however, suggest a methodology that could be used to determine appropriate limits.
It also noted that there was general agreement that the MSS user transceiver out-of-band emission limits recommended
for protecting GPS would be sufficient to protect GLONASS operations below 1610 MHz.
 We requested comment on the proposed methodology and on the appropriate parameters to be used in developing protection
criteria.





135. ARINC/ATA and Rockwell maintain that the MSS out-of-band emission limits appropriate for protecting GPS operations
near 1575 MHz should similarly apply to GLONASS operations below 1610 HMz.
 The FAA suggests an interference threshold of ^145 dBW/1MHz of GLONASS receivers operating below 1610 MHz and calculates
a ^71 dBW/1MHz MSS user terminal out-of-band emission limit which, it argues, is necessary to protect GLONASS operations
at that particular interference threshold.
.






136. The MSS applicants question whether the assumptions made by the aviation parties in their analyses are appropriate
and disagree that a direct correlation can be made between the out-of-band emission limits necessary for protecting
GPS and the limits necessary for protecting GLONASS below 1610 MHz. Constellation, for example, noted that the provisions
to protect GPS from MSS out-of-band emissions were agreed to in the Committee, but that agreement was ``without prejudice
to the application of the interference protection model to any other case, 

i.e.,

 GLONASS, where it would be impractical to provide this same level of protection and for which other solutions are required
to avoid harmful interference.''
 LQP notes that while the FAA, ARINC and ATA seek protection of individual GLONASS signals, they have not provided an
analysis of why such protection is required to ensure the integrity of the GLONASS system.
 Motorola contends that the analyses conducted by the aviation community are ``skewed'' because they have assumed
that the MSS transmitter and the aircraft receiver are static when, in fact, both devices are usually mobile.
 Motorola also lists a number of factors which it argues would provide a more accurate determination of necessary out-of-band
emission limits.
 TRW requests that we incorporate in the rules the ongoing measurement programs and the system vulnerability analyses
now being used to determine actual protection requirements of GNSS.










137. We will not adopt out-of-band emission limits to protect GLONASS operations below 1610 MHz at this time. The Committee
did not agree on limits and the record indicates that a suitable methodology for determining such limits has still
not been agreed upon. We note, however, that RTCA Working Group SC159 ad hoc has been established to assess interference
to GNSS and possible interference mitigation techniques. The aviation community and the Big LEO applicants participate
in this group. We expect that the report from SC159 ad hoc will include an assessment of the out-of-band emission limits
on MSS operations necessary to protect GLONASS operations below 1610 MHz. We also believe that this information will
provide a mutually acceptable out-of-band emission level.

c. Out-of-band interference to ARNS/RNSS from secondary MSS downlinks in the 1613.8-1626.5 MHz band.

 138. The Committee also examined the potential for harmful interference to GPS and GLONASS from secondary MSS downlinks
in the 1613.8-1626.5 MHz band. It concluded that interference to GPS operations near 1575 MHz from these downlinks
would be negligible due to the low power density level of MSS satellite signals at the Earth's surface and the large
frequency separation between the MSS and the GPS frequency bands.
 To protect GLONASS from interference, however, the Committee recommended that space stations that use the 1613.8-1626.5
MHz band for downlinks not exceed a pfd of -141.5 dbW/m


 We proposed this limit in the Notice in rule  25.213(c)(3).






139. Motorola requests that we limit proposed  25.213(c)(3) to apply only to those frequencies that are used
by systems operating in accordance with International Radio Regulation RR 732. Motorola contends that this would
``follow any changes in the frequency plan of systems, like GLONASS, operating in accordance with RR 732, and would
also avoid restricting the operations of MSS systems in frequencies where there are no aeronautical radionavigation
systems and hence no need for a more restrictive power flux density limit.''
 Motorola also asks us to clarify that the pfd limit refers to the pfd level at the Earth's surface.





140. We believe that the pfd limits proposed in  25.213(c)(3) can be readily achieved by MSS operators using
the 1613.8-1626.5 MHz band for secondary downlink transmissions. We also believe that our intra-service sharing
plan provides sufficient separation between the MSS downlink band and GLONASS operations below 1610 MHz so as not
to create interference. Nevertheless, we have decided not to adopt the proposed rule containing out-of-band emission
limits for secondary MSS downlinks. Adopting such a rule could be construed to imply that the secondary service has
some protection rights relative to primary services in the band, which, by definition, it does not.





141. We remind MSS operators that plan to use the 1613.8-1626.5 MHz secondary allocation for MSS space-to-Earth
operations that downlink MSS operations shall not cause harmful interference to GLONASS operations in the 1598-1610
MHz band.
 Further, MSS operators may not claim interference protection from out-of-band GLONASS operations. We also remind
MSS operators of the obligation to coordinate secondary downlink operations in the 1613.8-1626.5 MHz band
pursuant to RR 731F.







3. Industrial, Scientific, and Medical Emissions at 2400-2500 MHz



142. The 2400-2500 MHz band may be used on a co-primary basis for Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) equipment
applications. ISM applications include microwave ovens, door openers, high frequency lighting systems, industrial
equipment, and other low power devices. The Committee was unable to reach a consensus as to whether ISM use represents
a significant interference problem to MSS downlinks at 2483.5-2500 MHz.
 In the Notice, we stated that the record in this area was insufficient to propose specific MSS/ISM sharing rules and
requested additional comment on this subject.







143. In their comments, LQP and TRW indicate they conducted independent analyses of the potential for ISM operations
to cause harmful interference to 2.4 GHz MSS downlinks. LQP concluded that MSS user transceivers operated in an urban
environment with full signal quality in 98% of the instances it recorded. Further, it concluded that MSS signals would
be usable 99.5% of the time. LQP also noted that because urban areas are usually served by terrestrial cellular networks,
a dual mode transceiver could be switched to terrestrial cellular frequencies when very high ISM interference is
present.
 TRW states that its study generally corroborates LQP's conclusion that 2.4 GHz MSS operations should not be adversely
affected by ISM transmissions.







144. Consequently, we do not believe any further inquiry into the MSS/ISM sharing situation is warranted. Should
sharing be more difficult than anticipated, affected parties may request that we revisit this matter.



4. Sharing with Fixed Services in the 2483.5-2500 MHz Band



145. Over 700 fixed terrestrial stations, including temporary fixed (transportable) stations, are licensed and
operating in the United States in the 2483.5-2500 MHz band. These stations are primarily used as links in microwave
relay systems serving petroleum companies and as broadcast auxiliary links. Since 1985, however, the Commission
has prohibited any further terrestrial licensing in this band.

146. The Committee recognized that MSS spacecraft operating at power flux density (pfd) levels in excess of the levels
prescribed by international radio regulation RR 2566 would be required to be coordinated with these ``grandfathered''
fixed terrestrial stations.
 It stated, however, that these cases should be infrequent and that, in any event, any interference problems should
be resolvable through coordination. The Committee also noted that terrestrial operations could interfere with
MSS operations, although no analyses were provided to quantify the sharing constraints needed to prevent such interference.
The Committee stated that because there is no inherent reason why fixed services need to continue operating in this
frequency band, the Commission should consider moving these fixed stations to a higher frequency band.





147. In the Notice, we accepted the Committee's finding that interference problems between terrestrial fixed-services
at 2483.5-2500 MHz and MSS downlinks operating in excess of the prescribed pfd levels may be settled through
the coordination process.
 We requested comment on this assessment. We also specifically requested comment from terrestrial operators, who
did not participate in the Negotiated Rulemaking.






148. In the RDSS Allocation Order, we recognized that fixed and temporary-fixed operations are unlikely to pose a
serious interference threat to RDSS.
 We therefore grandfathered all existing station licenses as of July 25, 1985, permitting them to continue operations
and subject only to license renewal. However, we acknowledged that coordination would be somewhat more difficult
when temporary-fixed stations are involved since RDSS licensees would not have exact information regarding the
location of these stations. Therefore, we required temporary-fixed licensees in this band to notify RDSS licensees
directly whenever the station is moved to a new location.
 A similar interference environment is present with MSS operations. Consequently, we proposed to modify Section
94.61(b)(4) to extend the notification requirement for grandfathered temporary-fixed licensees to MSS licensees
as well.









149. The Big LEO parties argue that the Commission should adopt pfd limits for MSS transmissions that are less stringent
than those of RR 2566 and that these limits should be implemented as ``triggers'' for coordination, not as ``absolute
limits.''
 This would work in the following manner: the relaxed pfd limit would be established as a ``trigger level.'' If the trigger
level is not exceeded, no further action would be required. If the trigger level is exceeded, the interference level
to terrestrial systems would then be examined, taking into account the individual system characteristics of the
MSS system. Only if the protection levels of the second step are exceeded would coordination be required.
 According to the Big LEO parties, relaxing the pfd levels and applying the coordination trigger method would enable
the MSS systems to enhance capacity and sharing with other MSS operators and avoid time-consuming and costly coordination.








150. We adopt the pfd threshold of RR 2566 for our domestic Big LEO systems. The ITU Radiocommunication Study Group,
Task Group 2/2 (TG 2/2), is studying the issue of relaxing the pfd limits of RR 2566, with the view to present a recommendation
at an upcoming World Radiocommunciation Conference (WRC). The Commission participates actively in the work of TG
2/2. We do not believe it would be appropriate to adopt an increase in the allowable pfd limits for MSS downlinks in the
2483.5-2500 MHz band in the United States before limits are agreed upon internationally. Indeed, even if we
adopted a relaxation of the RR 2566 pfd limits in the United States, it is questionable whether MSS systems that are
not designed for power controlled downlink transmissions would be able to take advantage of this relaxed limit worldwide.



151. We also adopt the notification requirement for grandfathered temporary-fixed licensees to MSS licensees as
proposed in the Notice and will not require these stations to relocate. No comments were filed with respect to a possible
relocation of grandfathered terrestrial stations. We therefore have no record in this proceeding on which to base
a finding that a move would serve the public interest.



5. Fixed Services above 2500 MHz (ITFS/MMDS)



152. The instructional television fixed service (ITFS) and the multi-channel multipoint distribution service
(MMDS) operate in the adjacent 2500-2690 MHz frequency band. The Committee found a potential for out-of-band
emission interference into MSS downlinks at 2483.5-2500 MHz from operations in the lowest frequency portion
of the ITFS/MMDS allocation. It indicated that because both ITFS and MMDS transmissions are similar to those of television
broadcast signals, they will cause harmful interference into MSS mobile user transceivers operating up to several
kilometers away from an ITFS or a MMDS transmitter. The Committee concluded that stricter limits on ITFS and MMDS out-of-band
emissions should be imposed, and recommended that the Commission initiate such a rulemaking.
 It acknowledged, however, that making these improvements would cost up to $30,000 per ITFS or MMDS station, and that
this cost might increase if these stations are converted from analog to digital technology.






153. We stated in the Notice that the record was insufficient to allow us to make a specific proposal in this area.
 No ITFS representative participated on the Committee nor did the Committee explore the economic and technical tradeoffs
that must be considered in developing a solution. Therefore, we requested comment on all aspects of the ITFS/MSS sharing
issue, noting that the regulations we ultimately adopt would be based on these comments. We noted that these regulations
might require ITFS operators to improve out-of-band suppression, might require MSS operators to accept additional
interference, or might require a combination of both.






154. Ellipsat and TRW contend that new out-of-band emission constraints on all ITFS/MMDS stations should be applied
immediately to allow for a transition period for these transmitters to conform to new requirements and that, according
to Section 74.936 of the Commission's Rules, the ``onus is on the ITFS operator to provide the required interference
protection to adjacent band services.''
 Further, TRW asserts the licensing of Big LEO systems or the initiation of service should not be delayed to permit ITFS
operators additional time to modify their transmitters.

155. The Wireless Cable Association International (WCAI), the National Telephone Cooperative Association (NTCA)
and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), urge that the Commission adopt rules that will provide adequate
compensation to ITFS/MMDS operators for costs associated with improving their transmitters to comply with any stricter
out-of-band emission requirements.
 WCAI also notes that broadband repeaters used by some ITFS and wireless cable system operators to relay signals into
areas that would otherwise be unreachable could pose a threat to MSS downlink operations at the upper portion of the
2483.5-2500 MHz band.







156. LQP, in contrast, does not believe that interference is a significant problem. It conducted a study to assess
the impact of ITFS/MMDS out-of-band interference to MSS downlinks in the 2483.5-2500 MHz band and concluded
that no harmful interference to MSS operations will result from ITFS/MMDS, including operations of ITFS/MMDS booster
stations, and that stricter standards on ITFS/MMDS out-of-band emissions are not necessary. LQP maintains that:
(1) MSS downlink operations below 2488.75 MHz will not experience interference from ITFS stations, (2) in urban areas,
where ITFS transmitters are prevalent, MSS dual mode transceivers can be used to switch customers to existing terrestrial
cellular radio facilities, and (3) MSS user transceivers operating in the highest channel frequency in the 2483.5-2500
MHz band within an ITFS coverage area will be able to operate satisfactorily in all but a few extreme situations by rejecting
the ITFS visual carrier and other out-of-band emissions.






157. TRW urges that the LQP study ``may have taken an overly optimistic view of the interference situation.''
 TRW also contends that MSS systems using wider CDMA channels (e.g., 5 MHz or wider) may not have the flexibility to move
to a lower frequency channel and that until further required measurements are taken and MSS system designs are finalized,
the impact of ITFS/MMDS out-of-band interference is not certain.







158. Upon review of the technical information in the record, we see no significant threat of harmful out-of-band emission
interference into MSS from ITFS/MMDS operations above 2500 MHz. Well designed CDMA receivers should mitigate the
effect of out-of-band emissions from ITFS/MMDS. Additionally, a MSS user transceiver's dynamic channel switching
capability should reduce any adverse affects from ITFS/MMDS. Further, our intra-service sharing plan allows enough
2.4 GHz band spectrum for MSS operators to avoid ITFS/MMDS out-of-band emissions in the upper portions of the allocation.
Consequently, we will not initiate a proceeding to restrict further the out-of-band emissions on ITFS/MMDS at this
time.

6. Other Terrestrial Services provided outside of the United States



159. In sixteen countries throughout the world, the 1550-1645.5 MHz band is allocated on a primary basis to the
fixed service pursuant to international Radio Regulation RR 730.
 Ground-based aeronautical radionavigation services (ARNS) are also operating throughout the world in the 1610-1626.5
MHz band pursuant to RR 732.





160. The Committee concluded that existing fixed stations operating in the 1610-1626.5 MHz band pursuant to
RR 730 and ground-based ARNS stations operating pursuant to RR 732 will not cause harmful interference to MSS operations.
It also concluded that MSS operations will not cause harmful interference to these terrestrial services. Consequently,
we proposed only to reiterate in Section 25.213(d) of our rules the general obligation that MSS stations shall not
cause interference into stations operating under RR 730. The requirement that MSS stations shall not cause interference
to, or claim protection from, stations operating pursuant to RR 732, (international Radio Regulation RR 732 encompasses
both ground-based and satellite-borne ARNS), was addressed by proposed rule section 25.213(c)(1), which was adopted
earlier in this order.






161. Constellation contends that we should not adopt proposed  25.213(d) since there are no U.S. systems operating
pursuant to RR 730.
 We disagree. We have repeatedly emphasized in this proceeding that the operation of LEO MSS systems is inherently
global. Though there are no systems operating in the United States pursuant to RR 730, it is important that we make clear
the obligations of Big LEO operators to coordinate their systems worldwide. Our rules do not elsewhere address coordination
of Big LEO systems with systems operating pursuant to RR 730.





162. We therefore adopt Section 25.213(d), as proposed, with the caveat that the coordination and notification procedures
fall under Resolution 46 (WARC-92).
 International Radio Regulations RR 731E and RR 731F require, respectively, that MSS uplink transmissions in the
1610-1626.5 MHz band and MSS downlink operations in the 1613.8-1626.5 MHz band be coordinated and notified
pursuant to Resolution 46 (WARC-92). Also according to RR 731E, MSS mobile earth terminals may not cause interference
to terrestrial stations operating in accordance with RR 730 and they may not claim interference protection from these
terrestrial stations. We note that all transmitting MSS subscriber terminals will be subject to the regulatory requirements
of those countries in which they are operating. User countries will be responsible for undertaking all necessary
coordination with neighboring countries to protect fixed or terrestrial aeronautical radionavigation operations
from MSS mobile earth terminals in those neighboring countries. Any secondary MSS downlink operations in the 1613.8-1626.5
MHz band also may not cause harmful interference into terrestrial services operating pursuant to RR 730 or 732. Nor
may a MSS mobile earth terminal which receives secondary downlink transmissions claim protection against harmful
interference from these terrestrial operation unless a particular country has agreed to provide this protection.





C. Feeder Links



163. In addition to the mobile links connecting customers with the MSS system, one or more ``gateway'' or central earth
stations are needed to complete the transmission paths, process the information being transmitted, and interconnect
the system with other communications networks or with other user transceivers. Without these ``feeder links,''
an MSS system would be useless. Because feeder links operate with gateway stations at fixed locations, the feeder
link operates in frequency bands allocated to the fixed-satellite service (FSS).

164. The six applicants requested a variety of feeder link frequency bands and bandwidths. In their applications,
Constellation, Ellipsat, and LQP each requested 66 MHz of spectrum in each transmission direction in the 5/6 GHz C-band.
Motorola and TRW and each requested approximately 100 MHz in each direction the 20/30 GHz Ka-band. AMSC requested
an unspecified amount of spectrum in the 12/14 GHz Ku-band.
 We note, however, that four of the applicants, in the Joint Proposal, indicate that their feeder link spectrum requirements
have increased significantly since they filed their original applications. As recognized in the Notice, the FAA
has opposed use of the 5 GHz portion of the C-band for space-to-Earth feeder links because of the interference potential
between the feeder links and a navigation system it is considering developing in this band.
 The 27.5-29.5 GHz portion of the Ka-band was the subject of a recently completed Negotiated Rulemaking involving
various terrestrial and satellite interests seeking to use the band. The Negotiated Rulemaking Committee was unable
to devise sharing criteria that would satisfy the feeder link requirements of more than one Big LEO applicant.







165. In the Joint Proposal, the parties nevertheless request the Commission to proceed with licensing. They state
that licenses can be issued to those applicants requesting to operate in feeder link bands that are available for assignment
at the time of licensing. They suggest that conditional licenses be awarded to applicants requesting to operate in
feeder link bands that are not available. According to the parties, the license would contain a range of feeder link
frequencies that the licensee will be able to use provided that those frequencies become available for Big LEO feeder
links and are assigned to that licensee by the Commission.

166. We agree that we should award Big LEO licenses as quickly as possible. While we are optimistic that sufficient
spectrum will be identified to support Big LEO feeder link operations, we are not certain when this will occur. It is
very likely that we will not be in a position to assign specific feeder link spectrum to any qualified applicant by our
target date for licensing in January 1995. Even if we were able to assign specific feeder link spectrum to some, however,
we would not issue unconditional grants to some and conditional grants to others as the applicants suggest. Until
we are certain that the feeder link requirements of all qualified applicants will be met, we will not foreclose our
options by assigning spectrum unconditionally.
 We will permit applicants to notify us whether they would prefer to have conditional feeder link frequencies included
in their authorizations or whether they would prefer their initial license to be silent on this issue. We envision
granting unconditional licenses, including specific feeder link frequencies, at the earlier of two events: (1)
Domestic allocations sufficient to support all Big LEO systems are available, regardless of frequency band or (2)
the completion of the upcoming World Radio Conference in the Fall of 1995 (WRC-95) assuming sufficient spectrum
is made available to satisfy these feeder link requirements. If sufficient feeder link spectrum to support all licensed
Big LEO systems is not identified by the completion of the WRC, we will need to develop a further processing mechanism
to assign feeder link bands to Big LEO licensees. In the interim, we will continue our international efforts to identity
feeder link spectrum at or below 15 GHz.

167. To this end, in preparation for the WRC, ITU-Radiocommunications Study Group Task Groups 8/3 and 4/5 are attempting
to define spectrum requirements, to identify available frequencies and to evaluate sharing possibilities with
existing and future users of the band. When these Groups complete their work in December of this year, both will prepare
Reports to the Conference Preparatory Meeting (CPM)-95. These Reports will form the basis for the CPM's Report
to WRC-95 on feeder links, which will be the technical basis for international decisions regarding feeder links
and the International Table of Allocations.
168. Since the frequencies to be used for LEO feeder links may also be used by GSO satellites, Task Group 4/5 is studying
the sharing potential between LEO and GSO satellites in all FSS allocations between 3 and 31 GHz. These studies have
indicated that certain FSS frequency bands are used more extensively by GSO FSS systems and other radio services and
that these bands are therefore less likely candidates for LEO MSS feeder links due to sharing difficulties. In bands
at or below 15 GHz, the 5000-5250 GHz and 15.4-15.7 GHz frequencies appear to be promising candidates for
reallocation for LEO feeder links.
 Task Group 4/5 has also studied the interference created by antenna beam coupling between GSO earth stations and LEO
satellite stations,
 and is exploring ways to reduce interference through a variety of coordination procedures, including geographic
exclusion zones, reverse band operation, and dedicated frequency allocations for LEO satellite feeder link use.
When these studies are completed, we will have an indication as to which bands may be recommended and, hopefully, made
available internationally for MSS feeder links at WRC-95.






169. Nevertheless, as we stated in the Notice, we will not allow the uncertain availability of bands below 15 GHz to
delay the licensing and implementation of Big LEO systems. Consequently, if sufficient spectrum is made available
at 20/30 GHz to accommodate all Big LEO licensees before bands below 15 GHz are identified, we will authorize all licensees
in the 20/30 GHz band, recognizing that several applicants will be faced with substantial system design and service
concept modifications. We will continue, however, to pursue bands at and below 15 GHz for Big LEO feeder links, and
will allow licensees to modify their licenses to request operational authority in any new bands if, and when, they
become available.

170. Motorola's proposed system includes intersatellite transmission links in the 23.18-23.38 GHz band.
This proposal falls within the intersatellite service allocation at 22.55-23.55 GHz. The Committee concluded
that Motorola's use of this band would be compatible with other operations in the band, which include operations by
NASA, the radio astronomy service, and fixed-terrestrial services. The Committee noted, however, that NASA has
indicated it would prefer that any future MSS intersatellite links operate in the 24.45-24.75 GHz band, which
recently was allocated internationally and domestically for intersatellite links. Nevertheless, the Committee,
which included a representative of NASA, proposed that we adopt a rule indicating that the 22.55-23.00 GHz,
23.00-23.55 GHz, 24.45-24.65 GHz, and 24.65-24.75 GHz frequencies are available for use by the
intersatellite service. In the Notice, we proposed to adopt the Committee's recommended rule regarding intersatellite
service frequencies, coordination with government agencies, and sharing criteria. We adopt the rule as proposed
with several minor changes and clarifications suggested by Motorola.



E. Service Rules


1. Regulatory Treatment




171. In the Notice, we asked parties to comment on our tentative conclusion that Big LEO MSS service may be offered as
a commercial mobile radio service (CMRS). We further sought comment on whether we should exercise our discretion
under Section 332(c)(5)
 to determine that Big LEO space station licensees making satellite capacity available to CMRS providers shall be
required to operate as common carriers. In the alternative, we asked parties to comment on how we should regulate Big
LEO space station operators if they are not offering CMRS. We noted that when making determinations regarding common
carriage obligations in the past, the Commission has examined individual service proposals in light of the criteria
delineated in 

National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners

 v. 

FCC, 

525 F.2d 630, 642 (D.C.Cir.), 

cert. denied,

 425 U.S. 999 (1976) (

NARUC I

).
 Referencing the two-pronged test in 

NARUC I,

 in the Notice, we requested comment regarding (1) the likelihood that space station capacity in this service will
be offered indifferently to the public, and (2) if there is no such likelihood, whether there should be a legal compulsion
for space segment providers to serve the public indifferently.
 We also asked for comment on the impact of requiring common carrier operation on the amount of foreign investment and
the international coordination of these satellites, given the requirements of Section 310(b) of the Act.










172. In a recent rulemaking, we determined the classification and regulatory treatment of providers of CMRS.
 Regarding satellite services, we held that, to the extent that a space station licensee provides a service that meets
the elements of the CMRS definition,
 we will generally regulate the provision of that service on a common carrier basis.
 We concluded, however, that so long as the service provider is not providing service directly to end users, the Commission
retains the authority under section 332(c)(5) to continue to employ its existing procedures to determine whether
the provision of space segment capacity by satellite licensees to CMRS providers will be offered on a common carrier
or private carrier basis.
 We also determined that the Commission has the discretion to extend this treatment to any entity that sells or leases
space segment capacity, to the extent that the entity is not providing CMRS directly to end users.

173. Motorola and LQP agree that the Commission must regulate Big LEO space station licensees as common carriers to
the extent that they provide CMRS to end users.
 If the licensees offer only space segment capacity to resellers, however, the parties contend that this provision
of service does not fall within the definition of CMRS, and therefore need not be made available on a common carriage
basis.
 LQP argues that in this situation, the public is assured common carriage access to the service because, at some point
a reseller will meet the definition of a CMRS provider and will be required to operate as a common carrier.








174. Big LEO space station licensees providing service directly to end users must be regulated as common carriers
if the service offering meets the definition of CMRS. We will determine whether a service offering meets the definition
based on the service description contained in the operator's application. Operators with pending applications
may amend their applications to the extent necessary to enable us to make the determination regarding the nature of
the service.






175. Pursuant to section 332(c)(5), however, if space segment capacity is offered by a Big LEO space station licensee
to a reseller or other entity who then offers CMRS to end users, we have the discretion to determine whether to require
the Big LEO licensee to offer such service on a common carriage basis, or to permit such offering to be made on a private
carriage basis. In making this determination, we have looked to the analysis enunciated in 

NARUC I.



176. Regarding the first prong of the 

NARUC I

 test, the commenters agree unanimously that nothing in the nature of the applicants' service proposals supports
a conclusion that their services will be offered indifferently to the public. Motorola points out that it and the other
applicants propose to market their space segment capacity to a small number of resellers, and to tailor these offerings
to the individual requirements of these few customers. Motorola contends that such offerings have never been viewed
as ``common carriage'' under the 

NARUC I

 standard.
 Constellation, LQP, TRW, and AirTouch concur, noting that Commission has historically viewed a service provider's
lack of intent to serve end users as an indication of non-common carriage.







177. We agree with the commenters that the record in this proceeding does not support a finding that the proposed space
segment services are likely to be offered to the public indifferently, a basic characteristic of common carrier service.
 First, in cases where licensees have not intended to serve the user public directly, the Commission has found services
to be non-common carrier in nature. In Domestic Fixed-Satellite Transponder Sales, for example, the Commission
noted the slim likelihood that non-common carrier domestic satellites would hold themselves out indifferently
to serve the user public as key to its decision to permitted qualified persons to apply for domestic satellite licenses
for non-common carrier purposes.
 More recently, the Commission, in assessing its discretion under section 332(c)(5), held that non-voice, non-geostationary
(NVNG) MSS space station licensees would be permitted to provide system access to CMRS providers on a non-common carrier
basis.
 Second, these limited offerings will be tailored to provide resellers with a wide variety of options, ranging from
position determination and data messaging services, such as those proposed by the NVNG MSS proponents, to global
telephony. Consequently, there is nothing in this record to support a finding that the services will be offered indifferently
to the public.







178. Regarding the second prong of the 

NARUC I

 test, the commenters unanimously agree that there should be no legal compulsion for space segment provides to serve
the public indifferently. AirTouch and other commenters allege that there will be significant competition in the
provision of these services to CMRS providers, both from Big LEO systems, as well as from GSO MSS and NVNG MSS systems.
 These commenters also assert that sufficient capacity will be available to assure service availability to those
that wish to receive it.
 TRW further contends that the danger of unreasonable or anticompetitive practices that common carrier regulation
is designed to prevent will not exist in the competitive environment in which Big LEO licensees will operate because
five applicants seek authority to operate these services.








179. We concur that there does not appear to be a need to impose common carrier requirements on Big LEO licensees at this
time. The Commission has found the presence of capacity and the resulting competition to be an important factor in
determining whether non-common carrier treatment should be permitted.
 As the commenters state, competitive voice mobile services already exist or are imminent. Furthermore, satellite-delivered
radiolocation and messaging services are currently provided by a Commission licensee,
 and are proposed by a number of NVNG MSS applicants.
 Moreover, under our rules adopted today, sufficient spectrum is available to support the grant of up to five of the
pending Big LEO applications.
 Thus, significant direct competition is approaching.
 We accordingly believe that sufficient competitive capacity will be available to assure the public of ample access
to these services. Therefore, we find that there is no reason to require the provision of space segment capacity to
be offered to resellers on a common carrier basis.
 Of course, if a space segment capacity provider chooses to provide service on a common carrier basis, that service
provider would be subject to regulation as a CMRS provider.
 The Commission has forborne from applying certain provisions of Title II to CMRS providers.













180. In so finding, we recognize that the commenters argued the imposition of common carrier requirements may have
an adverse effect on the development of this service. AirTouch and others argue that Section 310(b) restrictions
on foreign involvement in the affairs of domestic common carrier licensees may significantly hinder investment
by foreign entities, as well as their willingness to allow a U.S. licensee to operate within their own borders.
 The commenters allege that this investment is critical to the development of a global satellite service.
 Further, Motorola states that the submission of U.S. service providers to common carrier requirements will inhibit
their ability to compete with foreign systems that are not similarly encumbered.
 LQP concurs, noting that the space station licensees should be free to tailor their business plans to their respective
customer bases.

181. While we have already found that common 2 carrier requirements need not be imposed on space segment operators
providing service to resellers, there are several other factors that militate against the imposition of common carrier
requirements, particularly those limiting alien ownership under Section 310(b) of the Communications Act. Specifically,
these systems are inherently global, and extremely expensive. Systems may be comprised of as many as 66 satellites,
only a small number of which are visible over the United States at any one time. Because of their global nature, many
systems are raising capital in international markets.
 As such, it is reasonable to expect that investors will want to be involved with system operation, particularly if
the system will be accessed from the investor's jurisdiction. We concur that this foreign participation is likely
to improve the likelihood of receiving a grant of space station access by foreign administrations.




2. System License and License Term


182. As proposed in the Notice, and unanimously endorsed by the parties, we will follow the policy we established in
licensing NVNG MSS systems, which are also composed of constellations of technically identical LEO satellites.
Specifically, we will issue a single ``blanket'' authorization for the construction, launch, and operation of all
the satellites in an entity's constellation. This authorization will cover all construction and launches necessary
to put the complete constellation into place and to maintain it until the end of the license term, including any replacement
satellites necessitated by launch or operational failures, or by the retirement of satellites prior to the end of
the license period. All replacement satellites, however, must be technically identical to those in service and may
not cause a net increase in the number of operating satellites.
 This blanket authorization will include any in-orbit spares for which the applicant seeks authorization as part
of its system. Any such spares can be activated as required. Within ten days of activation, the licensee must certify
to the Commission that the activation did not cause it to exceed the total number of operation satellites for which
its system is authorized. Any spares or replacements that do not fall under the blanket authorization will need separate
authorizations to build, launch and operate, but their terms will expire concurrently with the blanket authorization.
As proposed in the Notice, the license will run from the date on which the first space station in the system begins transmissions
and will be valid for a ten-year period.




183. Some applicants urge us to permit replacement satellites that are ``functionally equivalent'' to those authorized
or have ``the same particulars of operation,'' to enable them to more readily include evolutions in design into newer
satellites. These are the same proposals and arguments we rejected when we adopted the blanket authorization standards
for NVNG MSS satellites.
 In the absence of arguments or evidence demonstrating that the NVNG MSS service is not analogous to the Big LEO service,
we continue to believe our interests in assuring the continued compatibility of the subject systems with other users
of the spectrum outweigh any convenience for licensees in a laxer standard. A modification application to upgrade
satellite design will not be unduly burdensome and should not impede technical innovation.




184. We also deny the request of LQP and Constellation that a licensee be permitted to put ``spare'' satellites into
service under their blanket license in order to enhance their systems. These parties would require only that there
be no overall increase in effective isotropically radiated power (e.i.r.p.), pfd, or any other sharing criterion,
and argue that this policy would allow licensees to increase path diversity, which can be a significant service improvement
for CDMA systems. We are not convinced by LQP and Constellation that other operators would not be affected by the operation
of facilities that have not been specifically analyzed and appropriately authorized. Accordingly, we affirm our
requirement that any satellites that an applicant wishes to include in its system must be specified in its initial
application or a modification application.
185. We proposed in the Notice that license terms will begin automatically with the first transmission from the first
authorized satellite, and will continue for ten years.
 All parties agree with the length of the license term. One party proposes that a license term should commence only after
commencement of actual service or within six months of launch, whichever occurs first. Apparently, the concern is
that the license term will begin to run before a licensee has launched a sufficient number of satellites with which
to begin commercial operations. This overlooks our general policy that, because all transmissions are capable of
causing interference, satellite license terms in all satellite services begin when radio transmissions commence.
We will not treat Big LEO operators differently by permitting them to engage in any transmissions, whether those transmissions
are to test the system's functioning or to provide a fully implemented commercial service, without a valid operating
license. Further, we do not believe that Big LEO operators will be unduly burdened if the license term for the system
begins to run on the date of the first transmission. If fuel is left on the satellite after its license term has expired,
we will entertain a request for special temporary authority to continue to operate if that location has not been assigned
to a new system.
 Thus, we adopt our rule as proposed.





186. We also proposed a filing window for system replacement applications identical to the one implemented in the
analogous NVNG MSS service. Specifically, we proposed that applications for the next generation Big LEO systems
must be filed no earlier than three months prior to and no later than one month after the end of the seventh year of the
existing license.
 Motorola, LQP and Constellation variously contend that some replacement applications could affect other licensees'
rights and thus potentially affected licensees should be able to file replacement applications earlier. No party
has explained, however, why our proposed rules fail to provide adequate opportunity for affected entities to respond
to proposed replacement systems, thus protecting their rights. We will therefore adopt the filing window for replacement
systems as proposed.




187. In the Notice, we stated that we intend to grant replacement applications if frequencies remain available for
use by such systems, consistent with our practice for other satellite services.
 Three applicants urge us to adopt an explicit replacement expectancy, with TRW proposing a specific provision that
would provide such an expectancy upon a licensee's consistent regulatory compliance. The Commission, however,
has historically rejected establishing an explicit replacement expectancy for space station systems.
 We have repeatedly noted circumstances such as intervening international agreements or changes in technology may
affect our determination as to whether a replacement system would serve the public interest. We assure Big LEO licensees
that given the enormous investment necessary to construct and operate a satellite system, we will consider replacement
applications in this service similar to other satellite services, that is, we will grant authority to implement a
next generation system unless extraordinary circumstances prevent us from doing so.

3. Implementation Milestones



188. As proposed in the Notice, we will adopt a set of satellite construction milestones modeled on those used in the
NVNG MSS service. All parties agree that implementation milestones to monitor the progress of system implementation
are advisable, and most parties approve of the essential elements of our proposed milestones, with certain minor
clarifications and modifications, some of which we are adopting. 

189. Each licensee will be required to adhere to a strict timetable for the system implementation. Failure to meet
this timetable will render the authorization null and void. We will generally require each licensee to begin construction
of its first two satellites within one year of the unconditional grant of its authorization, and complete construction
of those first two satellites within four years of that grant. Construction for the remaining authorized operating
satellites in the constellation must begin within three years of the initial authorization, and the entire authorized
system must be operational within six years.
 While we do not intend to deviate from these requirements for commencing construction, we may authorize a different
schedule if an applicant concretely demonstrates that its proposed system's size and/or complexity warrants additional
time because of the size or complexity of its proposed system.
 In every case, the licensee's individual milestone timetable will be set and become a condition of its authorization.
Some parties propose that we consider granting extensions of time to a licensee that has launched at least part of its
system. We will not adopt such a provision, which would suggest that we will not enforce strictly the system completion
requirement. Incomplete systems will not justify the reservation of the orbit/spectrum resource from other potential
users, and applicants should not anticipate that their authorization will require anything less than a complete
commitment of those resources necessary to execute the full global system upon which their authorization is premised.






190. We also will not impose a separate deadline for construction of in-orbit spares. We will leave the determination
of what is an appropriate timetable for building or launching in-orbit spares to each licensee. It is reasonable to
believe that if the rest of the system is implemented in a timely fashion, any in-orbit spares will also be put into place
on a timetable deemed prudent by the operator. Moreover, we do not wish to discourage applicants from proposing as
many in-orbit spares for inclusion in their initial blanket authorizations as they deem appropriate.

191. Some of the parties ask us to forego the construction commencement milestone in favor of a timetable that would
focus only on the initiation of commercial service. They primarily contend that our milestones are unfair to those
systems that could begin to provide service in stages (and, presumably, finance construction of the last satellites
from initial revenue streams). We are concerned, however, that such a timetable would prevent prompt identification
and elimination of those applicants that are not, for whatever reason, committed to building a system expeditiously
that is capable of providing global service.
 Most applicants fully support a global coverage requirement.







192. Several applicants suggest that we adopt a more detailed standard or a series of milestones to enable us to track
implementation progress more closely. LQP argues that this could result in long undetected delays in progress. We
do not believe interim milestones are necessary. The annual reporting requirements (further discussed below) and
our ability to demand additional contract and construction information should enable us to respond promptly to any
implementation failures.


193. Motorola suggests that we require a specific and significant portion of the ground segment to be constructed
on the same timetable as the space segment.
 Such a requirement, opposed by all other applicants, is undesirable. As noted, service provision in foreign countries
will be subject to a particular country's authorization. We cannot require a licensee to meet an implementation milestone
when its ability to do so is outside of its control. In any event, licensees that have launched enough satellites to
provide service should have no difficulty constructing their corresponding earth segments.

4. Reporting Requirements


194. We will also generally follow the NVNG MSS rules for annual reporting requirements for this service, as proposed
in the Notice and supported by most parties. Every licensee must provide an annual report fully describing the status
of its construction, system loading and any outages or malfunctions that have occurred during the reporting period.
These reports will be required on June 30 of each year.
195. Although several applicants argue that the information requested is either too burdensome or too proprietary
in nature for dissemination, we believe this information is needed to allow us to evaluate whether, and to what extent,
the spectrum is being used and to monitor construction progress. Licensees may request confidentiality for any portion
of their report, pursuant to  0.459 of the Commission's rules, 47 CFR 0.459. As proposed in the Notice, we will
also require that each licensee to certify to us within ten days of the date of any milestone requirement that the milestone
was met or to advise us that it was not.


5. Distress and Safety Communications


196. Although Big LEO applicants did not indicate that they plan to use their systems for extensive distress and safety
communications, we recognized in the Notice 

that because these systems have position determination capability,
 they have the potential to complement existing search and rescue (SAR) and disaster response services. Further,
although we recognize that Big LEO services cannot be used in lieu of distress beacons, such as satellite emergency
position locator transmitters or emergency indicator radio beacons, that are required to be carried by international
agreement or statute,
 Big LEO system operators have certain obligations relating to maritime distress communications under sections
321(b) and 359 of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. 321(b), 359.
 Other than these mandated requirements, we did not propose to require Big LEO systems to provide search and rescue
or disaster response communications as a general service offering. We stated, however, that we expected that any
satellite licensee that chose to offer emergency or safety communications services will coordinate its effort with
the appropriate search and rescue organizations.
 These requirements were contained in proposed rule  25.143(f).

197. Mr. Bernard Trudell (Trudell) states that in cases of emergency all MSS providers should be required to comply
with standards and call routing that will ensure the safety and well being of the public.
 Additionally, Trudell states that most MSS providers indicated that they would provide distress and safety services
in part as justification for license authority.
 Trudell concludes that the Commission should require MSS providers to address these issues. The U.S. Coast Guard
(Coast Guard) states that it will depend increasingly on 9-1-1 type services and caller ID for its SAR operations
and to prevent hoaxes. It requests, therefore, that Big LEO systems be required to provide standard location and caller
ID information.
 Several commenters expressed similar opinions stating, generally, that the Commission should require that Big
LEO systems be required to provide standardized information that would identify the calling party, give the calling
party's location and route emergency messages to an appropriate emergency organization.
 The Interagency Committee for Search and Rescue
 (ICSAR) noted all proposed Big LEO providers had stated that their systems will be available for distress and safety
communications and recommends that the Commission develop requirements to ensure that MSS systems meet public safety
needs.
 ICSAR also recommends that these issues_standardized location, caller ID and routing of emergency or distress calls_be
addressed in a separate rule making.
 The National Emergency Number Association states that the Commission should adopt a rule to require that licensees
of Big LEO systems cooperate in the provision of National Security and Emergency Preparedness (NS/EP) communications.













198. LQP states that it supports the Commission's proposed rule regarding distress and safety communications and
in principle its obligation regarding distress communications, but opposes having to provide search and rescue
or disaster response communications as a general service offering.
 LQP stated that the Commission should follow its decision reached in the Little LEO proceeding.
 Motorola states that it does not object to the proposed rule and notes that consistent with the Commission's decision
in the Little LEO proceeding, the Commission did not intend to require that Big LEO MSS licensees show specific means
of interconnection to route distress calls and did not intend for big LEO MSS stations to be used in lieu of emergency
beacons required to be carried by international agreement or statute.
 Motorola strongly opposes the imposition of a specific technical model for the 9-1-1 interconnection
and location information delivery.









199. Many of the Big LEO applicants acknowledge that they may carry distress and safety or disaster response communications.
They argue that this would be, however, no different than the capability of cellular radios today or future personal
communications services that may be used in the event of a distress or an emergency. In the Notice, we reminded licensees
of their obligations under the Communications Act regarding distress communications and noted the potential for
such systems to complement existing services, but, also recognized that Big LEO systems are not intended to replace
existing international safety services. Further, the Commission has begun to examine matters related to enhanced
9-1-1 capability including position locations in PCS, cellular and other mobile services in a recently
initiated rule making.
 We are, therefore, denying commenters requests that the Commission require caller ID, standardized position information
and automatic routing for distress and safety communications or disaster response communications. We will address
those issues in our rulemaking proceeding on enhanced 9-1-1 capability,
 and we will adopt section 25.143(f) substantially as proposed.






200. We also noted, however, that we expected any satellite licensee that chose to offer emergency or safety communications
to coordinate with appropriate SAR organizations.
 No commenters opposed this suggestion and we are adding it to the proposed rule.





201. Comsat states that because of the critical nature of distress and safety communications to the maritime community
and the extensive international effort that is underway to implement the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System
(GMDSS),
 the Commission should determine the extent to which applicants for Big LEO systems will provide distress and safety
communications and participate in the GMDSS.
 Mobile Datacom requests clarification of the proposed requirement for position determination capability for Big
LEO systems related to distress communications.
 Specifically, it requests that the Commission clarify whether Big LEO systems will be permitted to arrange for radio
determination satellite service (RDSS) from companies such as Mobile Datacom.

202. As we noted in paragraph 86 of the Notice, Big LEO systems may not be used in lieu of emergency beacons required to
be carried by statute or treaty. In response to Comsat's request, we note that Big LEO systems cannot now be used to comply
with the requirements of the GMDSS. The requirements for GMDSS equipment and the approval process are contained in
  80.1101 and 80.1103, respectively, of the Commission's Rules.
 There are, however, no restrictions prohibiting any Big LEO system from carrying distress and safety communications
on an ancillary basis. Finally, in response to Mobile Datacom's request for clarification of whether position determination
information can be supplied by an RDSS licensee, we proposed that Big LEO systems be capable of determining the position
of a user transceiver, but did not specify how licensees have to derive the position information. We believe that decision
is best left to the system provider. In conclusion, we are clarifying the language in Section 25.143(f) regarding
a licensee's responsibility to protect distress communications and to make clear that although it is the licensee's
responsibility to determine position information of transceivers that we are not prescribing how this must be accomplished.







6. Other Requirements



203. As proposed in the Notice and without objection from any interested parties, we will adopt a specific rule that
prohibits any licensee from selling a bare license for a profit.
 This provision is critical to discourage speculators and to prevent unjust enrichment of those who do not implement
their proposed systems. This provision is not intended to prevent the infusion of capital by either debt or equity
financing, but any such transaction will be monitored to ensure that it does not constitute an evasion of our anti-trafficking
provision.
 This rule, however, will not apply if auctions are implemented. It is not intended to prohibit applicants who obtain
licenses by competitive bidding from negotiating post-auction resale transactions.

<TEXT>
 

204. In the Notice, we also requested comment on whether any additional public service requirements should be imposed
on Big LEO licensees. Those favoring such a requirement were instructed to provide an analysis of the utility of Big
LEO systems to provide these services and an analysis of the existing systems used to provide these services, including
their costs. Several commenters recognize the important potential of MSS for educational and public service uses.
 The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), for example, discusses the promise of Big LEO systems to provide educational
services to those in remote areas and to allow users throughout the world to take ``electronic field trips.'' CPB urges
that to ensure public access to these services, the Commission should require licensees to make their systems available
to educators and students at preferential rates. It further argues that even if the Commission does not mandate a rate
preference in this proceeding, it should consider imposing such a requirement in a variety of other services.





205. None of the LEO applicants support a mandatory service or preferential rate requirement. Ellipsat notes that
MSS systems are unsuitable for providing the envisioned services. According to Ellipsat, Big LEO systems have inherently
low data rates and cannot supply the high bandwidth required to support the contemplated educational services without
drastically absorbing MSS capacity.
 Motorola further argues that requiring Big LEO operators to dedicate a portion of their capacity to non-revenue generating
activities would unduly constrain MSS systems and would handicap them in their ability to compete with other wireless
services and with foreign MSS providers.
 TRW and Motorola argue that none of the proponents of such a requirement have provided a detailed analysis of existing
systems and costs, as required. In the absence of this analysis, they conclude that there is no basis upon which the
Commission could impose public service requirements.









206. In light of the service hardships alleged by the system proponents, we believe that a strong demonstration of
need and feasibility is required prior to adopting specific public service requirements for Big LEO systems. We agree
with Motorola and TRW that there is not sufficient information in this record to support such requirements at this
time.

207. The National Communication Systems (NCS) believes that Big LEO licensees should be required to cooperate in
providing national security/emergency preparedness services (NS/EP) and that any discussion of technical requirements
for Big LEO systems should address survivable and endurable communications. NCS does not propose specific rules
but instead requests that the Commission consider these issues in its report and order. We note that the Commission
has chartered a federal advisory committee, the Network Reliability Council (NRC), to consider whether and to what
extent essential services, including emergency 9-1-1 service, health, safety and other emergency communications
services, are compromised during network outages.
 The NRC agreed that national security would be included within the topic of emergency services pursuant to its charter.
 We further note that on September 19, 1994 the Commission adopted a Notice of Inquiry requesting comment on the extent
to which mobile radio services, including LEO MSS, should be required to meet compatibility requirements with 9-1-1
services.
 The Commission will consider issues regarding the availability of reliable emergency services in these proceedings.







F. Mobile Earth Station Licensing



208. In the Notice, the Commission proposed a licensing procedure for the earth station segment of the satellite system.
We indicated that the ground segment will be comprised of central fixed-earth ``gateway'' stations operating in
the feeder link frequency bands, mobile user transceiver units operating in the mobile satellite frequency bands,
and tracking, telemetry and command (TT&C) earth stations operating in either the feeder link, mobile service
or space bands. We proposed to license gateway and TT&C stations as fixed-satellite earth stations under Part
25. In addition, we proposed a blanket licensing approach for the user transceivers. Under this approach, a service
vendor, which may or may not be the space station licensee, would hold the authorization and would be responsible for
a specified number of technically identical transceiver units. Blanket applications would include a demonstration
that the operation of transceivers will not interfere with other authorized users. License term would be ten years
from date of grant and requests for additional units would be treated as minor license modifications.
 In addition, we proposed that an end user be required to obtain authorization of the space station operator before
the user may transmit to that system and, that once access authority is obtained, the operations of that transceiver
would fall under the blanket earth station license of the space station operator or the vendor. Our proposed rules
would not preclude bilateral, government-to-government discussions regarding international roaming arrangements.
They would also permit roaming into the United States by users having technically compatible transceivers designed
to operate with U.S. licensed systems and once authorized to access a U.S. system, a roaming user's transceiver operations
would fall within the blanket license of the satellite operator or the service vendor. The regulatory treatment of
earth station licensees providing commercial mobile radio services would be as common carriers.







209. The comments received in response to our proposals were favorable
 and thus we will adopt the rules substantially as proposed. Constellation and Motorola, suggested several minor
clarifications to the final rules and we will adopt these suggestions.
 We will not, however, adopt at this time a complete revision of  25.115, Applications for Earth Station Authorizations,
as suggested by Motorola. If experience with these licensing procedures indicates that this rule, as it applies to
the Big LEO service, needs to be amended, we will consider doing so at a later time.

G. International Issues



1. Coordination



210. As we stated in the 

Notice, 

non-geostationary mobile satellites, in their orbits around the world, will pass over all countries. Because these
systems provide global coverage, each will require global coordination. As with all satellite services, each Big
LEO applicant and licensee will be required to provide the Commission with all information necessary for advance
publication, coordination, and notification of frequency assignments pursuant to the international Radio Regulations
and for consultation pursuant to Article 14 of the INTELSAT Agreement and Article 8 of the INMARSATQ Convention.






211. Furthermore, the ITU (WARC-92) has adopted Resolution 46 to govern the coordination of mobile satellite
systems in this frequency band. This procedure assures that worldwide coordination is accomplished in a manner that
requires both the administration proposing the system and the administration that is affected by the planned system
to cooperate in resolving coordination difficulties.
 We agree with LQP and TRW that successful coordination under Resolution 46 is not a prerequisite for licensing, launching
and operating these systems.
 We note, however, that until they successfully complete coordination they cannot cause harmful interference to
other primary services operating in these frequency bands, nor can they claim protection. We, however, will follow
the coordination procedures prescribed by the ITU and will work with the global community to promote mobile satellite
services through the development of sharing techniques and the exploration of other technical issues.
 Moreover, as we stated in our 

Notice, 

we will continue to require our licensees to meet both their international obligations and any national requirements
imposed by other licensing administrations regarding operations within their territories.
 We continue to believe that decisions relating to the implementation of Big LEO service within a country's territory
will remain within that country's jurisdiction and control.








212. In the Joint Proposal, the parties state that the Commission should establish a global band segmentation sharing
plan different than the spectrum domestic spectrum plan. Specifically, the parties state that outside of North America,
CDMA MSS licensees should be limited to operating their systems over 9.75 MHz of spectrum at 1610-1619.75 MHz
and that the TDMA MSS licensee should be limited to operating its system over 6.75 MHz of spectrum at 1619.75-1626.5
MHz. According to the Joint Proposal, all U.S. international coordination activity should be based either on the
domestic band segmentation plan we are adopting today, or, outside North America, on the proposed global plan. In
addition, the parties to the Joint Proposal request the Commission to prohibit MSS licensees from seeking or accepting
an exclusive assignment in the 1.6 GHz band that would preclude other MSS systems from providing service in any foreign
country. LQP objects to these proposals, stating that they could be construed as preempting other nations' sovereign
decisions.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941021-0-00187 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941021-0-00022 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

213. 
We will not impose a global band sharing plan on U.S. licensees at this time. The four parties to the Joint Proposal have
not given any justification for doing so, and one applicant specifically opposes the imposition of such a plan. We
have no evidence on the record before us of imminent coordination conflicts among the applicants beyond U.S. borders.
Neither is it clear at present that operating constraints designed to accommodate our domestic licensees will provide
either necessary or effective in other jurisdictions. Perhaps most importantly, we do not believe it is appropriate
for the United States to impose global band sharing restrictions, that directly impact the ability of other countries
to access these systems as they see fit, absent indications from these countries regarding their planned use of these
frequency bands. Accordingly, we will not mandate a band sharing scheme to be followed beyond U.S. borders. 



2. EC Concerns 



214. The Delegation of the European Commission (EC) is concerned that the proposals in the Notice are based purely
upon domestic U.S. interests despite the global nature of the proposed systems and services. Specifically, the EC
alleges that the Notice: (1) Fails to take into account proposed non-U.S. or future systems, their access to the U.S.
market and use of spectrum in the U.S.; (2) indicates an intention to extend Section 310 restrictions to the proposed
systems inhibiting potential European investment; (3) advances trade and industrial policy arguments underlining
the importance of the proposed systems to the U.S. economy and U.S. leadership; (4) proposes unilateral solutions
to orbit, frequency and coverage issues that are global in nature; (5) fails to discuss requirements to effect the
satisfactory application of Resolutions 46 and 70 of WARC-92; and (6) fails to address issues related to the
2 GHz band. The EC states that the regulatory approach that we proposed raises global regulatory and trade issues and
that the U.S. should not proceed with its domestic licensing process until it consults with foreign administrations.


215. We agree that the proposed systems have international ramifications. Many of these are or will be addressed in
appropriate international fora and in ITU satellite coordination activities. Others may be appropriate for bilateral
consultations of the nature sought by the EC. However, we do not agree that the U.S. domestic licensing process must
await final resolution of these issues. 

216. We find delaying the U.S. licensing process is unacceptable. Delaying our regulatory process would delay the
improved communications and economic growth that Big LEO services will create. These benefits would be developed
both for citizens of the United States and all other countries that may choose to participate in rendering these services.
Such a delay would also harm developing countries by limiting their opportunity to improve their communications
infrastructure. The uncertainty associated with delay could also adversely impact the viability of the proposed
systems in the financial markets and the ability of the applicants to attract additional investors. U.S. applicants
have already invested significant resources in research and development, satellite design, marketing and participation
in ITU meetings and conferences. Even if the United States were to delay its licensing process, it is unclear how the
EC proposes to resolve the issues it has identified, resulting in open-ended delay. Further, the EC's criticism of
our proposals is not accompanied by recommendations. Indeed, it is not clear that the EC is yet in a position to speak
authoritatively for its member countries. We do not believe that an indefinite delay in the U.S. regulatory process
under such circumstances is warranted. 
217. It is also clear that we do not need to delay the domestic licensing proceeding until international agreements
are finalized. Regardless of our domestic decisions, each administration will retain the right to license gateway
earth stations and mobile earth stations needed to provide service. In addition, U.S. licensees will be subject to
ITU recommendations and coordination procedures. Further, the United States is working with the ITU Radio Communications
sector to develop standards applicable to LEO systems. However, we seek to leave system design and service offerings
to the licensees as much as possible in order to encourage technological innovation, to promote rapid implementation
of Big LEO services and to maximize consumer choice. Therefore it is in the interest of the United States government
and U.S. system operators to seek globally acceptable standards and we will strive to do so. We disagree with the EC
that we are not taking into account projects envisaged outside the United States and future global systems that might
use the spectrum. In the Notice, we noted that all U.S. satellite systems are subject to ITU coordination procedures.
 Thus, U.S.-licensed operators are required to coordinate their proposed systems with countries whose existing
services, or whose possible future MSS systems, might be affected. Regardless of the spectrum licensing arrangement
within the United States, we would work with affected administrations to resolve any spectrum sharing or technical
issues. Further, we are not precluding access to the U.S. market. We believe, however, that subject is more appropriately
handled through bilateral discussions (as the EC contemplates) and the ITU coordination process.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941021-0-00188 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941021-0-00022 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

218. In addition, we are not seeking to extend  310 restrictions on the proposed systems with the intention of
inhibiting European investment. In fact,  310(b) restrictions will not necessarily apply to the systems because
we are not requiring them to operate on a common carrier basis.
 This policy will permit investment by European industry and other non-government interests. Some of the proposed
systems already anticipate significant non-U.S. investment and continue to seek additional such participation.
We recognize multinational participation as an integral part of developing a global system.





219. With regard to the EC's concern that we are advancing trade and industrial policy arguments by moving ahead with
the proposed systems, we note that a report prepared by PKMG Peat Marwick on behalf of the European Commission suggests
that (with regard to Europe), ``* * * the immediate

 priority is international trade and policy issues;''
 the very issues the EC accuses the United States of advancing. Notwithstanding the EC's views, the United States has
every right under established ITU procedures to move forward with licensing systems that are necessary to satisfy
domestic demand for new communication services. Other administrations have the right to decide whether these or
any other non-U.S. licensed systems will operate in their countries and whether to participate in the provision of
services. Participation in providing these MSS services will give their industries the opportunity to share in the
global economic benefits we believe these systems will bring.






220. The EC also argues that the Notice proposes unilateral solutions to orbit, frequency and coverage issues that
have global implications. Further, it contends that the Notice fails to discuss requirements necessary to effect
the application of ITU Resolution Nos. 46 and 70.


221. With regard to orbit considerations
 and the use of 1.6/2.4 GHz frequencies, we note that as a matter of course the United States engages in good faith negotiations
with respect to whatever non-U.S. systems have been filed with the ITU at the time U.S. systems are ready to begin coordination.
 Consequently, the use of the orbits and of frequencies by U.S.-licensed systems will be subject to the outcome of the
ITU coordination process. The worldwide coverage conditions proposed in the Notice
 result from our desire that these systems be capable of providing coverage to all areas of the world. This could further
U.S. participation in the global information infrastructure and potentially benefit developing countries. Again,
however, whether U.S.-licensed systems provide services outside the United States would be subject to the agreement
of and authorization by other administrations.










222. With regard to the application of Resolutions No. 46 and 70, we note that Resolution No. 46 relates to ``interim''
procedures for the coordination and notification of non-geostationary satellite networks. As an interim procedure
it is subject to further development and will likely evolve. Nevertheless, U.S.-licensed systems will be subject
to whatever coordination procedures are in effect at the time, including Resolution 46 or its successor. In the Notice
we stated explicitly that we would follow coordination procedures prescribed by the ITU, and in fact we reference
Resolution No. 46 and its applicability to Big LEO systems.
 We also note that each Big LEO applicant will be required to provide us all information necessary to advance publish,
notify and coordinate their proposed systems. Implicitly, all applicants will be required to assist us in effecting
whatever coordination procedures the ITU requires.






223. On the other hand, Resolution 70 relates to ``establishment'' of standards for low-orbit satellite systems
and has no requirements per se. It seeks to begin the process of establishing standards for low-orbit satellite systems
and invites the appropriate ITU organs to begin studies in this regard. The United States participates in these ITU
activities and will continue to do so. However, as Resolution No. 70 has not resulted in any specific ITU recommendations,
it is not possible to address ``requirements'' in a domestic licensing proceeding.


224. Finally, the EC contends that the Notice fails to address issues related to access to 2 GHz MSS bands
 and the relation between access to those bands and the bands under consideration here. First, we note that the 2 GHz
bands have not yet been allocated for MSS in the United States. Therefore, these bands will be the subject of another
proceeding. In such a proceeding, all matters relevant to the use of 2 GHz bands would be discussed. Nevertheless,
we note the increasing demand for access to MSS spectrum worldwide and the potential value of the 2 GHz bands for the
provision of MSS. We are also aware of proposals to use the 2 GHz bands for services similar and competitive to those
envisaged by the Big LEO applicants.
 The United States would like to facilitate access to these bands, as does the EC. We believe that WRC-95 and future
multi-lateral consultations would present the appropriate fora to discuss access to and use of 2 GHz MSS bands.

IV. Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis



225. 

Need for Rules and Objective. 

We have codified proposed rules that will permit Big LEO systems to be licensed. Our objectives have been to promote
efficiency and innovation in the licensing and use of the electromagnetic spectrum, to develop competitive and innovative
communications systems, and to promote effective and adaptive regulations.

226. 

Issues Raised by the Public in Response to the Initial Analysis. 

No comments were received specifically in response to the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis. We have, however,
taken into account all issues raised by the public in response to the proposed rules. In certain instances, we have
eliminated or modified our proposed rules in response to those comments.

227. 

Alternatives that would Lessen Impact. 

The minimal regulatory burden that we have imposed is necessary in order to carry out our duties under the Communications
Act and other Federal statutes. We will continue to examine these requirements in an effort to eliminate unnecessary
regulations and to minimize significant economic impact on small businesses.



V. Conclusion and Ordering Clause



228. By our action today, we are adopting regulations that will allow the licensing of competitive voice and data Big
LEO systems. This service has the potential to provide the United States public with a wide range of needed mobile voice
services and to help stimulate the domestic economy as these multi-billion dollar systems are implemented in the
United States and throughout the world.

229. Accordingly, 

It Is Ordered 

that Parts 25 and 94 of the Commission's rules are amended as specified in Appendix B, effective November 21, 1994.

230. 

It Is Further Ordered 

that the applicants will be required to file conforming amendments and all necessary fees no later than November 16,
1994 for continued consideration in this processing group.

Additional Coordination Obligation for Non-Geostationary and Geostationary Satellite Systems In Frequencies
Allocated to the Fixed-Satellite Service.



Licensees of non-geostationary satellite systems that use frequency bands allocated to the fixed-satellite service
for their feeder link operations shall coordinate their operations with licensees of geostationary fixed-satellite
service systems licensed by the Commission for operation in the same frequency bands. Licensees of geostationary
fixed-satellite service systems in the frequency bands that are licensed to non-geostationary satellite systems
for feeder link operations shall coordinate their operations with the licensees of such non-geostationary satellite

 25.279

Inter-satellite service.


(a) Any non-geostationary satellite communicating with other space stations may use frequencies in the inter-satellite
service as indicated in  2.106. This does not preclude the use of other frequencies for such purposes as provided
for in several service definitions, 

e.g.,

 FSS. The technical details of the proposed inter-satellite link shall be provided in accordance with  25.114(c).
(b) 

Operating conditions.

 In order to ensure compatible operations with authorized users in the frequency bands to be utilized for operations
in the inter-satellite service, these inter-satellite service systems must operate in accordance with the conditions
specified in this section.
(1) 

Coordination requirements with federal government users.

 (i) In frequency bands allocated for use by the inter-satellite service that are also authorized for use by agencies
of the federal government, the federal use of frequencies in the inter-satellite service frequency bands is under
the regulatory jurisdiction of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA).
(ii) The Commission will use its existing procedures to reach agreement with NTIA to achieve compatible operations
between federal government users under the jurisdiction of NTIA and inter-satellite service systems through frequency
assignment and coordination practice established by NTIA and the Interdepartment Radio Advisory Committee (IRAC).
In order to facilitate such frequency assignment and coordination, applicants shall provide the Commission with
sufficient information to evaluate electromagnetic compatibility with the federal government users of the spectrum,
and any additional information requested by the Commission. As part of the coordination process, applicants shall
show that they will not cause interference to authorized federal government users, based upon existing system information
provided by the government. The frequency assignment and coordination of the satellite system shall be completed
prior to grant of construction authorization.
(2) 

Coordination among inter-satellite service systems.

 Applicants for authority to establish inter-satellite service are encouraged to coordinate their proposed frequency
usage with existing permittees and licensees in the inter-satellite service whose facilities could be affected
by the new proposal in terms of frequency interference or restricted system capacity. All affected applicants, permittees,
and licensees, shall at the direction of the Commission, cooperate fully and make every reasonable effort to resolve
technical problems and conflicts that may inhibit effective and efficient use of the radio spectrum; however, the
permittee or licensee being coordinated with is not obligated to suggest changes or re-engineer an applicant's proposal
in cases involving conflicts.

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) and State wildlife agencies (States) are cooperatively establishing a national
Migratory Bird Harvest Information Program (Program) in which migratory game bird hunters will be required to participate
by supplying their names, addresses, and other necessary information to the hunting licensing authority of the State
in which they hunt. Hunters will be required to have evidence of current participation in the Program on their person
while hunting migratory game birds. The quality and extent of information about harvests of migratory game birds
must be improved in order to better manage these populations. Hunters' names and addresses will be used to provide
a sampling frame for a voluntary survey which will improve harvest estimates for migratory game birds.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The purpose of this final rule is to facilitate the collection of needed information about the harvest of migratory
game birds. A proposed rule was published on March 14, 1994 at 59 FR 11838. This final rule revises the migratory bird
hunting regulations to require hunters, as a condition for hunting migratory game birds, to annually provide their
names, addresses, and other necessary information to the licensing authority of the State in which they hunt. This
information will provide a sampling frame for the national Migratory Bird Harvest Survey that the Service will conduct
annually. 



The Service and States are currently implementing this Program over a 5-year period, starting with the 1994-95
hunting season. During this implementation, the requirement to participate in the Program will not apply on Federal
Indian Reservations or to tribal members hunting on ceded lands. The participating States will provide the names,
addresses, and other necessary information obtained from licensed hunters. During the implementation phase the
Service will work with the States to investigate and develop alternative methods for obtaining information about
unlicensed hunters to facilitate their inclusion in the sample frame upon full implementation. The Program will
be evaluated to determine the adequacy and timeliness of the sample and the time burden, cost, and other impacts on
hunters, State license agents, States, and the Service. 

The names, addresses, and other information for an adequate sample of hunters are needed in time for hunting record
forms to be distributed to selected hunters before they forget the details of their hunts. Because of this fundamental
need, States have only a short time to provide hunter names and addresses. The approaches used by different States
will be compared. Minimum survey standards will be developed during the next 2 years to ensure the quality of survey
data. As each new State is phased into the Program, an agreement will be developed with each State in order to identify
and resolve specific reporting or data-capture problems. This will ensure that each State will be providing reliable
survey data and that no material biases are incorporated into the system. 

A Program validation (

e.g.,

 ``Migratory Bird Harvest Information Program Participant'') will be printed on the annual State hunting license
or supplementary permit for those hunters who participate in the Program. The State may charge these hunters a small
handling fee to compensate agents and to cover the State's administrative costs associated with implementing the
Program. 

To reduce survey costs and to identify hunters who hunt less commonly hunted species, migratory bird hunters will
be asked the following questions: 

1. Will you hunt migratory game birds during [season]? [This screening question is needed only if a State asks all hunters
to provide their names, addresses, and other information needed by the Program]. 

2. Please check the birds you hunted last season in the United States. [This list need only include migratory birds
that are hunted in the State.]

Question 

#

3 will identify which success category (

e.g.,

 none, 1-10, etc.) a hunter was in during the previous year and will allow stratification of the sample. A stratified
sample (multiplying the number of hunters in each category by the average seasonal bag per hunter in that category
and then adding the results for each category) will provide a better estimate of total harvest and will not require
as large a sample size as a standard sample (multiplying the total number of hunters by the average seasonal bag per
hunter).

To protect hunters' privacy, it is the policy of the Service to use the names and addresses only for conducting hunter
surveys and for no other purpose. All records of hunters' names and addresses will be deleted after the surveys, and
no permanent record of names and addresses will be maintained by the Service. State uses of these names and addresses
will be governed by State laws. 

The provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3) provides for a minimum of 30 days for a rule to become effective unless an agency,
for good cause, has reason to make it sooner. The Service and the States are currently implementing this Program over
a five year period at the request of the International Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies. This rule will add
Maryland to the list of States already participating. Maryland has implemented the requirements of this rule under
State authority effective September 1. Therefore, the Service finds good cause to make this rule effective upon publication.




Review of Comments and the Service's Response 



Comments on the proposed rule were received from 12 States. None of the comments questioned the need for the Program
or for improved migratory bird harvest estimates; almost all expressed support for the proposed changes to the Program.
Two States requested delays in their implementation date and four States requested advances in theirs. The Program
was supported by the States of Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri,
Oklahoma, Texas and Vermont. 



1. Impact of Procedures on State Wildlife Agencies 





Comments: 

Arkansas pointed out that, overall, the Program will add burdens to their Agency, license vendors, and sportsmen.
They recommended reducing the hunter questions. 



Service Response: 

Changes as described in the Proposed Rule will reduce the number of questions. Enrolling hunters in the State of hunting
eliminates questions concerning species not found in that State. For example, band-tailed pigeons are restricted
to western States and this question will appear only in those States. This and some combining of species, such as duck/coot,
will reduce the number of questions to roughly half of the original list. 



2. Service Financial Support for the Program 





Comment: 

Louisiana stated that the amount of financial support the Service will provide States during the Implementation
Phase appears to be declining. They requested firm and substantial funding support from the Service. 



Service Response: 

This Program has always been viewed in the context of a partnership with Federal and State funds being used to implement
the effort. The Service's initial estimate of financial support for the Program was contingent upon approval of two
funding sources. One was from Federal Aid Administrative Funds at $500,000 annually for each of the first three years
of the implementation phase. The second was from the Service's annual appropriation which, in turn, was contingent
upon Congressional approval of the President's FY 1994 budget request of $750,000. The Administrative Funds were
approved in full, while the Congressional appropriation was reduced to $500,000. The present schedule of payment
for names and addresses is 30$ per hunter the first 2 years in the Program and 10$ per hunter thereafter.




3. Implementation Phase_Schedule of State Participation 





Comments: 

Six States requested changes in their scheduled entry into the Program. Four requested to be advanced and two to be
delayed. Maine requested to be moved ahead from 1998 to 1996. With the financial assistance provided by the Service,
Maine will be able to adopt an automated system of issuing licenses. Oklahoma requested to move ahead from 1996 to 1995.
A change in State licensing procedures will complement this agenda change. Vermont would like to advance to 1996 from
their scheduled entry in 1998. Oregon has implemented a basic system of electronic license sale and is prepared to
enter the program in 1995. Texas requested to move back from 1994 to 1995. Texas is working on several license-system
changes and would like to implement these changes and the Harvest Information Program at the same time. Georgia also
requested to move back from 1995 to 1996. Georgia is working toward a State program to improve their hunting and fishing
license procedures and would like to include implementation of the Harvest Information Program at the same time.

Service Response: 

The Service has consistently encouraged States to advance in the implementation schedule, while discouraging any
delays. The Service is encouraged by the advances proposed by Maine, Oklahoma, Oregon, and Vermont, and will accommodate
these changes in the schedule. The proposed delays by Texas and Georgia are viewed as setbacks to the Program. Both
proposals, however, are premised on improved license procedures that will better accommodate the Harvest Information
Program. The Service has made it clear that no schedule changes will be made that cause financial disadvantage to other
States entering the Program. Therefore, a one-year delay will be granted for these States with the understanding
that a portion of their original ``start-up'' monies will be used to assist those States that are now advancing in the
schedule. The long-term ramification of delays in State Program entry are being reviewed with the International
Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies. 


4. Limiting the Program Requirements to Licensed Hunters 




Comments: 

Seven States specifically regarded this as a positive change that would aid them in the implementation. Three implied
support by their broad agreement to changes. Two States had reservations. Missouri expressed concern that with each
exemption the quality of the harvest estimate is reduced. They urged rigorous survey standards for exempt categories
of hunters. Maryland strongly encouraged the Service to require that all migratory bird hunters participate in the
Program. Their concern is that serious bias may be introduced and that Program credibility may, as a consequence,
be in question. 


Service Response: 

In general the Service agrees that under a State licensing (permitting) system, exempt hunters must be enrolled by
an alternate survey procedure. The Service acknowledges that the migratory bird harvest from all hunters is desirable
and that unlicensed hunter harvest must be addressed. The Service proposes to do this with individual States as they
enter the Program. The Program changes that have evolved since its original design have replaced a Federal Permit
with a State Permit. This change places many States in the incongruous role of requiring an action that under State
law is specifically exempt from a license requirement (

e.g.,

 hunters under 16 years of age). This conflict is better addressed with individual States. Some States have the authority
to require non-licensed hunters to acquire permits, but many do not. In response to the request for information on
unlicensed hunters, only Maine responded. In Maine, only hunters who hunt exclusively on their own land are exempt
from licensing. They estimate this to be 0.3 percent of the hunter population (600 individuals) and that their hunting
is largely for deer. Migratory bird hunter harvest would be ``negligible''. 


5. Hunters Will Now Acquire Permits for Each State in Which They Hunt 




Comments: 

All State comments were supportive of this change. They varied from ``support'' to ``a significant improvement''.



Service Response: 

Program changes that evolved into issuance of a State permit negated the notion of a Federal permit that would be valid
in all States. This change will also simplify questions by restricting them to the species available in the State of
hunting and generally will be more cost-effective for the States.

NEPA Consideration 


The establishment of this Harvest Information Program and options have been considered in the ``Environmental Assessment:
Migratory Bird Harvest Information Program.'' Copies of this document are available from the Service at the address
indicated under the caption 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. 


Regulatory Flexibility Act, Executive Order 12866, and the 
Paperwork Reduction Act 


This rule was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review under Executive Order 12866. This rule will not
have a significant effect on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C.
601 

et seq

. 
This rule may eventually affect about 5 million migratory game bird hunters when it is fully implemented. It will require
migratory game bird hunters to supply their names, addresses, and other necessary information to the State licensing
authority in the State hunted in order that they can be sampled for a voluntary national harvest survey. Hunters will
be required to have evidence of current participation in the Program on their person while hunting migratory game
birds. 
The States may require a small handling fee to compensate their hunting-license vendors and to cover their administrative
costs. Many of the State hunting-license vendors are small entities, but this rule should not economically impact
those vendors. Only migratory game bird hunters (individuals) would be required to provide this information, so
this rule should not adversely affect small entities. 
The collection of information contained in this rule has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under

44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

 and assigned clearance number 1018-0015. The information is required from hunters to obtain the benefit of
hunting migratory game birds. 
The public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 0.015 hours per response,
including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the
data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Comments regarding the burden estimate
or any other aspect of these reporting requirements should be directed to the Service Information Collection Clearance
Officer, MS-224 ARLSQ, Fish and Wildlife Service, Washington, DC 20240, or the Office of Management and Budget,
Paperwork Reduction Project 1018-0015, Washington, DC 20503. 


Executive Order (EO) 12612_Federalism 


This regulation does not have significant federalism effects as provided in EO 12612. Due to the migratory nature
of certain species of birds, the Federal Government has been given responsibility over these species by the Migratory
Bird Treaty Act of 1918. State harvest surveys presently cannot provide adequate national estimates of migratory
game bird harvests for the following reasons: Some States do not now conduct annual harvest surveys or maintain accessible
lists of hunter names and addresses. Comparable information is not available from all States because States have
different licensing laws regulating who must buy a hunting license and different survey procedures. The harvest
of those hunters who can legally hunt without an annual State license is excluded from State estimates. Hunters might
buy more than one type of license in a single State and might buy licenses from more than one State, introducing duplication
problems. Currently, many State license lists are not available in time to permit distribution of hunter records
early in the hunting season. Budget constraints often prevent States from conducting harvest surveys during certain
years or could cause some States to eliminate them completely. 
This rule does not have a substantial direct effect on fiscal capacity, change the roles or responsibilities of Federal
or State Governments, or intrude on State policy or administration. Therefore, this regulation does not have significant
federalism effects and do not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism
Assessment. In fact, the Service would cooperate with States in providing surveys to meet special management needs,
and increased cooperation between Federal and State Agencies would reduce duplication of survey efforts. 


Executive Order 12630_Taking of Individual Property Rights 


Executive Order 12630 discussed guidelines for the taking of individual property rights. This rule, authorized
by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, does not affect any constitutionally-protected property rights. This rule will
not result in the physical occupancy of property, the physical invasion of property, or the regulatory taking of any
property. 


Authorship 


The primary author of this proposed rule is Robert L. Jessen, working under the direction of Paul R. Schmidt, Chief,
Office of Migratory Bird Management.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In this document, the Bureau of Prisons is amending its rule on Chemical Abuse Programs by renaming it as Drug Abuse
Treatment Programs, by expanding programming available to inmates, and by requiring participation from certain
inmates. An inmate who has been recommended for drug programming during incarceration by the sentencing judge, or
whose presentence investigation contains evidence that alcohol or other drug use contributed to the commission
of the instant offense, or for whom alcohol or drug abuse was a reason for violation of either supervised release, parole
or community corrections center placement will be required to participate in a drug abuse education course. Further
program opportunities are presented through voluntary participation in residential and non-residential drug
abuse treatment programs and through transitional services. This amendment also makes conforming changes with
respect to inmate financial responsibility requirements. Provisions on eligibility criteria for residential
and non-residential drug treatment programs are being adopted on an interim basis. This amendment is intended to
fulfill statutory requirements to make available to inmates appropriate substance abuse treatment.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Bureau of Prisons is amending its regulations on Chemical Abuse Programs. A proposed rule on this subject was published
in the 

Federal Register

 on January 7, 1994 (59 FR 1240 

et seq

.). This proposed rule renamed such programming as Drug Abuse Treatment Programs and distinguished between mandatory
and voluntary requirements for inmate participation. The comment period closed on March 8, 1994. The Bureau received
comment from only one respondent. A summary of comment and agency response follows. 



The commenter stated that the statutory provision mandating the Bureau of Prisons to provide substance abuse treatment
programs is directly opposed to mandating participation in treatment programs when imposing the original sentence.
The commenter cited 18 U.S.C. 3582(a) and 28 U.S.C. 994(k) as being ``inappropriately immiscible'' to the provisions
proposed in 28 CFR 550.52(a) (1) and (3). In response, the Bureau notes that there is no statutory conflict. The provisions
in 18 U.S.C. 3582(a) and 28 U.S.C. 994(k) relate to imposition of sentence by the court under the guidelines of the United
States Sentencing Commission. These are intended to ensure that the various aspects relating to the offense are considered
in determining the relevance of imprisonment, and if relevant, the length of such imprisonment. It is only after a
term of imprisonment is imposed that 18 U.S.C. 3621 becomes applicable. The Bureau's authority under 18 U.S.C. 3621(b)
to make available appropriate substance abuse treatment for each inmate committed to its custody has been implemented
separately through this very rulemaking. Use by the Bureau of the sentencing court's recommendation or of information
in the Presentence Investigation has no direct impact on the prior decision taken by the sentencing court. 

The commenter also questioned the operation of the program at a specific Bureau institution, stating that the proposals
were being implemented with severe sanctions for an inmate who does not participate voluntarily. The administrative
remedy procedure is the appropriate means for inmates to voice their concerns on such aspects of their imprisonment.
A review of inmate remedy requests for calendar year 1993 at the cited institution indicates only one request filed
under the subject matter of substance abuse programs. The ``severe sanctions'' apparently refer to pay and community
status restrictions (i.e., being held to the lowest pay grade and loss of eligibility for furlough consideration
or community corrections center placement) imposed on an inmate who had declined to complete drug abuse education
requirements. That complaint ultimately was mooted upon the inmate's completion of the forty hour course. 

In issuing the final rule, the Bureau has further reorganized the regulations for the sake of clarity. Additional
provisions have been added which are either administrative in nature or are intended to allow for increased voluntary
participation in drug abuse treatment programming. Specific provisions as to eligibility criteria codified in
new   550.55(a) and 550.57(a) are being adopted on an interim basis with the opportunity for further comment.
A discussion of this further reorganization and additions follows. 

The statement of purpose and scope  550.50 is adopted as final without change. The provisions in proposed  550.51
have been reorganized and revised as new   550.51 through 550.53. As revised, new  550.51 defines
the role of the Drug Abuse Treatment Coordinator and the Drug Abuse Treatment Specialist. Provisions of proposed
 550.51 which covered requirements on the Admission and Orientation program and screening and referral are
now separately stated in new   550.52 and 550.53. New  550.52 contains the provisions pertinent
to the Admission and Orientation program. These provisions have been reworded, but there is no change in the intent.
New  550.53 contains the provisions pertinent to screening and referral. As revised, this section now also
provides for a record review by the case manager.

This section has been reorganized and revised for the sake of clarity. As revised, paragraph (a)(2) of this section
now also specifies that, with respect to voluntary participants, the Bureau gives priority consideration to those
inmates whose participation has been recommended by unit or treatment staff. This change is necessary to help ensure
the efficient program allocation of Bureau resources. Paragraph (b) of the revised section now allows for inmates
to receive work assignment promotions during their participation in or while on a ``waiting list'' for the drug abuse
education course. 

The provisions in proposed  550.53 on institution residential and nonresidential programs have been revised
and separately stated in new   550.55 through 550.57. New  550.55 covers the voluntary institution
residential drug abuse treatment program. As revised, this section no longer restricts application to those inmates
who have been recommended by unit and/or drug treatment staff. As a consequence of this expansion of programming opportunity,
paragraph (a) of new  550.55 now contains eligibility criteria for program participation. The eligibility
criteria is intended to allow the Bureau to allocate its resources in an efficient manner. The Bureau is adopting this
provision on an interim basis, and will accept comments for the purpose of reissuance as a final regulation. New  550.56
contains the provisions in proposed  550.53(c) on the use of incentives. New  550.57 covers the voluntary
non-residential drug treatment program. As revised, programming opportunities appropriate for the drug abuse
treatment needs of inmates who have more than thirty-six months left to serve have been expanded and consequent eligibility
criteria in  550.57(a) have been adopted on an interim basis. 

The provisions for transitional services in proposed  550.54 have been adopted as final without change in new
 550.58. 

Conforming changes to the Bureau's provisions on inmate financial responsibility (28 CFR 545.11) have been adopted
as final without change. Other proposed conforming changes to the provisions on institution work and performance
pay (28 CFR 545.23) will be addressed in a separate final rule document. 

Interested persons may participate in this rulemaking by submitting data, views, or arguments in writing to the Bureau
of Prisons, 320 First Street, NW., HOLC Room 754, Washington, DC 20534. Comments received on the interim rule provisions
during the comment period will be considered before final action is taken. Comments received on the final rule provisions
will be considered but will receive no formal response in the 

Federal Register

. All comments received remain on file for public inspection at the above address. 

The Bureau of Prisons has determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action for the purpose of E.O. 12866,
and accordingly this rule was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. After review of the law and regulations,
the Director, Bureau of Prisons has certified that this rule, for the purpose of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub.
L. 96-354), does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.
