II. Description of the Proposed Amendment



The Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Reclamation (Ohio), submitted proposed Program Amendment
Number 69 by letter dated September 22,1 994 (Administrative Record No. OH-2059). In this amendment, Ohio proposes
to revise two rules at Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) sections 1501:13-1-03 and 13-7-05 to
make the Ohio program as effective as the corresponding Federal regulations concerning financial interest statements
and yield data for pasture or grazing land. The substantive rule revisions proposed by Ohio in this amendment are briefly
described below.



A. Financial Interest Statements (OAC section 1501:13-1-03)




1. Definition of ``Employee''



Ohio is revising paragraph (D)(2) to provide that members of the Ohio Board on Unreclaimed Strip Mined Lands are included
under this definition. Members of the Ohio Reclamation Board of Review and the board's hearing officers are not included
under this definition.



2. Hearing Officers of the Ohio Reclamation Board of Review



Ohio is revising paragraphs (F)(1), (G)(1), and (H) to require that hearing officers of the Ohio Reclamation Board
of Review must also file annual financial interest statements.



3. Standard Form for Annual Financial Interest Statements



Ohio is revising paragraph (I)(1) to specify that employees shall use Form OSM-23 to file their annual financial
interest statements.



4. Appeal of Remedial Actions



Ohio is revising paragraph (L)(1) to specify that nothing in OAC section 1501:13-1-03 modifies any right
of appeal that any employee may have under State law of a decision by the Chief of the Division of Reclamation, Ohio Department
of Natural Resources, on an employee's appeal of remedial action for prohibited financial interests. Ohio is also
revising paragraphs (L) (2) and (3) to provide that members of the Ohio Reclamation Board of Review and the board's
hearing officers may request advisory opinions from the Director of the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and
Enforcement on issues pertaining to an apparent prohibited financial interest.

on acreage reclaimed as pasture or grazing land (as well as acreage reclaimed to cropland or prime farmland must include
yield data.



III. Public Comment Procedures



In accordance with the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17(h), OSM is now seeking comment on whether the proposed amendment
satisfies the applicable program approval criteria of 30 CFR 732.15. If the amendment is deemed adequate, it will
become part of the Ohio program.



Written Comments



Written comments should be specific, pertain only to the issues proposed in this rulemaking, and include explanations
in support of the commenter's recommendations. Comments received after the time indicated under 

DATES

 or at locations other than the Columbus Field Office will not necessarily be considered in the final rulemaking or
included in the Administrative Record.



Public Hearing



Persons wishing to speak at the public hearing should contact the person listed under 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT

 by 4 p.m., E.D.T., on November 7, 1994. The location and time of the hearing will be arranged with those persons requesting
the hearing. If no one requests an opportunity to comment at a public hearing, the hearing will not be held.

Filing of a written statement at the time of the hearing is requested as it will greatly assist the transcriber. Submission
of written statements in advance of the hearing will allow OSM officials to prepare adequate responses and appropriate
questions.

The public hearing will continue on the specified date until all persons scheduled to speak have been heard. Persons
in the audience who have not been scheduled to speak and who wish to do so will be heard following those who have been scheduled.
The hearing will end after all persons scheduled to speak and persons present in the audience who wish to speak have
been heard.



Public Meeting



If only one person requests an opportunity to comment at a hearing, a public meeting, rather than a public hearing,
may be held. Persons wishing to meet with OSM representatives to discuss the proposed amendment may request a meeting
by contacting the person listed under 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT.

 All such meeting shall be open to the public and, if possible, notices of meetings will be posted at the locations listed
under 

ADDRESSES.

 A written summary of each public meeting will be made a part of the Administrative Record.



IV. Procedural Determinations



Executive Order No. 12866



This rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory
Planning and Review).



Executive Order 12778



The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Court Justice
Reform) and has determined that, to the extent allowed by law, this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections
(a) and (b) of that section. However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory
programs and program amendments since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM.
Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1253 and 1255) and 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions
on proposed State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the requirements
of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.



National Environmental Policy Act



No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA [30 U.S.C. 1292(d)] provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C).

Paperwork Reduction Act



This rule does not contain information collection requirements which require approval by the Office of Management
and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3507 

et seq.



Regulatory Flexibility Act



The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.

). The submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon corresponding Federal regulations for which an economic
analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic effect
upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements previously
promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule would have
a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions in the analyses for the corresponding
Federal regulations.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule; public comment period and opportunity for public hearing on proposed amendment.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

OSM is announcing receipt of a proposed amendment to the Utah regulatory program (hereinafter, the ``Utah program'')
under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). The proposed amendment consists of revisions
to the Utah rules pertaining to required liability insurance for coal mining operations. The amendment is intended
to allow coal mining operators to provide a certain amount of their liability insurance through self-insurance.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 





I. Background on the Utah Program



On January 21, 1981, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Utah program. General background information
on the Utah program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and the conditions of approval
of the Utah program can be found in the January 21, 1981, 

Federal Register

 (46 FR 5899). Subsequent actions concerning Utah's program and program amendments can be found at 30 CFR 944.15, 944.16,
and 944.30.



II. Proposed Amendment



By letter dated October 4, 1994, Utah submitted a proposed amendment to its program pursuant to SMCRA (administrative
record No. UT-979). Utah submitted the proposed amendment at its own initiative with the intention of allowing
companies in the coal industry, if they so desire, to provide a certain amount of their liability insurance through
self-insurance. The provision of the Utah Coal Mining Rules that Utah proposes to revise is Utah Administrative Rule
(Utah Admin. R.) 645-301-890.400, Terms and Conditions for Liability Insurance.

Specifically, Utah proposed to revise Utah Admin. R. 645-301-890.400 by cross-referencing a Utah self-insurance
statutory provision at Utah Code Annotated (U.C.A.) 63-30-28. This provision authorizes governmental
entities to purchase liability or liability self-insurance, and to establish trust accounts for self-insurance.
Utah's proposed revision at Utah Admin. R. 645-301-890.400 reads as follows, with the italicized language
representing wording that is being added to the existing rule, and the capitalized language in brackets representing
wording that is being deleted.




890.400 The Division [of Oil, Gas and Mining] may accept from the applicant, in lieu of a certificate for a public
liability insurance policy, satisfactory evidence from the applicant that it satisfies applicable state self-insurance
requirements 

Section 63-30-28, U.C.A.

 [Approved as part of the state program] and the requirements of R645-301-890.100 through R645-301-890.300.



III. Public Comment Procedures



In accordance with the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17(h), OSM is seeking comments on whether the proposed amendment satisfies
the applicable program approval criteria of 30 CFR 732.15. If the amendment is deemed adequate, it will become part
of the Utah program.



1. Written Comments



Written comments should be specific, pertain only to the issues proposed in this rulemaking, and include explanations
in support of the commenter's recommendations. Comments received after the time indicated under 

DATES

 or at locations other than the Albuquerque Field Office will not necessarily be considered in the final rulemaking
or included in the administrative record.



2. Public Hearing



Persons wishing to testify at the public hearing should contact the person listed under 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT

 by 4:00 p.m., m.d.t., November 7, 1994. The location and time of the hearing will be arranged with those persons requesting
the hearing. If no one requests an opportunity to testify at the public hearing, the hearing will not be held.

Filing of a written statement at the time of the hearing is requested as it will greatly assist the transcriber. Submission
of written statements in advance of the hearing will allow OSM officials to prepare adequate responses and appropriate
questions.

The public hearing will continue on the specified date until all persons scheduled to testify have been heard. Persons
in the audience who have not been scheduled to testify, and who wish to do so, will be heard following those who have been
scheduled. The hearing will end after all persons scheduled to testify and persons present in the audience who wish
to testify have been heard.



3. Public Meeting



If only one person requests an opportunity to testify at a hearing, a public meeting, rather than a public hearing,
may be held. Persons wishing to meet with OSM representatives to discuss the proposed amendment may request a meeting
by contacting the person listed under 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT

. All such meetings will be open to the public and, if possible, notices of meetings will be posted at the locations listed

Planning and Review).



2. Executive Order 12778



The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments
since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA
(30 U.S.C. 1253 and 12550) and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed
State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.



3. National Environmental Policy Act



No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA 930 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).



4. Paperwork Reduction Act



This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by OMB under the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507

).



5. Regulatory Flexibility Act



The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

). The State submittal that is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an economic
analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic effect
upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements previously
promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule would have
a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart Federal regulations.

Regulations Governing FedSelect Checks 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Treasury, Fiscal, Financial Management Service. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This rulemaking proposes new regulatory text for 31 CFR Part 247 to govern the use of FedSelect checks, a new payment
instrument for use by Federal agencies in paying Federal obligations. This rulemaking sets forth procedural instructions
for using FedSelect checks, and defines the rights and liabilities of the Federal Government, Federal Reserve Banks,
and depositary institutions in connection with FedSelect checks. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Financial Management Service, U.S. Department of the Treasury (FMS), currently offers Federal agencies two
payment mechanisms for paying Federal obligations. A Federal agency may either request the issuance of a Treasury
check or the initiation of an electronic funds transfer. However, the FMS will soon be making available to Federal
agencies a third payment option called FedSelect, a new check instrument to be used with imprest fund transactions
and other ``on-demand'' payment needs. The preferred method of payment is electronic. However, FedSelect is the
FMS's response to customer needs for a new paper instrument and is to be used only when checks are deemed appropriate
and consistent with FMS policy. 



Federal agencies that use the new payment instrument will be given a supply of FedSelect checks, on Federal Reserve
Bank check stock, which are drawn on a Federal Reserve Bank in its banking capacity, rather than the United States Treasury.
Federal agencies will be able to issue the FedSelect checks on site in payment for United States obligations. 

These proposed regulations set forth procedural instructions for using FedSelect checks, and define the rights,
responsibilities, and liabilities of the Federal Government, Federal Reserve Banks, and financial institutions
in connection with FedSelect checks. These rules for FedSelect checks differ from those applying to Treasury checks
in three important ways. First, FedSelect checks will be negotiable for 90 or 120 days, whereas Treasury checks are
payable for 1 year after issuance. Second, Federal agencies can at their own discretion stop payment on a FedSelect
check. Stop payment orders generally are not available on Treasury checks. Third, the regulations governing Treasury
checks are inapplicable to FedSelect checks, unless otherwise provided by statute or this proposed rule. In all matters
not addressed by these proposed regulations, FedSelect checks will be governed by the Uniform Commercial Code, as
drafted by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, and by Regulation J (12 CFR Part 210) and
Regulation CC (12 CFR Part 229) of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve.

FMS invites comments regarding the possibility of referencing within either this regulation or the Treasury Financial
Manual a standard dollar limit of $10,000, with $25,000 exceptions by permission of FMS, above which a FedSelect check
could not be issued by an agency. This limit is being considered to be consistent with FMS's electronic payment policies
as contained within 31 CFR Part 206 and to minimize losses to agencies arising from negligence, forgeries, counterfeiting,
and alterations. FMS requests that comments on this matter include any foreseen (positive or negative) effects of
limiting the dollar amount of FedSelect checks, including whether a dollar limit would encourage an agency to participate
in the FedSelect check program. 


Rulemaking Analysis 



It has been determined that this regulation is not a significant regulatory action as defined in E.O. 12866. Therefore,
a regulatory assessment is not required. It is hereby certified that this regulation will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. A regulatory flexibility analysis is not required. It is anticipated
that FedSelect checks will not negatively affect a substantial number of small entities because of the relatively
low volume of checks to be issued in comparison to the use of other payment mechanisms by Federal agencies. 


Notice and Comment 



Public comment is solicited on all aspects of this proposed rule. The FMS will consider all comments made on the substance
of this proposed rule, but does not intend to hold hearings on it. 


List of Subjects in 31 CFR Part 247

Applicability. 



The regulations in this Part prescribe the rights and liabilities of the United States, the Federal Reserve Banks,
depositary institutions, and others on FedSelect checks. These regulations apply to FedSelect checks issued on
behalf of the United States for payments in connection with United States obligations. FedSelect checks are issued
by Federal agencies on Federal Reserve Bank check stock. FedSelect checks are drawn on the payor Federal Reserve Bank
in its banking capacity. The drawer of a FedSelect check is the United States; the drawee is a Federal Reserve Bank.
Therefore, a FedSelect check shall not be deemed to be drawn on the United States nor shall the Federal Reserve Bank
be deemed its drawer.

is the United States, the requirements and procedures for disbursing and certifying activities under 31 U.S.C. 3321
apply to agency accountable officers issuing FedSelect checks. 
(b) FedSelect checks shall be drawn by an individual who is duly authorized by the agency, and shall be certified by
a certifying officer. 
(c) When an agency issues a FedSelect check in payment of a United States obligation, such agency certifies the issuance
of the payment contemporaneous to the issuance of the FedSelect check. Therefore, where FedSelect checks are issued
through an automated system, certification occurs through the on-line data transfer between the agency issuing
a FedSelect check and the FMS. 
(d) Agencies shall ensure that there are proper internal controls over the issuance of FedSelect checks, including
payment authorization, check issuance, and reconciliations. Payment authorization is the process by which vouchers
or invoices are approved for payment by individuals designated to do so by the head of the agency, or their designees.
Check issuance is the physical issuance of a FedSelect check in payment of a duly approved voucher or invoice. Reconciliation
is the process by which amounts authorized for payment are verified against amounts of checks issued. 


 247.8 

Presentment. 


(a) Presentment of FedSelect checks must be made to the payor Reserve Bank. FedSelect checks must be presented through
normal banking channels. 
(b) FedSelect checks may have different periods of payability depending on the agencies' requirements. The standard
period of payability will be 90 days. However, at the request of an agency to the FMS, the payability of a FedSelect check
may be increased to 120 days. 
(c) FedSelect checks shall bear a pre-printed legend, ``Void After 90 Days,'' or ``Void After 120 Days.'' 
(d) When an outstanding FedSelect check reaches its stale-date, a cancellation indicator will be placed against
it and its status reflected as canceled due to stale-dating. A payor Reserve Bank will refuse to pay a FedSelect check
presented to the bank of first presentment more than the number of days stated on the FedSelect check. A FedSelect check
not timely presented should be surrendered by the holder to the payor Reserve Bank as a non-cash item. The issuance
of another FedSelect check to replace a lost, stolen, or destroyed FedSelect check must be made in accordance with
 247.10.

 247.9 

Presentment warranties. 



(a) Presenting banks and indorsers of the FedSelect check are deemed to guarantee that all prior indorsements are
genuine, whether or not an express guaranty is placed on the FedSelect check. When the first indorsement has been made
by one other than the payee personally, the presenting bank and the indorsers are deemed to guarantee, in addition
to other warranties, that the person who so indorsed had unqualified capacity and authority to indorse the check on
behalf of the payee. 

(b) A presenting bank makes the warranties required of a sender under Subpart A of 12 CFR part 210 (Regulation J). This
section does not limit any warranty by a presenter or other party arising under State law. Neither the Department,
an agency nor a Reserve Bank is barred from recovering on a breach of warranty solely because: 

(1) The negligence of the Department, an agency or of a Reserve Bank, as fiscal agent, had contributed to a fraudulent
indorsement or material alteration; 

(2) The Department, an agency or a Reserve Bank, as fiscal agent, had failed to discover promptly an unauthorized signature
or alteration; 

(3) An imposter had fraudulently caused the issuance of a FedSelect check in the name of any existing payee or fictitious
payee; or 

(4) An employee of the Department, an agency or a Reserve Bank, as fiscal agent, had caused the fraudulent issuance
of a FedSelect check in the name of any existing payee or fictitious payee. 

(c) In the event of a breach of warranty, the payor Reserve Bank may either return the item to the presenting bank or send
to the presenting bank notice of the breach. If, upon receipt of the returned check or notice of the breach, the presenting
bank does not make prompt restitution, the Department, an agency or the payor Reserve Bank may begin appropriate collection
procedures.

 247.10 

Notice and replacement_non-receipt, theft, loss or destruction; late presentment. 



(a) If an agency has notice that a FedSelect check is not received by the payee within a reasonable time after a payment
is due, or that a FedSelect check is lost, stolen or destroyed, the agency must request to the FMS that a stop payment
order be placed on that item. The notice may be given by telephone or facsimile, but if it is given by telephone, such
notice must be confirmed in writing before another payment is issued. The notification must contain sufficient information
to identify the account and/or the obligation to which the payment is related. Payment on a FedSelect check is stopped
if the notice of non-receipt, loss, theft, or destruction is received from the agency at such time and in such manner
as to afford the payor Reserve Bank and the FMS a reasonable opportunity to act on it prior to final payment, as provided
by applicable law. Once a stop payment order has been placed against an outstanding FedSelect check, such stop payment
order will not be removed. 

(b) The agency that issued the FedSelect check will issue another FedSelect check to replace a lost, stolen or destroyed
FedSelect check, or other form of payment, at its discretion. Items an agency may require before issuing another FedSelect
check include: 

(1) Written confirmation that the original FedSelect check was lost, stolen, or destroyed; 

(2) Confirmation from the FMS that the original FedSelect check is unpaid; 

(3) A determination that recovery of the original FedSelect check is unlikely; and 

(4) An indemnification agreement executed by the payee and/or indorsee. 

(c) If a payor Reserve Bank refuses payment on a FedSelect check solely as a result of  247.8(c), the agency that
issued the original FedSelect check may issue, at its discretion, another FedSelect check, or other form of payment,
to a payee or holder upon surrender of the original FedSelect check and execution of such indemnification agreement
as may be required by the agency. 

(d) Upon verification of the existence of a forged or unauthorized indorsement on a FedSelect check which has been
finally paid, the agency that issued the original FedSelect check may issue, at its discretion, another FedSelect
check or other form of payment to the person entitled. Disputes as to any continuing obligations for payment remain
between the agency that issued the payment and the payee. Prior to the issuance of another FedSelect check, the payee
or indorsee of the original FedSelect check may be required to execute an affidavit asserting that the payee or indorsee
was in no way involved in the fraudulent or unauthorized indorsement of the original FedSelect check, in addition
to any indemnification agreement required by the agency. 

(e) In the case of a FedSelect check payable to the order of two or more persons, the requirements of this section apply
to all designated payees.

 247.11 

Losses and accountability. 


(a) Agencies will be accountable for all losses arising out of agency activity related to the issuance of FedSelect
checks. Such activities include negligence, fraud perpetrated by an employee or agent of the agency, and fraud perpetrated
by a service-provider or vendor receiving a FedSelect check as payment. 
(b) If an agency had notice that a FedSelect check was not received by the payee within a reasonable time after a payment
is due, or that a FedSelect check is lost, stolen or destroyed, and the agency failed to request to the FMS that a stop
payment order be placed on that item pursuant to  247.10(a), the agency will be accountable for any loss occurring
as a result of the failure to request stop payment in a timely fashion. 
(c) Losses caused by the fault or negligence of the FMS will be the accountability of the FMS. Such losses include failure
to adhere to a request by an agency to place a stop payment order on an item in accordance with  247.10(a). 
(d) The FMS will be accountable for losses caused by third-parties, including losses caused by alteration, counterfeit
and forgery of the payee indorsement, unless such losses occur as described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.




 247.12 

Debt collection. 


(a) Agencies are responsible for collection procedures on all improperly paid items arising under the circumstances
described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of  247.11. However, excepting cases of fraud, an agency should write off
a debt and refer it to the FMS for collection if it is not resolved within 90 days after the item was paid. When the FMS collects
on the debt, the funds will be returned to the agency minus an administrative fee for the collection, in accordance
with rules set forth in I TFM 4-3500. Accountability for a debt remains with the agency in accordance with  247.11.

(b) The FMS is responsible for collection procedures on all improperly paid items arising under the circumstances
described in paragraphs (c) and (d) of  247.11. With all such items, the FMS will make an initial demand for refund
of the amount of a check payment to the presenting bank or any other debtor. This demand shall advise the presenting
bank or debtor of the amount demanded and the reason for the demand. All delinquent debts will be subject to interest,
penalties and administrative fees in accordance with the Federal Claims Collections Standards. Any discrepancies
should be brought to the attention of the FMS.

 247.13 

Funds for losses. 


(a) If collection efforts by the FMS for debts arising under paragraphs (c) and (d) of  247.11 are unsuccessful,
sources of funds for the payment of such losses include FMS appropriations, to the extent available, funds collected
from reimbursement fees for services provided by the FMS pursuant to  247.5(b), and other available sources.

(b) Reimbursement fees paid by agencies to the FMS for FedSelect check services will be retained for payment of uncollectible
losses, consistent with all applicable laws. 



 247.14 

Additional requirements. 


In any case or any class of cases arising under these regulations, the FMS or the agency that issued the FedSelect check
may require such additional evidence of loss, improper indorsement or entitlement to another payment may be necessary
for the protection of the interests of the United States. 

 247.15 

Waiver of regulations. 


The FMS reserves the right to waive any provision(s) of these regulations in any case or class of cases for the convenience
of the United States or in order to relieve any person(s) of unnecessary hardship, if such action is not inconsistent
with law, does not impair any existing rights, and the FMS is satisfied that such action will not subject the United
States to any substantial expense or liability. 



 247.16 

Supplements, amendments or revisions. 


The FMS may, at any time, prescribe supplemental, amendatory, or revised regulations or revoke the regulations in
this Part.

Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; California State Implementation Plan Revision; Monterey Bay
Unified Air Pollution Control District



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is proposing to approve revisions to the California State Implementation Plan (SIP) which concern the control
of emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from storage of organic liquids, gasoline transfer operations,
and steam drive wells. The intended effect of proposing approval of these rules is to regulate emissions of volatile
organic compounds (VOCs) in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA or the Act).
EPA's final action on this notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) will incorporate these rules into the federally approved
SIP. EPA has evaluated each of these rules and is proposing to approve them under provisions of the CAA regarding EPA
action on SIP submittals, SIPs for national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards and plan requirements
for nonattainment areas. 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


Background


On March 3, 1978, EPA promulgated a list of ozone nonattainment areas under the provisions of the Clean Air Act, as amended
in 1977 (1977 CAA or pre-amended Act), that included the Monterey Bay Area. 43 FR 8964, 40 CFR 81.305. Because these
areas were unable to meet the statutory attainment date of December 31, 1982, California requested under section
172(a)(2), and EPA approved, an extension of the attainment date to December 31, 1987. 40 CFR 52.238. On May 26, 1988,
EPA notified the Governor of California, pursuant to section 110(a)(2)(H) of the pre-amended Act, that the above
district's portions of the California SIP were inadequate to attain and maintain the ozone standard and requested
that deficiencies in the existing SIP be corrected (EPA's SIP-Call). On November 15, 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments
of 1990 were enacted. Public Law 101-549, 104 Stat. 2399, codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401-7671q. In amended
section 182(a)(2)(A) of the CAA, Congress statutorily adopted the requirement that nonattainment areas fix their
deficient reasonably available control technology (RACT) rules for ozone and established a deadline of May 15, 1991
for states to submit corrections of those deficiencies. 
Section 182(a)(2)(A) applies to areas designated as nonattainment prior to enactment of the amendments and classified
as marginal or above as of the date of enactment. It requires such areas to adopt and correct RACT rules pursuant to pre-amended
section 172(b) as interpreted in pre-amendment guidance.

1

 EPA's SIP-Call used that guidance to indicate the necessary corrections for specific nonattainment areas. The Monterey
Bay Area is classified as moderate

2

; therefore, this area was subject to the RACT fix-up requirement and the May 15, 1991 deadline. 






This document addresses EPA's proposed action for the following rules from the Monterey Bay Unified Air Pollution
Control District (MBUAPCD): Rule 417, Storage of Organic Liquids; Rule 418, Transfer of Gasoline into Stationary
Storage Containers; and Rule 427, Steam Drive Crude Oil Production Wells. On June 8, 1993, the State of California
was issued a finding of nonsubmittal for the above rules, thus starting an 18 month sanctions clock under section 179(a)
of the CAA. In addition, section 110(c) of the Act provides that EPA promulgate a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP)
no later than two years after a finding under section 179(a). The rules being acted upon in this document were adopted
by the MBUAPCD on August 25, 1993 and were submitted by the State of California to EPA on November 18, 1993. The mandatory
sanctions clock was stopped on December 23, 1993 when EPA determined that the State had made a complete submittal pursuant
to EPA's completeness criteria that are set forth in 40 CFR part 51, appendix V.

3

 By this document, EPA is proposing to approve these rules into the SIP. Final approval of these rule revisions will
incorporate the regulations into the federally approved SIP and stop the FIP clock.





Rule 417 controls VOCs associated with organic liquid storage, and Rule 418 controls VOCs during the transfer of gasoline
from delivery vessels into storage containers. Rule 427 controls emissions from oil wells where production has been
enhanced by steam injection. VOCs contribute to the production of ground level ozone and smog. The rules were adopted
as part of the District's efforts to achieve the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone and in response
to the section 182(a)(2)(A) CAA requirement. The following is EPA's evaluation and proposed action for these rules.


EPA Evaluation and Proposed Action


In determining the approvability of a VOC rule, EPA must evaluate the rule for consistency with the requirements of
the CAA and EPA regulations, as found in section 110 and part D of the CAA and 40 CFR part 51 (Requirements for Preparation,
Adoption, and Submittal of Implementation Plans). The EPA interpretation of these requirements, which forms the
basis for today's action, appears in the various EPA policy guidance documents listed in footnote 1. Among those provisions
is the requirement that a VOC rule must, at a minimum, provide for the implementation of RACT for stationary sources
of VOC emissions. This requirement was carried forth from the pre-amended Act.
For the purpose of assisting state and local agencies in developing RACT rules, EPA prepared a series of Control Technique
Guideline (CTG) documents. The CTGs are based on the underlying requirements of the Act and specify the presumptive
norms for what is RACT for specific source categories. Under the CAA, Congress ratified EPA's use of these documents,
as well as other Agency policy, for requiring States to ``fix-up'' their RACT rules. See section 182(a)(2)(A). The
CTG documents applicable to Rule 417 are entitled, ``Control of Volatile Organic Emissions from Petroleum Liquid
Storage in External Floating Roof Tanks,'' EPA-450/2-78-047 and ``Control of Volatile Organic
Emissions from Petroleum Liquid Storage in Fixed Roof Tanks,'' EPA-450/2-77-036. The CTG documents
applicable to Rule 418 are ``Control of Volatile Organic Compound Leaks from Gasoline Tank Trucks and Vapor Collection
Systems,'' EPA-450/2-78-051 and ``Control of Volatile Organic Emissions from Bulk Gasoline Plants,''
EPA-450/2-77-035. For some source categories, such as steam-enhanced oil production wells, EPA
did not publish a CTG. In such cases, the District makes a determination of what controls are required to satisfy the
RACT requirement by reviewing the operations of facilities within the affected source category. In that review,
the technological and economic feasibility of the proposed controls are considered. Additionally, for both CTG
and non-CTG rules, the District may rely on EPA policy documents, such as the Blue Book, to ensure that the adopted rules
are fully enforceable and strengthen or maintain the SIP.
MBUAPCD Rule 417, Storage of Organic Liquids, includes the following significant changes from the current SIP:



1. Gap requirements for vapor-mounted primary seals have been added.
2. Recordkeeping, definitions, and test methods have been added.



MBUAPCD Rule 418, Transfer of Gasoline into Stationary Storage Containers, includes the following major changes
from the SIP:



1. An exemption for agricultural tanks has been revised to be consistent with EPA policy.
2. Recordkeeping, definitions, and test methods have been added.
3. Executive Officer discretion in determining equivalence of emission controls has been deleted.



MBUAPCD Rule 427, Steam Drive Crude Oil Production Wells, includes the following significant changes from the SIP:



1. Operational and repair requirements have been added.
2. Definitions, reporting, recordkeeping, and test methods have been added.
3. Executive Officer discretion in determining compliance equivalency has been deleted.



EPA has evaluated the submitted rules and has determined that they are consistent with the CAA, EPA regulations, and
EPA policy. Therefore, MBUAPCD Rule 417, Rule 418, and Rule 427 are being proposed for approval under section 110(k)(3)
of the CAA as meeting the requirements of section 110(a) and part D. 
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements.


Regulatory Process


Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small 
entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a
substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises
and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
SIP approvals under sections 110 and 301 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply
approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose
any new requirements, it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature
of the 
Federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal
inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs
on such grounds.

Pesticide Tolerances for Cyfluthrin




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA proposes to amend tolerances for residues of the synthetic pyrethroid cyfluthrin in or on the raw agricultural
commodities (RAC's) milk, meat, fat, and meat byproducts of cattle and establish a tolerance for milkfat. The proposed
regulation to amend the tolerances and establish a maximum permissible level for residues of the pesticide in milkfat
was requested in a petition submitted by Miles Corp., Animal Products (formerly Mobay Corp.).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 EPA issued a notice, published in the 

Federal Register

 of April 3, 1991 (56 FR 13642), which announced that Miles Corp. had submitted pesticide petition (PP) 1F3923 to EPA
requesting that the Administrator, pursuant to section 408(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA),
21 U.S.C. 346a(d), amend 40 CFR 180.436 by increasing tolerances for residues of the insecticide cyfluthrin, [cyano[4-fluoro-3-phenoxyphenyl]-methyl-3-[2,2-dichloroethenyl]-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate],
in or on the raw agricultural commodities milk to 0.08 part per million (ppm) (from 0.01 ppm) and meat, fat, and meat
byproducts of cattle to 0.40 ppm (from 0.05 ppm). The proposal to increase tolerances was submitted in support of direct
application (pour-on) of the pesticide Bayocide Pour On Insecticide containing cyfluthrin to lactating dairy and
beef cattle.


A review of the data indicated that cyfluthrin residues concentrate in fat; therefore, Miles Corp. was asked to amend
the petition by requesting an appropriate milkfat tolerance. On February 14, 1994, Miles Corp. submitted an amended
pesticide petition proposing that tolerances be established for milkfat at 2.5 ppm (reflecting 0.08 ppm in whole
milk).
The data submitted in support of these tolerances and other relevant material have been evaluated. The toxicological
and metabolism data and analytical methods for enforcement purposes considered in support of these tolerances are
discussed in detail in related documents published in the 

Federal Register

 of August 16, 1989 (54 FR 33718).
A dietary exposure/risk assessment was performed for cyfluthrin using a Reference Dose (RfD) of 0.025 mg/kg bwt/day,
based on a no-observed-effect-level (NOEL) of 2.5 mg/kg/ bwt/day and an uncertainty factor of 100. The NOEL was determined
in a 2-year rat feeding study. The endpoint effects of concern were decreased body weights and inflammation of the
kidneys. The Theoretical Maximum Residue Contribution (TMRC) from established tolerances utilizes 5.5% of the
RfD for the U.S. population or 11% of the RfD if the new tolerances are granted. Established tolerances utilize 20%
of the RfD for nonnursing infants less than 1 year old, the subgroup with the highest estimated exposure to cyfluthrin
residues or 30% of the RfD if the new tolerances are granted. Generally speaking, EPA has no cause for concern if total
residue contribution for published and proposed tolerances is less than the RfD. 
The metabolism of the chemical in animals for these uses is adequately understood. An adequate analtyical method,
gas-liquid chromatography, is available for enforcement purposes. The enforcement methodology has been submitted
to the Food and Drug Administration for publication in the Pesticide Analytical Manual, Vol. II (PAM II). Because
of the long lead time for publication of the method in PAM II, the analytical methodology is being made available in
the interim to anyone interested in pesticide enforcement when requested from: Calvin Furlow, Public Response and
Program Resources Branch, Field Opearations Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection
Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: Rm. 1132, CM #2, 1921 Jefferson
Davis Hwy., Arlington, VA 22202, (703)-305-5232. 
There are currently no actions pending against the continued registration of this chemical.
Based on the information and data considered, the Agency has determined that the tolerances established by amending
40 CFR part 180 would protect the public health. Therefore, it is proposed that the tolerances be established as set
forth below.
Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide under the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) as amended which contains any of the ingredients listed herein may request
within 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register

 that this rulemaking proposal be referred to an Advisory Committee in accordance with section 408(e) of the FFDCA.

Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulations. Comments must bear a notation
indicating the document control number, [PP 1F3923/P593]. All written comments filed in response to these petitions
will be available in the Public Response and Program Resources Branch, at the address given above from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday, except legal holidays.
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order (i.e., Regulatory Impact Analysis,
review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant'' as those
actions likely to lead to a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious
inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering
the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues
arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order.
Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat.
1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising
tolerance levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements, or establishing or raising food additive
regulations do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification
statement to this effect was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).

Michigan: Final Authorization to Revisions to 
State Hazardous Waste Management Program 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking and public comment period.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Michigan has applied for final authorization of revisions to its hazardous waste management program under the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended (hereinafter RCRA). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
has reviewed Michigan's application and has reached a decision, subject to public review and comment, that these
hazardous waste management program revisions satisfy all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization.
Thus, EPA intends to approve Michigan's hazardous waste management program revisions. Michigan's application
for program revision is available for public review and comment. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
A. Background 



States with final authorization under section 3006(b) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6929(b) have a continuing obligation to
maintain a hazardous waste program that is equivalent to, consistent with, and no less stringent than the Federal
hazardous waste management program. 

When either EPA's or a State program's controlling statutory or regulatory authority is modified or supplemented,
or when certain other changes occur, revisions to State hazardous waste management programs may be necessary. Most
commonly, State program revisions are necessitated by changes to EPA's regulations in 40 CFR parts 124, 260 through
268, and 270. The procedures that States and EPA must follow for revision of State programs are found at 40 CFR 271.21.




B. Michigan 



The State of Michigan initially received final authorization for its hazardous waste management program effective
on October 30, 1986 (51 FR 36804-36805, October 16, 1986). Subsequently, Michigan received authorization
for revisions to its program effective on January 23, 1990 (54 FR 225, 
November 24, 1989), June 24, 1991 (56 FR 18517, April 23, 1991), and 
November 30, 1993 (58 FR 51244, October 1, 1993). 

On November 8, 1991, the Governor of Michigan issued Executive Order 1991-31, which resulted in reorganization
of the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (MDNR), the State agency that administers the RCRA program in the
State of Michigan. However, the Order did not immediately take effect due to court challenges by the State House of
Representatives and environmental groups. A State Supreme Court ruling on September 2, 1993, upheld the Governor's
power to organize the executive branch and lifted the stay on the Order, making the Order immediately effective on
September 2, 1993. 

On March 10 and August 18, 1994, Michigan submitted an application 
seeking authorization of the revised program. The application consisted of a modified program description, a statement
by the Michigan Attorney General, and an addendum to the memorandum of agreement between the State and EPA outlining
the policies, responsibilities and procedures under which the program is administered. 

EPA has reviewed Michigan's application and has determined that the MDNR's operation of the State hazardous waste
management program continued on and after September 2, 1993, without interruption, and the MDNR has continued to
act as the lead State agency responsible for administering the program. EPA has also determined that the reorganized
MDNR did not result in significant modification of Michigan's hazardous waste management program, nor did the Order
transfer any part of the program from the approved State agency to any other State agency. Therefore, EPA does not view
the reorganization as a transfer within the purview of  271.21(c). 

Consequently, EPA has made a decision, subject to public review and comment, that Michigan's hazardous waste program,
as revised, satisfies all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. The public may submit
written comments on EPA's decision up until November 21, 1994. Copies of Michigan's application are available for
inspection and copying at the locations indicated in the 

Addresses

 section of this notice. 


Approval of Michigan's program revision shall become effective when the Regional Administrator's final approval
is published in the 

Federal Register

. If adverse comment pertaining to Michigan's program revision is received during the comment period, EPA will publish
either: (1) A notice of disapproval; or (2) a final rulemaking approving the modifications, which would include appropriate
comment response. 

If final approval is granted, Michigan will maintain final authorization to operate its hazardous waste management
program as revised. MDNR will continue to have responsibility for permitting treatment, storage, and disposal facilities
within its borders and carrying out other aspects of the RCRA program, subject to the limitation of its revised program
application and previously approved authorities. Michigan also will maintain primary enforcement responsibilities,
although EPA retains the right to conduct inspections under section 3007 of RCRA, and to take enforcement actions
under sections 3008, 3013 and 7003 of RCRA. 


Michigan is not seeking authority to operate the Federal program on Indian lands. This authority will remain with
EPA unless provided otherwise in a future statute or regulation.

Northeast Multispecies Fishery; Public Hearings


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of intent to prepare a supplemental environmental impact statement (SEIS); request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS announces the intention of the New England Fishery Management Council (Council) to prepare an SEIS for proposed
Amendment 7 to the Northeast Multispecies Fishery Management Plan (FMP). The most recent Northeast Fisheries Science
Center's (NEFSC) Stock Assessment Workshop (SAW 18) for Georges Bank cod and Georges Bank yellowtail flounder recommends
that, in order to avert a collapse of cod and improve stock rebuilding for yellowtail, fishing mortality should be
reduced to as low a level as possible, approaching zero. In the development of Amendment 7, the Council proposes to
adopt the SAW's recommendation and consider all options in meeting this objective while addressing the issue of displacement
of fishing effort. The Council also announces a continuing public process to determine the scope of issues under consideration.
The purpose of this document is to inform the public of this process and of the opportunity to participate in the further
development of Amendment 7 to the FMP. All persons affected by, or otherwise interested in, the proposed amendment
are invited to participate in determining the scope of significant issues to be considered in the SEIS by submitting
written comments. The scoping process also will identify and eliminate issues that are not significant from detailed
study.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Many of the New England multispecies stocks are over-exploited and at extremely low levels of abundance. Scientists
believe that cod, haddock and yellowtail flounder, the three main species making up the Northeast multispecies stock
group, are near or at the point of collapse. Under such conditions, the fishery can expect a prolonged period during
which landings from the resource are substantially below their long-term potential. Due to the reduced spawning
stock size, the probability is low that sufficient numbers of fish will be produced to replace those being removed,
further jeopardizing or delaying stock recovery.


Amendment 5 to the FMP was implemented on March 1, 1994 (59 FR 9872), and was intended
to eliminate overfishing through an incremental effort-reduction program, mesh-size increase, expanded spawning
area closures and other measures. When the Council adopted objectives for the amendment more than 3 years ago, cod,
haddock, and yellowtail flounder stocks were being fished at a rate that was on average twice what could be sustained
over the long term, so it designed a plan to reduce fishing effort by half.
In the fall of 1993, NMFS informed the Council that the condition of the Georges Bank haddock stock was deteriorating
and in need of more protection than was provided by Amendment 5. NMFS implemented emergency regulations on January 3, 1994
(59 FR 26), which essentially limited the possession limit of haddock to 500 lb (226.8 kg) and extended
the time and area closure for Closed Area II, and subsequently prepared and implemented these measures on a permanent
basis under Amendment 6 (59 FR 32134, June 22, 1994).
During the Amendment 5 development and implementation period, fishing mortality rates increased and the downward
trends in stock size and yields continued. The recent stock assessment from the NEFSC (SAW 18) addresses the status
of Georges Bank cod and yellowtail flounder stocks and concludes that Amendment 5 is clearly inadequate to achieve
the reductions in fishing mortality rates needed to allow for appreciable stock rebuilding. Further, SAW 18 advises
that fishing mortality levels need to be reduced to as low a level as possible, approaching zero, in order to avert a
collapse of cod and improve the prospects of stock rebuilding for yellowtail flounder. This assessment coupled with
the severely depleted condition of the haddock stock and similar advice from the NEFSC (SAW 17) concerning Southern
New England yellowtail, presents an alarming picture of the overall status of the New England multispecies fishery.
Thus, even though the effort reductions required by Amendment 5 are very restrictive, they are insufficient. The
Council now intends to prevent an even worse scenario for the multispecies resource by severely reducing fishing
effort sooner and perhaps by more than what is required by Amendment 5.
The Council voted at its September 21-22, 1994 meeting to recommend that the Groundfish Committee (Committee)
immediately begin the development of an amendment to the FMP to implement the recommendations of SAWs 17 and 18 for
severely depleted groundfish stocks including Georges Bank yellowtail flounder, Southern New England yellowtail
flounder, haddock, Georges Bank cod, and others as needed. Also, the Council voted that the Committee needs to consider
all available options in meeting this objective while ensuring that in the Committee's analysis, consideration
of fishing effort displacement into other fisheries and other groundfish fisheries is taken into account. The range
of measures include, but is not limited to, a closure of all fisheries capable of catching multispecies and those fisheries
not protected from effort displacement resulting from this closure, a closure of very large areas in the Northwest
Atlantic for long periods of time, prohibitions or limitations on the use of specific gear types capable of catching
multispecies, selective gear requirements such as increased mesh size or square mesh, limits on total allowable
catch and/or individual vessel catch, and increased limits on vessel days at sea.
The Council expects that regulations sufficient to implement the recommendations of the NEFSC stock assessment
advisors will have significant economic and social impacts. The Council recognizes that these impacts will extend
beyond the individuals, families, and communities that principally depend on multispecies and will affect other
fisheries in the region due to the displacement of fishing effort caused by the regulations or through possible restrictions
on the incidental catch of multispecies in those other fisheries. For this reason the Council has determined that
it will prepare an SEIS.

Background



On April 15, 1982, the FAA announced the adoption of Amendment 67-11 (47 FR 16298; April 15, 1982) to the FAR (14
CFR part 67). The amendment revised, among other things, the special discretionary procedures for issuing airman
medical certificates to persons who do not qualify for certification under   67.13, 67.15, or 67.17 of
the FAR. In the preamble to that amendment, the FAA announced that, in compliance with Executive Order 12291, Federal
Regulation (February 17, 1981), it intended to conduct an overall review of the medical standards in part 67 of the
FAR. A complete review of the regulations was needed to bring the standards and procedures for airman medical certification
up to date with advances in medical knowledge, practice, and technology. Therefore, Amendment 67-11 was considered
interim clarification until a comprehensive review of the medical standards contained in part 67 could be concluded.

The FAA began the review of the medical standards for airmen and of its certification practices and procedures (47
FR 30795; July 15, 1982) by requesting public comment. In addition, the FAA initiated a contract with the American
Medical Association (AMA) to provide professional and technical information. The AMA presented its report, ``Review
of Part 67 of the Federal Air Regulations and the Medical Certification of Civilian Airmen'' (AMA Report), on March
26, 1986. The public was again invited to comment on part 67 in ``Announcement of the Availability of a Report'' (51
FR 19040; May 23, 1986). The AMA Report detailed the results of a comprehensive review of the standards for airman medical
certification and of their application. The AMA Report considered pertinent advances in the field of medicine since
1959, recommended changes in FAA medical standards and explained the rationale for such changes. 
In a separate but related issue, on May 11, 1979, the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA) petitioned to amend
 61.23 to require medical examinations for private pilots at 36-month intervals rather than at 24-month intervals.
In response to the petition, the FAA reviewed the literature, surveyed the medical practices of the Department of
Defense, and considered a preliminary analysis of its own aeromedical certification data. The FAA then contracted
with Johns Hopkins University to prepare a detailed statistical analysis of information collected by the FAA from
annual examinations on approximately 31,000 air traffic controllers over a 15-year period. The study sample was
demographically similar and broadly comparable to the private pilot population, and the examinations were similar
to airman medical examinations.

The Johns Hopkins University analysis confirmed an increasing incidence of recorded pathology with increasing
age, agreeing with the data from the AMA report, but a relatively low incidence in young individuals. Reducing the
frequency of medical examinations could be expected to result in an increased prevalence of undetected pathology
within the system. For the younger age groups, however, this effect would be small. The Johns Hopkins analysis did
not identify exact ages at which the frequency of examinations should be changed. 
In response to the AOPA petition to amend  61.23, the FAA issued on October 29, 1982, NPRM No. 82-15 (47 FR
54414, December 2, 1982) proposing to amend part 61 to revise the duration of validity of third-class privileges of
airman medical certificates for operations requiring a private or student pilot certificate. As proposed by Notice
No. 82-15, the requirement for a third-class medical examination would have been changed to every 5 years for
the youngest pilots then increasing in frequency to the existing 2-year interval for older pilots. 
On September 27, 1985, prior to the issuance of the AMA Report on its review of the airman medical standards and certification
procedures in part 67, the notice proposing to amend part 61 to revise the duration of third-class airman medical certificates
was withdrawn (50 FR 39619). The proposal was withdrawn, in part, because of issues raised by the medical community.
In addition, a regulatory evaluation of Notice 
No. 82-15 suggested a slight increase in aircraft accident fatalities if the then proposed third-class medical
certificate was set to 5 years for young airmen. Given the then pending issuance of the AMA Report and the possibility
that the report would provide better data on which to base an evaluation of the safety concerns raised by the medical
community, the FAA decided that any future consideration of examination frequency would be within the context of
the outcome of the comprehensive review of part 67. 
On February 26, 1986, AOPA again petitioned the FAA to revise the duration of a third-class airman medical certificate
to 36 calendar months for noncommercial operations requiring a private, recreational, or student pilot certificate.
The petition (Docket No. 24932) was entered in the public docket and remains open. 
On September 24, 1993, AOPA once again petitioned the FAA to revise the duration of a third-class airman medical certificate
to 48 calendar months for a specific trial period for noncommercial operations requiring a private or student pilot
certificate. The petition (Docket No. 27473) was entered in the public docket and remains open. 
Based on the FAA's review of part 67, the FAA's judgment regarding recommendations contained in the AMA Report, and
on consideration of all public comments in response to previous notices, the FAA proposes to revise part 67, ``Medical
Standards and Certification.'' The proposed revision of part 67 will involve the incorporation of additions and
changes to specific medical standards, the scope of examination, and the administrative procedures pertaining
to airman medical certification. In consideration of pertinent advances in the field of medicine since the last significant
revision of part 67, the medical standards and certification procedures that are being proposed reflect current
medical knowledge, technology, and practice. 
As stated in the notice withdrawing Notice 82-15, the duration of airman medical certificates was to be reconsidered
after the AMA's report; however, the report provided no duration recommendation. The proposal to revise airmen standards
and certifications procedures and the duration of airmen medical certificates was also addressed in a January 1992
agency rulemaking review. The results of these events supported the revision of part 67 and duration of third-class
airman medical certificates. A reevaluation of all studies and data collected since 1982 supports a revision of the
duration of third-class medical certificates outlined in this proposal. Accordingly, the FAA is proposing revisions
to part 67 and to  61.23 of part 61 of the FAR. 


Summary of Proposed Amendments to Part 67 


The following is a summary of the substantive changes proposed in this rulemaking. Because the FAA is proposing a complete
recodification of part 67, this summary states both the current and proposed section/paragraph numbers. 
1. Distant visual acuity requirements for first- and second-class certification are changed to delete the uncorrected
acuity standards. However, each eye must be corrected to 20/20 as in the current standard. [FAR Standards: Current
  67.13(b) and 67.15(b); Proposed   67.103(a) and 67.203(a)] 
2. For third-class certification, the current 20/50, uncorrected, or 20/30, corrected, distant visual acuity standard
is changed to 20/40 in each eye, with or without correction. [FAR Standard: Current  67.17(b); Proposed  67.303(a)]

3. For first- and second-class certification, minimum near visual acuity requirements are specified in terms of
Snellen equivalents (20/40), corrected or uncorrected, each eye, at 16 inches and, after age 50, also include an intermediate
standard (20/40) at 32 inches. This replaces the current standard of V=1.00 at 18 inches for first-class only. [FAR
Standards: Current   67.13(b) and 67.15(b); Proposed   67.103(b) and 67.203(b)] 
4. A near visual acuity standard of 
20/40, corrected or uncorrected, each eye, at 16 inches is added to the third-class visual requirements. [FAR Standard:
Current (None); Proposed 
 67.303(b)] 
5. Color vision requirements are amended to read: ``ability to perceive those colors necessary for safe performance
of airman duties,'' and are the same for all classes. Current standards require ``normal color vision'' for first-class
and the ability to distinguish aviation signal colors for second- and third-class applicants. [FAR Standards: Current
  67.13(b), 67.15(b), and 67.17(b); Proposed   67.103(c), 67.203(c), and 67.303(c)] 
6. The current first-class standard pertaining to pathological conditions of the eye or adnexa that interfere or
that may reasonably be expected to interfere with proper function is substituted in both the second- and third-class
standards for the current standards which specify, respectively, ``no pathology of the eye'' and ``no serious pathology
of the eye.'' [FAR Standards: Current   67.15(b) and 67.17(b); Proposed 
  67.203(e) and 67.303(d)]

7. The ``whispered voice test'' for hearing is deleted for all classes. Substituted are a conversational voice test
using both ears at 6 feet; an audiometric word (speech) discrimination test to a score of at least 70 percent obtained
in one ear or in a sound field environment; or pure tone audiometry according to a table of acceptable thresholds (ANSI
1969). The amended standards for hearing are the same for all classes. [FAR Standards: Current   67.13(c),
67.15(c), and 67.17(c); Proposed   67.105(a), 67.205(a), and 67.305(a)] 
8. The standards pertaining to the ear, nose, mouth, pharynx, and larynx are revised to more general terms and related
to flying and speech communication. Specific references to the mastoid and eardrum are deleted. The current standard,
``No disturbance in equilibrium,'' is changed to, ``No ear disease or condition manifested by, or that may reasonably
be expected to be manifested by, vertigo or a disturbance of equilibrium.'' The amended standards are the same for
all classes. [FAR Standards: Current   67.13(c), 67.15(c), and 67.17(c); Proposed   67.105(b),
67.205(b), and 67.305(b)] 
9. ``Psychosis,'' as used in the proposed regulation, refers to ``a mental disorder in which the individual has manifested
psychotic symptoms or to a mental disorder in which an individual may reasonably be expected to manifest psychotic
symptoms.'' This alleviates some of the problems in interpreting the regulations created by changes in nomenclature
and classification of mental conditions found in the 

Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders

, 3rd edition (DSM III). [FAR Standards: Current   67.13(d), 67.15(d), and 67.17(d); Proposed   67.107(a),
67.207(a), and 67.307(a)] 
10. Substance dependence and substance abuse are defined and specified as disqualifying medical conditions. Substance
dependence is disqualifying unless there is clinical evidence, satisfactory to the Federal Air Surgeon, of recovery,
including sustained total abstinence from alcohol for not less than the preceding 2 years in the case of alcohol dependence.
In the case of other substance dependence, recovery would include sustained total abstinence from that substance
for not less than the preceding 5 years. Substance abuse, in the case of alcohol within the preceding 2 years and in the
case of other substances within the preceding 5 years, is disqualifying. Alcohol dependence and alcohol abuse are
included in the terms ``substance dependence'' and ``substance abuse'', respectively. [FAR Standards: Current
  67.13(d), 67.15(d), and 67.17(d); Proposed   67.107(a) and (b), 67.207(a) and (b), and
67.307(a) and (b)] 
11. ``Bipolar disorder'' is added as a specifically disqualifying condition. This corrects a regulatory problem
created by the change in nomenclature contained in DSM III. [FAR Standards: Current (None); Proposed   67.107(a),
67.207(a), and 67.307(a)] 
12. The general mental standard is amended to add the word ``other'' before ``mental.'' The proposed revised standard
reads, ``No other personality disorder, neurosis, or other mental condition * * *.'' [FAR Standards:
Current   67.13(d), 67.15(d), and 67.17(d); Proposed   67.107(c), 67.207(c), and 67.307(c)]

13. ``A single seizure,'' and ``A transient loss of control of nervous system function(s) without satisfactory medical
explanation of the cause,'' are added as specifically disqualifying neurologic conditions. [FAR Standards: Current
(None); Proposed   67.109(a), 67.209(a), and 67.309(a)] 
14. The word ``seizure,'' is substituted for ``convulsive.'' [FAR Standards: Current   67.13(d), 67.15(d),
and 67.17(d); Proposed   67.109(b), 67.209(b), and 67.309(b)] 
15. ``Cardiac valve replacement,'' ``permanent cardiac pacemaker implantation,'' and ``heart replacement''
are added as specifically disqualifying cardiovascular conditions for all classes of certification. [FAR Standards:
Current   67.13(e), 67.15(e), and 67.17(e); Proposed   67.111(a), 67.211(a), and 67.311(a)]

16. A requirement is added whereby all applicants for second-class airman medical certificates will be required
to have a routine resting electrocardiogram (ECG) at the first application after reaching age 35 and every 2 years
after reaching age 40. An ECG requirement currently exists for first-class applicants; however, first-class applicants
must have an annual ECG after reaching age 40. There is no requirement added for third-class. [FAR Standards: Current
 67.13(e); Proposed   67.111(d) and 67.211(d)] 
17. The current table of age-related maximum blood pressure readings for applicants for first-class certificates
and the reference to ``circulatory efficiency'' are deleted, and a requirement that average blood pressure while
sitting not exceed 150/95 millimeters of mercury is added for applicants of all classes. A medical assessment is specified
for all applicants who need or use antihypertensive medication to control blood pressure. [FAR Standards: Current
 67.13(e); Proposed 
  67.111(b), 67.211(b), and 67.311(b)] 
18. For first-class applicants only, a total blood cholesterol determination after reaching age 50 is added. A cholesterol
of 300 milligrams per deciliter or more may require further evaluation although the applicant, if otherwise eligible,
is issued a medical certificate pending the results. [FAR Standard: Current (None); Proposed  67.111(f)]

19. The use of anticoagulant medication is made specifically disqualifying for applicants of all classes. [FAR Standards:
Current (None); Proposed   67.111(c), 67.211(c), and 67.311(c)] 
20. Current  67.19 of the FAR, Special Issue of Medical Certificates, is rewritten [Proposed FAR Standard:
 67.401(a)] to provide for, at the discretion of the Federal Air Surgeon, an ``Authorization for Special Issuance
of Medical Certificate'' (Authorization), valid for a specified period of time. An individual who does not meet the
published standards of part 67 of the FAR may be issued a medical certificate of the appropriate class if he or she possesses
a valid Authorization. The duration of any certificate issued in accordance with proposed  67.401 of the FAR
is for the period specified at the time of its issuance or until withdrawal of the Authorization upon which it is based.
A new Authorization is required after its expiration, and the applicant must show again that airman duties can be performed
without endangering air commerce. 
Proposed FAR Standard,  67.401(b) also provides for a Statement of Demonstrated Ability (SODA) instead of
an Authorization. The SODA will be issued to applicants whose disqualifying conditions are static or nonprogressive
and who have been found capable of performing airman duties without endangering air commerce. The SODA authorizes
an aviation medical examiner to issue a certificate if the applicant is otherwise eligible.

Proposed  67.401(e) retains the language of current  67.19(c) regarding consideration of the freedom
of a private pilot to accept reasonable risks to his or her own person or property that are not acceptable in the exercise
of commercial or airline transport pilot privileges, and consideration at the same time of the need to protect the
safety of persons and property in other aircraft and on the ground. 

Proposed  67.401(f) adds language that explicitly provides that the Federal Air Surgeon may withdraw the Authorization
or SODA. An Authorization or SODA may be withdrawn at any time for (1) adverse change in medical condition, (2) failure
to comply with its provisions, (3) potential endangerment of public safety, (4) failure to provide medical information,
or (5) the making or causing to be made of a fraudulent or intentionally false statement or an incorrect statement in
support of a request for an Authorization or SODA or in any entry in any logbook, record or report that is kept, made,
or used to show compliance with any requirement for an Authorization or SODA. 

Proposed  67.401(i) allows a person to request that the Federal Air Surgeon review a decision to withdraw an
Authorization or SODA. The request for a review would have to be made within 60 days of the service or mailing of the letter
withdrawing the Authorization or SODA. The proposed review procedures would be on an expedited basis and would provide
an affected holder of an Authorization or SODA a full opportunity to respond to a withdrawal by submitting supporting
medical evidence. 

21. Proposed  67.403 amends current  67.20 to provide for denial of an airman medical certificate if the
application for airman medical certificate is falsified. Though this consequence is implied, the current regulation
specifically provides only for revocation or suspension of certificates. Additionally,  67.403 proposes
to deny or withdraw any Authorization or SODA where information provided to obtain it is false, whether the statement
was knowingly false or unknowingly incorrect. Finally,  67.403(c) proposes that the making of an unknowingly
incorrect statement on an application for an airman medical certificate or on a request for an Authorization or SODA
is a basis for denial, revocation, withdrawal, or suspension of an airman medical certificate and the denial or withdrawal
of an Authorization or SODA. The making of an unknowingly incorrect statement is not a basis for revocation or suspension
of other types of certificates or ratings issued under the FAR. 

22. A new  67.415 of the FAR is proposed to provide that the holder of any medical certificate that is suspended
or revoked shall, upon the Administrator's request, return it to the Administrator. The FAA practice always has been
to request return of the certificate in such circumstances. 

23. Where appropriate, changes are made to eliminate gender-specific pronouns, to replace ``applicant'' with ``person,''
to use current position titles and addresses, to correct spelling and improve syntax, and to adjust section and sub-section
references. 



Summary of Proposed Amendments to Part 61 



Section 61.3(c) of the FAR provides, with some exceptions, that no person may serve as pilot in command or in any other
capacity as a required pilot flight crewmember unless that person has in his or her personal possession an appropriate
current medical certificate issued under part 67 of the FAR. The medical standards for issuing first-, second-, and
third-class medical certificates are set forth in current   67.13, 67.15, and 67.17, respectively.


Section 61.23 identifies the duration of validity and privileges of each class of medical certificate. Currently,
a first-class medical certificate is valid for 6 months for operations requiring an airline transport pilot certificate,
12 months for operations requiring only a commercial pilot certificate, and 24 months for operations requiring only
a private, recreational, or student pilot certificate. A second-class medical certificate is valid for 12 months
for operations requiring a commercial pilot or an air traffic control tower operator certificate and for 24 months
for operations requiring only a private, recreational, or student pilot certificate. A third-class medical certificate
currently is valid for 24 months for operations requiring a private, recreational, or student pilot certificate.

Using the John Hopkins University analysis (raw data originated from the FAA), airman certification data, and annualized
pilot exposure data, a decision model was prepared for the FAA that determined the best age-specific duration plan
for the third-class medical certificate population. We determined that the best plan would provide for maximum regulatory
relief without public safety decrement. For further discussion of duration analysis, see this docket's copy of the
regulatory evaluation at pages 25-26, 58-64, and 77-80. 

Using the model and the decision criteria previously discussed, the FAA proposes to lengthen the validity period
of third-class airman medical certificates for most persons under the age of 40. Persons under age 40 would be required
to undergo a physical examination every 3 years for a third-class medical certificate. Third-class medical certificates
for persons age 40 but less than age 70 would continue to be valid for 2 years. Persons age 70 and older would be required
to undergo a physical examination every year when applying for a third-class medical certificate. 

These ages and examination periods were selected because they will allow no significant increase in undetected pathology
between required examinations. Regulatory and economic relief can be provided without a significant effect on aviation
safety. 

The FAA has determined that the frequency of routine examinations can be reduced in the case of younger airmen who are
less likely to suffer medical disability and who have undergone an initial examination and certification prior to
first solo flight. Those individuals manifesting conditions that represent a risk to safety will be denied certification
or, after individual evaluation, will be restricted in their flying activities or examined more thoroughly and frequently,
or both. Those individuals who meet the published medical standards but whose conditions require more frequent scrutiny
will, under the new amendment, be issued medical certificates with a validity of 2 years rather than the longer period
which they may otherwise be granted. With routine medical examination frequency increasing with age as proposed,
aviation safety will be maintained. 

Both the AMA report and the Hopkins' analysis confirm the greater incidence of medical pathology in older persons.
FAA analysis also confirms that the incident of accidents generally increase with an increase in age. It is prudent,
therefore, to leave the current routine periodic examination requirement unchanged for persons age 40 but less than
age 70 and to increase the frequency of examination for persons age 70 and older. 

All third-class airman medical certificates or third-class privileges of a first- or second-class medical certificate
issued prior to the effective date of a final rule will remain valid for 2 years from the date of issuance unless the validity
period has been otherwise limited by the FAA. The period of validity for all third-class airman medical certificates
or third-class privileges of a first- or second-class medical certificate issued on or after the date of a final rule
will be calculated according to the provisions of the final rule unless the validity period has been otherwise limited
by the FAA. 

Because of the increased public responsibilities associated with commercial pilot privileges, the FAA does not
plan at this time to change the frequency of examinations for first- or second-class medical certificates for operations
requiring an airline transport pilot, commercial pilot, or air traffic control tower operator certificate. Similarly,
the agency does not plan now to revise the validity period of student pilot certificates, now 2 years as set forth in
 61.19, though these are usually issued in combination with the third-class medical certificate. A student
pilot whose student pilot certificate has expired but whose third-class medical certificate remains valid, may
obtain a new student pilot certificate from an FAA operations inspector as provided in  61.85(b). 

Section 61.53 of the FAR provides that: ``No person may act as pilot in command, or in any other capacity as a required
pilot flight crewmember while he [or she] has a known medical deficiency, or increase of a known medical deficiency,
that would make him [or her] unable to meet the requirements for his [or her] current medical certificate.'' This amendment
does not change  61.53, and the FAA continues to require airmen to comply with that rule. In reducing the frequency
of required periodic contacts with knowledgeable health professionals, self-monitoring and personal attention
to health become a more important part of the individual airman's responsibility for flight safety. 
This notice also proposes to amend  61.39 to require that applicants must possess at least a third-class medical
certificate or the third-class privileges of a first- or second-class medical certificate valid under proposed
 61.23 in order to be eligible for a flight test for a certificate, or an aircraft or instrument rating. The proposal
amends  69.39 to coincide with the duration changes in  61.23, as discussed above. 

As noted above, the FAA developed its proposal through review of the literature, survey of the medical practices of
the Department of Defense, analysis of National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) accident data and its own aeromedical
certification data, consideration of the data developed by the Johns Hopkins University, and in consideration of
the part 67 proposal announced in this notice. The proposed examination spacing represents the agency's view of an
optimum schedule in terms of estimated detectable pathology in the airman population and of the burden of required
examinations.

No change in the scope of required examinations was proposed by Notice 82-15, Duration of Medical Certificates.
Where an applicant for medical certification demonstrates by history or by findings that additional or more detailed
medical evaluation is required, current regulations permit the FAA to obtain it. The routine examination used for
many years has proven adequate for the identification of those airmen who should be further evaluated yet places only
minimum burden on that majority of persons who can be immediately certificated. Nevertheless, the FAA announced
and conducted a complete review of the standards for airman medical certification (47 FR 16298, April 15, 1982 and
47 FR 30795; July 15, 1982), and examination scope was one object of the review. The larger part of this notice announces
proposals related to standards and administrative procedures for airman medical certification. 


History of Medical Standards 


Airman medical standards have been in effect for many years. The 1938 Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR parts 20 and
21, 1938) under the authority of the Air Commerce Act contained minimum requirements for the physical condition of
airmen. The early rules did not provide for the issuance of airman medical certificates. However, they did require
that an appropriate physical examination be given before a pilot could be tested for a pilot certificate. In 1942,
a system for the issuance of medical certificates was adopted that provided for the issuance of first-, second-, and
third-class medical certificates. 
Discretion in the issuance of medical certificates has always been a feature of the FAA medical certification system.
Over the years this feature has been modified but the basic provision for special issuance of a medical certificate
to a person who does not meet the required medical standards has remained. To be granted a special issuance, an airman
has had to demonstrate by operational experience, flight testing, special practical evaluation, or a special medical
evaluation that he or she can carry out the appropriate airman duties without endangering public safety during the
prescribed time period of the medical certificate. 
A number of specific changes to the medical standards took effect in 1959. Electrocardiographic examination was
required of first-class certificate applicants. The ECG is to demonstrate the absence of myocardial infarction
and to identify other cardiovascular conditions. A second amendment provided for additional medical standards
related to a person's general physical condition and nervous system. These revisions were based primarily on a study
conducted by the Flight Safety Foundation, Inc. (FSF). The study proposed that the existing certification criteria
be expanded to cover the following specific medical conditions: 
(1) An established diagnosis of diabetes requiring insulin or other hypoglycemic treatment agents; 
(2) A history of myocardial infarction or other evidence of coronary artery disease; and, 
(3) A history of an established diagnosis of psychosis, severe psychoneurosis, severe personality abnormality,
epilepsy, chronic alcoholism or drug addiction. 
The FSF position was that the existence of any of the above conditions was an appropriate basis for disqualification
for any class of medical certificate. The FSF based its recommendation on the belief, at that time, that medical prognostication
for these conditions was too imprecise to provide assurance that these conditions would not interfere with the safe
piloting of an aircraft. The FSF found that the likelihood of an occurrence of a partially or totally incapacitating
state directly related to these conditions was so great that an airman with one of these conditions posed a potential
hazard to flight safety. As a result of the FSF's recommendations, the procedures were amended to prohibit the granting
of special issuances to airmen with these conditions. The Federal Aviation Act of 1958, however, provided for the
granting of exemptions by the Administrator. In 1960, the FAA specified that the existing general exemption procedures
applied to the medical standards. 
Rapid developments in medical knowledge about the disqualifying conditions and the development of improved techniques
for prediction of their risk for incapacitation led the FAA shortly afterwards to grant exemptions, with appropriate
limitations, to many persons with these conditions. Though exemptions were available, requests from individuals
with severe manifestations of some conditions were denied. 
In 1971, the authority to grant or deny petitions for exemption from part 67 was delegated to the Federal Air Surgeon
(Amendment 11-11; 36 FR 3462; February 25, 1971). This revision was designed to reduce administrative processing
time and lower costs for the FAA in the granting of exemptions. The FAA granted over 3,000 medical exemptions in the
ensuing years. Overall, the safety record of airmen who were granted exemptions has been at least as good as that of
the general population of airmen who hold medical certificates issued under the medical standards.

In 1982, the FAA amended part 67 in several areas (47 FR 16298; April 15, 1982). First, any disqualifying condition
which previously required a formal petition for exemption was permitted to be considered for certification through
special issuance procedures. Second, the prerequisite agency administrative review and decision process leading
to eligibility for NTSB review of denial actions was streamlined. Third, authority was delegated to the Federal Air
Surgeon to place functional limitations on medical certificates. Fourth, 
 67.19 was amended to state that the Federal Air Surgeon, in granting special issuances to applicants for private
pilot certificates, considers the freedom of these applicants to accept reasonable risks to their person or property
that are not acceptable in the exercise of commercial or airline transport privileges, and at the same time, considers
the need to protect the safety of persons and property in other aircraft and on the ground. Fifth, clarifying interim
cardiovascular standards were issued. Sixth, the alcoholism standard was revised to conform to the Comprehensive
Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism Prevention, Treatment, and Rehabilitation Act of 1970. In addition to the amendments
to part 67, the preamble to the 1982 final rule announced that in accordance with Executive Order 12291, Federal Regulations,
the FAA would undertake an overall review of the medical standards in part 67. This total and comprehensive review
was described as a major rulemaking effort that would involve obtaining the views of the medical profession and all
other interested parties and result in significant revision of part 67.

Current Requirements_Medical Certification of Airmen 


Part 67 of the FAR provides for the issuance of three classes of medical certificates. A first-class medical certificate
is required to exercise the privileges of an airline transport pilot certificate. Second- and third-class medical
certificates are needed to exercise the privileges of commercial and private pilot certificates, respectively.

An applicant who is found to meet the appropriate medical standards, based on a medical examination and an evaluation
of the applicant's history and condition, is entitled to a medical certificate without restrictions or limitations
other than the prescribed limitation as to its duration. These medical standards are currently set forth in   67.13,
67.15, and 67.17 (14 CFR part 67). 
An applicant for a medical certificate who is unable to meet the standards in   67.13, 67.15, or 67.17 may,
nevertheless, be issued a medical certificate. Procedures for granting special issuances or exemptions have always
been available, and, thus, the standards have never been ``absolutely disqualifying,'' in the sense that certification
is permanently denied all who do not meet the standards. 
Under  67.19, ``Special issue of medical certificates,'' at the discretion of the Federal Air Surgeon, acting
on behalf of the Administrator under  67.25 of the FAR, a special flight test, practical test, or medical evaluation
may be conducted to determine that, notwithstanding the applicant's inability to meet the applicable medical standard,
airman duties can be performed, with appropriate limitations or conditions, without endangering public safety.
If this determination can be made, a medical certificate may be issued with appropriate limitations to ensure safety.

Discussion of the Proposal


The FAA proposes to amend part 67 to incorporate additions and changes in the specific medical standards and scope
of examination and in the administrative procedures pertaining to airman medical certification. The FAA also proposes
to recodify and partly reorganize part 67 to improve readers' accessibility to specific standards and procedural
requirements. Additional changes are proposed to improve syntax and correct errors. Section and sub-section references
are adjusted as necessary to reflect additions, deletions, and reorganization. Because the proposed medical standards
are not meant to be exhaustive in naming all medical conditions that are disqualifying, the word ``includes'' rather
than the word ``are'' is used in each section of the medical standards. Disqualifying medical conditions are not limited
to those representative conditions listed in the proposed standards. Medical conditions may be identified during
an examination which are related to a specific medical category of a section in the proposed standards but are not specifically
named in the standards (e.g., respiratory malignancy). These medical conditions would be considered under the General
Medical Condition section of the medical standards. 
The proposal is based on the FAA's review of part 67, on the FAA's judgment regarding the AMA Report recommendations,
and on public comment relevant to those recommendations and to the standards generally. The following discussion
of the proposal presents under each subject heading a discussion of the current rule, the AMA recommendations, and
the proposed rule. Also included in this preamble is a response to the comments received on the review of part 67 (Docket
No. 23190). 


Distant Visual Acuity 


The current standards for applicants for first- or second-class airman medical certificates require that the uncorrected
distant visual acuity be not poorer than 20/100 and the corrected acuity not poorer than 20/20 in each eye, separately.
Applicants for third-class certificates are required to meet a standard of distant visual acuity of 20/50 or better
in each eye, separately, without correction; or, if poorer than 20/50, a corrected distant visual acuity of 20/30.
For third-class airman medical certification there is no standard for minimum acceptable uncorrected distant visual
acuity. 
The FAA practice for many years has been to grant any class certificate requested, regardless of uncorrected distant
acuity, if the required minimum vision is present or achieved through conventional corrective lenses (spectacles
or contact lenses), there is no evidence of significant eye pathology, and the person is otherwise eligible. For first-
and second-class certification, this has been accomplished through the special issuance process. 
Thousands of airmen exercising airline transport pilot, commercial pilot, private pilot, student pilot, and air
traffic control tower operator certificates have demonstrated their ability to safely perform their jobs while
using corrective lenses for distant visual acuity that is poorer than 20/100 in each eye. 

The AMA Report recognizes that the uncorrected distant visual acuity standards for first- and second-class certification
may be too stringent and recommends that they be changed from 20/100 to 20/200 without offering a rationale for the
specific recommendation of 20/200. The FAA notes that this recommended standard is consistent, in part, with the
standards of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). 
In response to the AMA recommendation, in mid-1986, the agency simplified the procedure for special issuance of certification
in cases where the applicant for a first- or second-class certificate demonstrates uncorrected distant vision worse
than 20/100 but not worse than 20/200. AME's were given permission to evaluate applicants without further referral
to eye specialists or to the agency for decision. In the absence of significant eye pathology, the AME may, after telephone
coordination with the agency, issue any class certificate. Individuals whose distant vision is poorer than 20/200
can be granted certification only by the FAA, after evaluation by an eye specialist. The FAA has found through experience
that safety is not adversely affected by permitting medical certification at any level of uncorrected acuity. Little,
if any, disqualifying eye pathology is found through the special evaluations of applicants whose vision corrects
to acceptable levels, and AME's are able to identify those whose findings suggest the need for further examination
by specialists. Therefore, the FAA proposes under   67.103(a) and 67.203(a) the deletion of the current
uncorrected acuity standard for first- and second-class certification, thereby administratively simplifying
the certification process and reducing costs to airmen and to the agency. The FAA intends, however, to retain the current
requirement for first- and second-class certification that distant visual acuity be, or correct to, not poorer than
20/20 in each eye separately. 
For third-class certification the FAA proposes under 
 67.303(a) that the standard be amended to require a distant visual acuity of not poorer than 20/40 in each eye,
separately, with or without correction. This amendment eliminates the confusing current minimum acuity standard
(20/30 if corrective lenses are used and 20/50 if not used) and is consistent with safety and with the standards commonly
used by state automobile driver licensing authorities. It also reflects the ICAO standards for private pilots, and
it includes the AMA Report recommendation for minimum distant visual acuity without correction. 


Near Visual Acuity 


The current near visual acuity standard for first-class medical certification is expressed as ``* * *
at least v=1.00 at 18 inches with each eye separately, with or without corrective glasses.'' The near visual acuity
standard for second-class medical certification is based on the ability to pass a test showing that the applicant
can read official aeronautical maps. Currently the rules for third-class medical certification have no near visual
acuity requirements. 
 The AMA Report recommends several revisions to the near visual acuity standards. The AMA Report points out that the
current vision terminology of first-class medical certification is antiquated and unfamiliar to most AME's and
ophthalmologists. The AMA also notes that the Near Vision Acuity Test Card, FAA Form 8500-1, contains letters
that are to be used at 16 inches while the current standards are established for 18 inches.

The AMA Report recommends the same near visual acuity standards for all three classes of medical certification: a
near vision of 20/40, Snellen equivalent, at 16 inches in each eye separately, with or without corrective lenses.
In addition, the AMA Report recommends, at age 50 or older, a near vision standard of 20/40, Snellen equivalent, at
both 16 inches and 32 inches in each eye separately, with or without corrective lenses. 
Additional requirements are imposed after age 50 because, with age, the eye loses the ability to accommodate for close
viewing distances, a condition called ``presbyopia.'' The AMA Report states: 



It is important while piloting to be able to see clearly at close distances, as when looking at maps, and at intermediate
distances, as when viewing the instrument panel. This is especially important in night flying. Diminished intermediate
visual acuity due to presbyopia in an individual 50 years of age or older may be further compromised by bifocal correction.
Trifocal or progressive power lenses may be necessary for clear vision at distance, intermediate, and near. 



The AMA Report recommends that the appropriate necessary corrective lenses must be worn while exercising the privileges
of the certificate. 


The proposed rule at   67.103(b) and 67.203(b) follows the AMA Report recommendations except that a standard
for intermediate visual acuity is not proposed for third-class medical certification (see proposed  67.303(b)).
Also, the proposed rule would require only that the corrective lenses be available while exercising the privileges
of the certificate. 
The FAA is not proposing an intermediate visual acuity standard for third-class certification in recognition of
the lower level of responsibility inherent in noncommercial flight operations. 
The proposal does not require that corrective lenses for near or intermediate visual acuity be worn during all flight
operations because this is a matter better left to the discretion of the pilot. FAA practice and the FAR currently permit
airmen to exercise their certificates when any required corrective lenses for near vision are in their possession.
This permits, at the airman's option, use of separate near and distance spectacles; contact lenses for distance with
the addition of spectacles for near; unifocal contact lenses that correct for both near and distance; bifocal spectacles;
or continuously variable focus spectacles. If the airman requires correction only for near vision, spectacles,
half-spectacles, or bifocal spectacles without power in the distance portion may be used. 
From among these options, an airman should be able to choose his or her method of visual correction while piloting an
aircraft. A requirement that all airmen wear their correction for near vision while flying would significantly and,
in the absence of demonstrated problems, unnecessarily limit their choice of visual aids. The FAA has no evidence
that significant operational problems are occurring with the use of corrective lenses for near vision. Therefore,
the proposed requirement for corrected intermediate vision in older airmen can be met through possession of additional
spectacles of the appropriate power or by use of trifocal lenses or lenses of continuously variable focus, as desired.



Color Vision 


The current standards for first-class medical certification require ``normal color vision'' ( 67.13(b)(3));
second- and third-class certification require ``ability to distinguish aviation signal red, aviation signal green,
and white.'' (  67.15(b)(5) and 67.17(b)(3)). 
In current practice, applicants for certification are tested by use of standard pseudoisochromatic plates or by
other approved devices. A passing score defines the applicant as not color deficient. Failure indicates a color deficiency
and requires that any certificate issued be limited, prohibiting flight at night or by color signal control. This
limitation can, however, be removed through the successful completion of a practical signal light test or of a medical
flight test, as appropriate for the class certificate sought and the level of aviation experience of the applicant.

Airmen are routinely granted second- or third-class medical certificates without restriction if they pass the signal
light test. When they have the experience required for an 
airline transport pilot certificate and pass the medical flight test, first-class certification is granted. An
experienced airman rarely fails a medical flight test given for deficient color vision. 
Safety is further enhanced by the thorough training and testing given airmen seeking authorization to pilot new aircraft.
Through use of actual aircraft or of simulators, instructors, check airmen, and flight inspectors have an opportunity
to identify and, if necessary, recommend restrictions for those individuals who encounter difficulty with color.

The AMA Report states: 



* * * the hazard to aviation safety of anomalous color vision is not clear. No studies have shown that
color deficiency has been a direct cause of accidents. On the other hand, color is an important constituent of aircraft
devices such as instrument panel gauges and warning lights, and of airport landmarks, such as beacons and runway lights.




The AMA Report recommends that testing for color vision remain part of the routine periodic examination of airmen.
The suggested standards include the retention of ``normal color vision for first-class certification and ``ability
to distinguish aviation signal red, aviation signal green, and white'' for third-class certification. The AMA Report
suggests, however, that the standard for second-class certification be changed to that for first-class. The AMA
Report notes an increasing use of color in instrument displays for advanced aircraft but less frequent use of colored
signal lights in today's flight environment. Despite these diverging trends and the absence of accident data, prudence
dictates some continued concern for the color perception of airmen. 


The FAA, therefore, proposes at   67.103(c), 67.203(c), and 67.303(c) that testing at the time of the
periodic medical examination be continued as recommended, but that the standard for all classes of certification
be, ``Ability to perceive those colors necessary for the safe performance of airman duties.'' The standard is consistent
with that of the ICAO and reflects the agency's experience and practice for many years. Tests, instructions, and scoring
criteria are provided to AME's in the ``Guide for Aviation Medical Examiners.'' 
Certification relative to deficient color vision ultimately is based on performance. It is appropriate, therefore,
that the standard be related to the job requirement and that it be the same for each class of medical certificate.

Other Pathology of the Eye 


The current standard is worded differently for each class of certification but without significant difference of
meaning. In accordance with the AMA recommendations, therefore, revision is made to correct the spelling of the plural
word ``adnexa'' and to provide for the same standard for all classes of certification, at proposed   67.103(e),
67.203(e), and 67.303(d). 


Eye Fusion 


This standard, which applies only to first- and second-class certification, is revised to correct spelling and to
eliminate gender-specific pronouns. No substantive revisions are proposed for this standard. (See proposed   67.103(f)
and 67.203(f)). 


Intraocular Pressure 






The AMA Report recommends for all three classes of certification the measurement of intraocular pressure after the
age of 40 to identify glaucoma. The basis for this recommendation is that glaucoma may appear in two forms. One, closed-angle
glaucoma, is acute, painful, and potentially impairing; the other, open-angle glaucoma, is subtle, painless, and
progressive. Either form can be destructive to vision. Since, in many cases, open-angle glaucoma is not noticed by
the individual until after permanent changes in visual fields have occurred, a search for it should be a part of any
routine health maintenance examination. 
Current regulations have no standard for intraocular pressure, however, and the FAA is not proposing standards at
this time. While the recommendations of the AMA Report suggest that everyone might benefit from regular measurement
of intraocular pressure, the risk to flight safety appears minimal in comparison to the cost and difficulty of testing.



Hearing 


Current standards for hearing are as follows: (1) for first-class medical certification the person must be able to
hear the whispered voice at 20 feet with each ear separately or demonstrate a hearing acuity of at least 50 percent of
normal in each ear as shown by a standard audiometer; (2) for second-class certification, the person must be able to
hear the whispered voice at 8 feet in each ear separately; and (3) for third-class certification, the person must be
able to hear the whispered voice at 3 feet in one ear. The use of the whispered voice has raised questions of accuracy
and validity in the aviation environment. Pure tone audiometry is considered a more scientific and accepted method
for determining hearing capabilities and for documenting changes in that capability over a period of time. The present
procedure, however, has served well in enabling AME's to identify for referral and evaluation those individuals
whose hearing acuity is less than normal. 
Testing accomplished by the AME serves as a screen to identify those individuals who should receive more specialized
initial and periodic future evaluations. Almost all hearing-impaired applicants, however, receive special issuance
of a certificate after documentation of their condition. Many undergo practical testing to determine their functional
aviation capabilities. In the absence of other significant pathologic conditions, the certification decision
regarding hearing relates only to the individual's ability to safely exercise airman privileges. Medical flight
tests are used frequently for this determination, and the subject may use hearing aids, if necessary. Though an airman
may regularly use a hearing aid for activities not involving flight, the normal aircraft communication equipment
may serve as well, and the agency does not, in such cases, mandate the wearing of an aid. Special issuance is possible,
especially for applicants for third-class medical certification, in the presence of total deafness. Restrictions
on the exercise of airman privileges are applied to maintain safety in cases of total or functionally significant
deafness, and agency experience demonstrates that these practices have been successful and appropriate. 



The AMA Report recommends that speech discrimination be the basic screening examination used for certification
for all three classes. If sound field or speech testing audiometry equipment is unavailable, pure tone audiometry
is offered as an alternative. Speech testing would be accomplished either binaurally or monaurally, while pure tone
audiometry would apply a ``better ear'' and ``poorer ear'' standard. The AMA Report suggests individual consideration
when an applicant fails the standard tests. 
The FAA agrees with the AMA Report that the standards for hearing and for testing should be the same for all classes of
medical certification. 
However, it is unlikely that equipment appropriate for speech discrimination testing, as proposed by the AMA Report,
will be available to all AME's. In keeping with the intention of the AMA Report and in the interest of cost, availability,
simplicity, and functional adequacy, the FAA believes and, therefore, proposes at   67.105(a), 67.205(a),
and 67.305(a) that the basic screening test administered to all applicants be a spoken voice test. This test is included
as part of Hearing Requirement No. 1 and Hearing Requirement No. 2, Chapter 6._ Medical Requirements, Personnel Licensing,
International Standards and Recommended Practices, Annex 1 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation,
ICAO. It has been implemented in many countries and is easily described and administered. The conversational voice
test is not inconsistent with the AMA Report emphasis on speech discrimination. The proposed standards would require
that a person be able (1) to hear an average conversational voice in a quiet room, using both ears, at a distance of 6 feet;
(2) understand speech by audiometric speech discrimination testing to a score of at least 70 percent obtained in one
ear or in a sound field environment; or (3) provide acceptable results of pure tone audiometric testing in accordance
with a table that is provided in the rule. 
Audiometric speech discrimination or pure tone audiometric testing are proposed as alternatives or for the further
evaluation of individuals who show reduced hearing acuity in the conversational voice test. The proposed standard
would apply to the examination of applicants without use of their hearing aids. Need for these devices to meet the standard
suggests that a more detailed evaluation is appropriate before certification, and that special issuance with periodic
reevaluation may be necessary. 


Ear, Nose, Throat, and Equilibrium 


In addition to hearing (discussed above), current ear, nose, throat, and equilibrium standards specify: no acute
or chronic disease of the middle or internal ear; no disease of the mastoid; no unhealed perforation of the eardrum;
no disease or malformation that would interfere with or be aggravated by flying; and no disturbance in equilibrium.

The AMA Report recommends, for all three classes, a change of the standard to specify, ``No acute or chronic disease
of the middle or internal ear that will cause acute paroxysms or unpredictable attacks of vertigo.'' Also, the AMA
Report recommends an additional standard that specifies, ``No disease or malformation of the oral cavity, pharynx,
or larynx that would interfere with clear and effective speech communication.'' All other standards in the current
rule would be deleted. 
For the most part, the proposed rule at   67.105(b), 67.205(b), and 67.305(b) follows the AMA Report recommendations.
It requires that there be no ``disease or condition of the middle or internal ear, nose, oral cavity, pharynx, or larynx''
that will interfere with or be aggravated by flying or that will interfere with clear and effective speech communication.
In addition, in the proposed rule at   67.105(c), 67.205(c), and 67.305(c) there may be no disease or condition
that may involve vertigo or a disturbance of equilibrium. 
Current standards reflect specific concerns about infections of the ear and mastoid and the damage caused by such
infections to the ear drum and middle ear. The proposed standards more generally and properly address diseases, or
conditions of the ear, nose, or throat that may interfere with speech communication or equilibrium, factors that
are important for safety. 


Mental 


Mental disorders may adversely affect judgment and behavior in ways that create potential hazards in aviation. The
current standards for all three classes of airman medical certification, therefore, list certain psychiatric disorders
for which medical certification would be denied. The list was derived from the recommendations made by the Flight
Safety Foundation in 1959. These disorders are considered to constitute a definite hazard to safety in flight when
determined to be present in an airman by established medical history or by clinical diagnosis. As listed in the current
regulations, any of the following disorders is a cause for denial: (1) a personality disorder that manifests itself
in overt acts; (2) a psychosis; (3) alcoholism; and (4) drug dependence. In addition, the current standards provide
for denial of medical certification in the presence of any ``other personality disorder, neurosis, or mental condition
that the Federal Air Surgeon finds makes the applicant unable to safely perform the duties or exercise the privileges
of the airman certificate that he holds or for which he is applying; or may reasonably be expected, within two years
after the finding, to make him unable to perform those duties or exercise those privileges.'' 
The mental standards have been well accepted by the public and by the medical community as practical and effective.
However, with publication of the authoritative reference, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
Third Edition (DSM III), changes in the diagnostic terminology and classification of mental disorders have caused
some confusion. Major illnesses, previously included in the category of ``psychosis,'' are separately described
in the DSM III and are, therefore, no longer considered by some others as covered under the term ``psychosis'' in the
FAR. Since these conditions are of concern in the context of airman medical certification and flight safety, the agency
must amend the mental standards to clarify the position of the FAA. 
The AMA Report recommends amendment of the regulations to include a more extensive and specific list of disqualifying
mental disorders: substance abuse or dependence; schizophrenic disorders; paranoid disorders; psychotic disorders;
major affective disorders (including bipolar disorders and depression); anxiety disorders; dissociative disorders;
impulse disorders; disorders first evident in infancy, childhood, and adolescence; and organic brain syndrome.

The proposed rule at   67.107 (a) through (c), 67.207 (a) through (c), and 67.307 (a) through (c) would
include all of these disorders but would not specifically list them. The current and proposed mental standard lists
a psychosis as a disqualifying disorder. The proposed standard states that ``psychosis'' refers to ``a mental disorder
in which the individual has manifested psychotic symptoms or to a mental disorder in which an individual may reasonably
be expected to manifest psychotic symptoms.'' In this way, two types of persons would be disqualified under this standard:
those who have manifested psychotic symptoms; and those who have not had psychotic symptoms but whose mental condition
is one in which psychotic symptoms may reasonably be expected to develop. Psychotic symptoms are characterized by
a failure to maintain adequate contact with reality. The failure to maintain adequate contact with reality results
in or may reasonably be expected to result in the impairment of judgment, including bizarre, grossly disorganized
behavior; out of control behavior; delusions; or hallucinations. ``Psychosis'' would include schizophrenic disorders,
paranoid disorders, and other disorders such as mood disorders, that sometimes manifest psychotic symptoms. Also
included would be such conditions as schizotypal and borderline personality disorders. Other disqualifying disorders
listed in the AMA Report that are not specifically listed in the proposed rule, such as anxiety disorders and impulse
disorders, may be disqualifying under the general mental provisions of the regulations as they are now, depending
on the severity of the disorders. The particular circumstances of each individual history and medical condition
are considered by the FAA in determining whether such history or condition is disqualifying.

<TEXT>
 

The FAA also proposes, as recommended in the AMA Report, that bipolar disorder be added to the list of disqualifying
conditions. Previously called manic depressive psychosis, this common, major affective disorder now is separately
classified by DSM III and may include individuals who have manifested only mania. Bipolar disorder is not specifically
referenced in current part 67. In consideration of potential risk to flight safety, individuals with this diagnosis
are rarely granted certification. Those few individuals who are determined to be eligible for certification through
the special issuance provisions of the FAR must be followed closely for relapse and recurrence of symptoms. By including
the new terminology, the standards will clearly reflect the agency's concern about this disorder. (Discussion of
how a proposed disqualifying condition may affect a current medical certificate appears under ``Additional Standards
for Disqualification.'') 


Substance Abuse/Dependence 


Additional proposed changes in the mental standards for airmen are influenced by DSM III nomenclature for conditions
involving dependence on or abuse of alcohol, drugs, or other chemical substances. Current regulations list as disqualifying
``alcoholism'' and ``drug dependence.'' The AMA Report points out that DSM III eliminates the term ``alcoholism''
and substitutes the diagnosis of ``substance dependence'' and ``substance abuse.'' As disqualifying conditions,
the AMA Report recommends ``substance abuse, substance dependence and related substance use disorders, including
but not limited to those associated with alcohol; barbiturates; other sedative/hypnotics; muscle relaxants; anxiolytics;
opioids; central nervous system stimulants such as cocaine and amphetamines; and hallucinogens such as phencyclidine,
cannabis, and volatile solvents and gases.'' 
The proposed rule differs from the AMA recommendations in that (1) ``barbiturates'' are not specified separately
since they would be included with ``sedatives and hypnotics;'' (2) the phrase ``and similarly acting sympathomimetics''
would be added to the grouping of ``cocaine'' and ``amphetamines;'' and (3) ``phencyclidine or similarly acting
arylcyclohexylamines,'' ``cannabis,'' and ``volatile solvents and gases'' are listed separately rather than
grouped under ``hallucinogens.'' Additionally, the phrase ``related substance use disorders,'' as proposed,
but not defined in the AMA Report, is not included in this proposal. 
The proposed standard defines ``substance dependence'' and ``substance abuse.'' A medical history or clinical
diagnosis of ``substance dependence'' would disqualify a person for a medical certificate under the standards unless
there is evidence of recovery satisfactory to the Federal Air Surgeon. The proposed changes also are intended to provide
specific regulatory medical standards for excluding from aviation a person who, though not substance dependent,
has abused alcohol within the preceding 
2 years or other substances within the preceding 5 years. These proposed standards respond to the AMA Report as well
as to national concerns about substance abuse. These standards would enhance the agency's ability to examine and
to exclude, where medically appropriate, those airmen who have abused a substance within the time frames stated above
or who have a medical history or a clinical diagnosis of substance dependence. The proposed mental standard retains,
however, current language that permits medical certification under the standards upon presentation of acceptable
evidence of recovery and a specified period of abstinence in the case of alcohol dependence. The proposed rule provides
that clinical evidence of recovery would include sustained total abstinence from alcohol for not less than the preceding
2 years in the case of alcohol dependence, and in the case of other substance dependence, sustained total abstinence
from the substance for not less than the preceding 5 years. The time periods for sustained total abstinence are based
on the AMA recommendations. Other factors considered in determining recovery include the natural history and severity
of the problem; the period of satisfactory recovery since manifestation of the problem; any treatment, as well as
any continuing requirements for treatment, and its nature; any current or recent psychiatric symptoms, aberrant
behavior, or psychiatric or other medical findings; the need for or use of chemical agents; any personality traits
or other recognized factors involving the risk of future recurrence of the problem or the risk of other adverse events;
the period of the person's abstinence from the substance or substances; the number of times treatment was sought and
relapse occurred; the quality of the final treatment effort; the presence of residual medical complications, especially
neurologic manifestations; progress in marital, social, vocational, and educational areas, as appropriate, since
rehabilitation began; commitment to rehabilitation by virtue of continuing contacts with social or professional
agencies, or both, and their opinions and recommendations; and the findings of recent psychiatric and psychologic
evaluations, if appropriate. 
The proposed definition of substance abuse includes two criteria (the first relates to alcohol, the second to other
substances) that state a person would be disqualified if he or she demonstrated recurrent use of a substance in situations
in which that use was physically hazardous. At least one of the uses would have to have taken place within the preceding
2 years in the case of alcohol or 
5 years in the case of other substances. Under this criterion, use in physically hazardous situations need not involve
the same substance or substances. 
A third criterion states that a person who used a prohibited drug as that term is defined in part 121, appendix I of the
FAR would be disqualified. The prohibited drug use would have to have taken place within the preceding 5 years. ``Prohibited
drugs'' as defined in the FAR do not include all substances; however, ``substances'' as defined in this proposal do
include all prohibited drugs. Alcohol, for example, is a substance which may be abused but is not a prohibited drug
as that term is defined under appendix I of part 121. 
A positive drug test result for a prohibited drug is one type of evidence of use. The FAA recognizes that the probative
value of a drug test result varies depending on several factors, including the type of test, circumstances under which
the test was conducted, and other corroborative evidence of drug use. The FAA considers a positive drug test conducted
under any rule or internal program of the Department of Transportation (such as the FAA program required by   121.457
and 135.251 or any other Administration within DOT) to be compelling proof of the use of a prohibited drug for which
the drug test was positive.

With respect to positive drug tests other than those conducted under rules or internal programs of the Department
of Transportation, the FAA would evaluate such test results and the surrounding circumstances on a case-by-case
basis to determine the weight to be accorded them. If one of these tests is positive for substance use, the individual
could be disqualified under the criteria used in the definition of substance abuse or substance dependence. 
A fourth substance abuse criterion states that an individual is medically disqualified if he or she misused a substance
that is found by the Federal Air Surgeon to make the person unable to safely perform the duties or exercise the privileges
of the airman certificate applied for or held; or may reasonably be expected, within 2 years after the finding, to make
the person unable to perform those duties or exercise those privileges. The finding of the Federal Air Surgeon is based
on the case history and appropriate, qualified medical judgment. Again, as in the two previous criteria the misuse
must have taken place within the preceding 2 years in the case of alcohol or 
5 years in the case of other substances. 
As with the current regulation, certification before completion of the 2- or 5-year abstinence/recovery period
is possible under the special issuance provisions of the FAR if an individual evaluation demonstrates that the applicant
is able to perform airman duties without endangering public safety. 


Neurological Conditions 


Current regulations on neurological conditions list as disqualifying for all three classes anyone with a history
or clinical diagnosis of epilepsy or disturbance of consciousness without satisfactory medical explanation of
cause. Nor may a person have any other convulsive disorder, disturbance of consciousness, or neurological condition
that the Federal Air Surgeon finds makes the person unable to perform airman privileges safely, or may reasonably
be expected, within 2 years after the finding to make the airman unable to perform airman privileges. 
A detailed discussion of neurological conditions, their evaluation, and prognosis is provided within the AMA Report.
Additional information and recommendations are contained in ``Neurological and Neurosurgical Conditions Associated
with Aviation Safety,'' a major report prepared in 1979 by representatives of the American Academy of Neurology and
the American Association of Neurological Surgeons through an earlier contract between the FAA and the AMA. Neither
report proposes detailed, objective criteria and tests that could be included in the standards and by which medical
certification could be determined. They discuss the medical techniques now available for evaluation of individual
airmen and the significance of the results obtained from their use. 
Both reports emphasize the significance of seizure disorders. The few changes to the standards suggested by the AMA
Report are proposed by the FAA at   67.109, 67.209, and 67.309, for all three classes of airman medical
certificates and include the addition of ``a single seizure'' to the list of disqualifying conditions; the use of
``seizure'' rather than ``convulsive'' to describe disorders that may be found disqualifying by the Federal Air
Surgeon; and the addition of a ``transient loss of control of nervous system function(s) without satisfactory explanation
of the cause'' as a specific basis for disqualification. This last proposed addition clarifies the agency's aeromedical
concern about such events whether or not they are characterized as disturbances of consciousness. (Discussion of
how a proposed disqualifying condition may affect a current medical certificate appears under ``Additional Standards
for Disqualification.'') 
Other neurological conditions described in the AMA Report, though of significance in questions of aeromedical certification,
are not proposed as separate standards. The proposed regulatory provisions provide an adequate medical basis for
assuring safety. 
The AMA Report recommended that an abbreviated mental examination of four questions be included in each airman medical
certification examination. If one or more responses are incorrect, the Mini-Mental Status Examination of Folstein,
Folstein and McHugh (Folstein) would be given. The FAA studied the feasibility of the AMA Report's recommendation.
It found that neither the AMA-recommended test nor the test by Folstein provides a useful screening device, alone
or in combination, for airman neurological status. There was an unacceptable incidence of false negatives. Additionally,
neither test, alone or in combination, provides predictors of any skills known to be relevant to piloting. 


Cardiovascular Conditions 


To meet its statutory responsibility to ensure public safety, on May 17, 1982 (47 FR 16298; April 15, 1982), the FAA
amended part 67 of the FAR in part to clarify the cardiovascular standards. This change codified FAA policy that individuals
with a history of coronary heart disease not be medically certificated for the exercise of airman privileges under
  67.13, 67.15, or 67.17. These individuals would continue to be certificated through the discretionary
special issuance procedures after a separate determination that their disease no longer represents a risk to aviation
safety. During that rulemaking procedure, a number of commenters expressed the belief that the cardiovascular standards
for medical certification should be relaxed. Commenters also suggested that those standards be revised to set forth
more detailed, objective criteria and tests by which medical certification could be determined, and a group of concerned
pilots submitted a petition for rulemaking (to be discussed later in this document) that was intended to accomplish
such a revision. Many commenters contended that the standards failed to take into account the advances in medicine
that had occurred since part 67 was issued. The FAA announced that these issues would be addressed in its review of part
67.

Accordingly, the FAA specifically asked the committee of consultants assembled by the AMA to review the cardiovascular
standards in light of recent advances and current concepts in cardiovascular medicine. Further, the FAA asked the
physicians to develop suggestions for inclusion of diagnostic and prognostic techniques in the standards, if appropriate
and feasible. The final AMA Report, however, indicates that the group could not establish, in the standards, qualifications
for medical certification. Instead, the AMA Report suggests general retention of the current cardiovascular standards
and format with additions to further improve their utility for ensuring aviation safety. In the presence of known
cardiovascular disease, certification decisions still would require professional evaluation of multiple medical
factors rather than verification of the results of a test specified in the published standards. The individual airman
who fails to meet the published standards would continue to be considered in accordance with the discretionary special
issuance provisions. 

The AMA Report does recommend a number of changes. Additional cardiac conditions are suggested for inclusion in the
standards as rendering an airman unqualified for certification; revised standards for acceptable blood pressure
are given; maximum levels of blood cholesterol are proposed for some commercial airmen; and routine periodic electrocardiography
for all airmen is recommended. Rather than changes to the standards, the AMA Report emphasizes the need for careful
evaluation of all applicants prior to certification. Where individuals are found either to have cardiovascular
disease or to have factors or findings indicative of increased risk, more exhaustive evaluations are suggested before
certification can be granted and before periodic renewal of certification. Recommendations for these evaluations
are included in the AMA Report and are generally consistent with long-standing FAA practice. 


Coronary Heart Disease 



The FAA proposes that the present standards pertaining to coronary heart disease and its manifestations remain unchanged.
As amended in 1982, these standards are clear and have provided a firm medical basis for denying airman privileges
to individuals with significant, active coronary heart disease who might endanger public safety. This condition
precludes routine airman medical certification because it is a documented cause of in-flight pilot incapacitation,
and it is progressive in nature. 

The FAA will continue to evaluate airmen who fail to meet this standard to determine their eligibility for a discretionary
special issuance of medical certification. Certification will be based upon acceptable evidence that the individual
has recovered and that his or her anatomic and physiologic cardiac status would justify the subsequent exercise of
airman privileges. Appropriate functional limitations of airman privileges may be applied, and periodic follow-up
medical reevaluations may be required to detect any relapse or progression of disease. This procedure protects the
public while providing a means of relief for those individuals whose heart disease has stabilized sufficiently to
pose an acceptable risk. Since adoption of the amendments in 1982, an increasing number of airmen have been found eligible
and granted certification. 



Additional Standards for Disqualification 



The FAA also proposes additions to the standards in proposed paragraphs (a) (4), (5), and (6) of   67.111,
67.211, and 67.311, providing that a history or clinical diagnosis of cardiac valve replacement, implantation of
a permanent cardiac pacemaker, or heart replacement would make the subject person unqualified for certification
under the standards. These amendments are consistent with the AMA Report and the opinions of agency consultants and
reflect the serious nature of each of the conditions. Among the agency's concerns are failure of prosthetic heart
valves, pacemaker malfunction or progression of underlying disease that has required artificial cardiac pacing,
organ rejection, or the complications of immunosuppression. While the FAA may determine that an airman with a history
or clinical diagnosis of any of these conditions may be granted a discretionary special issuance of certification,
such history would preclude certification until specialized medical evaluation confirms adequate recovery and
function and the absence of significant risk in terms of the aviation environment. Where special issuance of certification
is granted, the regulations will provide for periodic medical reevaluations, if appropriate, for subsequent certification.


Under the proposed medical standards, a small number of airmen, who currently hold certificates as a result of an order
of the NTSB, would become disqualified from further medical certification because of the addition of specifically
disqualifying medical conditions. These airmen had been denied medical certification by the FAA under a current
general medical standard. Under the general medical standards, an individual is denied certification by the FAA
when he or she has a condition which the Federal Air Surgeon finds may reasonably be expected to make the individual
unable to safely perform pilot duties. For example, the FAA has denied certification to airmen who have had cardiac
valve replacement and the NTSB has ordered certification in some of these cases. Under the proposed standards a medical
history of cardiac valve replacement would be specifically disqualifying and those airmen would no longer be entitled
to certification. It is expected, however, that the possible certification of such individuals would be reviewed
under the Federal Air Surgeon's special issuance authority once the FAA evaluates the case and is satisfied with the
airman's condition since the NTSB ordered certification. Such a disposition of these cases would be consistent with
the FAA's practice after the 1982 amendment of the cardiovascular standards rendered several airmen disqualified
whose certification under the old medical standards had been ordered by the NTSB.

Other AMA Recommendations 



The AMA Report also suggests that certain other cardiac diagnoses be added to the standards as specific disqualifications.
FAA certification experience, however, has not indicated a need for regulatory change in cases of cardiomyopathy,
congenital heart disease, valvular heart disease or murmurs, pericarditis, or disturbances of heart rhythm or conduction.
The agency agrees with the AMA Report that these conditions pose a potential risk but has found that the existing standards
and procedures provide adequate opportunity for identification and evaluation of the affected airmen and a regulatory
basis for denial of airman privileges, if appropriate. 



Electrocardiography 



Current standards require that applicants for first-class medical certificates submit a resting, 12-lead ECG at
the time of their first examination after reaching age 35 and, annually, after reaching age 40. They must show by these
ECG's, ``an absence of myocardial infarction.'' An ECG made within the 90 days before an examination for a first-class
medical certificate is accepted as meeting the requirement. There now is no routine requirement for submission of
ECG's by applicants for second- or third-class medical certificates. 

The AMA Report notes that it is well established that up to 20 percent of myocardial infarctions (``heart attacks'')
fail to produce symptoms that bring a person to a physician. The resting ECG often shows evidence of a prior myocardial
infarction and patterns of anatomic change and other abnormalities that are also associated with an increased risk
of coronary artery disease. The AMA Report adds that many of the most common alterations of cardiac conduction seen
on the routine ECG are not associated with symptoms or with easily discerned physical findings. Yet, each of these
electrocardiographic findings causes special concerns regarding medical certification and may result in recommendations
for additional assessment. 

The AMA Cardiovascular Committee, in recognition of these facts, recommended that the requirement for electrocardiography
be modified in an effort to increase the assurance that significant cardiac disease in pilots will be detected. The
committee suggested that, in addition to the current requirement for first-class certificates, an ECG be made on
all applicants for medical certification at the time they first apply. These ECG's would serve as a valuable medical
baseline for future comparison. Further, the committee recommended that an ECG be made on applicants for second-class
medical certificates at ages 35 and 40 years and every 2 years thereafter, and on applicants for third-class certificates
at age 40 years and every 6 years thereafter. The committee also suggested that the standard be modified to include
the agency's concern for any clinically significant electrocardiographic abnormality rather than the current
limited specification of myocardial infarction alone. 

In proposed  67.211(d), all applicants for second-class airman medical certification would be required to
submit ECG's at the first examination after reaching age 35 and, biennially, after reaching age 40. There is reciprocity
between the first- and second-class cardiovascular standards in satisfying the ``after reaching the 35th birthday''
and the ``after reaching the 40th birthday'' ECG requirements. For example, an application with an ECG that satisfies
the ``age 35'' ECG requirement for first-class medical certification also satisfies the ``age 35'' ECG requirement
of an application for second-class medical certification and vice versa. In the case of the ``after reaching the 40th
birthday'' ECG requirement, however, the time provisions of   67.111(d)(3) and 67.211(d)(3), as discussed
below, are also required for reciprocity. 

The proposed time provision for the ``after reaching the 40th birthday'' periodic ECG for first-class medical certification
requires that an applicant submit an ECG with the application unless, within the preceding 9 months, an ECG was provided
as part of an application for medical certification. That is, if an applicant has submitted an ECG as part of an application
for airman medical certification within 9 months of the current application, the applicant does not have to submit
another ECG for the current application. Thus, after reaching the 40th birthday, a person who maintains a first-class
medical certificate would be required to have an ECG at alternate applications or approximately every year. In a few
cases, it could be 1 year and 3 months between first-class ECG's. The time provision for the ``after reaching the 40th
birthday'' periodic ECG for second-class medical certification is the preceding 15 months. An applicant maintaining
a second-class medical certificate would be required to have an ECG at alternate applications or approximately every
2 years. In a few cases, it could be 2 years and 3 months between ECG's. The proposed requirement for first-class medical
certification allows more leeway than the current rule. An applicant with a first-class medical certificate could
wait up to 9 months and the ECG of the previous application for a first-class medical certificate would meet the requirement
for the succeeding application for a first-class medical certificate. An applicant with a second-class medical
certificate could wait up to 15 months and the ECG of the second-class medical certificate would meet the requirement
for the succeeding application for second-class medical certification. No ECG requirement is being proposed for
third-class medical certification.

To ensure the currency of an ECG, the FAA proposes in   67.111(e) and 67.211(e) that if a person is required
to submit an ECG as part of an application for medical certification, it must be dated no earlier than 60 days before
the date of the application it is to accompany and must be performed and transmitted according to acceptable standards
and techniques. Of course, there is no requirement to submit an ECG with a current application for medical certification
if a previous ECG submitted as a part of an application for medical certification can satisfy any current ECG requirement.
Sixty days is a longer period than the 30 days recommended by the AMA Report but represents a reduction from the 90 days
now permitted. The agency recognizes that many ECG's are provided by employers or through private physicians other
than the AME, and a reasonable period, such as that proposed, is appropriate for the airman's convenience. Finally,
the FAA did not propose a baseline ECG be performed for either first- or second-class medical certificate applicants
because it had a negative cost analysis and the FAA considers the ECG after age 35 to serve as an adequate baseline ECG.


The FAA also proposes to amend the wording of the standard to require that the affected person ``demonstrate an absence
of myocardial infarction and other clinically significant abnormality on electrocardiographic examination.''
The FAA will continue to require electrocardiography or other appropriate evaluations for any airman whose medical
history or findings suggest it. 



Blood Pressure 



The current medical standard pertaining to blood pressure applies only for first-class medical certificates. Depending
on the person's age and the scope of the examination accomplished, blood pressures from 140 to 170 mm Hg pressure, systolic,
and 
88 to 100 mm Hg pressure, diastolic, are permitted. In practice, 170 mm Hg systolic and 100 mm Hg diastolic have been
considered the maximum allowable pressures for all applicants for second- and third-class certificates. The ICAO
standard provides only that the blood pressure of all airmen be ``within normal limits.'' 

In addition,  67.13(e)(5) of the FAR provides that, ``if an applicant is at least 40 years of age, he must show
a degree of circulatory efficiency that is compatible with the safe operation of aircraft at high altitudes.''

It is rare for an applicant for certification to manifest hypertension (high blood pressure) at the level of the current
standard or above. Current and accepted medical practice for several years has reflected knowledge of the adverse
effects of even mild elevations of blood pressure and treatment is prescribed for most individuals at levels of blood
pressure much lower than the FAA standard for medical certification. If any person is taking medication for hypertension,
FAA practice is to consider the condition as coming under the provisions of present  67.13(f)(2), 

General medical condition, 

of the FAR. This section directs that the applicant have ``no other organic, functional, or structural disease, defect,
or limitation that the Federal Air Surgeon finds makes the applicant unable to safely perform the duties or exercise
the privileges of the airman certificate that he holds or for which he is applying; or may be reasonably expected, within
2 years after the finding, to make him unable to perform those duties or exercise those privileges; * * *''
Certification is conditioned on the findings of a more detailed medical evaluation, including an assessment of cardiovascular
risk factors, the presence or absence of disease of ``target'' organs, the degree of blood pressure control, and of
the medication itself.

The AMA Report recommends that the existing, outmoded standard for blood pressure be replaced. It suggests a sitting
blood pressure standard of 150 mm Hg pressure, systolic, and 95 mm Hg pressure, diastolic, for all pilots. It further
recommends that the systolic level never exceed 160 mm Hg, regardless of the diastolic blood pressure. The AMA Report
notes that its recommendations represent a somewhat less rigid standard for younger airmen and a more rigid standard
for older airmen. Less rigid standards for the younger airmen are appropriate in terms of safety. For older airmen
the more rigid standards respond to data demonstrating the adverse medical significance of the high level of blood
pressure permitted by the current standard.

The FAA agrees that the existing standard relating to blood pressure is outmoded and does not reflect current medical
knowledge or practice. It also finds that current  67.13(e)(5) is medically vague and does not serve a useful
purpose. Accordingly, it proposes that the provisions of  67.13(e) (4) and (5) of the FAR, including the table,
be deleted and replaced by new standards (proposed   67.111(b), 67.211(b), and 67.311(b)) applicable
to all classes of medical certificates. It proposes that average blood pressure while seated not exceed 150 mm Hg,
systolic, or 95 mm Hg, diastolic. For ease of application, the agency will not introduce into the standard the additional
suggestion that the systolic pressure never exceed 160 mm Hg. 

The proposed standard would require more extensive assessment of airmen who require or use antihypertensive medication.
To maintain first-class certification, the assessment will be required at least at annual intervals, usually with
every other application. For second- and third-class certification, valid for 1 year and 2 years, respectively,
the assessment will be required with each application. Unless otherwise determined by the FAA under the special issuance
provisions of the FAR, certificates will be valid for the normal periods and, in most cases, issued by the designated
AME if there are no adverse findings. These procedures are included in current FAA guidelines. 

This proposed amendment would clarify the FAA's concern for the cardiovascular risk represented by hypertension
and the agency's position that persons who are undergoing therapy for hypertension should be evaluated to assess
the degree of risk. Though these standards are being codified for the first time, this evaluation does not represent
a new practice. 



Cholesterol 



Currently no cholesterol standards exist in the regulations. In consideration of the responsibility for public
safety held by airmen exercising pilot privileges in air transport operations, the FAA has partially accepted the
recommendations of the AMA Report that the level of blood cholesterol be determined as part of the examination for
medical certification. The Risk Factor Committee of the AMA that considered risk factors and qualifications for
flying suggested that serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels be determined for all applicants initially and
at 50 years of age. The Cardiovascular Committee of the AMA, however, recommended that a determination of serum cholesterol
be made only for 50-year old applicants for first- and second-class medical certificates who exercise airman duties
in single-pilot commercial operations. Both committees recommended further evaluation if a level greater than
300 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl) of total cholesterol is found. 

The FAA proposes (proposed  67.111(f)) that total serum cholesterol be tested annually as part of the examination
of all applicants for first-class medical certification who have reached their 50th birthday. Unlike a single determination,
an annual requirement will assist the FAA in the identification of adverse trends in cardiovascular risk factors
as airmen age. Applicants whose cholesterol level is determined to exceed 300 mg/dl would be required to undergo an
additional cardiovascular evaluation to determine if significant disease is present, but issuance of a medical
certificate would not be withheld solely on the basis of the cholesterol level. 

The FAA agrees with the AMA Report and with the National Institutes of Health regarding the importance of this risk
factor for disease and believes that the additional cost to the holders of first-class airman medical certificates
is justified by the more effective identification of disease. By limiting this requirement to first-class certificate
holders 50 years of age and older, public benefits are enhanced with minimum costs by targeting the population having
the greatest risk and greatest public responsibility. 

The FAA does not consider feasible the AMA Report recommendation that the serum cholesterol level requirement be
limited to persons who exercise airman duties in single-pilot commercial operations. Individual airmen frequently
perform in a variety of commercial operations or change from one type of operation to another. There are no regulatory
controls for limiting applicability of such a requirement to single-pilot commercial operations.

Hematocrit 


Currently no standard exists in the FAA regulations for blood hematocrit. The AMA Report recommends that all applicants
at age 40, and periodically thereafter, demonstrate a hematocrit within the range of 32 to 55 percent. The requirement
is recommended because the ability of blood to transport oxygen effectively to tissues is dependent on adequate hemoglobin
concentration and on the ability of blood to perfuse organs. Abnormalities of this function can result in incapacitating
organ infarcts. Also, a number of significant medical conditions are often reflected in abnormalities of the blood.
Anemias of various etiology, organ malignancies, polycythemia, lung disease, hemoglobinopathies, coagulation
and thrombotic disorders, hematologic neoplasia, lymphomas, immunodeficiency syndromes, and other disorders
are included in the conditions that may be discovered through examination of the blood. 
The FAA is not proposing to add new standards for blood hematocrit testing at this time. Hematocrit testing would impose
incremental costs on applicants for a first-class airman medical certificate and additional administrative costs
on the FAA. While the recommendations of the AMA Report suggest that hematocrit testing would result in detection
of certain adverse or potentially incapacitating medical conditions, the risk to flight safety appears minimal
in comparison to the cost of testing. The list of specific conditions that would disqualify a person is not proposed
for inclusion in the FAR because the conditions are already covered in the general medical standards. 


Anticoagulation 


Current regulations do not contain specific standards for anticoagulation. Under the general rules of current paragraphs
(f)(2) (i) and (ii) of   67.13, 67.15, and 67.17, the FAA has denied routine certification of persons who
require medication for anticoagulation. The FAA does, however, grant special issuance to a limited number of airmen
who use this type of medication after extensive evaluations of the conditions requiring anticoagulation, the stability
of the airmen's treatment regimens, and the presence or absence of adverse side-effects. Periodic reevaluation
always is required for subsequent certification. 
The AMA Report recommends denial of routine medical certification for any person who uses an anticoagulant medication.
This recommendation is consistent with earlier medical reports such as the report of the Eighth Bethesda Conference
of the American College of Cardiology in 1975, the Report of a Working Party of the Cardiology Committee of the Royal
College of Physicians of London in 1978, The First United Kingdom Workshop in Aviation Cardiology in 1982, and The
Second United Kingdom Workshop in Aviation Cardiology in 1987, and with recommendations of some FAA medical consultants.
Based on its experience with airmen who are taking anticoagulant medication, the FAA believes that some individuals
who receive anticoagulant medications may be granted airman medical certification after careful evaluation of
their specific condition. Such certification represents an exception, however, and must be accomplished under
the special issuance provisions of the FAR, subject to appropriate, periodic medical reevaluation and possible
restrictions. To clarify this position and to meet the FAA's statutory responsibility to ensure public safety, the
FAA proposes (proposed  67.111(c)) to add the use of anticoagulant medication to those conditions specified
in the FAR as disqualifying an individual for certification. (Discussion of how a proposed disqualifying condition
may affect a current medical certificate appears under ``Additional Standards for Disqualification.'') 


Respiratory System 


Current regulations do not contain specific standards pertaining to the respiratory system. The Respiratory System
Committee, in its section of the AMA Report, recommended that all airmen older than 40 years periodically demonstrate
the absence of severe lung disease through spirometry, a simple, non-invasive test available in the physician's
office. The committee stated its concerns for the danger to public safety represented by airmen with serious pulmonary
disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, pulmonary fibrosis, infectious diseases
of the lung, hypoventilation syndromes, chronic interstitial lung disease, and disorders of the respiratory muscles
and bony thorax. Both judgment and the ability to perform complex tasks may be affected adversely by a reduction of
oxygen available to the brain (hypoxia) because of poor pulmonary function, and acute lung disease can cause hypoxia
without warning. Altitude itself affects pulmonary function, so careful assessment of pulmonary status is required
to prevent incapacitation during flight, according to the committee's report.

Tests that measure the actual levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the arterial blood are costly and not generally
available in the aviation medical examiner's office. Careful clinical assessment of respiratory function, including
medical history and physical examination ordinarily are used to separate those applicants requiring further evaluation
of their pulmonary status from those who do not. 
The FAA is not proposing to add a new requirement for routine spirometric testing at this time. Spirometric testing
would impose incremental costs on applicants for all classes of airman medical certificate and additional administrative
costs on the FAA. AME's would be required to purchase the equipment necessary to perform the examination. Under current
practice, individuals with potentially serious pulmonary disease are identified through existing procedures
and referred for further evaluation, including spirometric testing, of their pulmonary status to determine their
eligibility for medical certification. 
The AMA Report also recommends specifically disqualifying diseases and conditions of the respiratory system. These
would include severe lung disease, poorly controlled asthma, sleep disorders, pulmonary hypertension, pneumothorax,
pulmonary emboli, and carcinoma of the lung. The list of specific conditions that would disqualify a person is not
proposed for inclusion in the FAR because the conditions are already covered in the general medical standards. 


Diabetes 


In its discussion of diabetes in the preamble to Amendment 67-11, the FAA stated that the Federal Air Surgeon
would continue to deny certification to individuals who have an established medical history or clinical diagnosis
of diabetes that is controlled by the use of insulin or another hypoglycemic drug (47 FR 16298, April 15, 1982). The
preamble further stated, ``If, in the future, information demonstrating that medical technology has advanced to
the point that diabetes can be controlled without significant risk of incapacitation from hypoglycemia or other
complications becomes available to the FAA, consideration for special issuance of a medical certificate under  67.19
will be possible.'' 
As part of the review of part 67, the AMA Report made recommendations concerning individuals seeking medical certification
who have an established history or clinical diagnosis of diabetes that is controlled by insulin or another hypoglycemic
drug. The AMA Report recommended that persons whose diabetes is adequately controlled with oral hypoglycemic drugs
and who show evidence of stability and freedom from adverse effects be considered for medical certification with
proper medical monitoring. The Endocrine Committee assembled by the AMA believes that the likelihood of incapacitation
from the effects of diabetes or its treatment with current oral hypoglycemic drugs, in those persons medically selected
and monitored, is very remote. The AMA Endocrine Committee recommends that absolute prohibitions of certification
of individuals requiring insulin for control of diabetes be continued. Informal surveys of agency medical consultants,
comments by interested medical practitioners, and review by the FAA medical staff indicate general agreement with
these findings and recommendations of the AMA Report. The more widespread use of technically advanced equipment
and procedures has made it possible for physicians to better select those persons who should be allowed to use, or continue
to use, oral drugs to control their disease. The increased use of simple equipment and tests for self-monitoring gives
the diabetic and the physician a more accurate and timely picture of a person's immediate condition as well as his or
her ability to control blood sugar over time. 
In view of the current consensus of the medical community, the FAA has determined that many individuals whose diabetes
is without complications and acceptably controlled by diet and oral drugs, with appropriate monitoring and other
conditions, can perform the duties authorized by their class of medical certificate without endangering public
safety. Accordingly, though no substantive rule change is proposed to current requirements in paragraph (f)(1)
of   67.13, 67.15, and 67.17, the Federal Air Surgeon has determined that those persons who do not meet
the medical standard of the FAR because their diabetes requires oral hypoglycemic drugs will no longer be categorically
denied special issuance of airman medical certification.

In determining eligibility for medical certification under the special issuance provisions of the FAR, the Federal
Air Surgeon considers the natural history and severity of the problem, the period of satisfactory recovery since
manifestation of the problem, and any treatment, as well as any continuing requirements for treatment, and the nature
of treatment. For diabetics whose disease is controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents, additional factors that
may be considered include: the age of onset of diabetes; the documented degree and means of past and present diabetes
control; the presence or absence of adverse effects, including hypoglycemic episodes; the presence or absence of
other known risk factors; and the individual's willingness and ability to maintain strict control of his or her condition
and treatment and to cooperate with any monitoring plan required by the FAA. 

Four physicians who served on the AMA Report's Endocrinology Committee subsequently submitted a letter stating
that they reconsidered their Committee's recommendation on diabetes. The recommendation of the Endocrine Committee
was to continue to disqualify diabetics who use insulin to control their disease. In their letter, the four physicians
stated that persons on insulin therapy should be allowed consideration for special issuance certification. Several
other physicians who commented on the AMA Report also supported certification of persons on insulin therapy. 

The issues raised by these commenters pertain to current FAA policy of not permitting special issuance consideration
for persons on insulin therapy. As recommended by the full AMA Committee, the FAA proposes to retain this policy but
remains open to a change in its policy should there be any new medical developments. The issue was thoroughly covered
by the full AMA Committee and its recommendation was made after deliberation and thorough discussion. The contra
recommendation of the four physicians who submitted a letter to the FAA was not subjected to the same process, nor did
their recommendation contain any acceptable procedure for identifying persons on insulin therapy who could be safely,
reliably, and practically certified through the special issuance process. 

In a related matter, a summary of an American Diabetes Association (ADA) petition for rulemaking to review FAA rules
and policies regarding individuals with diabetes was recently published in the 

Federal Register

 (56 FR 10383, March 12, 1991). Specifically, the ADA petitioned the FAA to amend FAR   67.13, 67.15, 67.17,
and 67.19 to allow individuals with insulin-treated diabetes mellitus to be issued medical certificates on a case-by-case
basis. The ADA further requested the creation of an FAA-appointed medical task force to develop a medical protocol
capable of permitting meaningful case-by-case review. 

Docket No. 26493 was established to receive comments on the ADA petition. Since the comment period on the ADA petition
has closed but the subject of that petition is directly related to the part 67 review, additional comments on the diabetes-related
issues raised in the ADA petition may be submitted to the docket of this rulemaking. The FAA may dispose of the issues
raised in the ADA petition through this action at the final rule stage, or through the issuance of a separate disposition
of the ADA petition.

Musculoskeletal 



The Musculoskeletal System Committee of the AMA recommends standards that would disqualify an applicant for medical
certification because of conditions such as quadriplegia, hemiplegia, hemiparesis, collagen disease, and vascular
disease. The FAA does not propose specifying these conditions as disqualifying since they are already covered by
current general medical standards (proposed   67.115, 67.215, and 67.315). 



Special Issuance of Medical Certificates 



The FAA has used special issuance (waiver) provisions of  67.19 (proposed  67.401) for many years to grant
airman medical certification to acceptable applicants who do not meet the published standards. Prior to 1982, except
for applicants for air traffic control tower operator certificates, this authority was not available for airmen
with histories of certain psychiatric, neurological, cardiac, or endocrine conditions, and exemptions from the
regulations were required. Beginning in May 1982, however, airmen with a history or clinical diagnosis of any medical
condition could be granted discretionary medical certification through the special issuance provisions if it could
be determined that, notwithstanding the person's failure to meet the applicable medical standard, airman duties
could be performed, with appropriate limitations or conditions, without endangering public safety. Through special
issuance provisions, many airmen have returned to productive aviation careers and others to private flying after
recovery and rehabilitation from serious medical conditions without adverse impact on public safety. 

Consideration for the granting of a special issuance can be initiated in different ways. Currently, the FAA will often
consider an individual for a special issuance who does not meet the medical standards under part 67 without a formal
request to the agency from the individual. In some cases an individual who does not meet the medical standards under
part 67 will make a written request to the Federal Air Surgeon or to his or her authorized representative to be considered
for a grant of a special issuance. 

Under current practice, a special issuance letter is issued advising an airman of the FAA's decision to grant the special
issuance of a medical certificate. The letter describes the provisions and conditions of a special issuance of medical
certification. Based on the letter and on the individual being otherwise eligible, the agency or examiner issues
a medical certificate to the individual. These procedures apply for a new application and for an application for recertification.


Current  67.19 provides that the Federal Air Surgeon may limit the duration of a medical certificate issued
under that section, condition the continued effect of a medical certificate on the results of subsequent medical
tests, examinations, or evaluations, impose any operational limitation needed for safety, or condition the continued
effect of a second- or third-class medical certificate on compliance with a statement of functional limitations
issued to the person in coordination with the Director of Flight Standards or the Director's designee. It is implicit
in this section that in the interests of public safety a finding of adverse change in the medical condition of the holder
would result in termination of the validity of the medical certificate. 

The validity of the special issuance letter, however, does not lapse until the FAA takes some affirmative action to
modify or terminate it. Similarly, once a medical certificate is issued pursuant to the special issuance provisions,
even if the FAA terminates the special issuance letter, it may be considered that the medical certificate itself does
not lapse until the original date of expiration, unless it is sooner suspended or revoked under the provisions of section
609 of the Federal Aviation Act. Long-standing agency practice in the case of adverse medical change has been to send
the holder a letter terminating the validity of the special issuance of medical certification and requesting the
return of any medical certificates held.

To ensure that the medical justification for the special issuance remains valid and the holder of the special issuance
undergoes the same type of periodic reevaluation as the holder of any medical certificate does, it is proposed that
the duration of an Authorization for Special Issuance of a Medical Certificate (Authorization) will be limited,
and a new request for that Authorization will be required upon expiration. In addition, when the FAA determines that
an Authorization should be withdrawn, the medical certificate issued pursuant to that Authorization will also expire,
in accordance with proposed  67.401(a). 

An Authorization is one of two types of special issuances and covers those medical conditions, such as coronary heart
disease, where the disease is progressive in nature. A Statement of Demonstrated Ability (SODA) is the second type
of special issuance. If a medical condition, such as the accidental loss of a limb or deficient color vision is static
and nonprogressive, the FAA issues a SODA to those applicants found able to perform airman duties without endangering
public safety. This document remains valid indefinitely and permits a designated AME to issue a medical certificate
of the specified class if the holder remains otherwise eligible. In the event of adverse change, certification is
withheld and the person referred to the FAA for a new determination of eligibility. 

Current  67.19 (proposed  67.401) refers only to the special issuance of medical certificates. The FAA
proposes to add specific reference to the two types of special issuance documents: An Authorization and a SODA. The
first document codifies the special issuance letter currently used to grant and describe the provisions of a special
issuance of medical certification, and the second codifies a document that has been in use for many years. The proposed
change explicitly connects the duration of any medical certificate issued to the validity of the document upon which
it is based and requires periodic requests for reissuance. 

The FAA also proposes to add language (proposed 
 67.401(f)) that explicitly provides that the Federal Air Surgeon may withdraw an Authorization or SODA when:
There is adverse change in the holder's medical condition; the holder fails to comply with a statement of functional
limitations or operational limitations issued as a condition of medical certification; the public safety would
be endangered by the holder's exercise of airman privileges; the holder fails to provide medical information reasonably
needed by the Federal Air Surgeon to determine continued eligibility for certification under the special issuance
provisions; or the holder makes or causes to be made a fraudulent or false statement or an incorrect statement in support
of his or her request or in any entry in any logbook, record, or report that is kept, made, or used, to show compliance
with any requirement for an Authorization or SODA. 

Proposed  67.401(i) would allow a person to request a review of a decision to withdraw an Authorization or SODA.
The holder of an Authorization or SODA that is withdrawn may request, within 60 days after the service or mailing of
a letter of withdrawal, that the Federal Air Surgeon provide for a review of the decision to withdraw. The review procedures
would provide the holder an opportunity to submit supporting evidence in his or her behalf, and to otherwise respond
to the decision to withdraw. The proposed procedures and timeframes in  67.401(i) are intended to provide an
expeditious administrative review for the benefit of those persons affected by a decision to withdraw an Authorization
or SODA. The public is invited to comment on the proposed procedures for withdrawal of an Authorization or SODA. 

Proposed  67.401(j) implements the procedure by which the FAA will convert current special issuances to either
Authorizations or SODA's. All Authorizations will have an expiration date. The date will coincide with the expiration
date of the airman's medical certificate or a date as stipulated by the Federal Air Surgeon or his or her authorized
representative that relates to any medical test, report, or examination required as a condition of the special issuance.

Applications, Certificates, Logbooks, Reports, and Records: Falsification, Reproduction, or Alteration 



Section 67.20(a) (proposed  67.403(a)) of the FAR provides the regulatory basis for enforcement action when
an applicant or airman falsifies a medical certification document. In current  67.20(b), consequences for
violating paragraph (a) include suspension or revocation of all airman, ground instructor, and medical certificates
and ratings held by that person. 

Although present paragraph (a)(1) provides explicitly only for suspension or revocation for fraudulent or intentionally
false statements on any application for a medical certificate, the FAA has denied the medical certificate applied
for in such cases. If the FAA interpreted the current regulation narrowly, it would have to issue a medical certificate
and then revoke it in cases where the person has falsified the application. The proposed revision of these requirements
(proposed  67.403) provides explicitly for denial of an application for medical certification, as well as
for suspension or revocation of all airman, ground instructor, and medical certificates and ratings held by that
person, if the person makes a fraudulent or intentionally false statement or entry on the application or other document
required to be kept, made, or used to show compliance with any requirement for any medical certificate under part 67.


A new paragraph (c) has been added to proposed  67.403 to allow the FAA the 

option

 of denying, suspending, or revoking an airman medical certificate if any incorrect statement or entry has been made,
even if the person did not knowingly make the incorrect statement or entry. Medical certification based on incorrect
medical data may be inappropriate in the light of the true data. 

Proposed  67.403 also prohibits fraudulent or intentionally false statements or incorrect statements or
entries in connection with any Authorization or SODA. In addition, proposed  67.401, which sets out the procedures
for Authorizations and SODA's, specifically lists the making of a fraudulent or intentionally false statement or
an incorrect statement as grounds for withdrawal of an Authorization or SODA. 



Certification Procedures, Applicability, and Medical Examinations 



No substantive changes are proposed for present  67.23 of the FAR (proposed  67.405). Current  67.21
is deleted because it is unnecessary under the new reorganization. 



Delegation of Authority 



This section (current  67.25; proposed  67.407) would be amended to substitute the current term ``Manager''
for ``Chief'' in the delegation of authority to the Manager, Aeromedical Certification Division, Civil Aeromedical
Institute. It also would be amended to add issuance, renewal, denial, and withdrawal of Authorizations and SODA's
to the authority delegated by the Administrator to the Federal Air Surgeon. 



Denial of Medical Certificate 



Current  67.27 of the FAR (proposed  67.409), Denial of Medical Certificate, is proposed for amendment
only to substitute current terminology and the address for the Manager, Aeromedical Certification Division, and
to remove gender-specific pronouns. 



Medical Records 



The FAA proposes to amend  67.31 of the FAR (proposed  67.413(a)) to change the word ``refuses'' to ``fails''
to make it clear that there need not be an actual refusal by an applicant or holder of a medical certificate to furnish
requested information to trigger a suspension, modification, or revocation of a medical certificate. Failure to
provide the requested information is sufficient cause for the Administrator to act. A new sentence would be added
to this section ( 67.413(b)) to make it clear that submission of requested information does not automatically
lead to issuance of a medical certificate. A determination by the Federal Air Surgeon that the person meets applicable
medical standards is needed before a certificate will be issued. The FAA also proposes to remove gender-specific
pronouns and to substitute the more appropriate word, ``physician'' for the word ``doctor.''

Return of Medical Certificates After Suspension or Revocation 



Current  67.27(g) of the FAR provides that the holder of a medical certificate shall surrender it, upon request
of the FAA, if its issuance is wholly or partly reversed upon reconsideration. Part 61 ( 61.19(f)) provides
that the holder of any certificate issued under that part that is suspended or revoked shall, upon the Administrator's
request, return it to the Administrator. Except for  67.27(g), part 67 is silent regarding return of medical
certificates that have been suspended or revoked under the FAR or under Section 609 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958
(49 U.S.C. 1422). Because the retention by an airman of an invalid medical certificate is not consistent with proper
and efficient enforcement of safety regulations, new  67.415 is proposed. This amendment would codify existing
practice, and clarify that any airman medical certificate revoked or suspended under existing authority must be
returned on request of the Administrator. 



Related Petition 



On July 7, 1981, the Civil Pilots for Regulatory Reform (CPRR) filed a petition with the FAA Administrator (Docket
No. 22054; AVS-81-520-P). The petition took issue with two aspects of the airman medical certification
process. First, that the cardiovascular standards for first-, second-, and third-class medical certificates (paragraph
(e)(1) in   67.13, 67.15, and 67.17; 1981), automatically disqualify an airman who has an established
history or clinical diagnosis of a myocardial infarction regardless of degree or recency. Second, that the only means
to regain medical certification is dependent on the sole discretion of the Federal Air Surgeon via an exemption under
part 11 of the FAR. 

The CPRR petition proposes to modify a subparagraph of the 1981 cardiovascular standard which reads, ``No established
medical history or clinical diagnosis of myocardial infarction . . .,'' to read, ``No coronary artery
disease that makes the applicant unable to safely perform the duties or exercise the privileges of the airman certificate
that he holds or for which he is applying; or may reasonably be expected, within 2 years after the finding, to make him
unable to perform those duties or exercise those privileges; and the findings are based on the case history and appropriate,
qualified, medical judgment relating to the condition involved.'' The effect of the proposed change is that a history
of coronary artery disease would not, per se, disqualify an airman. 

The CPRR petition also proposes that the standards and tests used by the Federal Air Surgeon to recertificate pilots
who have sustained infarcts be published in regulatory form in an appendix to part 67, and that a pilot be granted appeal
rights to the NTSB in the event that an exemption is denied. Furthermore, the CPRR petition proposes that the medical
exemption procedures under part 11 be revised to provide a ``due process'' format for the exemption deliberation
under part 11. The format would include: (a) if the airman petitioner requests exemption under part 11 because of disqualification
under the cardiovascular standard, the airman is given a complete file, prior to the exemption panel meeting, of all
records, reports and other documents which the agency plans to consider in the ruling; 
(b) the airman may attend and present evidence at the exemption panel meeting; (c) panel members must record their
individual position in the official record of the meeting; and (d) the agency must construct a record sufficient to
form a basis for review by the courts of appeal under the arbitrary and capricious standard of review.

FAA Response: The medical standards were revised in 1982 
(47 FR 16298; April 15, 1982). The revision eliminated the need for the time consuming and cumbersome exemption pathway
under part 11 for part 67 medical disqualification cases and opened up part 67 medical disqualification cases (including
cardiovascular cases) to special issuance procedures under  67.19. Additionally, the 1982 rule change stated,
in the preamble, general and specific criteria that would be considered in the determination of a cardiovascular
special issuance. The 1982 change considerably reduces the administrative costs and processing time for special
issuance cases. 

In regard to the CPRR proposals to change the disqualifying statement on myocardial infarction and to allow for ``due
process'' and appeal, FAA review of part 67 has not led to such proposals. The disqualification for myocardial infarction
remains in the proposed rules. However, it is, and would continue to be, possible for an applicant with a history or
diagnosis of myocardial infarction to receive a medical certificate through the special issuance procedures if
further medical evaluation of the applicant shows that he or she is able to perform the privileges of an airman certificate
without endangering public safety. Any applicant who has been denied certification because he or she is unqualified
under the cardiovascular standards is notified of the procedures, standards, and tests required for special issuance
determination. Test results are reviewed and evaluated by medical specialists. Generally, in difficult cases or
those involving commercial pilots, a panel of cardiovascular specialists reviews the medical reports and other
required documentation, assesses the risks involved in accordance with its best medical judgment and advises if
it believes a special issuance is warranted. The procedures provide for a reasoned, objective determination based
on medical facts and judgment. The determination is not based on a hearing-type procedure in which subjective facts
are weighed. In any case, the proposed rule would allow for the same ``due process'' as under the present rule. 



Discussion of Public Comments 



The FAA requested public comments on the review of part 67 in two separate notices. On July 15, 1982, the FAA announced
the review of the regulations and invited public comment (47 FR 30795). On May 23, 1986, the FAA announced the availability
of the AMA Report and invited public comment on recommendations in the report (51 FR 19040). A total of 211 comments
were received. Comments were submitted by pilots, pilot organizations, and physicians, including several AME's.
Most of the comments refer to the AMA Report recommendations, only some of which are proposed in this document for adoption.


The following discussion of comments addresses only the main medical issues raised by commenters that are relevant
to this rulemaking document. It does not address comments on AMA recommendations that the FAA did not choose to adopt.
Some commenters recommended changes similar to those recommended in the CPRR petition and, since the FAA's position
on these issues has already been stated, it is not repeated below. While the following discussion addresses the main
medical issues raised by commenters, it is not intended to be an exhaustive discussion of all of the comments received
and considered by the FAA. 



Comments Received on the Review of Part 67 



In response to the first notice, the FAA received 
52 comments providing suggestions for the FAA to consider during its review of part 67. 

Twenty commenters, including four physicians, comment on persons with diabetes. In general, the commenters argue
that diabetes is a disease that is well understood and easily monitored by a personal physician. Advances in treating
diabetes, such as home glucose monitoring and other tests, provide full control to a pilot of his/her illness. Several
pilots suggest that diabetes is readily containable with the appropriate medical care, and no significant physical
strain is placed on a diabetic pilot in providing continuous treatment of the illness. 

Four commenters discuss the possible benefits of an electrocardiogram (ECG) in evaluating a person's medical situation.
One doctor who is also an AME recommends a chest 
X-ray as a preventive test. 

Another physician explains that there are currently no standards for risk factors such as cholesterol, cigarette
smoking, and blood pressure. These all have links to heart disease and, as a result, should be closely examined. 
Three people, including two physicians, support closer testing of pilots for signs and effects of alcoholism. They
point out that alcohol abuse is a major cause of aviation accidents and should, therefore, be tested. 

Nineteen people objected to the stringent medical standards for persons obtaining a third-class medical certificate
under  67.17. They argue that these strict standards are too rigid for this class of flyers, who are generally
leisure and sports pilots and can not easily obtain a medical examination. 

The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA) submitted a detailed section by section recommendation for revising
part 67 that was based on recommendations of a medical advisory panel of distinguished physicians that was convened
by AOPA.

FAA Response: 

The FAA considered all of these comments, including AOPA's section by section recommendations, during its review
of part 67. The FAA's proposed standards and policy on diabetes are discussed under the proposed rule portions of this
preamble. New ECG requirements are proposed in this notice. Assessment of risk factors such as cholesterol and blood
pressure is included and standards pertaining to alcoholism have been updated in the proposal. 

The proposed rule amends the standards for third-class medical certificates in light of recent technology and medical
knowledge. As noted in the discussion of the proposed rule, the standards for third-class medical certificates are
less stringent than those for first- and second-class certificates in recognition of the lower level of responsibility
inherent in noncommercial flight operations. 



Comments Received on AMA Report Recommendations 



Most commenters were generally opposed to any AMA recommendations that involved a perceived strengthening of the
standards for airman medical certification. Only eight commenters generally favored the AMA recommendations,
some with suggestions for improving them. 

Many of the opposing comments from pilots were based on their reading of an editorial about the AMA Report which appeared
in 

Flying

 magazine (Volume 113, November 1986, page 24) entitled ``What's Up, Doc?'' While the editorial was factually accurate,
it briefly summarized some of the recommendations and was primarily a subjective editorial opinion opposing certain
recommendations in the AMA Report. 



Cost and Safety 



The most frequent comment from those who objected to the AMA Report recommendations is that the recommended changes
will result in a substantial increase in the cost of obtaining a medical certificate and that there are no accident
data to indicate a need for increasing medical standards and thereby medical certification costs. 



FAA Response: 

The review of part 67 was necessary to ensure that the standards reflect current medical technology and evolving knowledge
about conditions that could affect a pilot's ability to perform safely. For the most part, the proposed revisions
to part 67 are not a strengthening of the standards over current regulations and policy. They represent clarification,
codification of policy, and an updating of the current standards and practices. The proposed rule would make some
standards less stringent, such as the deletion of uncorrected distant visual acuity requirements and the revised
wording of those requirements pertaining to the eye, ear, nose, pharynx, and larynx. In other instances, additions
to the medical examination requirements such as the proposed new standards for blood pressure for second- and third-class
medical certification are clearly warranted. The FAA would be remiss in its responsibility for safety if it ignored
medical findings and advances that can better identify those individuals subject to incapacitation or deterioration
of performance. The estimated costs and benefits of this proposal are addressed in a Regulatory Evaluation Summary
later in this preamble and more fully in a full regulatory evaluation which is in the public docket.

Prevention vs. Safety 



Several commenters object to statements in the AMA Report that certain recommendations are based on concepts of preventive
medicine. These commenters say that the FAA's responsibility is to safety rather than to a system of healthier pilots.
According to these commenters, the purpose of the agency's medical examination is to determine if a pilot is able to
perform safely the privileges of the airman certificate, not whether the pilot is generally healthy. 



FAA Response: 

The FAA is not proposing to change the primary safety objective of the medical certification examination. Rather,
the proposed revisions to the standards embody what has been learned in the last 25 years about medical risk factors.
FAA's interest in risk assessment is directly related to its need to determine at the time of a medical examination
as much objective information as possible on the medical condition of the person being examined. This information
is directly relevant to FAA's need to determine the likelihood that the person being examined will remain medically
fit for the next 6 months, or 1 or 2 years, as applicable. 

The AMA report is fully consistent with helping the FAA meet its statutory safety responsibilities. The AMA Report
notes that some of its recommendations include ``risk factor identification items.'' It further notes: 




These items add to the safety factor for which the examination is designed; they also increase the likelihood that
pilots who pay attention to these risk factors will be able to enjoy flying aircraft for more years. 




The fact that the AMA Report mentions potential long term preventive health benefits that may accrue to the person
being examined in no way diminishes the importance of the short term health evaluation benefits that are of primary
concern to the FAA. 



AMA Contract 



Several commenters object to the AMA Report because they believe the recommendations are in the AMA's self interest.
According to these commenters, any proposed increase in requirements would serve to increase the cost of the medical
examination and thereby the income of doctors. 



FAA Response: 

In its consideration of the AMA Report, the FAA found no indication of self-serving motives. The AMA committees which
worked on developing the recommendations were made up of experienced and respected specialists in each area of medical
interest. Each committee did an in-depth and thorough analysis of the current standards in relation to advances in
medical knowledge and examination techniques and recommended, as appropriate, optimum standards for safety. The
FAA reviewed and considered these recommendations along with public comments (many from professionals in the field)
and advice from its own staff. Factors such as pilot performance, aircraft technology, and cost, in addition to general
safety were considered by the FAA in assessing each AMA recommendation. (A cost benefit analysis appears in the Regulatory
Evaluation portion of this preamble.) The FAA believes the proposed standards will benefit all airmen as well as the
general public. 



FAA Workload 



Several commenters express concern that the AMA Report recommendations, if adopted, would lead to an increase of
denials and, therefore, an increase in requests for certification under the special issuance provisions of the FAR.
This in turn would lead to certification processing delays. 



FAA Response: 

The FAA does not anticipate that the proposed standards will significantly increase the internal FAA workload. The
potential for such an increase and the FAA's plans to meet the increase are discussed more fully in the regulatory evaluation.




Industry Disincentive 



Several commenters state that general aviation is presently in economic trouble and that more stringent medical
standards would discourage more people from becoming general aviation pilots. 



FAA Response: 

The FAA does not agree. The safer the system, the greater the number of participants and the lower the cost. The FAA believes
that these proposals encourage and support aviation.

Alleged Discrimination Against Older Pilots 



Several commenters allege that the AMA recommendations discriminate against older pilots in favor of younger ones,
since many of the tests recommended become critical for pilots after the age of 40 or 50. Air transport pilots who commented
argue that, if adopted, the recommendations might prohibit some older and more experienced pilots from flying. According
to these commenters, older pilots represent a high percentage of the highly competent and seasoned professional
pilots. 



FAA Response: 

Any medical standards necessarily have a greater effect on older persons since many disorders occur more frequently
with advancing age, especially after age 40. The FAA contracted with Johns Hopkins University to prepare a detailed
statistical analysis of computerized medical information collected by the FAA from examination of approximately
31,000 air traffic controllers over a 15-year period. The study sample was demographically comparable to the private
pilot population and the examinations were similar to airman medical examinations. The analysis shows that the incidence
of pathology recorded at periodic examinations increases with age; the prevalence of pathology in individuals over
the age of 50 was greater than in those under the age of 40. The AMA recommendations and the FAA proposed rule focus on
those disorders most likely to result in reduced performance or to incapacitate a pilot. They provide for more relevant,
more thorough, and more predictive evaluations after age 40 or 50, particularly for those persons seeking first-class
medical certification. Proposed changes in this category relate to vision; electrocardiograms; and blood cholesterol
determinations. The proposed standards will permit the identification of risk factors and encourage pilots to maintain
better control over those conditions which eventually could lead to disqualification. Those AMA recommendations
included in the FAA proposal should serve, in the long term, to increase the pool of experienced, professional, and
medically eligible pilots. 



AME's or Private Physicians 



Several commenters raise issues about the role of AME's and the role of private physicians in the maintenance of a pilot's
health. Two flight instructor pilots state that mistrust exists between pilots and medical examiners caused by pilots'
fear of losing their medical certification and their careers as pilots. More stringent rules, as recommended by the
AMA, will increase pilots' concerns and mistrust. Commenters also believe that some of the recommendations concerning
family history, for example, should be the domain of a pilot's personal physician and that in some instances personal
physicians could supply the information required by the recommended standards. 



FAA Response: 

Both current and proposed standards permit the use of test results provided by personal physicians, such as ECG's
and X-rays. However, the historical and legal role of the AME as a designee of the FAA is to conduct a medical examination
to determine the fitness of the pilot to exercise the privileges of his or her certificate without endangering public
safety. The proposed standards in no way are intended to interfere with or replace a pilot's use of a personal physician.
Experience, however, indicates that the FAA's statutory responsibility to ensure that an airman is medically fit
to perform his or her duties cannot be delegated to any personal physician. The proposed changes, however, should
not affect the relationship between pilots and AME's. 



Specific Standards 



Several commenters object to one or more specific recommendations in the AMA Report. Objections to cardiovascular
and vision standards are the most frequent. Some of these commenters express concern that the recommended standards
will serve to discourage good health practices through fear of denial. For example, commenters who objected to the
AMA recommendation for a blood pressure standard particularly object to the AMA recommendation that an applicant
shall have no established medical history of use of antihypertensive medication within the last year. Commenters
who use antihypertensive medication said they would either stop taking the medication (which they need) or be denied.




FAA Response: 

The proposed standards do not specify that individuals using antihypertensive medication shall be denied certification.
If antihypertensive medication is used or is needed to meet the blood pressure requirement, a person may be issued
a certificate only after a current, satisfactory medical assessment, prescribed by the Federal Air Surgeon. In this
case as in some others, the FAA has not followed the AMA recommendation. However, the comments indicate a misunderstanding.
A medical history of a disqualifying condition, whatever that condition is, does not necessarily mean that a person
will be denied certification absolutely. It may mean that additional evaluation may be required before the FAA can
determine if certification is appropriate. This may require additional time and some expense for additional tests,
but, for most of the proposed standards, the added inconvenience is minimal compared to the improvement in safety.




Regulatory Evaluation Summary 



Introduction 



Three requirements pertain to economic impacts of regulatory changes to the FAR. First, Executive Order 12291 directs
Federal agencies to promulgate new regulations or modify existing regulations only if the potential benefits to
society outweigh the potential costs. Second, the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires agencies to analyze
the economic impact of regulatory changes on small entities. Finally, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) directs
agencies to assess the effects of regulatory changes on international trade. In conducting these analyses, the FAA
has determined that this rule: 

</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941021-1-00054 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941021-1-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(1) would generate benefits exceeding costs, and, thus, is not a major rule as defined by the Executive Order; (2) is
significant as defined in DOT's Policies and Procedures; and (3) would not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities; and (4) would not have an impact on international trade. These analyses, available in the
docket, are summarized below. 



Regulatory Evaluation Summary 



The majority of the proposed amendments would have insignificant attributable costs with respect to the benefits
received. This evaluation does not address the minor proposed amendments such as changes in syntax, technical corrections,
reorganization, updating medical terminology, or adjustments to cross-references for conformance purposes.


Furthermore, the evaluation attributes no significant costs or benefits to several other proposed amendments that
would add a specific disease or medical condition to the list of medical standards. Such additions do not necessarily
constitute a change in the standards. Current regulations include two open-ended (general) medical standards that
cover: 

(1) any other personality disorder, neurosis, or mental condition * * *, or (2) any other organic,
functional, or structural disease, defect, or limitation * * * that the Federal Air Surgeon finds
would make, or may reasonably be expected to make, the applicant unable to perform the duties associated with the certificate.
Thus, the applicable medical standards are not limited to those actually listed in the regulation. As medical knowledge
and experience progress, the Federal Air Surgeon may find a previously unlisted disease or condition to be grounds
for withholding or restricting a medical certificate, so long as that finding is based on qualified medical judgment.


Under the proposed standards, a small number of airmen who currently hold certificates as a result of an order of the
NTSB would become disqualified from further medical certification because of the addition of specifically disqualifying
medical conditions. These airmen were denied medical certification by the FAA under the current general medical
standards. For example, the FAA has denied certification to airmen who have had cardiac valve replacement and the
NTSB has ordered certification in some of these cases. Under the proposed standards, a medical history of cardiac
valve replacement would be specifically disqualifying and those airmen would no longer be entitled to certification.
It is expected, however, that certification of the affected individuals would continue under the Federal Air Surgeon's
special issuance authority once the FAA evaluates the case and is satisfied that the airman's condition has not worsened
since the NTSB ordered certification. As such, the expected economic impact of the specifically disqualifying medical
conditions would be minor. 



Costs and Benefits That Are Not Quantified 



Prior to summarizing the evaluation of the substantive proposals, it is important to note one category of costs and
one category of benefits that have not been quantified in this analysis. The evaluation does not explicitly quantify
the economic consequences to those individuals who would lose their pilot certificate privileges as a result of the
proposed additional medical tests or standards. Where such consequences are expected, the evaluation estimates
the numbers of persons who would be denied but does not attribute a cost to those actions. 

It is recognized that the denial of pilot privileges would mean the loss of a highly valued avocation for some individuals.
For others, it would actually result in the loss of primary livelihood. An accurate assessment of the economic valuation
of the denials that are projected under this proposed rule is beyond the scope of the evaluation. 

At the same time, the evaluation also does not quantify the overwhelming personal health benefits, external to flight
safety, that would be afforded to those individuals whose medical conditions would be detected and whose treatment
would be enabled by the proposed tests and standards. On average, third-class medical certificate holders spend
only 0.7 percent of their time flying. The evaluation only quantifies the direct benefits of the proposed rule to reduced
aviation accidents. 

Under existing regulations, the Federal Air Surgeon is charged to deny a certificate in those cases where a disease
or other physical or mental condition would make, or may be reasonably be expected to make, the applicant unable to
perform the duties associated with the certificate. Such findings are not capricious, but instead, are based on the
case history of the individual and on appropriate, qualified medical judgment. 



Summary of Quantified Costs and Benefits 



Vision Proposals, All Classes 



The proposed rule would institute additional vision tests and standards for all three classes. For first- and second-class
applicants age 50 and older, it would add a new standard (20/40 Snellen) and a new test for intermediate vision (32 inches).
Applicants for third-class medical certificates would be subject to a new standard (20/40 Snellen) and a new test
for near vision (16 inches). 

The projected 10-year (1994-2003) costs of the intermediate vision proposal for first-class applicants are
$1.1 million in primary testing costs, $1.7 million in follow-up compliance costs (examinations and glasses) for
those persons not meeting the standard, $5,641 in direct processing costs for the expected 14 additional persons
who would be denied under the provision, totalling $2.8 million, with a 1993 present value of $2.0 million.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941021-1-00055 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941021-1-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The projected 10-year costs of the intermediate vision proposal for second-class applicants are $462,887 in primary
testing costs, $2.2 million in follow-up compliance costs (examinations and glasses) for those persons not meeting
the standard, and $6,529 in direct processing costs for the expected 17 additional persons who would be denied under
the provision, totalling $2.7 million, with a 1993 present value of $1.8 million. 
The projected 10-year costs of the near vision proposal for third-class applicants are $2.8 million in primary testing
costs, $1.3 million in follow-up compliance costs (examinations and glasses) for those persons not meeting the standard,
and $131,340 in direct processing costs for the expected 339 additional persons who would be denied under the provision,
totalling $4.2 million, with a 1993 present value of $2.9 million. It is emphasized that the denials and costs associated
with the near vision proposal are not wholly attributable to the proposed amendment. Although this requirement does
not exist in current regulations, it has been in place administratively for some time. Thus, the associated costs
are being, and would continue to be, incurred without this proposed amendment. 
NTSB accident records were investigated for the periods from 1962 through 1989 for commercial flights and from 1982
through 1989 for general aviation (GA). For these periods, no accident was found where intermediate or near vision
deficiency was specifically determined to be the cause. As such, the FAA is not able to quantitatively ascribe the
benefits of the three proposed vision amendments based on historical accident analysis. 
Notwithstanding the absence of documented accidents related to these three proposals, the FAA maintains that such
accidents may well have occurred and could continue to occur in the absence of the proposed amendments. The NTSB accident
analysis system may not document those cases where a near or intermediate vision problem caused or contributed to
accidents. Examples would include deviations from course or altitude, inaccurate monitoring of gauges and other
avionic displays, and incorrect setting of aeronautical parameters such as headings or radio frequencies. 
While the extent to which intermediate or near vision problems have caused such accidents is unknown, it is the FAA's
position that: (1) general aviation pilots require adequate near vision to read charts and checklists, and (2) commercial
pilots require adequate intermediate vision to properly monitor aircraft instruments. Although this evaluation
is not able to quantify the benefits of the proposed vision amendments, the FAA holds that the benefits would be significant
and would exceed the expected costs. 


Electrocardiogram (ECG), Second-Class 


The proposal would add a new requirement whereby applicants for second-class medical certificates would be required
to have a routine resting ECG at the first application after reaching age 35 and every 2 years after reaching age 40.
The projected ten-year costs of the provision are $25.5 million in primary testing costs, and $1.7 million of additional
testing and processing costs for those persons who would not meet the standard, including 178 persons who would be
denied, totalling $27.2 million, with a 1993 present value of $19.2 million. 
The projected benefits of this provision were based on a review of the related NTSB accident records. In the absence
of this proposal, commercial pilot, heart-related accidents over the 1994-2003 period are projected to consist
of: 2.64 deaths per year valued at $6.60 million, .14 serious injuries per year valued at $89,600, .14 minor injuries
per year valued at $322, and 2.06 damaged or destroyed (GA and commercial) airplanes per year valued at $169,360, totalling
$6,859,282 per year. The projected benefits of this provision over the ten-year study period are $68.6 million, with
a present value of $48.2 million. The FAA holds that the proposed amendment would meet or exceed the 40 percent effectiveness
level ($19.2 million cost / $48.2 million potential benefit) necessary to be cost beneficial.

Blood Pressure, Second-Class 


The proposal would add a new requirement that the sitting blood pressure second-class medical certificate applicants
not exceed 150/95 millimeters of mercury. The projected ten-year costs of the provision are $1.8 million in primary
testing costs and $0.7 million of additional testing and processing costs for those persons who would not meet the
standard, including 32 persons who would be denied, totalling $2.5 million, with a 1993 present value of $1.7 million.

The projected benefits of this provision were based on the review of the related NTSB accident records. For second-class
(commercial pilots), only one general aviation accident was found where hypertension or stroke was specifically
listed as the cause. That accident caused one death and destroyed one aircraft. Based on that accident, commercial
pilot accidents related to hypertension or stroke are projected over the forecast period to equal: (1) .14 deaths
per year valued at $350,000 and (2) .14 destroyed airplanes per year valued at $10,920, totalling $360,920 annually.

In addition to the directly attributable pathologies, high blood pressure is also an associated risk factor for other
pathologies including cardiovascular disease and kidney failure. The exact impact of the proposed rule on preventing
accidents from these related diseases is not known but the FAA estimates that the magnitude of associated-disease
accident costs that would be averted by the proposed amendment is at least equal to 
5 percent of the projected costs attributable to second-class cardiovascular accidents. Such potential benefits
would total $342,964 per year. The combined (direct and associated risk disease) potential benefits of the proposed
second-class blood pressure amendment over the ten-year study period are expected to total $7.0 million, with a 1993
present value of $4.9 million. The FAA holds that the proposed amendment would meet or exceed the 35 percent effectiveness
level ($1.7 million cost / $4.9 million potential benefit) necessary to be cost beneficial. 


Blood Pressure, Third-Class 


The proposal would add a new requirement that the sitting blood pressure of all applicants for third-class medical
certificates not exceed 150/95 millimeters of mercury. The projected ten-year costs of the provision are $2.8 million
in primary testing costs and $1.0 million of additional testing and processing costs for those persons who would not
meet the standard, including 48 persons who would be denied, totalling $3.8 million, with 1993 present value of $2.7
million. 
The projected benefits of this provision were based on a review of the related NTSB accident records for the period
1982 through 1989. For third-class certificate holders, 6 general aviation accidents were found where hypertension
or stroke was specifically listed as the cause. In the absence of this proposal, third-class accidents related to
hypertension or stroke are projected to equal .75 deaths per year valued at $1,875,000, .5 serious injuries per year
valued at $320,000, .13 minor injuries per year valued at $299, and .75 destroyed airplanes per year valued at $58,500,
totalling $2.3 million per year. Over the ten-year study period, the potential benefits would equal $22.5 million,
with a 1993 present value of $15.8 million. 
Similar to the proposal for second-class, the proposed third-class blood pressure standard would also reduce those
accidents caused by the secondary pathologies where high blood pressure is an associated risk factor. However, the
magnitude of accidents directly caused by hypertension and stroke in third-class pilots is so large that an estimate
of these secondary benefits is unnecessary. The FAA holds that the proposed amendment would meet or exceed the 17 percent
effectiveness level ($2.7 million cost / $15.8 million potential benefit) necessary to be cost beneficial. 


Cholesterol, First-Class 


The proposal would add a new requirement whereby applicants for first-class medical certificates age 50 and over
would be tested and would be subject to a standard of 300 milligrams per deciliter. The projected ten-year costs of
the provision are $3.4 million in primary testing costs and $2.0 million of additional testing and processing costs
for those persons who would not meet the standard, including 81 persons who would be denied, totalling $5.4 million,
with a 1993 present value of $3.7 million.

A review of general aviation accidents from 1982 through 1989 found six accidents caused by heart attacks in air transport
pilots. These accidents resulted in seven deaths, one serious injury, and six destroyed airplanes. Parallel statistics
for commercial accidents (from 1962 through 1989) revealed 4 accidents with 95 deaths, 15 major injuries, 2 destroyed
commuter airplanes and 2 destroyed air transport planes. 
These statistics project an annual, cardiovascular-related accident cost of $2.0 million in damaged airplanes,
and $27.2 million in lost life and injury costs. Multiplying the total $29.2 million projected cost by 5 percent, to
estimate the likely proportion of these costs that would be averted by the proposed cholesterol test and standard,
results in a potential annual benefit estimate of $1.46 million. Accordingly, the ten-year benefits are projected
to be $14.6 million, with a 1993 present value of $10.3 million. The FAA projects that the expected minimum potential
benefits of the proposal ($10.3 million) would exceed the estimated cost ($3.7 million). 


Part 61, Certificate Validity Period, Third-Class 


Under the proposal, persons under age 40 would generally only be required to undergo a physical examination every
3 years. Medical certificates for persons age 40 through 69 would continue to be valid for 2 years. Persons age 70 and
older would be required to undergo a physical examination every year. 
The amendment would reduce: (1) the projected years of pilot pathology exposure by an estimated 0.2 percent, (2) the
projected flight hours of pilot pathology exposure by some 4.1 percent, and (3) the projected number of third-class
medical examinations by 14.5 percent. Accordingly, it is expected that the proposed amendment would not induce any
costs to third-class applicants considered as a whole. 
The evaluation does not specifically quantify the potential benefits from the expected minor reductions in pathology
exposure. The expected ten-year savings that would derive from the 14.5 percent reduction in examinations is projected
to total $23.7 million in direct testing and time costs (a 1993 present value of $16.5 million). With a projected benefit
of $16.5 million and no expected net costs, the FAA finds that this provision would be cost beneficial. 
It is noted that the provision would transfer costs and benefits across age groups. Third-class applicants younger
than 40 would take fewer examinations and would be expected to manifest a higher incident of undetected pathologies.
Conversely, the group of applicants age 70 and older would take more examinations and would exhibit fewer undetected
pathologies. However, the net effect would be a reduction in both examinations and pathologies, consistent with
Executive Order 12291 which requires that regulatory objectives be chosen to maximize the net benefits to society.



Regulatory Flexibility Determination 


The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily
or disproportionately burdened by Government regulations. The RFA requires a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
if a rule would have a significant economic impact, either detrimental or beneficial, on a substantial number of small
entities. FAA Order 2100.14A, Regulatory Flexibility Criteria and Guidance, provides threshold cost and small
entity size standards for complying with RFA review requirements in FAA rulemaking actions. After reviewing the
projected effects of the proposed rule in light of these standards, the FAA finds that the proposal would not have significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 


International Trade Impact Statement 


The proposed rule would have little or no impact on trade for both U.S. firms doing business in foreign countries and
foreign firms doing business in the United States. 


Paperwork Reduction Act 


The paperwork burden associated with part 67 is currently approved under OMB number 2120-0034. Any increase
or decreases associated with this NPRM will be submitted to OMB for approval.

Federalism Implications 


The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the states, on the relationship between
the national government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12866, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 


Conclusion 


For the reasons discussed in the preamble, and based on the findings in the Regulatory Evaluation and the International
Trade Impact Analysis, the FAA has determined that this proposed regulation is not major under Executive Order 12866.
In addition, the FAA certifies that this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact, positive
or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. This
proposal is considered significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979).
An initial regulatory evaluation of the proposal, including a Regulatory Flexibility Determination and Trade Impact
Analysis, has been placed in the docket. A copy may be obtained by contacting the person identified under

Subpart E_Certification Procedures 



 67.401 

Special issuance of medical certificates. 



(a) At the discretion of the Federal Air Surgeon, an Authorization for Special Issuance of a Medical Certificate (Authorization),
valid for a specified period, may be granted to a person who does not meet the provisions of subparts B, C, or D of this
part if the person shows to the satisfaction of the Federal Air Surgeon that the duties authorized by the class of medical
certificate applied for can be performed without endangering public safety during the period in which the Authorization
would be in force. The Federal Air Surgeon may authorize a special medical flight test, practical test, or medical
evaluation for this purpose. A medical certificate of the appropriate class may be issued to a person who does not meet
the provisions of subparts B, C, or D of this part if that person possesses a valid Authorization and is otherwise eligible.
An airman medical certificate issued in accordance with this section shall expire no later than the end of the validity
period or upon the withdrawal of the Authorization upon which it is based. At the end of its specified validity period,
for grant of a new Authorization, the person must again show to the satisfaction of the Federal Air Surgeon that the
duties authorized by the class of medical certificate applied for can be performed without endangering public safety
during the period in which the Authorization would be in force. 

(b) At the discretion of the Federal Air Surgeon, a Statement of Demonstrated Ability (SODA) may be granted, instead
of an Authorization, to a person whose disqualifying condition is static or nonprogressive and who has been found
capable of performing airman duties without endangering public safety. A SODA does not expire and authorizes a designated
Aviation Medical Examiner to issue a medical certificate of a specified class if the examiner finds that the condition
described on its face has not adversely changed. 

(c) In granting an Authorization or a SODA, the Federal Air Surgeon may consider the person's operational experience
and any medical facts that may affect the ability of the person to perform airman duties including_

(1) The combined effect on the person of failure to meet more than one requirement of this part and 

(2) The prognosis derived from professional consideration of all available information regarding the person. 

(d) In granting an Authorization under this section, the Federal Air Surgeon specifies the class of medical certificate
authorized to be issued and may do any or all of the following: 

(1) Limit the duration of the Authorization; 

(2) Condition the granting of a new Authorization on the results of subsequent medical tests, examinations, or evaluations;


(3) State on the Authorization, and any certificate based upon it, any operational limitation needed for safety;
or 

(4) Condition the continued effect of an Authorization, and any second- or third-class medical certificate based
upon it, on compliance with a statement of functional limitations issued to the person in coordination with the Director
of Flight Standards or the Director's designee. 

(e) In determining whether an Authorization or SODA should be granted to an applicant for a third-class medical certificate,
the Federal Air Surgeon considers the freedom of an airman, exercising the privileges of a private pilot certificate,
to accept reasonable risks to his or her person and property that are not acceptable in the exercise of commercial or
airline transport privileges, and, at the same time, considers the need to protect the safety of persons and property
in other aircraft and on the ground.

(ii) In any entry in any logbook, record, or report that is kept, made, or used, to show compliance with any requirement
for an Authorization or SODA. 

(g) A person who has been granted an Authorization or SODA under this section based on a special medical flight or practical
test need not take the test again during later physical examinations unless the Federal Air Surgeon determines or
has reason to believe that the physical deficiency has or may have degraded to a degree to require another special medical
flight or practical test. 

(h) The authority of the Federal Air Surgeon under this section is also exercised by the Manager, Aeromedical Certification
Division and each Regional Flight Surgeon. 
(i) If an Authorization or SODA is withdrawn under paragraph (f) of this section the following procedures apply: 
(1) The holder of the Authorization or SODA will be personally served or mailed a letter of withdrawal, stating the
reason for the action; 
(2) By not later than 60 days after the service or mailing of the letter of withdrawal, the holder of the Authorization
or SODA may request, in writing, that the Federal Air Surgeon provide for review of the decision to withdraw. The request
for review may be accompanied by supporting medical evidence; 
(3) Within 60 days of receipt of a request for review, a written final decision either affirming or reversing the decision
to withdraw will be issued; and 
(4) A medical certificate rendered invalid pursuant to a withdrawal, in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section,

compliance with any requirement for any medical certificate or for any Authorization or SODA under this part; 
(3) A reproduction, for fraudulent purposes, of any medical certificate under this part; or 
(4) An alteration of any medical certificate under this part. 
(b) The commission by any person of an act prohibited under paragraph (a) of this section is a basis for_
