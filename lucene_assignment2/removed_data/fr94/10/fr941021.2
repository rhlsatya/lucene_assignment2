DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE



Forest Service

Helicopter Landing Tours on the Juneau Icefields, Tongass National Forest, Chatham Area, Juneau Ranger District,
Juneau, AK



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Forest Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Agriculture, Forest Service will prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to disclose
the environmental impacts of authorizing helicopter landing tours on icefields adjacent to the city of Juneau, Alaska.
The proposed action is to issue five year special use permits (1995-1999) authorizing Coastal Helicopter,
Inc., ERA Helicopters, Inc. and Temsco Helicopter, Inc. to land on the Juneau icefields at specified locations and
conduct tours. The majority of use would occur between May and September of each year. Tours would originate at private
heliports and helicopter flightpaths would transit a variety of private and municipal lands prior to entering the
National Forest. The proposed action would increase authorized helicopter landings tours on the Juneau icefields
from 11,000 in 1994 to a maximum of 22,000 in 1999.



The Forest Service is seeking information and comments from Federal, State and local agencies as well as individuals
and organizations who may be interested in, or affected by, the proposed action.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The purpose and need for the proposed action is to meet public demand for quality guided services which provide safe
access to remote locations on the Juneau Icefield. Meeting this demand includes providing for visitor safety and
an appropriate balance between commercial guided recreation opportunities and non-commercial, non-guided recreation
opportunities without unacceptable impacts to other forest users and resources.




Kenneth E. Mitchell, Juneau District Ranger, Tongass National Forest, Chatham Area, is the deciding official. The
decision to be made is whether or not to issue special use permits for helicopter landing tours as requested, and if
permits are issued, decide the levels to be authorized and the mitigation measures that will be required.

The no action and proposed action alternatives will be considered in the EIS as well as other alternatives which address
significant issues and satisfy the purpose and need for the action. Alternatives may consider limiting the number
of landings, moving heliports, or defining flight paths.

Preliminary issues that have been identified include helicopter noise disturbance to residential areas, wildlife,
and ground-based recreation users; impacts to the local economy; and public demand for helicopter landing tours.

In 1992, an environmental assessment analyzing the effects of these tours was completed. A Finding of No Significant
Impact was made. That decision was reversed on appeal and remanded to the deciding official.

Comments from the 1992 EA were used to identify issues for this EIS. Comments were also solicited between May 17 and
June 27, 1994 through a news release and letters to the public. Federal, state and local agencies, interested individuals
and groups are invited to participate in this analysis. Comments will be accepted throughout the EIS process but,
to be most useful, should be received by October 21, 1994.

Because most of the data collection and scoping was completed during preparation of the 1992 EA and subsequent re-evaluation
of the original proposed action, the draft environmental impact statement should be available for review by November
5, 1994. The final environmental impact statement is scheduled to be completed by January 15, 1995.

The comment period on the draft environmental impact statement will be 45 days from the date the Environmental Protection
Agency publishes the notice of availability in the 

Federal Register.



The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers notice of several court rulings
related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft environmental impact
statements must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful
and alerts an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions. 

Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. 

v. 

NRDC, 

435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978). Also, environmental objections that could be raised at the draft environmental impact statement
stage but that are not raised until after the completion of the final environmental impact statement may be waived
or dismissed by the courts. 

City of Angoon 

v. 

Hodel, 

803 F.2d 1016, 1022 (9th Cir. 1986) and 

Wisconsin Heritages, Inc. 

v. 

Harris, 

490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980). Because of these court rulings, it is very important that those interested
in this proposed action participate by the close of the 45 day comment period so that substantive comments and objections
are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final
environmental impact statement. To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns
on the proposed action, comments on the draft environmental impact statement should be as specific as possible. It
is also helpful if comments refer to specific pages or chapters of the draft statement. Comments may also address the
adequacy of the draft environmental impact statement or the merits of the alternatives formulated and discussed
in the statement. Reviewers may wish to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing
the procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these points.

The Final EIS and Record of Decision is expected to be released in January 1995. The Juneau District Ranger, Chatham
Area. Tongass National Forest will, as the responsible official for the EIS, make a decision regarding this proposal
considering the comments, responses, and environmental consequences discussed in the Final EIS, and applicable
laws, regulations, and policies. The decision and supporting reasons will be documented in the Record of Decision.

Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Reviews: Electrolytic Manganese Dioxide From Japan



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce.




</AGENCY>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In response to requests by the petitioners, the Department of Commerce (``the Department'') has conducted administrative
reviews of the antidumping duty order on electrolytic manganese dioxide (``EMD'') from Japan. The reviews cover
one manufacturer/exporter of this merchandise to the United States, Tosoh Corporation (``TOSOH''), during the
periods April 1, 1991, through March 31, 1992, April 1, 1992, through March 31, 1993. 




The Department has completed these reviews and has determined that respondent's dumping margin should be based on
best information available (``BIA'') for the 1991-1992 and 1992-1993 reviews. The margin for this manufacturer/exporter
is 77.43 percent for the 1991-1992 and 1992-1993 periods.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background



On April 13, 1994, and July 8, 1994, the Department published the 

Federal Register

 notices of the preliminary results of its administrative reviews for the periods April 1, 1992, through March 31,
1993 (59 FR 17511), and April 1, 1991, through March 31, 1992 (59 FR 35096), respectively. The Department gave interested
parties an opportunity to comment on the preliminary results. We received a comment from petitioners, Kerr-McGee
Chemical Corporation and Chemetals Incorporated, on July 20, 1994, relating to the 1992-1993 review. TOSOH
did not comment on either the 1991-1992 review or the 1992-1993 review. The Department has completed these
reviews in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act).



Scope of Reviews



Imports covered by these reviews are shipments of electrolytic manganese dioxide. EMD is manganese dioxide (MnO

2

) that has been refined in an electrolysis process. During the review periods, such merchandise was classifiable
under subheading 2820.10.0000 of the 

Harmonized Tariff Schedule

 (HTS). The HTS subheading is provided for convenience and customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive.

On January 6, 1992, the Department published a final scope ruling, 

 Electrolytic Manganese Dioxide from Japan; Final Scope Ruling

 (57 FR 395, January 6, 1992), in which it affirmed that high-grade chemical manganese dioxide (CMD-U) is a ``later-developed
product'' and is included in the scope of the order on EMD from Japan. For a detailed discussion of that ruling, 

see Electrolytic Manganese Dioxide from Japan; Preliminary Scope Ruling

 (56 FR 56977, November 7, 1991). 

These reviews cover EMD sales to the United States by one manufacturer/exporter, TOSOH.



Interested Party Comment



Comment



Petitioners request confirmation in the context of the 1992-1993 review that any subsequent review involving
TOSOH's shipments of the subject merchandise will include an inquiry into the correct basis for U.S. prices of reviewed
transactions. Specifically, petitioners request that the Department confirm that it will make a determination
in a future review as to whether the price to test against fair value is TOSOH's price to its customer, Mitsubishi Corporation
(``Mitsubishi''), or the price that Mitsubishi charges to its customer in the United States.



DOC Position



It is not appropriate for the Department to speculate on the resolution of issues that are not relevant to the instant
proceeding. Although petitioners argued that Mitsubishi's prices to its customer should be the basis for U.S. price,
this issue did not need to be addressed in the 1992-1993 proceeding because TOSOH did not participate. Whether,
in subsequent review periods, the Department will examine TOSOH's relationship with Mitsubishi is a matter to be
decided in those proceedings should the issue be raised.



Final Results of the Reviews



TOSOH declined to respond to section D of the Department's questionnaire in the 1991-1992 review. TOSOH also
did not respond to any part of the Department's questionnaire in the 1992-1993 review. Pursuant to section 776(c)
of the Act, whenever a company refuses to produce information requested or otherwise significantly impedes an investigation,
the Department will use BIA.

Because TOSOH refused, in both reviews, to respond to the Department's questionnaire, we consider it to be an uncooperative
respondent. Our practice for uncooperative respondents is to apply as BIA the higher of (1) the highest of the rates
found for any firm in the less-than-fair value (``LTFV'') investigation or prior administrative reviews, or (2)
the highest rate found in the current review for any firm. 

See Final Results of Administrative  Review: Antifriction Bearings (other than Tapered Roller Bearings) from France

 (58 FR 39729, 39739, July 26, 1993).

Accordingly, for both reviews, we used as BIA the highest of the rates found for any firm in the original LTFV investigation:
77.43 percent 

(See Final Determination of the Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Electrolytic Manganese Dioxide from Japan

 (54 FR 8778, March 2, 1989)).

As a result of these reviews, we determine that the following margins exist for each review period:






The Department will instruct the Customs Service to assess antidumping duties on all appropriate entries for each
period of review. Individual differences between United States price and foreign market value may vary from the percentage
stated above. The Department will issue appraisement instructions directly to the Customs Service.

Furthermore, the deposit requirements will be effective for all shipments of the subject merchandise, entered,
or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the publication date of the final results of these administrative
reviews, as provided by section 751(a)(1) of the Act. A cash deposit of estimated antidumping duties based on margins
for the most recent period of April 1, 1992, through March 31, 1993, shall be required on all shipments of subject merchandise
from Japan, as follows:

(1) The cash deposit rate for the reviewed company will be that established in the final results of the 1992-1993
administrative review;

(2) For previously reviewed or investigated companies not listed above, the cash deposit rate will continue to be
the company-specific rate published for the most recent period;

(3) If the exporter is not a firm covered in the 1992-1993 review, a prior review, or the original LTFV investigation,
but the manufacturer is, the cash deposit rate will be the rate established for the most recent period for the manufacturer
of the merchandise; and

(4) If neither the exporter nor the manufacturer is a firm covered in the 1992-1993 review, any previous review
conducted by the Department, or the original LTFV investigation, the cash deposit rate will be the ``all other'' rate
established in the LTFV investigation of 73.30 percent. See the 

Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review: Gray Portland Cement and Clinker from Japan 

58 FR 48826, 48833, (September 20, 1993), for a further discussion of the Department's practice in setting the all
others rate.

These deposit requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next
administrative review.

This notice also serves as a final reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate
regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during these review
periods. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement
of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties.

This notice also serves as the only reminder to parties subject to administrative protective order (APO) of their
responsibility concerning disposition of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance with 19 CFR
353.34(d). Timely written notification of return/destruction of APO materials or conversion to judicial protective
order is hereby requested. Failure to comply with the regulations and terms of the APO is a sanctionable violation.

These administrative reviews and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1))
and 19 CFR 353.22.

<DOCTITLE>Frozen Concentrated Orange Juice From Brazil; Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review and Revocation
of Order in Part</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of final results of antidumping duty administrative review and revocation in part.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On February 3, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published the preliminary results of its administrative
review of the antidumping duty order on frozen concentrated orange juice (FCOJ) from Brazil, and its intent to revoke
the order in part (59 FR 5174). We have now completed this review and determined the margins for Branco Peres, Citropectina,
and Frutropic to be zero or 

de minimis

 during the period May 1, 1991 through April 30, 1992. We have also determined that Frutropic has met the requirements
for revocation.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



Background



On May 5, 1987, the Department published in the 

Federal Register

 an antidumping duty order on FCOJ from Brazil (52 FR 16424). On May 31, 1992, pursuant to the Department's notice of
``Opportunity to Request Administrative Review'' (57 FR 19412) of the order for the period May 1, 1991 through April
30, 1992, Branco Peres, Citropectina, and Frutropic requested an administrative review. Accordingly, the Department
initiated this administrative review on June 18, 1992 (57 FR 27212).

On May 29, 1992, Frutropic submitted a timely request for revocation of the antidumping duty order, accompanied by
the certification required by 19 CFR 353.25(b)(1). Frutropic did not submit an agreement to immediate reinstatement
of the order under 19 CFR 353.25(a)(2)(iii). Frutropic claimed that it was not required to do so because Frutropic
was not originally investigated and had never been found to have sold at less than foreign market value (FMV) in any
administrative review.

On February 3, 1994, the Department published the preliminary results of its administrative review and its intent
to revoke the order in part (59 FR 51174). We gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on the preliminary results.
No comments were received.

In the preliminary results of this review, we erroneously stated that FMV periods of less than one month were used because
distortions could result from the application of a monthly FMV due to hyperinflation. In fact, shorter periods were
used to avoid distortions which would have been created through the use of a monthly FMV due to significant price fluctuations
unrelated to hyperinflation. The Department has now completed this administrative review in accordance with section
751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act).



Scope of Review



Imports covered by the administrative review are shipments of FCOJ from Brazil. The merchandise is currently classifiable
under item 2009.11.00 of the 

Harmonized Tariff Schedule

 (HTS). The HTS item number is provided for convenience and Customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive.



Final Results of the Review



The final results of our review are identical to those in the preliminary results of review:

The Department hereby revokes the antidumping duty order with respect to Frutropic, as it has demonstrated three
consecutive years of sales at not less than FMV, and it is not likely that Frutropic will sell subject merchandise at
less than FMV in the future. As required by 19 CFR 353.25(c)(2)(ii), the Department has conducted a verification of
all factual information submitted by Frutropic in this administrative review.

We have also examined Frutropic's claim that it is not required to file an agreement under 19 CFR 353.25(a)(2)(iii).
Section 353.35(a)(2)(iii) states that:




For producers or resellers that the Secretary previously has determined to have sold the merchandise at less than
foreign market value, the producers or resellers agree in writing to their immediate reinstatement in the order,
as long as any producer or reseller is subject to the order, if the Secretary concludes under section 353.22(f) that
the producer or reseller, subsequent to the revocation, sold the merchandise at less than foreign market value.




As Frutropic was not originally investigated and has not been found to have sold at less than FMV in the first administrative
review or in any of the other years in which the company was reviewed, we determine that Frutropic has not sold the merchandise
at less than FMV for purposes of 19 CFR 353.25(a)(2)(iii), and is not required to submit an agreement to immediate reinstatement
in the order. The Department is, therefore, revoking the order with respect to Frutropic.



However, if the Department concludes from available information that changed circumstances sufficient to warrant
a review exist with respect to exports of FCOJ from Frutropic, the Department will initiate a changed circumstances
antidumping administrative review under 19 CFR 353.22(f). Further, if as a result of this changed circumstances
review, the Department concludes that, subsequent to revocation, Frutropic sold the subject merchandise at less-than-fair-value
(LTFV), the Department will reinstate the order with respect to Frutropic.

The Department will instruct the U.S. Customs Service to assess antidumping duties on all appropriate entries. With
respect to Frutropic's entries, the Department will instruct Customs to terminate suspension of liquidation, to
liquidate all entries without regard to antidumping duties and to cease collecting cash deposits. Since the margins
for Branco Peres and Citropectina are 

de minimis

 and zero, respectively, the Department shall not require a cash deposit of antidumping duties on entries of FCOJ from
these companies.

Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective upon publication of this notice of final results
of administrative review for all shipments of the subject merchandise, entered or withdrawn from warehouse, for
consumption on or after the publication date, as provided for by section 751(a)(1) of the Act: (1) the cash deposit
rate for the reviewed companies will be as outlined above; (2) for previously reviewed or investigated companies
not listed above, the cash deposit rate will continue to be the company-specific rate published for the most recent
period; (3) if the exporter is not a firm covered in this review, a prior review, or the original LTFV investigation,
but the manufacturer is, the cash deposit rate will be the rate established for the most recent period for the manufacture
of the merchandise; (4) the cash deposit rate for all other manufacturers or exporters will be 1.96 percent, the ``all
other'' rate established in the original LTFV investigation by the Department (52 FR 9324, March 17, 1989), in accordance
with the decisions of the Court of International Trade in 

Floral Trade Council

 v. 

United States

, Slip Op. 993-79, and 

Federal-Mogul Corporation

 v. 

United States

, Slip Op. 93-83.

This notice serves as a final reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate
regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review
period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement
of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties.

This notice serves as the only reminder to parties subject to administrative protective order (APO) of their responsibilities
concerning the return or destruction of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance with 19 CFR 353.34(d).
Failure to comply is a violation of the APO. This administrative review and notice are in accordance with sections
751(a)(1)(B) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1)(B)) and 19 CFR 353.22 and 353.25.

The Commission on the Social Security ``Notch'' Issue.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of hearings.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Commission on the Social Security ``Notch'' Issue was established by the Treasury, Postal Service, and General
Government Appropriations Act of Fiscal Year 1993 (Public Law 102-393, September 10, 1992).



BACKGROUND: 

The legislation adopted in 1972 to provide for automatic cost of living adjustments (COLA's) in social security benefits
contained a flawed formula for determining benefits which resulted in higher benefits than intended. In 1977, Congress
enacted legislation to remove this flaw. The new law was effective for all beneficiaries born after 1916 and the resulting
benefit modification for those born for several years after that date created what has become known as the ``Notch''
issue.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Requests 

to present oral or written testimony at the hearings must be made by telephone to Karen Norrell or Ruth Anne Miller at
202-336-8730 before close of business November 4, 1994. The Notch Commission staff will notify those
scheduled to appear. Fifteen copies of the oral testimony must be 

submitted 

to the Commission staff by November 8, 1994. Testimony should be mailed or delivered to 1100 New York Ave., 10th floor,
East Tower, Washington, DC 20005. Those presenting oral testimony must also submit 25 copies of their testimony at
the hearing. Witnesses scheduled to present oral testimony are requested to briefly summarize their written statements.
In view of the limited time available to hear witnesses, the staff may not be able to accommodate all requests to be heard.
However, written testimony is welcome.


Any persons or organizations wishing to submit written testimony for the printed record of the hearings should submit
15 copies of their statement by Wednesday, November 30, 1994. Copies should be mailed to the Commission on the Social
Security ``Notch'' Issue, 1100 New York Ave., NW., 10th floor, East Tower, Washington, DC 20005.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:






Authority: 

Executive Order 11651 of March 3, 1972, as amended; section 204 of the Agricultural Act of 1956, as amended (7 U.S.C.
1854).




On February 1, 1994 a notice and letter to the Commissioner of Customs dated January 26, 1994 were published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 4693) announcing the establishment of limits and guaranteed access levels (GALs), re-instatement of visa
and certifications requirements and establishment of manufacturer's identification requirements for certain
textiles and textile products, produced or manufactured in Haiti and exported during the period beginning on January
1, 1994 and extending through December 31, 1994.

Based on Executive Order 12917, the Chairman of CITA issued a directive to the Commissioner of Customs cancelling
the directive issued on January 26, 1994 (59 FR 35325, published on July 11, 1994 and 59 FR 44410, published on August
29, 1994). 


In the letter published below, the Chairman of CITA, directs the Commissioner of Customs to re-establish the limits
and guaranteed access levels for 1994. Also, the Commissioner of Customs is directed to re-instate the visa, certifications
and manufacturer's identification requirements for certain textiles and textile products which are exported from
Haiti. Goods exported from Haiti during the period October 21, 1994 through November 20, 1994 shall not be denied entry
for lack of a visa or certification. Goods exported from Haiti on or after November 21, 1994 shall be denied entry if
not accompanied by an appropriate export visa or certification. The Commissioner of Customs is directed to accept
and sign the ITA-370P form for shipments of U.S. formed and cut parts destined for assembly in Haiti and re-entry
into the United States under the Special Access Program.

Shipments of GAL qualifying textile products which are re-exported to the United States from Haiti on or after October
21, 1994 shall be charged to the appropriate guaranteed access level.


A description of the textile and apparel categories in terms of HTS numbers is available in the CORRELATION: Textile
and Apparel Categories with the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (see 

Federal Register

 notice 58 FR 62645, published on November 29, 1993). Also see 56 FR 51201, published on October 10, 1991.

Requirements for participation in the Special Access Program are available in 

Federal Register

 notices 51 FR 21208, published on June 11, 1986; 52 FR 6053, published on February 27, 1987; 52 FR 26057, published on
July 10, 1987; and 54 FR 50425, published on December 6, 1989.

The letter to the Commissioner of Customs and the actions taken pursuant to it are not designed to implement all of the
provisions of the Memorandum of Understanding dated December 30, 1993 between the Governments of the United States
and Haiti, but are designed to assist only in the implementation of certain of its provisions.

Commissioner of Customs,


Department of the Treasury, Washington, DC 20229.




Dear Commissioner: This directive cancels and supersedes the monitoring directives dated December 3, 1992 and December
8, 1993, and the July 5, 1994 (as corrected on August 23, 1994), directive prohibiting the importation of any textile
or apparel products from Haiti, issued to you by the Chairman, Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements.

Under the terms of section 204 of the Agricultural Act of 1956, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1854); pursuant to the Memorandum
of Understanding dated December 30, 1993, between the Governments of the United States and Haiti; and in accordance
with the provisions of Executive Order 11651 of March 3, 1972, as amended, you are directed, effective on October 21,
1994, to re-establish the following limits for cotton and man-made fiber textile products in the following categories,
produced or manufactured in Haiti and exported during the twelve-month period beginning on January 1, 1994 and extending
through December 31, 1994:






Effective on October 21, 1994, you are directed to re-instate visa, certification and manufacturer identification
requirements for all shipments of textile products, produced or manufactured in Haiti and exported from Haiti. Goods
exported from Haiti during the period October 21, 1994 through November 20, 1994 shall not be denied entry for lack
of a visa or certification. Goods exported from Haiti on or after November 21, 1994 shall be denied entry if not accompanied
by an appropriate export visa or certification.

You are directed to accept and sign the ITA-370P form for shipments of U.S. formed and cut parts destined for assembly
in Haiti and re-entry into the United States under the Special Access Program.
 


In accordance with the provisions of the Special Access Program, as set forth in 51 FR 21208 (June 11, 1986), 52 FR 26057
(July 10, 1987) and 54 FR 50425 (December 6, 1989), and pursuant to current bilateral textile agreement, as amended,
between the Governments of the United States and Haiti, you are directed, effective on October 21, 1994, to re-establish
guaranteed access levels for properly certified cotton and man-made fiber textile products in the following categories
which are assembled in Haiti from fabric formed and cut in the United States and re-exported to the United States from
Haiti during the twelve-month period beginning on January 1, 1994 and extending through December 31, 1994. 






Any shipment for entry under the Special Access Program which is not accompanied by a valid and correct certification
and Export Declaration in accordance with the provisions of the certification requirements established in the directive
of February 19, 1987, as amended, shall be denied entry unless the Government of Haiti authorizes the entry and any
charges to the appropriate specific limit. Any shipment which is declared for entry under the Special Access Program
but found not to qualify shall be denied entry into the United States.


In carrying out the above directions, the Commissioner of Customs should construe entry into the United States for
consumption to include entry for consumption into the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.

The Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements has determined that these actions fall within the foreign
affairs exception of the rulemaking provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1).

Sincerely,

Paiute Pipeline Company; Intent To Prepare an Environmental Assessment for the Proposed Paiute Pipeline Expansion
Project


October 18, 1994.


The staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or the Commission) will prepare an environmental assessment
(EA) that will discuss environmental impacts of the construction and operation of facilities proposed in the Paiute
Pipeline Expansion Project.

1

 This EA will be used by the Commission in its decision-making process to determine whether an environmental impact
statement is necessary and whether or not to approve the project. 




Summary of the Proposed Project 



On November 10, 1993, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or Commission) issued a Notice of Intent To Prepare
a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Northwest Expansion II Projects. The projects included two
proposals by Paiute in Docket Nos. CP93-751-000 and CP94-29-000, and related projects proposed
by Northwest Pipeline Corporation (Northwest) in Docket Nos. CP93-613-000 and CP93-673-000.
The purpose of the notice was to request comments on environmental issues. 

Because of changes made in Northwest's proposals, Paiute withdrew its application in Docket No. CP93-751-000
which proposed the construction of 7.8 miles of loop pipeline in two segments on September 8, 1994. Also, on September
9, 1994, Paiute sent a letter to the Director of OPR indicating that no changes were necessary to Docket No. CP94-29-000.
In this application Paiute proposes to: 

 Construct 53.5 miles of loop pipeline in seven segments; 
 Construct two new compressor stations with a total of 2,139 horsepower (hp) of compression; 
 Add 268 hp of compression at an existing compressor station by installing an upgraded compressor unit; and

 Modify other existing meter, compressor, and pressure reduction stations. 
The following table contains more detailed information about the facilities. The general location of the project
facilities is shown in appendix 1.

Southwest Gas Corporation, a local distribution company, would also build facilities to receive gas from Paiute
and serve additional customers in the Truckee, California area. Those facilities include: 
 22.9 miles of small diameter distribution pipeline; 
 18.4 miles of transmission pipeline (ranging from 6 to 12 inches in diameter); and 
 Five distribution regulator stations. 
We have determined that an environmental assessment (EA), rather than an EIS is the more appropriate document for
analyzing the potential environmental impacts associated with Paiute's project.

3

 This decision was made because the scope of the projects originally anticipated for the EIS decreased when Northwest's
applications no longer included the delivery of gas to Paiute, severing the connection between the two proposals,
and Paiute withdrew one of its proposals. The Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Forest Service concur as cooperating
agencies. 




The EA Process 


The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires the Commission to take into account the environmental impacts
that could result from a major Federal action whenever it considers the issuance of a Certificate of Public Convenience
and Necessity. Our EA will give the Commission the information it needs to do that. If the EA concludes that the projects
would result in significant environmental impacts, we will prepare an environmental impact statement. Otherwise
we will prepare a Finding of No Significant Impact. 

NEPA also requires us to discover and address concerns the public may have about proposals. We call this ``scoping''.
The main goal of the scoping process is to focus the analysis in the EA on the important environmental issues, and to
separate these from issues that are insignificant and do not require detailed study. Local scoping meetings have
already been held for the original projects. Additional scoping meetings are not planned since the facilities have
not changed. We are asking for comments which may provide 

new information

 or on the change in the environmental documentation. 

The EA will discuss impacts that 

could

 occur as a result of the construction and operation of the proposed projects under these general subject headings:

 Geology and soils 
 Endangered and threatened species 
 Water resources 
 Vegetation 
 Land use 
 Air quality and noise 
 Wetland and riparian habitat 
 Cultural resources 
 Fish and wildlife 
 Public safety 
We will also evaluate possible alternatives to the projects, or portions of the projects, and make recommendations
on how to lessen or avoid impacts on the various resource areas. 

Our independent analysis of the issues will result in the publication of the EA which will be mailed to Federal, state,
and local agencies, public interest groups, interested individuals, affected landowners, newspapers, libraries,
and the Commission's official service list for these proceedings. 


Public Participation 


You can make a difference by sending a letter with your specific comments or concerns about the projects. You should
focus on identifying information that was not previously available or brought to our attention. You do not need to
re-submit comments if you have already done so. We are particularly interested in alternatives to the proposals (including
alternative routes), and measures to avoid or lessen environmental impact. The more specific your comments, the
more useful they will be. Please follow the instructions below to ensure that your comments are received and properly
recorded: 
 Address your letter to: 
Lois Cashell, Secretary, 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 
825 North Capitol St., NE., 
Washington, D.C. 20426; 
 Reference Docket No. CP94-9-000; 
 Send a 

copy

 of your letter to: 
Ms. Lauren O'Donnell, Project Manager, 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 
825 North Capitol St., N.E., Room 7312, 
Washington, D.C. 20426; and 
 Mail your comments so they will be received in Washington D.C. on or before November 7, 1994. 


Becoming an Intervenor 


In addition to involvement in the EA scoping process, you may want to become an official party to the proceedings or
an ``intervenor''. Among other things, intervenors have the right to receive copies of case-related Commission
documents and filings by other intervenors. Likewise, each intervenor must provide copies of its filings to all other
parties. If you want to become an intervenor you must file a Motion to Intervene according to Rule 214 of the Commission's
Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214) which is attached as appendix 2. 
The date for filing timely motions to intervene in this proceeding has passed. Therefore, parties now seeking to file
late interventions must show good cause, as required by Section 385.214(b)(3), why this time limitation should be
waived. Environmental issues have been viewed as good cause for late intervention. You do not need intervenor status
to have your scoping comments considered. 


Environmental Mailing List 


If you do not want to send comments at this time but still want to receive a copy of the EA, please return the Information
Request (see appendix 3). If you have previously returned the Information Request you don't need to do so again. 
Additional information about the proposed projects is available from Ms. Lauren O'Donnell, EA Project Manager,
at (202) 208-325.

Take notice that on October 14, 1994, Edison Electric Institute (``EEI''), on behalf of its member electric utilities
and pursuant to Section 207 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, petitioned the Commission to issue
a Statement of Policy on the ratemaking treatment of the costs associated with sulfur dioxide (SO

2

) emission allowances required by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. EEI's request is limited to coordination transactions.
EEI also requests, among other things, that the Commission find that neither the sale nor purchase of emission allowances
require authorization under section 203 of the Federal Power Act, and find that the sale of emission allowances does
not constitute a wholesale power sale and therefore is not jurisdictional under section 205 of the Federal Power Act.

Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rules 211

<DOCTITLE>Florida Gas Transmission Co.; Notice of Proposed Changes in FERC Gas Tariff</DOCTITLE>



October 17, 1994.



Take notice that on October 13, 1994, Florida Gas Transmission Company (FGT), tendered for filing to become part of
its FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1, effective December 1, 1994, the tariff sheets listed on the attached
Appendix A.

FGT states the instant filing proposes changes to FGT's FERC Gas Tariff which primarily correct minor errors and clarify
certain provisions. Specifically, FGT submits the revised tariff sheets as follows:

Third Revised Sheet No. 1 reflects FGT's correction of two page references and adds Sheet No. 8D to the Table of Contents.
Sheet No. 8D was filed September 22, 1994, in compliance with FERC's Order issued August 31, 1994, in Docket No. RP94-332.

Fourth Revised Sheet No. 43 and Third Revised Sheet No. 49 eliminate the designation of contacts authorized to perform
day-to-day dispatching from the listing of information required when requesting ITS-1 and IPS transportation
service. Due to the changing nature of this information, it is more expedient for FGT to obtain this data at the time
nominations are furnished.

Second Revised Sheet No. 180 clarifies that FGT will retain variable costs, usage surcharges, and fuel charges prior
to revenue sharing and crediting consistent with the sharing and crediting mechanism approved in Docket No. RS92-16.

Second Revised Sheet No. 183 corrects an error in the determination of Participating Firm Shippers' total share of
Interruptible Shared Proceeds. Original Sheet No. 183 made effective November 1, 1993, contained the correct determination
of the shared proceeds. When FGT filed First Revised Sheet No. 183 to change certain other provisions of this section,
language from an earlier draft of this sheet, which never became effective, was inadvertently included. In addition,
the term ``Relinquishing Shipper'' has been changed to ``Participating Shipper'' to conform with the terms used
in this section.

First Revised Sheet Nos. 197A and 197C reflect an accounting change required by the FERC in Order No. 552. Two typographical
errors also are corrected on Sheet No. 197C.

Second Revised Sheet Nos. 452, 459 and 462 and First Revised Sheet No. 463 delete references to and eliminate Exhibit
C from FGT's FTS-1 form of service agreement while designating and modifying Exhibit B to set forth the Maximum
Daily Transportation Quantities formerly reflected on Exhibit C.

First Revised Sheet Nos. 454, 470, 485, 494A, 500 and 514 have been modified to clarify that the commencement of the
primary term of a transportation service agreement between FGT and a Shipper may be different than the effective date
of the service agreement.

Second Revised Sheet Nos. 499, 502, 504 and 507 and First Revised Sheet Nos. 500, 505 and 506 reflect certain modifications
to FGT's ITS-1 form of service agreement solely for purposes of clarification. Second Revised Sheet Nos. 501
and 508 delete references to and eliminate Exhibit A from the ITS-1 form of service agreement. Third Revised
Sheet No. 509 eliminates extraneous text from this page previously designated as ``Reserved for Future Use''.

Finally, First Revised Sheet No. 659 corrects two typographical errors reflected on FGT's Index of Requirements
by End-Use Priority.

FGT states that copies of the filing were mailed to all customers serviced under the rate schedules affected by the
filing and the interested state commissions.

<DOCTITLE>Northern Natural Gas Co.; Notice of Amendment to Application</DOCTITLE>


October 17, 1994.


Take notice that on October 7, 1994, Northern Natural Gas Company (Northern), 1111 South 103rd Street, Omaha, Nebraska
68124, filed an amendment (Amendment) to its original application in Docket No. CP94-608-000 which was
filed pursuant to Section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act for an order permitting and approving the abandonment by sale
to Enron Gathering Company (EGC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Enron Operations Corp., certain compression, dehydrating,
delivery point and pipeline facilities, with appurtenances, located in various counties in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas,
Wyoming and Colorado and services rendered thereby. Also, in its original application, Northern requests approval
concurrent with the conveyance of the facilities to EGC to abandon certain agreements and services. Northern states
that the Amendment: (1) Reflects changes in the Amended and Restated Contract for the Purchase and Sale of Assets,
dated September 23, 1994, (Amended Contract); (2) clarifies certain elements of the original application; and (3)
updated certain exhibits with additional information, all as more fully set forth in the amendment which is on file
with the Commission and open to public inspection.
Northern states that it is amending the application to divide it into four parts, identifying the facilities on the
basis of geographic production areas and requests that each partial assignment made by EGC to its four affiliates
be given a separate subdocket to facilitate review along the geographic lines associated with each affiliate taking
assignment from EGC. Northern indicates that, by assignments dated September 23, 1994, EGC has assigned the gathering
facilities generally located in: (1) The Anadarko production area to Enron Anadarko Gathering Corp. (EAGC); (2)
the Hugoton production area to Enron Gathering Limited Partnership (EGLP); (3) the Permian production area to Enron
Permian Gathering Inc. (EPGI), and; (4) the Rocky Mountain region to Enron Mountain Gathering Inc. (EMGI). Northern
states that, pursuant to the Amended Contract, EGC has made partial assignments of the gathering facilities to the
four separate and distinct regional entities due to expressions of interest by third parties to purchase certain
of these assets from EGC.
In the Amendment, Northern states that it is also refiling three large scale maps to make changes and clarifications
to symbols, locations and functions of facilities identified on the maps. Further, Northern states that it is adding
two delivery points on the Brewer system in the Hugoton production area located in Texas County, Oklahoma and the Jackson
B

#

1 delivery point in the Anadarko production area located in Hansford County, Texas. Also, Northern is deleting the
Clinton Oil Company delivery point from its list of delivery points since it is located on a transmission pipeline
that is not included in the facilities to be abandoned, it is indicated.
Northern states that it is supplementing Exhibit W to replace a notice of termination of Rate Schedule T-5 with
a consent letter to terminate Rate Schedule T-5 between Northern and Mobil Oil Corporation. Also, Northern
states it is amending Exhibit U to delete its request to abandon Northern's Rate Schedule X-38 since the abandonment
authorization has been requested in a separate proceeding.
Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said amendment should on or before November
7, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest
in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211)
and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered
by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding.
Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion
to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. All persons who have heretofore filed need not file again.

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Issuance of Decisions and Orders During the Week of August 1 Through August 5, 1994</DOCTITLE>


During the week of August 1 through August 5, 1994, the decisions and orders summarized below were issued with respect
to applications for relief filed with the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the Department of Energy. The following
summary also contains a list of submissions that were dismissed by the Office of Hearings and Appeals.


Request for Exception




Noltgas Propane Fuel & Supply, 8/2/94, LEE-0098



Noltgas Propane Fuel & Supply filed an Application for Exception from the reporting requirement of Form EIA-782B.
In considering the request, the DOE found that the firm was not experiencing a serious hardship or gross inequity,
as those terms have been defined by the DOE. Accordingly, exception relief was denied.


Whistleblower Proceeding


Dr. Naresh Mehta, 8/4/94, LWN-0003



The DOE issued an Order granting Dr. Naresh Mehta interim reinstatement to his former position at the Superconducting
Super Collider Laboratory. On March 17, 1994, the DOE had found that Dr. Mehta's dismissal by Universities Research
Association, a DOE contractor, violated the provisions of the Contractor Employee Protection Regulations, 10 CFR
part 708. Although the DOE had ordered that Dr. Mehta be reinstated in March 1994, the reinstatement was stayed by a
request for review filed by Universities Research Association.

ACTION:

 Notice of Implementation of Special Refund Procedures 


 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) of the Department of Energy (DOE) announces the procedures for disbursement
of the total amount of $2,226,782.70 in crude oil overcharges obtained by the DOE under the terms of a Consent Order
that Mt. Airy Refining Company (Mt. Airy) and its former shareholders, William P. Boswell, W. Luke Boswell, Lindsay
B. McLean, David P. Boswell, P. Wilson Boswell II and Ellen W. Boswell, entered into with DOE on November 14, 1990. Case
No. LEF-0121. OHA has determined that the funds will be distributed in accordance with DOE's Modified Statement
of Restitutionary Policy in Crude Oil Cases. 


 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In accordance with 10 CFR 205.282(c), notice is hereby given of the issuance of the Decision and Order set out below.
The Decision sets forth the procedures that DOE has formulated to distribute the total amount of $2,226,782.70 obtained
under the terms of a Consent Order that DOE entered into with Mt. Airy Refining Company and its former shareholders
on November 14, 1990. The Consent Order settles claims by DOE that Mt. Airy had violated reporting provisions of the
Mandatory Petroleum Allocation Regulations and the Administrative Procedures and Sanctions Regulations with
regard to its sale of crude oil. 



OHA will distribute the Mt. Airy Consent Order funds in accordance with DOE's Modified Statement of Restitutionary
Policy in Crude Oil Cases (the MSRP). 51 FR 27899 (August 4, 1986). Under the MSRP, crude oil overcharge monies are divided
between the Federal government, the states, and injured purchasers of refined petroleum products. Refunds to the
states are distributed in proportion to each state's consumption of petroleum products during the price control
period. Refunds to eligible purchasers are based on the total volume of petroleum products purchased and the degree
to which they can demonstrate injury. 




Because the June 30, 1994, deadline for crude oil refund applications has passed, no new applications from purchasers
of refined petroleum products will be accepted for these funds. Instead, the share allocated to these purchasers
will be added to the general crude oil overcharge pool used for direct restitution.

Decision and Order of the Department of Energy

Implementation of Special Refund Procedures 



October 14, 1994.




Name of Firm: Mt. Airy Refining Company. 
Date of Filing: February 3, 1994. 
Case Number: LEF-0121. 




On February 3, 1994, the Economic Regulatory Administration (ERA) of the Department of Energy filed a Petition requesting
that the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) formulate and implement Subpart V special refund proceedings for crude
oil overcharge funds. Under DOE procedural regulations, special refund proceedings may be implemented to refund
monies to persons injured by violations of DOE petroleum price and allocation regulations, provided DOE is unable
to readily identify such persons or ascertain the refund amount each person should receive. 10 CFR 205.280. We have
considered ERA's request to formulate refund procedures for the disbursement of $2,226,782.70 remitted by Mt. Airy
Refining Company (Mt. Airy) and its former shareholders, William P. Boswell, W. Luke Boswell, Lindsay B. McLean,
David P. Boswell, P. Wilson Boswell II and Ellen W. Boswell, in connection with a Consent Order Mt. Airy and its former
shareholders entered into with DOE and have determined that such procedures are appropriate.
 





The Mt. Airy Consent Order funds were remitted to DOE to remedy the firm's alleged violation of the Mandatory Petroleum
Allocation Regulations published at 10 CFR Part 211 and the provisions of the Administrative Procedures and Sanctions
Regulations set forth at 10 CFR Part 205. These funds are being held in an escrow account established with the United
States Treasury pending a determination of their proper distribution. This Decision sets forth OHA's plan to distribute
those funds. 



I. Jurisdiction and Authority 



The general guidelines that govern OHA's ability to formulate and implement a plan to distribute refunds are set forth
at 10 CFR Part 205, Subpart V. These procedures apply in situations where DOE cannot readily identify persons injured
as a result of actual or alleged violations of its regulations or ascertain the refund amount each person should receive.
For a more detailed discussion of Subpart V and OHA's authority to fashion procedures to distribute refunds see, 

Office of Enforcement

, 9 DOE  82,508 (1981) and 

Office of Enforcement

, 8 DOE  82,597 (1981). 



II. Background 



Mt. Airy operated a refinery in Mt. Airy, Louisiana from the date of its incorporation under the laws of the state of
Ohio in 1977 until its dissolution on August 11, 1983. It was therefore a ``refiner'' as that term has been defined in
the federal petroleum price and allocation regulations at 10 CFR  211.62. As such, Mt. Airy was subject to the
jurisdiction of DOE. 

In accordance with the reporting requirements found at 10 CFR  211.66(b)(h), Mt. Airy was required to submit
a ``Refiners Monthly Report'' detailing its crude oil receipts, runs to stills and volume of crude oil processed.
DOE reviewed Mt. Airy's compliance with these regulatory provisions during the course of an audit of Mt. Airy's principal
business operations. The audit was conducted during the period beginning on January 1, 1977 and ending on January
27, 1981. On July 25, 1986, ERA issued a Proposed Remedial Order which found that Mt. Airy had improperly reported its
crude oil receipts for the period beginning July 1977 and ending November 1977. ERA amended that Order on May 27, 1987
(the May 1987 Order) to include additional entitlement reporting violations by Mt. Airy. 

The May 1987 Order states that Mt. Airy's violations resulted in its receipt of $2,059,649.94 in entitlements which
it was not authorized to receive and directs Mt. Airy to refund the amount of its violation, plus interest. The Order
further states that Mt. Airy shareholders were individually liable, to the extent that Mt. Airy's assets were distributed
to them upon its dissolution in 1983, for refunding the violation amount. ERA found that shareholder liability in
this case was predicated upon the ``trust fund doctrine'', which provides that stockholders who receive assets upon
corporate dissolution hold those assets in trust for the payment of bona fide corporate debts incurred before dissolution.


See Bayport

, 18 DOE  83,007 at 86,058 (1989). Mt. Airy and its former shareholders vigorously contested the May 1987 Order
in proceedings before OHA. Nonetheless, without admitting any violations whatsoever, they agreed to enter into
a Consent Order with DOE on November 14, 1990, (the November 1990 Order) to settle the violations.

In accordance with the November 1990 Order, Mt. Airy and its former shareholders (1) paid the principal sum of two million
dollars ($2,000,000.00), plus interest, in full and final settlement of all matters covered by the Order; and (2)
agreed to retain (i) Mt. Airy's records evidencing sales volume data for each product subject to controls, during
the period covered by the audit; and (ii) Mt. Airy's customers' names and addresses. The November 1990 Order requires
Mt. Airy to retain the records described above for a period of thirty (30) days following DOE's final distribution
of the Mt. Airy Consent Order funds or January 1, 2000, whichever occurs earlier. Mt. Airy shall make such information
available to DOE, if so requested. 


III. The Crude Oil Refund Procedures 


A. Crude Oil Refund Policy 


The monies remitted by Mt. Airy and its former shareholders will be distributed in accordance with DOE's Modified
Statement of Restitutionary Policy in Crude Oil Cases (MSRP). 

See

 51 Fed. Reg. 27899 (August 4, 1986). This policy has been utilized in all Subpart V proceedings involving alleged crude
oil violations. 

See

 Order Implementing the MSRP, 51 Fed. Reg. 29689 (August 20, 1986) (the August 1986 Order). 

Under the MSRP, 40 percent of the crude oil overcharge funds will be refunded to the federal government, another 40
percent to the states, and up to 20 percent may initially be reserved for the payment of claims by injured parties. The
MSRP also specified that any monies remaining after all valid claims by injured purchasers are paid will be disbursed
to the federal government and the states in equal amounts. See, 

In re:

 The Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation, 653 F. Supp. 108 (D. Kan.), 6 Fed. Energy Guidelines
 90,509 (1986) (the Stripper Well Settlement Agreement) for a more detailed discussion of the MSRP. 

On April 10, 1987, the OHA issued a Notice analyzing the numerous comments received in response to the August 1986 Order.
52 Fed. Reg. 11737 (April 10, 1987) (the April 10 Notice). This Notice provided guidance to claimants that anticipated
filing refund applications for crude oil monies under the Subpart V regulations. In general, we stated that all claimants
would be required to (1) document their purchase volumes of petroleum products during the August 19, 1973 through
January 27, 1981, crude oil price control period; and (2) prove they were injured by the alleged crude oil overcharges.
End-users of petroleum products whose businesses are unrelated to the petroleum industry would be presumed to have
been injured by the alleged crude oil overcharges and would not be required to submit proof of injury. 

See City of Columbus, Georgia,

 16 DOE  85,550 (1987). 


B. The Proposed Decision and Order 



On June 3, 1994, OHA issued a Proposed Decision and Order (PDO) establishing tentative procedures to distribute the
crude oil violation amount that had been obtained from Mt. Airy and its former shareholders. The amount of money covered
by the PDO is $2,226,782.70, plus accrued interest. OHA tentatively concluded that the funds should be distributed
in accordance with the MSRP and the April Notice. Pursuant to the MSRP, OHA proposed to reserve 20 percent of these funds
($445,357.00) for direct refunds to applicants who claim that they were injured by the crude oil violations. We stated
that the remaining 80 percent of the funds would be distributed to the states and the federal government for indirect
restitution. After all valid claims have been paid, any remaining funds in the claim reserve would also be divided
between the states and the federal government. The federal government's share ultimately would be deposited into
the general fund of the Treasury. 

We provided a period of 30 days from the date of the PDO's publication in the 

Federal Register

 in which the public could submit comments regarding the tentative refund procedures. More than 30 days have elapsed,
and the OHA has received no comments concerning the proposed procedures.

<DOCNO> FR941021-2-00049 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941021-2-00036 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Under the terms of the MSRP, 80 percent of the crude oil violation amounts subject to this Decision or $1,781,426.00
in principal, plus accrued interest, should be disbursed in equal shares to the states and federal government for
indirect restitution. Accordingly, we will direct the DOE's Office of the Controller to transfer one-half of that
amount, or $890,713.00, plus interest, into an interest bearing subaccount for the states, and one-half, or $890,713.00,
plus interest, into an interest bearing subaccount for the federal government. In accordance with previous practice,
when the amount available for distribution to the states reaches $10 million, we will direct the DOE's Office of the
Controller to make the appropriate disbursement to the individual states. Refunds to the states will be in proportion
to the consumption of petroleum products in each state during the period of price controls. The share or ratio of the
funds allocated to each state is contained in Exhibit H of the Stripper Well Agreement. When disbursed, these funds
will be subject to the same limitations and reporting requirements that apply to any other crude oil funds received
by the states in accordance with the Stripper Well Agreement. 

We must also determine the appropriate method for disbursing the 20 percent of the fund available for direct restitution
($445,357). The application period for crude oil overcharge refunds ended on June 30, 1994. As we discussed in 

King Petroleum, Inc.,

 Case No. LEF-0125, August 8, 1994 (Proposed Decision and Order), we will not hold a separate refund proceeding
for monies that become available for direct restitution after the June 30, 1994 closing date. 59 Fed. Reg. 41755 (August
15, 1994). Therefore, the funds in this case ($445,357) will be added to the general crude oil overcharge pool for direct
restitution to those applicants who applied by the June 30, 1994 deadline. 

It Is Therefore Ordered That: 

(1) The Director of Special Accounts and Payroll, Office of Departmental Accounting and Financial Systems Development,
Office of the Controller, Department of Energy, shall take all steps necessary to transfer $2,226,782.70, plus accrued
interest, from the Mt. Airy Refining Company escrow account Number 650X00286Z, as specified in Paragraphs (2), (3)
and (4) of this Decision. 

(2) The Director of Special Accounts and Payroll shall transfer $890,713.00, plus accrued interest, of the funds
referenced in Paragraph (1) above, into the subaccount denominated ``Crude Tracking-States,'' Number 999DOE003W.


(3) The Director of Special Accounts and Payroll shall transfer $890,713.00, plus accrued interest, of the funds
referenced in Paragraph (1) above, into the subaccount denominated ``Crude Tracking-Federal,'' Number 999DOE002W.


(4) The Director of Special Accounts and Payroll shall transfer $445,357.00, plus accrued interest, of the funds
referenced in Paragraph (1) above, into the subaccount denominated ``Crude Tracking-Claimants 4,'' Number 999DOE0010Z.


(5) This is a final Order of the Department of Energy.

<DOCTITLE>Workshop on Particulate Matter Mortality Epidemiological Research</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
agency: 

Environmental Protection Agency.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
action: 

Notice of public meeting.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is sponsoring a workshop to review selected epidemiology studies
of relationships between particulate matter (PM) and mortality among human populations. The Environmental Criteria
and Assessment Office (ECAO), within EPA's Office of Research and Development, is conducting the workshop to critically
examine the subject studies to determine the extent to which these studies and supporting materials provide an adequate
quantitative basis for determining PM exposure characteristics (particle sizes, concentrations, etc.) associated
with any increased risk of human mortality/morbidity effects. This workshop is being held as part of the process for
reviewing and, as appropriate, revising the EPA document Air Quality Criteria for Particulate Matter, to meet statutory
requirements of the Clean Air Act.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplemental information: 

As discussed in a previous call for information (59 FR 17375, April 12, 1994), EPA is undertaking to review and where
appropriate, update and revise the document, Air Quality Criteria for Particulate Matter. As part of this process,
the scientific literature is reviewed for information that will help form the scientific bases on which decisions
can be made with regard to possible revision of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for Particulate
Matter (PM) under section 109(d) of the Clean Air Act. This workshop will include presentation and review of methodological
aspects and analytical results from newly emerging epidemiology studies that evaluate the potential health effects
from PM exposure and are likely to be of much importance in addressing health effects issues in the revised PM criteria
document. The 1994 workshop discussions and associated peer-review comments will provide inputs for consideration
in the drafting of epidemiology chapter materials to be included in an initial draft of the revised PM criteria document.
The epidemiology chapter (and other chapters) of that initial document draft will later undergo review at another
experts' workshop to be held in early 1995 (as will be announced in a later 

Federal Register

 notice) before release of an external review draft of the document for public review and comment, and review by the
Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC).



Copies of the research studies to be covered at the November 1994 workshop will be made available to the public at the
time of the workshop. Members of the public will have an opportunity at the workshop to make brief, oral statements
pertinent to the technical evaluation of the epidemiologic studies under review at the workshop. The workshop will
not address the issue of possible revision of the current PM NAAQS per se. Interested parties also are invited to assist
the EPA in developing and refining the scientific information base for PM by submitting new information on the topics
covered at the workshop. To be considered for inclusion in the review process, submitted information should have
been published or accepted for publication in a peer-reviewed, scientific journal. Such information should be submitted
to Allan Marcus at the address provided.

<DOCTITLE>Public Meeting on the Development of Smoking Prevention and Cessation; Clinical Practice Guideline </DOCTITLE>



The Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announce
that a public meeting will be held to receive comments and information pertaining to the development of the clinical
practice guideline on Smoking Prevention and Cessation. The guideline will focus on the intervention therapies
used for nicotine dependence treatment and the evidence of their effectiveness. The guideline is being developed
by a private-sector panel of health care experts and consumers. The panel is supported by AHCPR. 
A notice announcing that AHCPR was arranging for the development of this clinical practice guideline was published
in the 

Federal Register

 on December 15, 1992 (Vol. 57, No. 241). That notice invited nominations for experts and consumers to serve on the panel
that is developing the guideline. 
A public meeting to provide an opportunity for interested parties to contribute relevant information and comments,
including research in areas relevant to the guideline, will be held as follows: 


Meeting: 

Smoking Prevention and Cessation.


Date: 

November 9, 1994.


From: 

9:00 a.m.-12:00 p.m. 


Location: 

Bethesda Marriott Hotel, Grand Ballroom, 5151 Pooks Hill Road; Bethesda, MD 20814.


Phone: 

(301) 897-9400.


Background 


The AHCPR is charged, under Title IX of the Public Health Service Act, with enhancing the quality, appropriateness,
and effectiveness of health care services, and access to such services. The AHCPR accomplishes its goals through
the establishment of a broad base of scientific research, and through the promotion of improvements in clinical practice
and in the organization, financing, and delivery of health care services. (See 42 U.S.C. 299-299c-6 and
1320-12.) 
In keeping with its legislative mandates, AHCPR arranges for the development, periodic review, and update of clinically
relevant guidelines that may be used by physicians, nurses, other health care providers, educators, and consumers
to assist in determining how diseases, disorders, and other health care conditions can most effectively and appropriately
be prevented, diagnosed, treated, and clinically managed. Medical review criteria, standards of quality, and performance
measures are then developed based on the guidelines produced. 
Section 912 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 299b-1(b)), as amended, requires that the guidelines: 
1. Be based on the best available research and professional judgment; 
2. Be presented in formats appropriate for use by physicians, nurses, other health care providers, medical educators,
medical review organizations, and consumers; 
3. Be presented in treatment-specific or condition-specific forms appropriate for use in clinical practice, education
programs, and reviewing quality and appropriateness of medical care;

4. Include information on the risks and benefits of alternative strategies for prevention, diagnosis, treatment,
and management of the particular health condition(s); and 

5. Include information on the costs of alternative strategies for prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and management
of the particular health condition(s), where cost information is available and reliable. 

Section 914 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 299b-3(a)), as amended, identifies factors to be considered in establishing
priorities for guidelines, including the extent to which the guidelines would: 

1. Improve methods for disease prevention; 

2. Improve methods of diagnosis, treatment, and clinical management, and thereby benefit a significant number of
individuals; 

3. Reduce clinically significant variations among clinicians in the particular services and procedures utilized
in making diagnoses and providing treatment; and 

4. Reduce clinically significant variations in the outcomes of health care services and procedures. 

Also, in accordance with Title IX of the PHS Act and section 1142 of the Social Security Act, the AHCPR Administrator
is to assure that the needs and priorities of the Medicare program are reflected appropriately in the agenda and priorities
for development of guidelines and guideline updates. 



Arrangements for the November 9, 1994 Public Meeting on Smoking Prevention and Cessation 



Representatives of organizations and other individuals are invited to provide relevant written comments and information,
and make a brief (5 minutes or less) oral statement to the panel. Individuals and representatives who would like to
attend must register with Cheryl Campbell, Panel Manager, Technical Resources, Inc., (TRI), at the address set out
below by 
October 26, 1994, and indicate whether they plan to make an oral statement. A written copy of the oral statement, comments,

 Notice of availability.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), as amended by the Superfund
Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA) [42 U.S.C. 9604(i)(3)] directs the Administrator of ATSDR to prepare
toxicological profiles of priority hazardous substances and to revise and republish each toxicological profile
as necessary. This notice announces the availability of 8 updated drafts and 2 new draft toxicological profiles prepared
by ATSDR for review and comment. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) (Pub. L. 99-499) amends the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund) (42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq.) by establishing certain
responsibilities for the ATSDR and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with regard to hazardous substances
which are most commonly found at facilities on the CERCLA National Priorities List (NPL). Among these statutory provisions
is that the Administrator of ATSDR prepare toxicological profiles for substances included on the priority lists
of hazardous substances. These lists identified the 
275 hazardous substances which both Agencies determined pose the most significant potential threat to human health.
The availability of the revised priority list of 275 hazardous substances was announced in the 

Federal Register

 on February 28, 1994 (59 FR 9486). For prior versions of the list of substances see 

Federal Register

 notices dated April 17, 1987 (52 FR 12866); October 20, 1988 (53 FR 41280); October 26, 1989 (54 FR 43619); October 17,
1990 (55 FR 42067); October 17, 1991 (56 FR 52166); and October 28, 1992 (57 FR 48801). CERCLA also requires ATSDR to
assure the initiation of a research program to fill data needs associated with the substances. 



Section 104(i)(3) of CERCLA (42 U.S.C. 9604(i)(3)) outlines the content of these profiles. Each profile is required
to include an examination, summary and interpretation of available toxicological information and epidemiologic
evaluations. This information and data are to be used to ascertain the levels of significant human exposure for the
substance and the associated health effects. The profiles must also include a determination of whether adequate
information on the health effects of each substance is available or in the process of development. When adequate information
is not available, ATSDR, in cooperation with the National Toxicology Program (NTP), is required to assure the initiation
of a program of research designed to determine these health effects. 

Although key studies for each of the substances were considered during the profile development process, this 

Federal Register

 notice seeks to solicit any additional studies, particularly unpublished data and ongoing studies, which will be
evaluated for possible addition to the profiles now or in the future.

The following draft toxicological profiles are expected to be available to the public on or about October 17, 1994.







All profiles issued as ``Drafts for Public Comment'' represent the agency's best efforts to provide important toxicological
information on priority hazardous substances in compliance with the substantive and procedural requirements of
Section 104(i)(3) of CERCLA, as amended. As in the past, we are seeking public comments and additional information
which may be used to 
supplement these profiles. ATSDR remains committed to providing a public comment period for these documents as a
means to best serve public health and our clients.

Medicare Program; Data, Standards, and Methodology Used to 
Establish Fiscal Year 1995 Budgets for Fiscal Intermediaries 
and Carriers 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), HHS. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed notice. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice describes the data, standards, and 
methodology that will be used to establish fiscal 
intermediary and carrier budgets for fiscal year 1995, which 
begins October 1, 1994. Fiscal intermediaries and carriers 
are public or private entities that participate in the 
administration of the Medicare program by performing claims 
processing and benefit payment functions. This notice is 
published in accordance with sections 1816(c)(1) and 
1842(c)(1) of the Social Security Act, which require us to 
publish for public comment the data, standards, and 
methodology we intend to use to establish budgets for 
Medicare fiscal intermediaries and carriers. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

I. Background 



Under sections 1816(a) and 1842(a) of the Social 
Security Act (the Act), public or private organizations and 
agencies may participate in the administration of the 
Medicare program under agreements or contracts entered into 
with the Secretary. These Medicare contractors are known as 
fiscal intermediaries (section 1816(a) of the Act) and 
carriers (section 1842(a) of the Act). Fiscal 
intermediaries perform bill processing and benefit payment 
functions for Part A of the program (Hospital Insurance) and 
carriers perform claim processing and benefit payment 
functions for Part B of the program (Supplementary Medical 
Insurance). When bills are submitted by providers, and 
claims by beneficiaries, physicians, and suppliers of 
services, fiscal intermediaries and carriers are responsible 
for: 

 Determining the eligibility status of a beneficiary; 

 Determining whether the services on the submitted 
claims or bills are covered under Medicare and, if so, 
what are the correct payment amounts; and

<TEXT>
 

 Making appropriate payments to the provider, 
beneficiary, physician, and/or supplier of services. 

Fiscal intermediary and carrier performance is 
monitored by HCFA at the central office and regional office 
(RO) levels. In general, issues that affect policies on a 
national level are addressed by the central office, and 
issues dealing with regional and local policies, as well as 
those of an operational nature, are addressed by the ROs. 
Continuous communication between HCFA and the fiscal 
intermediaries and carriers is established through 
consultation workgroups that meet on a regular basis and are 
comprised of representatives from the central office, ROs, 
and Medicare contractors. 



II. Fiscal Intermediary and Carrier Budget Process 



HCFA's central office is responsible for developing a 
national contractor budget for Parts A and B of the Medicare 
program. The budget is formulated over an 18-month period, 
beginning in March of the calendar year preceding the fiscal 
year (FY) to which it applies. Input from the contractor 
community, HCFA, the Department of Health and Human 
Services, and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is 
received and included before submission to the President for 
approval and forwarding to the Congress. Once the national 
contractor budget has been approved, HCFA issues Budget and 
Performance Requirements (BPRs). BPRs specify the level of 
effort required for contractor functions and serve as the 
statement of work for contractor use in preparing their 
individual budgets for submission to HCFA. 

The budgets submitted by contractors are reviewed by 
the ROs during a budget level determination process that is 
based on current claims processing trends, legislative 
mandates, administrative initiatives, current year 
performance standards and criteria, and the availability of 
funds appropriated by the Congress. We subsequently 
allocate funding within these constraints. 

This notice contains the proposed data, standards, and 
methodology that we intend to use to establish a national 
contractor budget for fiscal intermediaries and carriers for 
FY 1995. As in prior years, we have had, and will continue 
to seek, extensive input from the involved parties, 
particularly contractors, when establishing the national 
contractor budget. The national contractor budget (the FY 
1995 President's budget) has already been presented to the 
Congress. Nevertheless, to the extent that we receive 
comments during this comment period, which warrant revisions 
to the data, standards, and methodology we used, we will 
make the necessary changes before publishing the final 
notice.

III. Overview of FY 1995 National Medicare Contractor Budget 


A. Data, Standards, and Methodology 


The FY 1995 national Medicare contractor budget request was submitted to the Congress in February 1994. The workload
for the FY 1995 request is expressed in terms of work processed. For Part A, the FY 1995 estimated workload (129.2 million
bills) is 9.2 percent more than the FY 1994 estimate. For Part B, the estimated workload (655.6 million claims) results
in a 4.2 percent increase over the FY 1994 estimate. 
Our estimates involved the use of a regression model that uses the last 36 months of actual contractor workload data.
For the FY 1995 projections, we used November 1993 data, which were the latest available to us at the time. The resulting
projections will be updated monthly to assure that the most timely data are available for budgeting purposes. 
The FY 1995 unit costs for processing bills and claims were calculated based on the FY 1994 level adjusted for savings
achieved due to productivity, Electronic Media Claims, and reduced funding for incremental workload. This calculation
resulted in a new unit cost, which, when multiplied by the Part A or Part B workloads, determines the total amount required
for bill and claim processing in FY 1995. 
Feedback received from contractors and ROs during the past several years has led us to believe that contractors can
make major improvements in performance if given the authority to manage their budgets. The FY 1994 BPRs gave the ROs
the authority to set a budget and the contractors the authority to manage their budgets on a bottom-line basis. Once
funding was issued, each contractor had the flexibility to optimally manage the budget consistent with the statement
of work contained in the BPRs. Prior to FY 1993, contractors were not allowed to ``shift'' more than 5 percent of funds
from one line item to another in their budget, as determined by the lesser of the two line items. This restriction was
intended to give contractors some latitude with regard to reporting their costs, yet still allow HCFA to maintain
control over the national budget. With the exception of the ``Payment Safeguards,'' ``Productivity Investments,''
and ``Other'' line items, contractors now have total flexibility in the use of funds. There is a 5 percent limitation
on the amount of funds that may be shifted out of individual ``Payment Safeguards,'' with unlimited shifting into
``Payment Safeguards.'' Shifting into or out of ``Productivity Investments'' and ``Other'' line item funding,
not governed by contract modifications, may not exceed 5 percent. Each ``Other'' line item is treated separately.
The ``Productivity Investment'' line item is treated as a whole and not by a separate project. Funding that is governed
by contract modifications may not be shifted to other functions or line items. 


B. Medicare Contractor Functional Areas 


The Medicare contractor budget consists of functional areas of responsibility that are performed by the fiscal intermediaries
for Part A and the carriers for Part B. The eight functional areas of responsibility for fiscal intermediaries under
Part A are: 
 Bill Payment; 
 Reconsideration and Hearing; 
 Medicare Secondary Payer; 
 Medical Review and Utilization Review; 
 Provider Audit (Desk Review, Field Audit, and Provider Settlement); 
 Provider Reimbursement; 
 Productivity Investments; and 
 Benefits Integrity.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941021-2-00067 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941021-2-00046 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The nine functional areas of responsibility for carriers under Part B are: 


 Claim Payment; 
 Review and Hearing; 
 Beneficiary or Physician Inquiry; 
 Provider (physician/supplier) Education and Training; 
 Medical Review and Utilization Review; 
 Medicare Secondary Payer; 
 Participating Physicians; 
 Productivity Investments; and 
 Benefits Integrity. 
These functions are funded from the Hospital Insurance and Supplementary Medical Insurance trust funds. The data,
standards, and methodology used in these functional areas are discussed in section IV. of this notice. In the following
national budget summary, we have combined the discussion of functional areas that are common to fiscal intermediaries
and carriers. However, data specific to Part A or Part B are provided under each heading. Workload estimates are provided
for all functional areas where the development of the budget is predominantly workload driven. Workload estimates
are not provided for functional areas that are not predominantly workload driven, or for which a workload is uncertain
until final negotiations with the Medicare contractors are complete. 


1. Bill and Claim Payment (Part A and Part B) 


We currently estimate the Part A processed workload to be 129.2 million bills in FY 1995. The Part B processed workload
is currently projected at 655.6 million claims and is based on the current funding available. 


2. Reconsideration (Review Under Part B) and Hearing (Part A and Part B) 


This function includes all activities related to guaranteeing due process of law as a result of contractor action,
for example, disallowances on bills and claims. The estimated workload volume is expected to total approximately
10.9 million for FY 1995. 
In FY 1995, we expect to maintain efficiencies achieved in prior years through the use of shorter decision letters
and the experimental use of the telephone to conduct reviews and reconsiderations. 


3. Medicare Secondary Payer (Part A and Part B) 


The Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) function is the first of four initiatives (Medicare Secondary Payer, Medical
Review and Utilization Review, Benefits Integrity, and Provider Audit) we developed as ``Payment Safeguards''
to safeguard the Medicare program against improper payments. The focus of the MSP initiative is to ensure that the
Medicare program pays for covered care only to the extent required after payment by the primary insurer. 
Medicare contractors are responsible for identifying MSP situations and aggressively pursuing the recovery of
improper payments from the appropriate party. The standard for determining the amount of MSP funding a contractor
will receive in FY 1995 is based on workload volumes, required systems changes, and any special projects that may be
assigned to contractors. 
Based on actuarial analysis, we develop specific savings goals for each contractor. The goals are developed on estimates
of savings to be achieved by contractors for the MSP categories of working aged, disabled, workers' compensation,
end-stage renal disease, and liability or no-fault insurance. After assigning goals to contractors, funds are allocated
based on the various MSP activities a contractor must perform such as processing prepayment claims, postpayment
claims, inquiries, outreach, and hospital reviews. 
In FY 1995, the Initial Enrollment Questionnaire (IEQ) will be operational. The IEQ eliminates the need for first
claim development on approximately 85 percent of the new enrollees. This initiative will improve service to beneficiaries
on a national basis by providing detailed information on the MSP program at the time a beneficiary enrolls in Medicare.

We have also included funding to process the workloads based on the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)/Social Security
Administration (SSA)/HCFA data match project created by section 6202 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of
1989 (OBRA '89), Public Law 101-239. The funds are allocated on the basis of the number of report identification
numbers a contractor will process. 
In addition to the IRS/SSA/HCFA data match, we will continue to pursue other data matches with State Motor Vehicle
Administrations, Workers' Compensation, and Medicaid Agencies, and the Departments of Defense, Labor, and Veterans
Affairs. 


4. Medical Review and Utilization Review (Parts A and B) 


In addition to processing and paying claims from providers of services and Medicare beneficiaries, contractors
perform medical and utilization reviews of claims to determine whether services are covered under the program and
are medically necessary. The distribution of Medicare contractor funding is based on each contractor's proportion
of the workload and individual contractor medical review/utilization review projects.

Fiscal intermediaries are responsible for medical and utilization review of home health agencies, skilled nursing
facilities, outpatient hospital services (excluding surgery), and other outpatient services such as those provided
by rehabilitation facilities, rural health clinics, and similar entities. This review assures that medical care
received is necessary and appropriate, and that quality medical services are delivered to Medicare beneficiaries.

Carriers are responsible for medical and utilization review of Part B providers and suppliers. All carriers will
utilize data analysis capabilities to target on focused medical review in FY 1995. Through focused medical review,
carriers will identify aberrancies from national or local carrier data and further investigate aberrancies to determine
which require appropriate corrective actions to eliminate overutilization. These actions will include provider
education (individual or group), development and revision of local medical review policies or screens, identification/recoupment
of overpayments, and referral of cases to HCFA's Benefit Integrity staff. 
Additionally in FY 1995, HCFA will support the Medical Review activities of the four Durable Medical Equipment Regional
Carriers (Regional Carriers). The Regional Carriers will conduct prepayment and postpayment review of durable
medical equipment, prosthetic, orthotic, and supply claims to identify areas of potential abuse and overutilization
and prevent payment for non-covered items and services. Through focused medical review and analysis of data, the
Regional Carriers will initiate corrective action for the recoupment of overpayments and the targeting of suppliers
with aberrant billing patterns. They will also continue to revise regional medical review policies and screens and
make referrals where appropriate to the HHS Office of Inspector General. 


5. Provider Audit (Part A Only) 


For FY 1995, we have planned a modest increase in the number of onsite reviews/audits for all types of providers to help
in the identification and prevention of improper payments. This increase is made possible by reducing the amount
of resources needed to perform desk reviews, and by applying these resources to onsite reviews, focused reviews,
and field audits. In addition, we will encourage all contractors to retain a knowledgeable audit staff and provide
training in accordance with Government Auditing Standards. All contractors are expected to respond to provider
appeals and file position papers with the Provider Reimbursement Review Board.

<PARENT> FR941021-2-00046 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

A large percentage of the hospitals paid under the Prospective Payment System (PPS) are expected to appeal their capital
cost reimbursement because of adjustments made for the purpose of setting their capital PPS rate. Also, there is an
expected increase in the number of appeals to be filed for payments made for graduate medical education based upon
per-resident amounts. 


6. Provider Payment (Part A Only) 


In FY 1995, Medicare contractors are expected to provide payment services to approximately 34,300 health care providers.
This represents an increase of approximately 7.5 percent over the number of providers requiring payment services
in FY 1994. These payment services include establishing and adjusting interim rates, recouping provider overpayments,
and providing consultative services to providers for maintaining and adjusting their accounting systems to ensure
accurate data for preparing claims and cost reports. 
We will distribute funds in proportion to workload by provider type. 


7. Productivity Investments (Part A and Part B) 


The costs of implementing new initiatives that are designed to improve the effectiveness of Medicare program administration
are referred to as productivity investments (PIs). PIs generally provide start-up funds for new or revised contractor
activities. Once these projects are operational, their funding becomes part of the contractor's ongoing costs.
The criteria for selecting PIs to be implemented are varied. For example, some PIs are required by statute or regulation.
We also fund projects that will improve administrative cost efficiency, such as Contractor Resource Sharing. 
There is no single distribution methodology for the allocation of PI funds. After we determine the national cost of
a PI, funds are distributed among the contractors. These funds are based on the contractors' cost estimates or through
formulas that we derive, which are based on project specifications. Other PI initiatives require equal effort by
all contractors regardless of size and, therefore, funds are distributed equally among contractors. Finally, some
PIs, such as the Common Working File and Contractor Resource Sharing, are given only to contractors that are involved
in the specific projects. 


8. Beneficiary or Physician Inquiry (Part B Only) 


The Medicare contractors are the direct link between beneficiaries, providers, physicians, other suppliers, and
the Medicare program. It is the responsibility of HCFA and the contractors to provide the most effective and efficient
service to beneficiaries, providers, physicians, and other suppliers, and to continue to expand their awareness
and understanding of the Medicare program. Funding will continue to be provided to contractors so they may continue
to provide toll-free telephone lines for beneficiaries and expand the use of Audio Response Units. 
In FY 1995, carriers will receive an estimated 40.4 million inquiries by telephone, in writing, or through direct
contact. This is an increase of 3.2 percent over FY 1994. 


9. Participating Physicians/Suppliers (Part B Only) 


Participating physicians and suppliers are those who agree to accept assignment on all Medicare claims in return
for certain incentives or benefits. All physicians must be given an opportunity to enroll or disenroll in the participation
program annually. 
For FY 1995, the FY 1994 funding was used as the base and was adjusted in proportion to the workload within the limits
of the funding available to HCFA. 


10. Provider (Physician/Supplier) Education and Training (Part B Only) 


The success of the Medicare program depends upon the continuing cooperation of individuals and institutions providing
health care services. The funding provided in FY 1995 will allow carriers to perform the activities outlined in the
BPRs. 


11. Benefit Integrity (Part A and B)

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941021-2-00070 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941021-2-00046 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In FY 1995, HCFA will provide funding to continue its efforts in deterring and detecting emerging Medicare fraud and
abuse. The carriers will improve the quality of referrals to the Office of Inspector General by expanding data analysis
capability. The Medicare fraud focus will include a full range of Medicare fraud detection activities through our
fiscal intermediaries and carriers. The fiscal intermediaries will concentrate on home health agencies and skilled
nursing facilities and Medicare carriers will focus their detection activities on medical laboratory, radiology,
anesthesia, and ambulance claims. Also, in FY 1995, Medicare carriers will standardize the method of how fraud units
treat billing and assignment violations. 


12. Printing Claim Forms (Part A and Part B) 


Although this activity is not among the seven Part A and nine Part B contractor functional areas, it is a part of the national
Medicare contractor budget. In the interest of maintaining standard formats and quality of Medicare entitlement
and report forms, fiscal intermediaries and carriers supply beneficiary enrollment and provider cost reporting
forms. The use of these forms is essential to beneficiary notification, effective and efficient contractor operations,
and other program objectives. 


C. Contractor Unit Cost Calculations 


A key step in the contractor budget process is the development of contractor unit costs for processing Part A bills
and Part B claims. These bottom-line unit costs encompass all of the budget's line items except ``Provider Audit,''
``Productivity Investments,'' ``Other,'' and, in FY 1995, ``Provider Reimbursement.'' 
As first implemented in FY 1992, the complexity index (CI) was designed to improve efficiency and reduce contractor-by-contractor
cost inequities, and was based on the application of the Industrial Engineering (IE) study commissioned by HCFA.
The IE study provided HCFA with an actual weighted unit cost for each claim type; that is, inpatient or outpatient,
and method of submission (electronically submitted or hardcopy) of a bill or a claim. After adjustment for changes
in program emphasis, these unit costs were applied to each contractor's individual workload mix to develop a weighted
unit cost that reflects the complexity of its workload mix. We published an explanation of the CI in our FY 1992 

Federal Register

 notice on January 2, 1992 (57 FR 57). Each contractor had a percentage goal in FY 1992 for increasing the submission
of claims electronically. 
We adjusted the unit costs to reflect achievement of the goals. After adjusting for various savings and increases
associated with initiatives, such as the Unique Physician Identifier Number and sections 6111(b), Clinical Diagnostic
Laboratory Tests (Annual Monitoring and Certification) and 6204, Physician Ownership of, and Referral to, Health
Care Entities (Annual Monitoring Cost) of OBRA '89, we then arrayed the contractors' unit costs and identified the
contractor at the 60th percentile. Each contractor with a unit cost higher than the 60th percentile was held to the
60th percentile unit cost, multiplied by the contractor's CI. Each contractor at or below the 60th percentile retained
its own unit cost, multiplied by its CI. 
We believe that the use of the CI over the last three FYs has enabled us to successfully achieve the goals of improving
efficiency in contractor operations and reducing contractor-by-contractor cost inequities. Since we have achieved
these goals, and believe that costs can be controlled, we will base each contractor's FY 1995 unit cost on the FY 1994
level, adjusted for savings achieved due to increased productivity, Electronic Media Claims, and reduced funding
for incremental workload.

D. Overall Budget Considerations 


It should be noted that limitations on the FY 1995 budget could require across-the-board cost cutting measures. In
that case, each RO will determine the amount of budget reduction for its contractors. 


IV. FY 1995 National Medicare Contractor Budget: Data, Standards, and Methodology 


Since the submission of the President's FY 1995 Medicare contractor budget request to the Congress in February 1994,
we have been developing BPRs to be issued to the contractors. These requirements outline the statement of work and
level of effort that fiscal intermediaries and carriers are expected to perform during the upcoming FY in each of the
functional areas for which they are responsible. 
The draft BPRs were released to the ROs in May, and the final BPRs scheduled for release in June 1994. Each fiscal intermediary
and carrier will have been given its individual requirements to be used in preparing its FY 1995 budget request in June
1994. The ROs will send any additional information that is pertinent to the fiscal intermediaries and carriers within
their region. Fiscal intermediaries and carriers are to submit their budget requests to HCFA no later than 6 weeks
after the issuance of the BPRs. 
After the fiscal intermediaries and carriers review the BPRs, they prepare their budget requests. The central office
and RO staff review the fiscal intermediary and carrier budget requests as they are submitted. The RO staff negotiates
a final and mutually acceptable budget, within the limits of the funding available to HCFA, with each fiscal intermediary
and carrier. The central office prepares a financial operating plan for each RO that provides total regional funding
authority for each functional area. The ROs, in turn, prepare a Notice of Budget Approval (NOBA) for each fiscal intermediary
and carrier that provides a full year budget plan subject to quarterly cash draw limitations. 


A. Standards 


The basic statement of work, along with new and special activities that fiscal intermediaries and carriers are expected
to perform, is described in the BPR package. Fiscal intermediaries and carriers are expected to perform the work as
described in the BPR package and in accordance with the standards included in the Contractor Performance Evaluation
Program (CPEP) for FY 1995. For consideration in developing their initial budget requests, a copy of the draft CPEP
standards will be sent to contractors. Final FY 1995 CPEP standards are published in the 

Federal Register

. 


B. Data 


The following sources of data that contain various workload volumes, functional costs, and manpower information
are used in developing the individual fiscal intermediary and carrier budgets for FY 1995:

C. Methodology 


The Medicare contractor budget is organized around the previously listed functional areas that are performed by
the fiscal intermediaries for Part A and the carriers for Part B. FY 1992 was the first year in which we developed a bottom-line
unit cost for each individual contractor. The following narrative describes the methodology used to calculate individual
line-item costs. This methodology will be considered as general reference for contractors as they develop their
FY 1995 budgets, and also to provide additional explanation in determining how certain costs and savings were determined.



1. Bill and Claim Payment 


The individual fiscal intermediary and carrier workload levels for FY 1995 are determined by using a statistical
forecasting model. Using the same data, we are also projecting the number of bills or claims a fiscal intermediary
and carrier may expect to have pending at the end of the FY 1994. We then combine the FY 1995 receipt estimate with the
anticipated end of FY 1994 pending level, and subtract the estimated FY 1995 pending for each fiscal intermediary
and carrier to establish a processed workload; that is, Estimated FY 1995 receipts + Estimated end of FY 1994 pending
^ Estimated end of FY 1995 pending = Estimated FY 1995 Processed Workload. 
In order to price individual contractor bill and claim workload, we develop a unit cost that is the cost of processing
a single bill or claim. The individual fiscal intermediary and carrier unit costs for FY 1995 are calculated from the
unit costs in the FY 1994 Notices of Budget Approval. The calculations include increases to recognize the cost of new
legislation. Savings achieved from operating efficiencies also are part of the formula employed in computing FY
1995 target unit costs. The ROs will negotiate with the fiscal intermediaries and carriers to resolve any differences
within the limits of the funding available to HCFA.

2. Reconsideration (Reviews Under Part B) and Hearing 


We will allocate funding based on the amount of dollars spent (line 2 of Forms HCFA-1523/1524) in the prior years,
adjusted for inflation and changes in volume. Specifically, we will adjust the previous year's costs for reconsiderations
and hearings by the estimated percentage change in workload.
The individual fiscal intermediary and carrier budget allocations for reconsiderations, reviews, and hearings
are estimated by multiplying forecast workloads by the adjusted unit costs. 
The ROs will negotiate with the fiscal intermediaries and carriers to resolve any differences between HCFA's allocations
and the contractors' requests within the limits of the funding available to HCFA. 


3. Beneficiary and Provider Inquiries (Part B Only) 


To establish a budgeted amount for beneficiary and provider inquiries, the prior year's cost is increased by the projected
workload change. We also consider special conditions unique to specific carriers in negotiating the budget. We will
use the data to develop a budgeted cost for beneficiary and provider inquiries by multiplying forecasted processed
volume times unit cost. The ROs will negotiate with the carriers to resolve any differences between HCFA's allocations
and the carriers' requests within the limits of the funding available to HCFA. 


4. Provider Reimbursement (Part A Only) 


In determining individual fiscal intermediary budgets for reimbursement activities, we first calculated a FY 1993
unit cost by using the funding included on the latest FY 1993 NOBA (Form HCFA 1523) and dividing that amount by the workload
reported on the Schedule of Providers Serviced (SPS) for the same period. The SPS is a listing of all the facilities
serviced by the fiscal intermediary. The SPS is submitted with each initial budget request so that a part of the analysis
is the comparison of the composition of the provider community serviced by the fiscal intermediary and any change
reported between fiscal years. 
The ROs will negotiate with the fiscal intermediaries to resolve any differences between HCFA's allocations and
the fiscal intermediaries' requests within the limits of the funding available to HCFA. 


5. Provider Audit (Part A Only)


For FY 1995, the provider audit function is divided into three major activities: field audits, desk reviews, and settlements.
The Contractor Auditing and Settlement Report (CASR) (Form HCFA-1525A) provides a breakout of audit activities
and costs by type of provider, and documents the savings incurred as a result of audit activity. Using this as a base,
the desk review costs are developed by projecting the number of providers serviced by the unit cost per desk review
(developed for the latest CASR for FY 1993) to determine the cost of handling the FY 1995 workload at the FY 1993 unit
cost. 
Settlement costs are based on the workload projected in the fiscal intermediary's budget request, multiplied by
the unit cost for settlements found in the most recent CASR for FY 1993. 
The first priority of all audit efforts is the completion of any special activities required by legislation. The second
priority is that all cost reports be reviewed and, to the extent possible, settled. 
The ROs will negotiate with the fiscal intermediaries to resolve any differences between HCFA's allocations and
the fiscal intermediaries' requests within the limits of the funding available to HCFA. 


6. Medicare Secondary Payer 


We will review the estimated workload data, reported backlog data, and any other items, for example, proposed MSP
systems enhancements, to determine MSP funding allocations. Each contractor's case mix is analyzed to adjust for
specialized workloads such as home health claims or durable medical equipment (DME). 
In FY 1995, the budget will be allocated based on the above considerations, adjustments created by shifts in the DME
workload from all carriers to the four specialty carriers, and other shifts in workload that may require adjustments.

The ROs will negotiate with the fiscal intermediaries and carriers to resolve any differences between HCFA's allocations
and their requests within the limits of the funding available to HCFA. 


7. Medical Review/Utilization Review (MR/UR) 


The individual fiscal intermediary and carrier MR/UR budgets for FY 1995 will be calculated in three segments: (1)
Prepayment medical review, (2) postpayment medical review activities, and (3) data analysis and screen development.
The BPR describes the activities and workload requirements that the fiscal intermediaries and carriers are expected
to meet. As part of the BPRs, we will ask the fiscal intermediaries and carriers to estimate the required funding to
meet their requirements. We will allocate prepayment and postpayment medical review funding to contractors based
upon the workload that a fiscal intermediary or carrier projects for FY 1995.

<TEXT>
 

The ROs will negotiate with the fiscal intermediaries and carriers to resolve any differences between HCFA's allocations
and the contractors' requests within the limits of the funding available to HCFA. 


8. Participating Physicians/Suppliers (Part B Only) 


In determining the individual carrier funding levels for the participating physician/supplier program for FY 1995,
we considered the following factors: 
 The number of physicians/suppliers in the carrier's service area; 
 The carrier's current participation rate; 
 The carrier's recent performance in increasing its participation rate; 
 The statement of work to be performed as outlined in the BPRs; and 
 Last year's cost experience. 
Since participating physicians/suppliers are eligible for toll-free telephone lines for electronic billing,
allowance has been made for these expenses. Carriers with lower participation rates will receive greater funding
for the limiting charge violation monitoring. We have discontinued carrier monitoring of the elective surgery disclosure
requirement. We now require carriers to investigate beneficiary complaints on a case-by-case basis. 
Carrier monitoring funds are allocated based on the national percentage of nonparticipating physicians/suppliers.
All carriers will receive the same funding amount for reporting participation statistics. 
In FY 1995 the participating physician incentive payment will be discontinued due to the implementation of the Resource-Based
Relative Value Scale fee schedules that have contributed largely to the increase in the number of physicians participating
in the Medicare program. Non- participation is discouraged by the ``limiting charges'' imposed under Physician
Payment Reform. 
The ROs will negotiate with the carriers to resolve any differences between HCFA's allocations and the carriers'
requests within the limits of the funding available to HCFA. 


9. Productivity Investments (PIs) 


The costs of implementing legislation and new initiatives that are designed to improve the effectiveness and efficiency
of Medicare program administration are referred to as PIs. Several allocation methodologies will be employed in
calculating the PI budgets for individual fiscal intermediaries and carriers. For those projects involving only
single contractors or small groups of contractors, we will allocate funds based upon the specifications of the particular
project. For those projects involving all fiscal intermediaries or carriers, where the costs are driven by bill or
claim volume, we will distribute the funding based upon our workload projections for each contractor. Finally, for
those projects involving all fiscal intermediaries or carriers that require equal effort, regardless of the contractor's
size, we derived a standard allocation to be given to all contractors. 
The ROs will negotiate with the fiscal intermediaries and carriers to resolve any differences between HCFA's allocations
and the contractors' requests within the limits of the funding available to HCFA. 


10. Provider (Physician/Supplier) Education and Training (Part B Only) 


Distribution of funds made available to HCFA for provider (physician/supplier) education and training is based
upon the ratio of physicians and suppliers in each carrier's service area to the national total of physicians and suppliers.



11. Benefit Integrity (BI) 


In allocating the FY 1995 BI budget to individual fiscal intermediaries and carriers, HCFA will consider: 
 The prior year's effectiveness in initiating fraud referrals to the Office of Inspector General; 

</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941021-2-00075 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941021-2-00046 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 Initiating overpayment recoveries when appropriate;  Prioritizing workload to concentrate on high
dollar and multi-state fraud; 
 The extracted workload and cost data from the Schedule of Fraud and Abuse (forms HCFA 1523G/1524G); 
 The Medicare Fraud Unit Workload Report; 
 The fraud unit's level of sophistication to determine BI funding allocations; 
 The completion of any special activity required by legislation will be an overriding priority; and 
 The networking costs, which will be determined by the personnel cost to support the Medicare Fraud and Abuse
Information Coordinator, travel costs, and the other expenses needed to conduct networking for the area assigned.

 

The ROs will negotiate with the contractors to resolve any differences between HCFA's allocation and the contractors'
requests within the limits of the funding available to HCFA.

Federal Property Suitable as Facilities To Assist the Homeless



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of the Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development, HUD.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This Notice identifies unutilized, underutilized, excess, and surplus Federal property reviewed by HUD for suitability
for possible use to assist the homeless.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In accordance with 56 FR 23789 (May 24, 1991) and section 501 of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act (42
U.S.C. 11411), as amended, HUD is publishing this Notice to identify Federal buildings and other real property that
HUD has reviewed for suitability for use to assist the homeless. The properties were reviewed using information provided
to HUD by Federal landholding agencies regarding unutilized and underutilized buildings and real property controlled
by such agencies or by GSA regarding its inventory of excess or surplus Federal property. This Notice is also published
in order to comply with the December 12, 1988 Court Order in 

National Coalition for the Homeless v. Veterans Administration

, No. 88-2503-OG (D.D.C.).




Properties reviewed are listed in this Notice according to the following categories: Suitable/available, suitable/unavailable,
suitable/to be excess, and unsuitable. The properties listed in the three suitable categories have been reviewed
by the landholding agencies, and each agency has transmitted to HUD: (1) Its intention to make the property available
for use to assist the homeless, (2) its intention to declare the property excess to the agency's needs, or (3) a statement
of the reasons that the property cannot be declared excess or made available for use as facilities to assist the homeless.

Properties listed as suitable/available will be available exclusively for homeless use for a period of 60 days from
the date of this Notice. Homeless assistance providers interested in any such property should send a written expression
of interest to HHS, addressed to Judy Breitman, Division of Health Facilities Planning, U.S. Public Health Service,
HHS, room 17A-10, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857; (301) 443-2265. (This is not a toll-free number.)
HHS will mail to the interested provider an application packet, which will include instructions for completing the
application. In order to maximize the opportunity to utilize a suitable property, providers should submit their
written expressions of interest as soon as possible. For complete details concerning the processing of applications,
the reader is encouraged to refer to the interim rule governing this program, 56 FR 23789 (May 24, 1991).

For properties listed as suitable/to be excess, that property may, if subsequently accepted as excess by GSA, be made
available for use by the homeless in accordance with applicable law, subject to screening for other Federal use. At
the appropriate time, HUD will publish the property in a Notice showing it as either suitable/available or suitable/unavailable.

For properties listed as suitable/unavailable, the landholding agency has decided that the property cannot be declared
excess or made available for use to assist the homeless, and the property will not be available.

Properties listed as unsuitable will not be made available for any other purpose for 20 days from the date of this Notice.
Homeless assistance providers interested in a review by HUD of the determination of unsuitability should call the
toll free information line at 1-800-927-7588 for detailed instructions or write a letter to William
Molster at the address listed at the beginning of this Notice. Included in the request for review should be the property
address (including zip code), the date of publication in the 

Federal Register

, the landholding agency, and the property number.

For more information regarding particular properties identified in this Notice (

i.e.

, acreage, floor plan, existing sanitary facilities, exact street address), providers should contact the appropriate
landholding agencies at the following addresses: U.S. Navy: John J. Kane, Deputy Division Director, Dept. of Navy,

Notice of Emergency Closure

AGENCY: 

Bureau of Land Management, Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of emergency closure of Bronson Peak area in Rio Grande County, Colorado to off-road vehicle use from October
15, 1994 and shall remain in effect unless revised, revoked or amended.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Notice is hereby given that effective October 15, 1994, public lands described below are closed to all Off-Road Vehicle
use. Under the authority and requirement of 43 CFR 8364.1 and 43 CFR 8341.1 and the Federal Land Policy and Management
Act of 1976. This closure affects 3760 acres of public lands in Rio Grande County located in the area south of Monte Vista,
Colorado and west of the Monte Vista National Wildlife Refuge and east of BLM Road 5100 in T.38N., R.7E., Sections 34
& 35 and T.37N., R7E., Sections 2, 3, 10, 11, 14 and 15. This area closure will eliminate an extremely dangerous
situation where a considerable number of hunters shoot elk as they leave the Wildlife Refuge in the early morning.
The closure will also protect the fragile vegetation and highly erodible soils from the adverse effects of vehicle
travel during the wet months of the year. This action does not effect hunting use in the area, but is intended to make
the area safer for hunters and the general public, and protect the natural resource from damage especially during
the fall/winter months when soils are often wet. These restrictions do not apply to emergency, law enforcement and
Federal, State or other government personnel who are in the area for official or emergency purposes and who are expressly
authorized or otherwise officially approved by BLM. Any person who fails to comply with this closure order may be subject
to the penalties provided by 43 CFR 8340.0-7 and/or 43 CFR 
8360.0-7 which includes fines not to exceed $1000 and/or imprisonment not to exceed 12 months. Notice of this
closure will be posted near or within the area, San Luis Resource Area Office and at the Canon City District Office.

 </AGENCY>
<ACTION>
action:

 Notice of competitive coal lease sale by sealed bid.

 



 
</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary:

 Notice is hereby given that certain coal resources in the tracts described below in LeFlore and Latimer Counties,
Oklahoma, will be offered for competitive lease by sealed bid in accordance with the provisions of the Mineral Leasing
Act of 1920, as amended (30 U.S.C. 181 

et seq.

), and the Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1977.



 </SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information:

 The tracts will be leased to the qualified bidder(s) submitting the highest cash offer provided that the high bid meets
the fair market value determination of the coal resource. The minimum bid for these tracts is $100.00 per acre, or fraction
thereof. No bid that is less than $100.00 per acre, or fraction thereof, will be considered. This $100.00 per acre is
a regulatory minimum, and is not intended to reflect fair market value for the tracts. Bids should be sent by certified
mail, return receipt, or be hand-delivered. The cashier will issue a receipt for each hand-delivered bid. Bids received
after the time specified above will not be considered. The fair market value of each tract will be determined by the
authorized officer after the sale. 

 

If identical high sealed bids are received, the tying high bidders will be requested to submit follow-up sealed bids
until a high bid is received. All tie-breaking sealed bids must be submitted within 15 minutes following the Sale Official's
announcement at the sale that identical high bids have been received. 

 All the tracts in this lease offering contain split estate lands. Except where specified, the proposed mining method
is surface mining techniques. The regulations in 43 CFR part 3427 set out the protection that shall be afforded qualified
surface owners of split estate lands (as defined in 43 CFR 3400.0-5(gg)).

Sec. 32, N1/2S1/2 and N1/2S1/2S1/2; 

Sec. 33, N1/2SW1/4 and N1/2S1/2SW1/4. 




Total recoverable reserves are estimated to be 11,136,600 tons. 

 


The coal beds present in this revised application area are the Upper and Lower McAlester Coals of Pennsylvanian Age.
About 7.5 miles of cropline are present in this area, which now contains 1,933.46 acres. The Upper McAlester Coal averages
2.1 feet thick, and the Lower McAlester Coal averages 2.0 feet thick. In general, the Upper McAlester is more consistent
in thickness than the Lower McAlester which has a tendency, in places, to change to a boney coal and develop shale splits
in the lower part of this bed. 

These two coals are separated by about 61 to 57 feet of gray shale in the Western two-thirds of this application, and
about 51 feet of gray shale in the Eastern third of this application. The Upper McAlester Coal overburden was described
consistently on the drill hole logs as gray shale. The drill hole information indicates that these two beds have an
average dip to the North of 6.9 degrees along the Western 3.5 miles (just west of the town of Red Oak), and an average dip
of 13 degrees (just East of the Town of Red Oak), on to the Eastern edge of the application area where the dip increases
to a little more than 17 degrees. 

The In-Place coal present in this area was calculated to be 5.1 million tons for the Upper McAlester Coal, and 6.0 million
tons for the Lower McAlester Coal. This is based on 1,800 tons per acre-foot using the above stated average thickness.


Minable reserve base and recoverable coal reserves for the area were based on (1) geology and coal quality data; (2)
assumptions used in determining maximum economic recovery for the original lease application report; and (3) data
adequacy standards for Federal coal leasing in Southeastern Oklahoma. 

There are no quality analysis in the CRO-CDP maps which can be specifically identified with this tract. However, from
Trumball, et al., 1957, we have the following quality data for the McAlester Coal in this part of Oklahoma: Moisture_2.5
percent; Volatile Matter_31.6 percent; Fixed Carbon_66.3 percent; Ash_11.7 percent; Sulfur_3.2 percent; and
BTU/lb-unknown. 



Surface Owner Consent Information 



It has been determined that this tract has six qualified surface owners. Copies of consents granted by the qualified
surface owners are attached to the detailed statement of sale. The lands and the purchase price of these consents are

The coal seams present in the application area are the Lower Hartshorne Coal (in places, the Upper Hartshorne Coal
may be recoverable). The application area contains about 9 miles of cropline. USGS CRO-CDP reports cover the
Western 5.5 miles of the application area. These reports show that there are four slope mines along the Lower Hartshorne
cropline. No information on coal quantity and quality, or the areal extent of mining is available. 
The Eastern seven miles of the application area has been strip mined. Thirty two drill holes have been identified in
or near the application area. These holes provide adequate coal quantity data for about one-third of the application
area. Coal thickness of the Lower Hartshorne is 5.6 feet. Total disturbance would be about 1,910.00 acres. 
Total recoverable coal reserves are estimated to be 18,290,200 tons.
There are 16 quality analysis points in or near the application area. The following analysis for the Lower Hartshorne
Coal provide adequate coal quality data for about one-third of the application area: Moisture_unknown; Volatile
Matter_20.4 percent; Fixed Carbon_68.3 percent; Ash_10.5 percent; Sulfur_1.2 percent; and BTU/lb_13,850.

will be required to submit a nonrefundable application fee of $50 in accordance with 43 CFR subpart 2720, for conveyance
of part of the unreserved mineral interests in the land. 

The proposed sale is consistent with the Grass Creek Management Framework Plan and will serve an important public

arise out of any violation of Federal or State law in connection with use of these lands. 

5. The purchaser shall comply with all Federal and State laws applicable to the disposal, placement, or release of
hazardous substances. 

The public land described above shall be segregated from all forms of appropriation under the public land laws, including
the mining laws, upon publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

. The segregative effect will end upon issuance of the patent or 270 days from the date of the publication, whichever
comes first. 

For a period of forty-five (45) days from the date of issuance of this notice, interested parties may submit comments
to the Bureau of Land Management, Darrell Barnes, Worland District Manager, P.O. Box 119, Worland, Wyoming 82401-0119.

<USBUREAU>Drug Enforcement Administration</USBUREAU>


<DOCTITLE>Alvin A. Chester, M.D.; Revocation of Registration</DOCTITLE>




On March 11, 1994, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to Alvin A. Chester, M.D., of Albuquerque, New Mexico, proposing to revoke his
DEA Certificate of Registration, AC3247738, and to deny any pending applications for registration as a practitioner.
21 U.S.C. 823(f) (1992). The basis for the Order to Show Cause was that Dr. Chester lacked authority to handle controlled
substances in the State of New Mexico, 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(3), and that his continued registration would be inconsistent
with the public interest, as the term is used in 21 U.S.C. 823(f) and 824(a)(4).

The Order to Show Cause was sent to Dr. Chester's registered location in Albuquerque, New Mexico by registered mail
on March 11, 1994, and a signed receipt was returned to DEA indicating a delivery date of March 19, 1994. More than thirty
days have passed since the Order to Show Cause was delivered to Dr. Chester's registered address. The DEA has received
no response from Dr. Chester or anyone purporting to represent him. Therefore, pursuant to 21 CFR 1301.54(d), the
Deputy Administrator finds that Dr. Chester has waived his opportunity for a hearing on the issues raised by the Order
to Show Cause. The Deputy Administrator has carefully considered the investigative file in this matter and enters
his final order based on the provisions of 21 CFR 1301.54(e) and 1301.57.


The Deputy Administrator finds that on December 2, 1992, the New Mexico Board of Medical Examiners (Medical Board)
revoked Dr. Chester's medical license. The Medical Board found that Dr. Chester had committed fraud or misrepresentation
in applying for and procuring a license to practice medicine in the State of New Mexico in that he failed to disclose
a prior conviction by military court-martial. The Medical Board also found that he had engaged in grossly negligent
practice of medicine and unwise and injudicious prescribing practices, both of which included inappropriate use
of Schedule II and IV controlled substances. The Medical Board concluded that the cumulative pattern of Dr. Chester's
medical practice demonstrated his incapacity or incompetence to practice medicine. On June 8, 1993, the New Mexico
Board of Pharmacy (Pharmacy Board) revoked Dr. Chester's controlled substance registration because the Medical
Board had revoked his practitioner's license and because he had failed to notify the Pharmacy Board of that action.

The Deputy Administrator has consistently held that DEA cannot maintain the registration of a practitioner who is
without State authority to handle controlled substances. Nathaniel S. Lehrman, M.D.,

 59 FR 44780 (1994) and 

Franz A. Arakaky, M.D., 

59 FR 42074 (1994); 

see also Elliot Monroe, M.D.,

 57 FR 23246 (1992) and 

Bobby Watts, M.D.,

 53 FR 11920 (1987). Dr. Chester is not authorized to administer, dispense, prescribe, or otherwise handle controlled
substances in the State of New Mexico wherein he is registered with the DEA. In light of this, the Deputy Administrator
concludes that it is not necessary to address whether Dr. Chester's continued registration is otherwise consistent
with the public interest.


Based on the foregoing, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration concludes that Dr. Chester's
DEA registration must be revoked. 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(3). Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement
Administration, pursuant to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104 (59 FR
23637), hereby orders that DEA Certificate of Registration AC3247738, previously issued to Alvin A. Chester, M.D.,
be, and it hereby is, revoked, and that any pending applications for the renewal of such registration, be, and they
hereby are, denied. This order is effective on October 21, 1994.

Investigations Regarding Certifications of Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance


Petitions have been filed with the Secretary of Labor under Section 221(a) of the Trade Act of 1974 (``the Act'') and
are identified in the Appendix to this notice. Upon receipt of these petitions, the Director of the Office of Trade
Adjustment Assistance, Employment and Training Administration, has instituted investigations pursuant to Section
221(a) of the Act.
The purpose of each of the investigations is to determine whether the workers are eligible to apply for adjustment
assistance under Title II, Chapter 2, of the Act. The investigations will further relate, as appropriate, to the determination
of the date on which total or partial separations began or threatened to begin and the subdivision of the firm involved.
The petitioners or any other persons showing a substantial interest in the subject matter of the investigations may
request a public hearing, provided such request is filed in writing with the Director, Office of Trade Adjustment
Assistance, at the address show below, not later than October 31, 1994.
Interested persons are invited to submit written comments regarding the subject matter of the investigations to
the Director, Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance, at the address shown below, not later than October 31, 1994.
The petitions filed in this case are available for inspection at the Office of the Director, Office of Trade Adjustment
Assistance, Employment and Training Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington,
D.C. 20210.

<DOCTITLE>Benicia Industries, Inc., Benicia, CA; Notice of Negative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration</DOCTITLE>



By an application dated August 23, 1994, Lodge 

#

1173 of the Automotive Machinists Union (IAM) requested administrative reconsideration of the subject petition
for trade adjustment assistance. The denial notice was signed on July 28, 1994 and published in the 

Federal Register

 on August 15, 1994 (59 FR 41792).

Pursuant to 29 CFR 90.18(c) reconsideration may be granted under the following circumstances:

(1) If it appears on the basis of facts not previously considered that the determination complained of was erroneous;

(2) If it appears that the determination complained of was based on a mistake in the determination of facts not previously
considered; or

(3) If in the opinion of the Certifying Officer, a misinterpretation of facts or of the law justified reconsideration
of the decision. 

The findings show that the workers are engaged in predelivery services for imported Mazda automobiles prior to transfering
these vehicles to automotive dealershps. Installing components_radios, bumpers, emblems and performing repairs
on imported automobiles would not provide a basis for a worker group certification.

The dominant cause for the layoffs at Benicia was a corporate decision to eliminate the Benicia facility and perform
the predelivery services at two other west coast ports. Worker separations resulting from a domestic transfer of
activity would not provide a basis for a worker group certification.



Conclusion



After review of the application and investigative findings, I conclude that there has been no error or misinterpretation
of the law or of the facts which would justify reconsideration of the Department of Labor's prior decision. Accordingly,
the application is denied.




Signed at Washington, D.C., this 11th day of October 1994.

<DOCTITLE>General Electric Company Aircraft Engine Division, Lynn, MA; Notice of Negative Determination Regarding Application
for Reconsideration</DOCTITLE>


By an application dated August 30, 1994, Local 

#

201 of the International Union of Electrical Workers (IUE) requested administrative reconsideration of the subject
petition for trade adjustment assistance, TAA. The denial notice was published in the 

Federal Register

 on August 15, 1994 (59 FR 41792).
Pursuant to 29 CFR 90.18(c) reconsideration may be granted under the following circumstances:
(1) If it appears on the basis of facts not previously considered that the determination complained of was erroneous;
(2) If it appears that the determination complained of was based on a mistake in the determination of facts not previously
considered; or
(3) If in the opinion of the Certifying Officer, a misinterpretation of facts or of the law justified reconsideration
of the decision.
Investigation findings show that the workers produced jet aircraft engines.
The union states that although imports of jet engines did not decrease absolutely they did increase relative to domestic
shipments of jet engines. The union also stated that the production of parts for its jet engines are being manufactured
offshore resulting in fewer jobs at Lynn's General Electric plant.
The dominant cause for the downsizing at Lynn was the decrease in the Federal Government's defense budget for jet engines
and fewer opportunities to break into the commercial airline business. Lynn's jet engine production was 90 percent
military, 10 percent commercial.
Further, less than 5 percent of the jet engine parts are outsourced overseas and this is a growing phenomenon with new
orders for customers in other counties in order to sell them jet engines. The Lynn workers never produced the component
parts for these new orders. Most of the outsourced component parts are not imported to the U.S.
With respect to the Department's certifications for Babco Textron (TA-W-28,716) and Walbar (TA-W-28,633)
both worker groups met all the statutory criteria for a worker group certification. Both worker groups produce component
parts for Lynn's GE engines. A substantial portion of their component work which was produced domestically was outsourced
to firms in other countries.


Conclusion


After review of the application and investigative findings, I conclude that there has been no error or misinterpretation
of the law or of the facts which would justify reconsideration of the Department of Labor's prior decision. Accordingly,
the application is denied.

have become totally or partially separated,

(2) That sales or production, or both, of the firm or subdivision have decreased absolutely, and

<DOCTITLE>Walker Manufacturing Company Hebron, OH; Notice of Negative Determination on Reconsideration</DOCTITLE>




On August 12, 1994, the Department issued an Affirmative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration
for workers and former workers of the subject firm. This notice was published in the Federal Register

 on August 23, 1994 (59 FR 43362).

In the United Auto Workers' application for reconsideration they submitted a list of assets from the Hebron plant
that have been shipped to Mexico.

The findings show that the Hebron facility will be closed by the end of 1994 and its business distributed to other corporate
domestic plants. Only the production of resonator bodies was transferred to Canada; however, this accounted for
only a very small portion of Hebron's total production and the workers were not separately identifiable by product.

New findings on reconsideration show that there is no production being transferred to Mexico as a result of the closure
of the Hebron plant. The closing is the result of capacity issues within Walker Manufacturing in North America.

Other findings on reconsideration show that Hebron is making its machinery available to other corporate North American
plants, including the one in Mexico.

Additional findings on reconsideration show that the Mexican plant produces exhaust systems only for the Mexican
market. The Hebron plant produces exhaust systems only for a major original equipment manufacturer (OEM) in the United
States.

The Department's survey of Hebron's customers shows that they did not decrease their purchases from Hebron and increase
their imports in the relevant period.



Conclusion



After reconsideration, I affirm the original notice of negative determination of eligibility to apply for transitional
adjustment assistance to workers and former workers of the Walker Manufacturing Company in Hebron, Ohio.

<DOCTITLE>Minimum Wages for Federal and Federally Assisted Construction; General Wage Determination Decisions</DOCTITLE>



General wage determination decisions of the Secretary of Labor are issued in accordance with applicable law and are
based on the information obtained by the Department of Labor from its study of local wage conditions and data made available
from other sources. They specify the basic hourly wage rates and fringe benefits which are determined to be prevailing
for the described classes of laborers and mechanics employed on construction projects of a similar character and
in the localities specified therein.

The determinations in these decisions of prevailing rates and fringe benefits have been made in accordance with 29
CFR Part 1, by authority of the Secretary of Labor pursuant to the provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act of March 3, 1931,
as amended (46 Stat. 1494, as amended, 40 U.S.C. 276a) and of other Federal statutes referred to in 29 CFR Part 1, Appendix,
as well as such additional statutes as may from time to time be enacted containing provisions for the payment of wages
determined to be prevailing by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with the Davis-Bacon Act. The prevailing rates
and fringe benefits determined in these decisions shall, in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing statutes,
constitute the minimum wages payable on Federal and federally assisted construction projects to laborers and mechanics
of the specified classes engaged on contract work of the character and in the localities described therein.

Good cause is hereby found for not utilizing notice and public comment procedure thereon prior to the issuance of these
determinations as prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 553 and not providing for delay in the effective date as prescribed in that
section, because the necessity to issue current construction industry wage determinations frequently and in large
volume causes procedures to be impractical and contrary to the public interest.

General wage determination decisions, and modifications and supersedeas decisions thereto, contain no expiration
dates and are effective from their date of notice in the 

Federal Register

, or on the date written notice is received by the agency, whichever is earlier. These decisions are to be used in accordance
with the provisions of 29 CFR Parts 1 and 5. Accordingly, the applicable decision, together with any modifications
issued, must be made a part of every contract for performance of the described work within the geographic area indicated
as required by an applicable Federal prevailing wage law and 29 CFR Part 5. The wage rates and fringe benefits, notice
of which is published herein, and which are contained in the Government Printing Office (GPO) document entitled ``General
Wage Determinations Issued Under The Davis-Bacon And Related Acts,'' shall be the minimum paid by contractors and
subcontractors to laborers and mechanics.

Any person, organization, or governmental agency having an interest in the rates determined as prevailing is encouraged
to submit wage rate and fringe benefit information for consideration by the Department. Further information and
self-explanatory forms for the purpose of submitting this data may be obtained by writing to the U.S. Department of
Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Wage and Hour Division, Division of Wage Determinations, 200 Constitution
Avenue NW., room S-3014, Washington, DC 20210.

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>






Northeast Nuclear Energy Company (Millstone Nuclear Power Station, Unit No. 2); Exemption



I



The Northeast Nuclear Energy Company (NNECO, the licensee) is the holder of Facility Operating License No. DPR-65
which authorizes operation of Millstone Nuclear Power Station, Unit No. 2. The license provides, among other things,
that Millstone Unit 2 is subject to all rules, regulations, and Orders of the Commission now or hereafter in effect.

The plant is a pressurized water reactor located at the licensee's site in New London County, Connecticut.



II



One of the conditions of all operating licenses for water-cooled power reactors, as specified in 10 CFR 50.54(o),
is that primary reactor containments shall meet the containment leakage test requirements set forth in 10 CFR part
50, appendix J. More specifically the following sections require that:



10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J. Section III.D.2(a)



Type B tests, except tests for air locks, shall be performed during reactor shutdown for refueling, or other convenient
intervals, but in no case at intervals greater than 2 years.



10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J. Section III.D.3



Type C tests shall be performed during each reactor shutdown for refueling but in no case at intervals greater than
2 years.




By letter dated September 26, 1994, NNECO requested schedular exemptions from the above requirements. NNECO recently
conducted a review of the Type B and Type C test data and on September 23, 1994, determined that a number of components,
for which Type B and Type C testing is required, have exceeded their respective 24-month interval by up to approximately
four months. Previously, Millstone Unit 2 considered the Type B and Type C tests to constitute one group such that the
2-year surveillance window began after the last component test was completed during the refueling outage. A review
of this rationale and discussions with industry counterparts and the NRC staff determined that this was not the appropriate
interpretation. Rather, each Type B or C test of a penetration or valve should be considered unique, each with its own
2-year surveillance window. Using the appropriate interpretation, NNECO determined on September 23, 1994, that
a number of Type B and Type C tests have exceeded their required 24-month test interval by up to approximately 4 months.
The requirement to perform Type B and Type C local leak rate tests (LLRTs) on September 23, 1994, when NNECO discovered
the misinterpretation of the requirement, would require an unscheduled plant shut down, given the current Millstone
Unit 2 refueling outage schedule. The total schedular delay in testing components will accumulate to be as much as
4 months before the plant is shutdown for refueling.



III



By letter dated September 26, 1994, NNECO requested an exemption to the requirements of Section III.D.2(a) and III.D.3
which require that Type B and C testing be performed during each reactor shutdown for refueling but in no case at intervals
greater than 2 years. In their submittal and in a phone conference between the staff and NNECO on September 24, 1994,
NNECO stated that they recently conducted a review of the Type B and Type C test data and on September 23, 1994, determined
that a number of components, for which Type B and Type C testing is required, have exceeded their respective 24-month
interval by up to approximately 4 months. The previously refueling was lengthy (approximately 7 months) due to the
replacement of both steam generators. The LLRTs during the outage, were conducted from June 1992 through December
1992. Previously, NNECO considered the Type B and Type C tests to constitute one group such that the 2-year surveillance
window began after the last component test was completed during the refueling outage. A review of this rationale and
discussions with industry counterparts and the NRC staff determined that this was not the appropriate interpretation.
Rather, each Type B or C test of a penetration or valve should be considered unique, each with its own 2-year surveillance
window. Using the appropriate interpretation, NNECO determined on September 23, 1994, that a number of Type B and
Type C tests have exceeded their required 24-month test interval by up to approximately 4 months. The requirement
to perform Type B and Type C LLRTs on September 23, 1994, when NNECO discovered the misinterpretation of the requirement,
would require an unscheduled plant shutdown, given the current Millstone Unit 2 refueling outage schedule. The total
schedular delay in testing components will accumulate to be as much as 4 months before the plant is shutdown for refueling.

NNECO stated in their submittal that they had completed the second Type A test for the present 10-year service period
successfully on December 24, 1992. The ``As-Found'' and ``As-Left'' integrated leakage rate test ILRT results were
0.2809 weight percent per day and 0.2577 weight percent per day respectively. Each ILRT result was below the Technical
Specifications limit which demonstrates the overall leak-tightness of the containment. In addition, as of December
1992, the total Type B and C ``As-Found'' and ``As-Left'' leakage results were 0.049 weight percent per day and 0.008
weight percent per day. These values represent approximately 16.3% and 2.7% of the Technical Specification limit
respectively. The results of these tests demonstrate that Millstone Unit 2 has maintained control of containment
integrity by maintaining a conservative margin between the acceptance criterion and the ``As-Found'' and ``As-Left''
leakage rates. Subsequent to this ILRT, during Cycle 12, maintenance on several containment isolation valves was
performed. The post-maintenance retest requirements were accomplished by successful performance of Type C test.
Thus, the previously Type A, B and C tests and prior post-maintenance retests of selected valves have demonstrated
the leak-tightness of the containment and the reliability of the penetrations/valves.

Based on the above evaluation, the staff finds there is reasonable assurance that the containment leakage-limiting
function will be maintained and that a forced outage to perform Type B and C tests is not necessary. Therefore, the staff
finds the requested temporary exemption, to allow the 
Type B and C test intervals to be extended to the end of the 12th refueling outage which began on October 1, 1994, to be
acceptable.






IV




Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12(a), the requested exemption is authorized
by law, will not present an undue risk to the public health and safety, and is consistent with the common defense and
security. Further, the Commission finds that the special circumstances required by 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii) are present.
Application of the regulation in these particular circumstances is not necessary to achieve the underlying purpose
of the rule in that, as discussed in Section III, the containment leakage-limiting function will be maintained.




An exemption is hereby granted from the requirements of Sections III.D.2(a) and III.D.3 of appendix J to 10 CFR part
50, which require that Type B and C tests be performed during each reactor shutdown for refueling but in no case at intervals
greater than 2 years until end of the current refueling outage.


Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that the granting of this Exemption will have no significant
impact on the quality of the human environment (59 FR 50928).




This Exemption is effective upon issuance.





Dated at Rockville, Maryland this 12th day of October 1994.

Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Granting Accelerated Approval of a Proposed Rule Change and Notice of Filing
and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Amendment No. 1 to the Proposed Rule Change by the American Stock Exchange,
Inc. Relating to the Listing and Trading of Banking Industry Portfolio Indexed Term Notes



October 17, 1994.



I. Introduction



On September 22, 1994, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') a proposed rule change to list and
trade Indexed Term Notes (``Notes''), the return on which is based upon a static portfolio of banking industry securities
(``Banking Industry Portfolio''). Notice of the proposal appeared in the 

Federal Register

 on October 4, 1994.
 No comment letters were received on the proposed rule change. The Exchange filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposal on
October 11, 1994.
 This order approves the proposal, as amended.








II. Description of the Proposal



Under Section 107 of the Amex Company Guide (``Guide''), the Exchange may approve for listing and trading securities
which cannot be readily categorized under the listing criteria for common and preferred stocks, bonds, debentures,
or warrants.
 The Amex now proposes to list for trading, under Section 107A of the Guide, Notes whose value is based in whole or in part
on a static index composed of twenty actively-traded bank stocks.







The Notes are non-convertible debt securities of Lehman Brothers, Inc. (``Lehman Brothers'') and will conform to
the listing guidelines under Section 107A of the Guide.
 Although the specific maturity date will not be established until immediately prior to the time of the offering, the
Notes will provide for maturity within a period of not less than one nor more than seven years from the date of issue.
The Notes provide for a single payment at maturity, and will bear no periodic payments of interest. Banking Industry
Portfolio Notes will entitle the owner at maturity to receive an amount based upon the percentage change between the
``Original Portfolio Value'' and the ``Ending Average Portfolio Value;'' provided, however, that: (1) the amount
payable at maturity will not be less than 90% of the principal amount of the Notes; and (2) the issuer may place a cap on
the amount to be paid on the Notes at maturity.
 The ``Original Portfolio Value'' is the value of the Banking Industry Portfolio on the date on which the issuer prices
the Notes for the initial offering to the public. The ``Ending Average Portfolio Value'' is the average of the closing
prices of the Banking Industry Portfolio securities for a specified number of days prior to maturity of the Notes.
 The Ending Average Portfolio Value will be used in calculating the amount owners will receive upon maturity.

<TEXT>
 

If market value of the Banking Industry Portfolio has declined, the owners of the Banking Industry Portfolio Notes
will receive at least 90% of the principal amount of the Notes. The payment at maturity is based on charges in the value
of the Banking Industry Portfolio, subject to any cap on appreciation that may be included by the issuer, but does not
reflect the payment of dividends on the securities that comprise the portfolio. Banking Industry Portfolio Notes
are cash-settled in that they do not give holder any right to receive a portfolio security or any other ownership right
or interest in the portfolio securities, although the return on the investment is based on the aggregate value of the
Banking Industry Portfolio securities.

According to the Amex, Banking Industry Portfolio Notes will allow investors to combine the protection of a portion
of the principal amount of the Notes with a potential additional payment based upon the performance of a portfolio
of 20 highly capitalized banking industry stocks. In particular, the proposed Banking Industry Portfolio Notes
will provide at least 90% principal protection with the opportunity to participate in any upside appreciation of
the underlying Banking Industry Portfolio, subject to any cap on appreciation that may be included by the issuer.

The Banking Industry Portfolio consists of securities of 20 companies that collectively, at the time of issuance,
 will satisfy the generic listing requirements approved by the Commission for the listing and trading of options on
newly established narrow-based indexes.
 Specifically, the component securities of the Banking Industry Portfolio satisfy the following criteria: (1) a
minimum market capitalization of $75 million, except that up to 10% of the component securities may have a market capitalization
of not less than $50 million; (2) trading volume in each of the six months prior to the offering of the Notes of not less
than one million shares, except that up to 10% of the component securities may have a trading volume in each of the six
months prior to the offering of the Notes of not less than 500,000 shares; (3) at least 90% of the component securities
will meet the then current criteria for standardized options trading set forth in Exchange Rule 915; (4) all components
of the Banking Industry Portfolio will be listed on the Amex or the New York Stock Exchange, or will be National Market
securities traded through Nasdaq; (5) all components of the Banking Industry Portfolio will be subject to last sale
reporting pursuant to Rule 11Aa3-1 of the Act; and (6) no more than 20% of the weight of the Banking Industry Portfolio
shall be represented by foreign securities or ADRs for which the Exchange does not have in place a comprehensive surveillance
sharing agreement with the appropriate regulatory organization(s) in such country(ies).











At the outset, each of the securities in the Banking Industry Portfolio will have equal representation. Specifically,
each security included in the Banking Industry Portfolio will be assigned a multiplier on the date of issuance so that
the security represents an equal percentage of the value of the entire portfolio on the date of issuance. The multiplier
indicates the number of shares (or fraction of one share) of a security, given its market price on an exchange or through
Nasdaq, to be included in the calculation of the portfolio. Accordingly, each of the 20 companies included in the Banking
Industry Portfolio will represent approximately 5.0% of the total portfolio at the time of issuance.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941021-2-00138 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941021-2-00089 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The multiplier for each security in the Banking Industry Portfolio will generally remain unchanged except for limited
adjustments that may be necessary as a result of stock splits or stock dividends.
 There will be no adjustments to the multipliers to reflect cash dividends paid with respect to a portfolio security.
In addition, no adjustments of any multiplier of a portfolio security will be made unless such adjustment would require
a change of at least 1% in the multiplier then in effect.




If the issuer of a security included in the Banking Industry Portfolio no longer exists, whether for reason of a merger,
acquisition or similar type of corporate control transaction, then Lehman Brothers will assign to that security
a value equal to the security's final value for the purposes of calculating portfolio values. For example, if a company
included in the portfolio is acquired by another company, Lehman Brothers shall thereafter assign a value to the shares
of the acquired company's securities equal to the value per share at the time that the acquisition takes place.
If the issuer of a Banking Industry Portfolio security is in the process of liquidation or subject to a bankruptcy proceeding,
insolvency, or other similar adjudication, such security will continue to be included in the Banking Industry Portfolio
so long as a market price on an exchange or through Nasdaq for such security is available. If such a market price is no
longer available for a portfolio security, including, but not limited to, liquidation, bankruptcy, insolvency,
or any other similar proceeding, then the value of the portfolio security will be assigned a value of zero in connection
with calculating the daily portfolio value and the closing portfolio value of the Banking Industry Portfolio, for
so long as no such market price exists for that security.





The value of the Banking Industry Portfolio will be calculated continuously by the Amex and will be disseminated every
15 seconds over the Consolidated Tape Association's Network B. The portfolio value will equal the sum of the products
of the most recently available market prices and the applicable multipliers for the portfolio securities.

<DOCNO> FR941021-2-00139 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941021-2-00089 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Notes may not be redeemed prior to maturity and are not callable by the issuer. Holders of Banking Industry Portfolio
Notes will be able to cash-out of their investment by selling the security on the Amex. The Exchange anticipates that
the trading value of the security in this secondary trading market will depend in large part on the value of the securities
comprising the Banking Industry Portfolio and also on such other factors as the level of interest rates, the volatility
of the value of the Banking Industry Portfolio, the time remaining to maturity, dividend rates, and the creditworthiness
of the issuer, Lehman Brothers.
Because Banking Industry Portfolio Notes are linked to a portfolio of equity securities, the Amex's existing equity
floor trading rules will apply to the trading of Banking Industry Portfolio Notes. First, pursuant to Amex Rule 411,
the exchange will impose a duty of due diligence on its members and member firms to learn the essential facts relating
to every customer prior to trading Banking Industry Portfolio Notes.
 Second, consistent with Amex Rule 411, the Exchange will further require that a member or member firm specifically
approve a customer's account for trading Banking Industry Portfolio Notes prior to, or promptly after, the completion
of the transaction. Third, Banking Industry Portfolio Notes will be subject to the equity margin rules of the Exchange.
Fourth, the Exchange will, prior to trading Banking Industry Portfolio Notes, distribute a circular to the membership
providing guidance with regard to member firm compliance responsibilities (including suitability recommendations)
when handling transactions in Banking Industry Portfolio Notes and highlighting the special risks and characteristics
of the Banking Industry Portfolio Notes.






III. Commission Findings and Conclusions


The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section
6(b)(5) of the Act.
 Specifically, the Commission believes that providing for exchange-trading of Banking Industry Portfolio Notes
will offer a new and innovative means of participating in the market for banking industry securities.
 In particular, the Commission believes that Banking Industry Portfolio Notes will permit investors to gain equity
exposure in such companies, while at the same time, limiting the downside risk of the original investment. For the
reasons discussed in the Commission's order approving the listing of Basic Industry Portfolio Notes,
 the Commission finds that the listing and trading of Banking Industry Portfolio Notes is consistent with the Act.






As with the Basic Industry Portfolio Notes, Banking Industry Portfolio Notes are not leveraged instruments. Their
price, however, will still be derived and based upon the underlying linked securities. Accordingly, the level of
risk involved in the purchase or sale of Banking Industry Portfolio Notes is similar to the risk involved in the purchase
or sale of traditional common stock. Nonetheless, the Commission has several specific concerns with this type of
product because the final rate or return of the Notes is derivatively priced, based on the performance of the underlying
securities. The concerns include: (1) investor protection concerns, (2) dependence on the credit of the issuer of
the security, (3) systemic concerns regarding position exposure of issuers with partially hedged positions or dynamically
hedged positions, and (4) the impact on the market for the underlying linked securities.
 The Commission believes the Amex has adequately addressed each of these issues such that the Commission's regulatory
concerns are adequately minimized.
 In particular, by imposing the listing standards, suitability, disclosure, and compliance requirements noted
above, the Amex has adequately addressed the potential public customer concerns that could arise from the hybrid
nature of the Notes.
 Further, the Commission believes that the listing standards and issuance restrictions should help to reduce the
likelihood of any adverse market impact on the securities comprising the Banking Industry Portfolio.

<DOCNO> FR941021-2-00140 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941021-2-00089 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Commission realizes that Banking Industry Portfolio Notes are dependent upon the individual credit of the issuer,
Lehman Brothers. To some extent this credit risk is minimized by the Exchange's continued listing standards which
require issuers to maintain an aggregate market value of $1 million for its publicly-held shares.
 In addition, the Exchange's hybrid listing standards further require that Banking Industry Portfolio Notes have
at least $4 million in market value.
 In any event, financial information regarding Lehman Brothers, in addition to the information on the issuers of the
underlying securities comprising the Banking Industry Portfolio, will be publicly available.







The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change and Amendment No. 1 to the proposal prior to
the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the 

Federal Register

. Specifically, the Commission believes that the proposal, as amended, does not raise any regulatory issues that
were not addressed by the Amex in its proposal to list and trade Basic Industry Portfolio Notes.
 Additionally, the Exchange's proposal to list and trade Basic Industry Portfolio Notes was noticed for the full comment
period without any comments being received by the Commission. Accordingly, the Commission believes that it is consistent
with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act to approve the proposed rule change and Amendment No. 1 thereto on an accelerated basis.




Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning Amendment No. 1 to the proposed
rule change. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and
Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submissions, all subsequent amendments,
all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written
communications relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that
may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection
and copying at the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of
such filings will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of the Amex. All submissions
should refer to File No. SR-Amex-94-39 and should be submitted by November 14, 1994.


It is Therefore Ordered,

 pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-Amex-94-39), as amended, is approved.





For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Participants Trust Company; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change Establishing
Early Principal and Interest Distribution on Government National Mortgage Association II Securities</DOCTITLE>



October 14, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 notice is hereby given that on October 11, 1994, the Participants Trust Company (``PTC'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change (File No. SR-PTC-94-05) as
described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared primarily by the self-regulatory organization.
The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.




I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The proposed rule change will establish early principal and interest (``P&I'') distribution on Government
National Mortgage Association (``GNMA'') II securities.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.




A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



The purpose of the proposed rule change is to extend the program for the early distribution of P&I to GNMA II P&I
distributions. Under the proposal, all of the P&I on GNMA II securities will be distributed by PTC to its participants
by Fedwire early in the day of distribution rather than by credit to the participants' cash balances payable at end
of day settlement.






Background



Before November 1993, PTC's rules and procedures provided that PTC disburse P&I on securities deposited at PTC
by means of a credit to the participant's applicable account cash balance. This resulted in the participant's receipt
of available funds in the amount of the P&I net of any account debits and/or credits at the end of the day as part of
the settlement process. In November 1993, PTC's rules were amended to eliminate the requirement that P&I be disbursed
by means of a credit to a participant's cash balance and to permit PTC to make payment of P&I either by intraday Fedwire
transfer of immediately available funds or by means of a credit to the applicable cash balance, as PTC deems advisable
from time to time.

At that time, the Commission required PTC to limit intraday disbursement of P&I to the amount of collected and
available P&I payments without recourse to funds available to PTC from other sources for P&I disbursement
such as PTC's own funds, the cash portion of the mandatory deposits to the participant's fund, and borrowed funds secured
by the P&I receipts.
 PTC then began a pilot program to distribute up to 50% of the P&I payable with respect to GNMA I securities subject
to the requirement that the intraday distribution be made from collected and available GNMA I P&I only.





PTC now seeks to expand its intraday P&I disbursement program to permit intraday disbursement of all GNMA II P&I
to participants who elect to receive the intraday distribution subject to retaining discretion to suspend the program
if it is deemed necessary or advisable in the future.



GNMA II P&I Proposal



Currently, Chemical Bank as central paying and transfer agent for the GNMA II program credits PTC's account on Chemical
Bank's books in the amount of the GNMA II payment. PTC transfers the funds via Fedwire transfer into PTC's account at
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on the GNMA II distribution date.
 PTC credits the GNMA II P&I to its participants' accounts at PTC on the day of receipt and disburses the payment
in same-day funds net of any intraday account debits and credits as part of the end-of-day settlement. PTC does not
use its uncommitted line of credit to fund the GNMA II P&I disbursement.
 Under the proposal, PTC anticipates passing-through all GNMA II P&I upon its receipt from Chemical Bank. This
will result in the intraday disbursement of all payable GNMA II P&I by Fedwire transfer at or before approximately
12 noon to all participants who elect to receive it intraday.






PTC believes that because the proposed rule change facilitates the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement
of securities transactions and provides for the safeguarding of securities and funds in PTC's custody or control
or for which it is responsible, it is consistent with Section 17A of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder
applicable to PTC.

Comments Invited 



We invite interested parties to submit comments on the proposed 

AC. Commenters must identify AC 23.1309-1B and submit comments to the address specified above. The FAA will
consider all communications received on or before the closing date for comments before issuing the final AC. The FAA
is requesting that comments be made only on the text with vertical bars, as these are the only changes to the AC. The proposed
AC and comments received may be inspected at the Standards Office (ACE-110), Suite 900, 1201 Walnut, Kansas
City, Missouri, between the hours of 7:30 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. weekdays, except Federal holidays. 



Background 



NTSB Recommendation A-92-89 recommended manufacturers of integrated flight guidance and control systems
be provided additional information in the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) and training information regarding systems
failures. The FAA's response to the recommendation includes the revision to AC 23.1309-1A that would include
additional guidance to needed warning and procedural information for complex integrated systems for inclusion
in the AFM. In the process of revising this AC, the policy and guidance for environmental and atmospheric conditions,
and software assessment, are also updated. 

 



Issued in Kansas City, Missouri, October 3, 1994.
