Kiwifruit Grown in California; Revision of Pack and Reporting Requirements 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This final rule revises pack and reporting requirements established under the Federal marketing order for kiwifruit
grown in California. The first change standardizes packaging for certain volume filled containers packed by weight.
For the 1994/95 season only, volume filled containers packed by weight will be required to be 22- or 23-pounds net weight
if more than 10 pounds and less than 35 pounds. Thereafter, a 22-pound volume filled standard will be effective. The
second change streamlines information collection requirements under the program by deleting a requirement that
handlers file a Beginning Inventory Data form and adding reporting requirements for a Kiwifruit Inventory Shipment
System (KISS) form. Since the KISS form is already in use by handlers, this requirement merely formalizes existing
industry use of the KISS form. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This final rule is issued under Marketing Order No. 920 [7 CFR Part 920], as amended, regulating the handling of kiwifruit
grown in California, hereinafter referred to as the ``order.'' The order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing
Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601-674], hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.'' 


The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have
retroactive effect. This final rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they
present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principle place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. 
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
There are approximately 65 handlers of California kiwifruit subject to regulation under the order and approximately
600 kiwifruit producers in the production area. Small agricultural service firms are defined by the Small Business
Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000, and small agricultural
producers have been defined as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000. A majority of handlers and producers
of California kiwifruit may be classified as small entities. 
Under the terms of the order, fresh market shipments of California kiwifruit are required to be inspected and are subject
to grade, size, maturity, pack, and container requirements. 
The Kiwifruit Administrative Committee (committee), the agency responsible for local administration of the order,
met on February 10, 1994, and unanimously recommended the following changes: 


Pack Requirements 


The committee recommended standardizing the weight of certain volume filled containers by requiring such containers
to be marked by weight at either 22-pounds or 23-pounds net weight through July 31, 1995. For subsequent seasons, volume
filled containers will be standardized at 22 pounds. Paragraph (a)(3) of  920.52 specifies that the Secretary
may fix the weight of containers used in the handling of kiwifruit.

In a volume filled container, fairly uniform size kiwifruit are loosely packed without cell compartments, cardboard
fillers or molded trays. Handlers may ship volume filled containers marked by either the appropriate count or net
weight of kiwifruit. Handler shipments are based upon the preference of the receiver. Volume filled containers marked
by count will not be affected by this change. Also, containers of less than 10-pounds or more than 35-pounds net weight
will not be affected by this revised weight standard. Thus the industry will continue to have the flexibility to utilize
containers of different weights for a variety of buyer preferences. 
Last season the industry standardized the weight of all volume filled containers of kiwifruit designated by weight
at 23-pounds net weight of kiwifruit unless such containers hold less than 10-pounds or more than 35-pounds net weight
of kiwifruit. The industry has since learned that the recognized world standard for volume filled containers of kiwifruit
is 10-kilograms (10-kg) net weight which is equal to approximately 22 pounds. The industry has also become aware that
neither foreign nor domestic buyers wish to pay more for a 23-pound box than for a 22-pound (10-kg) box. As a result,
California marketers selling 23-pound containers have been disadvantaged in both export and domestic markets compared
to marketers from other countries selling 22-pound (10-kg) containers of fruit. 
The change to a standard container weight of 22-pounds net weight will enable the industry to mark volume filled containers
both in terms of a unit of measure in pounds and with a metric weight. Standardizing the weight of volume filled containers
marked by weights recognized in the world market will standardize marketing practices for the kiwifruit industry.

The committee considered immediately standardizing the minimum weight for volume filled containers at only 22 pounds
(10 kg) rather than at 22 pounds or 23 pounds. However, all committee members were in favor of allowing handlers to continue
to also pack or ship to the 23-pound standard for the 1994/95 season to enable handlers to utilize existing inventories
of boxes and labels. Thus the requirement to ship only 22-pound net weight containers will be effective for the 1995-96
and subsequent seasons. 
This final rule will impact all handlers in the same manner. The same size container currently used for the 23-pound
standard can be used for the 22-pound (10-kg) standard. It is anticipated that only a small number of packages will
be shipped in 23-pound containers during the 1994/95 season. This is because handlers shipping 23-pound containers
have already expressed the concern that they do not receive a price premium for the extra pound of fruit in each container.
This concern will be remedied by deleting the preprinted marking of 23 pounds, relabeling the container to read 22
pounds, and filling the container with 22 pounds of fruit. This change will impose some minimal costs on those handlers
who choose to print new labels or convert 23-pound volume filled containers into other types of containers. However,
the overall benefits to the California kiwifruit industry by standardizing volume filled containers at 22 pounds
(10 kg), with the option of using existing labels and boxes for the 1994/95 season, will more than offset the costs imposed
on handlers. 


Reporting Requirements 


Paragraphs (a) and (b) of  920.60 authorize reporting requirements for kiwifruit handlers under the marketing
order. Pursuant to  920.160, the marketing order requires a Beginning Inventory Data form to be filed with the
committee by each handler no later than five days after all fruit has been packed for the season, or such other later
time as the committee may establish. This information includes beginning inventory by container type and by fruit
size. 
In 1990, the California Kiwifruit Commission, hereinafter referred to as the ``State commission,'' adopted the
Kiwifruit Inventory Shipment System (KISS) form. The KISS form is comprised of three sections: (1) The ``KISS/Add
Inventory'' requires all handlers to report their beginning inventories by size and container type. Inventory includes
all fruit packed at harvest; (2) The ``KISS/Deduct Inventory'' requires all handlers to report fruit lost in repack,
fruit repacked into another container type, and adjustments to decrease posted inventory; and (3) The ``KISS/Shipments''
requires all handlers to report shipments by size and container type. 
All three sections of the KISS form will be filed with the committee, on or before December 5th, or such other later time
as the committee may establish. Subsequent KISS forms, including all three sections, will be filed with the committee
by the fifth day and again by the twentieth day of each calendar month, or such other later time as the committee may establish.

The adoption of the KISS form by the State commission resulted in redundant reporting requirements in the kiwifruit
industry. The KISS form collects the same information as the Beginning Inventory Data form. This information is used
to verify the total amount of fruit available for shipping, to calculate statistics, and to determine if assessments
billed match reported shipments. In an effort to eliminate the redundant reporting requirements, the committee
recommended that the Beginning Inventory Data form reporting requirement be deleted from paragraph (b) of  920.160
and the KISS form reporting requirements be added. This rule is intended to enable kiwifruit handlers to efficiently
file one form to meet the requirements of both the State commission and the Federal marketing order. Deleting the requirement
for the Beginning Inventory Data form in paragraph (b) of  920.160 and utilizing the KISS form will eliminate
the submission of duplicate information.

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 [44 U.S.C. Chapter 35], the information collection requirements
contained in this rule have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and have been assigned OMB No.
0581-0149. Eliminating the Beginning Inventory Data form will decrease the information collection burden
for the industry by 65 hours. It has been estimated that it will take an average of .5 hours for each of the approximately
65 handlers of kiwifruit to complete the KISS form. Thus the finalized change will increase the overall burden by 325
hours because the KISS form is filed with the committee more frequently. 
A proposed rule concerning this action was published in the 

Federal Register

 on August 14, 1994 [59 FR 41717], with a 30-day comment period ending September 14, 1994. No comments were received.

Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including the information and recommendations submitted
by the committee and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule, as hereinafter set forth, will
tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. 
It is further found that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this rule until 30 days after publication
in the 

Federal Register

 [5 U.S.C. 553] because: (1) Handlers have begun labeling boxes in preparation of shipping kiwifruit for the 1994/1995
season which began in mid-September; (2) Handlers are aware of this rule, which was unanimously recommended by the
committee at a public meeting; and (3) a 30-day comment period was provided for in the proposed rule.

<USDEPT>FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM</USDEPT>










Credit by Brokers and Dealers 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Board is adopting amendments to Regulation T. The amendments are part of the Board's review of Regulation T and
respond to rulemaking by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) concerning settlement of securities transactions
and Congressional action concerning government securities. The proposed amendments were published for public
comment in the 

Federal Register

 on July 1, 1994. The amendments address two general areas: payment periods for securities purchases and transactions
in government securities. The amendments concerning payment periods will reduce by two days the amount of time customers
have to meet initial margin calls or make full cash payment for securities at the same time the SEC reduces the standard
settlement period by two days, require broker-dealers seeking an extension of this time period to obtain the extension
from their designated examining authority if the balance due is $1000 or more, and revise regulatory language in the
cash account so that the time periods within which extensions must be obtained and when the ``90-day freeze'' may be
lifted are consistent for certain transactions in which settlement exceeds the standard settlement period. The
amendments concerning transactions in government securities will exempt from Regulation T those broker-dealers
registered with the SEC solely as government securities brokers or dealers and create a new account for customers
of general broker-dealers that permits transactions in government securities to be effected without regard to other
provisions of the 
regulation. 

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The proposed amendments are part of the Board's general review of Regulation T (Docket R-0772) and were published
for public comment on July 1, 1994 (59 FR 33923). Twenty-two comments have been received. The comments on the proposed
amendments concerning transactions in government securities were supported by all commenters, although some asked
for additional amendments. The comments concerning the proposed reduction in payment periods were mixed, with some
commenters in favor, some opposed, and some requesting a delay in the amendments' effectiveness. The related payment
period issues were generally supported by the commenters, with the exception of the requirement that extensions
be obtained solely from the broker-dealer's examining authority and the use of language that will automatically
reduce the payment periods if the standard settlement cycle is reduced. Comments on these issues were also mixed.




The Board is adopting the proposed amendments substantially as proposed. Technical changes have been made in the
regulatory language and structure to respond to comments and clarify the intent of the amendments. 
The two general areas are discussed below. 



I. Payment Periods 



A. T+3 and Shortening of Payment Periods 



1. Introduction. On October 6, 1993, the SEC adopted 
Rule 15c6-1,

1

 which establishes a standard three business day settlement cycle for most securities transactions in the United
States, effective June 1, 1995. Regular settlement is presently effected in five business days. This new standard
is often referred to as ``T+3,'' meaning regular settlement will occur three business days after trade date. Regulation
T contains a seven day time period within which brokers must obtain cash or margin deposits from their customers. The
seven day payment period in Regulation T is based on the current five day settlement period. 





The Board proposed shortening the payment period in Regulation T by the same amount of time that SEC Rule 15c6-1
shortens the standard settlement cycle. Instead of changing the phrase ``seven business days'' to ``five business
days,'' the proposal defined a new term, ``payment period,'' to represent the number of days in the standard settlement
cycle plus two business days. This formulation allows the regulation to be amended immediately without changing
the current payment period. Once SEC Rule 15c6-1 becomes effective next June, the regulation will automatically
require payment within five business days. Although the definition of payment period refers to settlement date,
Regulation T remains a trade date based regulation. The use of the phrase ``payment period'' is meant to be an alternate
way of requiring payment within seven business days until June 1995 and five business days thereafter, unless the
SEC acts to further change the standard settlement cycle. Future changes by the SEC would be automatically incorporated
in the Board's rule without the necessity of further amendment.

2. Issues raised by commenters. Comments on the proposal to shorten the payment periods in conjunction with the SEC's
shortening of the standard settlement cycle were focused on three issues: whether the payment periods should be shortened,
whether the proposed language clearly accomplishes this goal, and whether future reductions in the standard settlement
period should be automatically accommodated or reviewed by the Board. 

a. Shortening the payment period by two days. The Board is adopting the proposed amendments, subject to the clarification
discussed in section b below. Many of the commenters who oppose shortening the payment periods had written to the SEC
last year to oppose its T+3 proposal. The Board and the SEC both have responsibilities in the area of settlement and
clearance. Shortening the Regulation T payment periods is consistent with (if not required by) the SEC's adoption
of a three day settlement cycle. A failure to adjust the payment periods would lessen the overall benefits to be realized
from the transition to T+3 and increase risk to the broker-dealer community since they will have to settle trades amongst
themselves in the shortened time frame while allowing their customers' behavior and payment patterns to remain unchanged.
Increased risk to broker-dealers also affects customers with cash and securities at those firms. Adoption of the
proposed amendments by the Board does not reduce the two-day period currently provided to resolve payment problems,
but merely clarifies that two days beyond the usual settlement date should be sufficient to resolve any mistakes in
the payment process. 

Some of the commenters opposed to shortening the payment periods in conjunction with the shortening of the standard
settlement cycle believe that the mail system does not permit funds to be delivered within this time frame. However,
the increased use of fax machines and money market mutual funds provide alternate ways for customers to make prompt
payment for their securities purchases. Although the Board shares the concerns expressed about investors who rely
on the mail to pay for securities, it believes that most investors will be able to adjust to the shortened periods. Indeed,
the Bachmann Task Force on Clearance and Settlement Reform in U.S. Securities Markets, which recommended to the SEC
that the standard settlement cycle be reduced to T+3, stated that it ``believes that current customer behavior practices
should not be an obstacle to shortened settlement provided there is strong leadership from within the industry and
educational efforts to address customer and account executive concerns.''
 Many of the commenters stressed the fact that the brokerage industry is already educating customers about the approach
of T+3 settlement and the changes this will entail. The Board is of the view that the successful implementation of T+3
includes a reduction in the Regulation T payment periods. It is expected that broker-dealers will be working with
customers who may have difficulty making prompt payment. A delay in the effectiveness of shortening the payment periods
would not necessarily improve the educational process, which is already well underway at most firms, and might serve
as an excuse for others to delay their educational efforts. 




b. Uniform payment period. The proposed term ``payment period'' was defined as the two business days beyond ``the
standard securities settlement cycle in the United States.'' This phrase was meant to refer to the current five day
settlement cycle for most securities transactions until SEC Rule 15c6-1 becomes effective next June, at which
time the Board's regulation would be referring to the three day period established in the SEC rule. Additional language
has been added to the definition of payment period to clarify this point. Some commenters believed the reference to
a ``standard settlement cycle'' depends on the type of security being purchased, so that trades involving standardized
options or government securities, both of which settle the day after trade date, would have to be paid for by the third
business day after trade date. Although broker-dealers can require payment for transactions by settlement date
of the particular trade, Regulation T establishes a standard period within which customers must make payment even
though certain securities settle in less than the current five day period. It was not the intent of the Board to change
this general policy. 

c. Impact of further reductions in settlement periods. As noted in the request for public comment, one of the reasons
for using the phrase ``payment period'' instead of a fixed number of days was to ensure that future reductions in the
settlement cycle would be automatically reflected in Regulation T, without the need for further amendments. Commenters
were evenly split on whether the Board should be forced to review the Regulation T payment periods whenever the standard
settlement cycle is altered. The proposed language has been retained. In light of the fact that investors are expected
to pay for securities on settlement date, tying the payment period to the standard settlement cycle merely codifies
the Board's current position that two business days should be sufficient to insure that a failure to receive the customer's
payment is not due to an error or other exceptional circumstance. 



B. Granting of Extensions of Time by a Broker-dealer's Examining Authority





If a customer has not made full cash payment or met an initial margin call within the payment period, the broker-dealer
must liquidate the customer's position. However, if exceptional circumstances exist, the broker-dealer can obtain
an extension for its customer. Regulation T currently permits any self-regulatory organization (SRO) to grant these
extensions. A New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) rule recently approved by the SEC requires broker-dealers for whom the
NYSE is the designated examining authority (DEA) to obtain these extensions only from the NYSE.
 Although the Board could leave Regulation T unchanged and most broker-dealers would still be required to go to their
DEA instead of any SRO, the Board proposed amending Regulation T to require that extensions be granted only by a broker-dealer's
DEA. This decision was based on analysis of the comments received by the Board in response to its advance notice of proposed
rulemaking concerning the current review of Regulation T and the SEC's consideration of the NYSE rule filing. No new
information was presented in this area. The Board is therefore adopting the requirement that extensions be granted
by a broker-dealer's DEA.

C. Technical Amendments Concerning Foreign Securities



The Board proposed technical amendments to the cash account to clear up confusion resulting from its 1990 amendment
allowing payment for foreign securities to be tied to the appropriate foreign settlement period. The amendments
would clarify that this longer period is also used to determine when extensions of time must be obtained and when the
``90-day freeze'' may be lifted for foreign securities. Two securities trade associations point out that the cash
account establishes three other situations in which settlement regularly exceeds the standard settlement cycle:
unissued securities, ``when-issued'' securities, and refunded securities.
 These commenters suggest the proposed language be revised to consistently refer to the various time periods in determining
when extensions are required and when the ``90-day freeze'' may be lifted. These amendments have been redrafted to
accommodate this suggestion. 





D. De Minimis Amount



The required liquidation of customer purchases for which payment has not been received within the required time currently
does not apply to amounts of $500 or less. The Board proposed doubling this amount to $1000 in light of the ten years that
had passed since the amount was last increased. This increase was supported by a wide variety of commenters. The increase
to $1000 will still reduce the regulatory burden on broker-dealers and their examining authorities by reducing the
number of extensions that must be requested and processed. 



II. Government Securities



Two amendments were proposed to exempt most transactions in * * * government securities from Regulation
T. The first exempts those brokers and dealers who effect customer transactions only in government securities (Section
15C Brokers). The second amendment effectively exempts transactions involving government securities for customers
of general securities broker-dealers by allowing the transactions to be effected in a new government securities
account. All of the commenters supported these two proposed amendments. 



A. Exemption from Regulation T for Brokers and Dealers Whose Activities are Limited to Government Securities



The scope of Regulation T, as stated in section 220.1(b)(1), is ``all financial relations between a customer and a
creditor.'' In order to exempt Section 15C brokers from Regulation T, the Board proposed excluding them from the definition
of creditor in section 220.2(b) of the regulation. The Public Securities Association (PSA) and the Securities Industry
Association (SIA) suggest that the exclusion be moved to the scope section, so that Section 15C brokers would still
be defined as ``creditors'' when they are not dealing with ``customers.'' For example, the commenters point out that
the term ``creditor'' is used in the broker-dealer credit account to describe permissible transactions between
broker-dealers. In light of these comments, the exclusion has been moved to the scope section of Regulation T. 




B. Government Securities Account



The second amendment proposed in the area of government securities was the creation of a new government securities
account. This account would allow general broker-dealers to effect customer transactions that could be effected
by Section 15C Brokers without regard to other restrictions in Regulation T. 

In addition to general support of the proposal, commenters focused on two areas: the regulatory language used to describe
the account and whether additional securities and other financial instruments should be included in its scope. 

1. Description. The government securities account was proposed for ``transactions involving government securities,
provided the transaction would be permissible for a broker or dealer registered under section 15C of the act.'' The
PSA and the SIA both suggest deletion of the reference to Section 15C Brokers because they believe it is confusing and
unnecessary. They argue that section 15C does not establish permissible and impermissible classes of transactions
in government securities. However, section 15C(b)(7) of the Act prohibits government securities brokers and dealers
from effecting ``any transaction * * * in any government security in contravention of any rule under
this section.'' The regulatory language for the government securities account has been redrafted to clarify that
it is available for transactions involving government securities as long as the transaction is not prohibited under
section 15C or any of the rules thereunder. 


2. Scope. The PSA, SIA, SIA-Credit Division and one broker-dealer suggest that all exempted securities, including
municipal securities, be included in the new account. A second broker-dealer would include foreign sovereign debt
that meets the margin requirements of Regulation T. In addition, three of these commenters believe that all nonconvertible
debt securities that meet the margin requirements of Regulation T should be eligible for the account and one of these
commenters would like ``money market instruments'' such as certificates of deposit, bankers acceptances and commercial
paper to be covered by the new account. All of these suggestions will be considered in the course of Board's review of
Regulation T, with an opportunity for public comment. As explained in the request for public comment on the proposed
government securities account, the rationale for the new account stems from the unique regulatory scheme established
for U.S. government securities and brokers and dealers in that market. 




Regulatory Flexibility Act 



The Board certifies that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities.

Miscellaneous Technical Amendments 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of Thrift Supervision, Treasury.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) is adopting several technical corrections and clarifications to its regulations
on home loans and other real estate loans, hearings, operating subsidiaries, appraisals, interest rate risk management
procedures, and its incorporation and standard conversion regulations. The OTS is also amending its insider transactions
rule and removing or revising obsolete or superseded provisions concerning investment limitations, stock ownership,
conservatorships, and remote service units. Finally, the agency is adding a waiver provision affecting regulations
that are not statutorily mandated.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On April 21, 1994, the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) proposed several technical corrections to revise, clarify,
or remove obsolete or ambiguous regulations.
 




The agency received three comments in response to the proposal. Two comments were submitted by trade associations
and one comment was submitted by a private law firm. All of the commenters supported the proposal. 


I. Amendments Described in April 21 Proposal 


Today, the OTS is adopting the amendments in the proposal, as described below. 


Stock Loans 


Section 205 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA)
 amended section 7(j)(9) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and modified the reporting criteria and procedures
of that section, thereby superseding existing section 574.5(b) of OTS's regulations. Rather than amend section
574.5(b) to conform to amended section 7(j)(9), the OTS has chosen to rescind the regulation because the statute is
self-implementing and OTS finds it unnecessary merely to repeat the statutory language. 




Directors 


Through its final rule on regulatory review,
 the OTS lowered the number of directors required for a Federal savings association from seven to five, consistent
with the required number of national bank directors. An additional reference in section 552.3, which was overlooked
in the earlier rulemaking, is now being changed to conform with the new requirement. 




Operating Subsidiaries

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941025-0-00012 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941025-0-00003 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The OTS is adding a clarifying technical amendment restructuring section 545.81(d). This replacement language
more clearly sets forth the requirements that apply when a federal savings association that owned a service corporation
on November 30, 1992, wishes to have that service corporation deemed an operating subsidiary. 



Insider Transactions 



Pursuant to and in accordance with section 4(a) of the Home Owners' Loan Act and section 106(b)(2)(H)(i) of the Bank
Holding Company Amendments Act of 1970,

4

 as revised by section 306(j) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA),

5

 the OTS is amending its regulation pertaining to insider transactions by incorporating by means of cross-reference
subpart B of the Federal Reserve Board's Regulation O, 12 CFR Part 215, subpart B, as now or hereafter in effect. 






Investments 



Section 563.96, which restricts the amount savings associations may invest in savings accounts and debt securities
hedged with forward commitments according to a complex formula set forth in the rule, is being removed in light of the
Federal Reserve Board's (FRB) final rule on interbank liabilities.

6

 The FRB's final rule limits such investments to 25% of capital. Since the FRB rule applies to savings associations,
section 563.96 is deleted as unnecessary. 





Loan Documentation 



The OTS is amending its interim final loan documentation regulation to broaden eligibility to any institution that
was assigned a CAMEL rating of 3 in its most recent report of examination and that has obtained written permission from
its Regional Director to employ the exemption. 



Remote Service Units 



Section 545.141(d), which addresses privacy of account data concerning an RSU account, is deleted because the OTS
believes that Regulation E of the Federal Reserve Board, 12 CFR Part 205, which governs electronic funds transfers
by all financial institutions, including savings associations, provides adequate protection for consumers' interests
in this area. Second, the OTS is revising section 545.141(e) to reflect earlier revisions to 12 CFR Part 568, ``Minimum
Security Devices.''

Waivers and Miscellaneous Changes 


The agency is adding a provision expressly setting forth its existing authority to waive any non-statutorily required
regulation for good cause. This authority is separate and apart from, and is not meant to limit, the agency's statutorily
based authority (

e.g.

, under the Depository Institutions Disaster Relief Act of 1992) to waive certain regulations and its inherent authority
to decide whether or not to take enforcement actions against violations of its regulations. 

See Heckler

 v. 

Chaney

, 470 U.S. 821 (1985). 
Sections 545.33, 545.35 and 563.93 are being revised to correct internal references. 


II. Technical Amendment to Service Corporation Rules 


One of the commenters suggested an additional amendment that OTS believes has merit. As required by section 18(m)
of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act,
 the OTS's service corporation regulation, 12 CFR 545.74, requires a Federal savings association to give the OTS and
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) 30 days prior notice before either establishing a new service corporation
or engaging in a new activity through an existing service corporation.
 That same statutory provision exempts Federal savings banks chartered before October 15, 1982. An earlier regulatory
amendment inadvertently removed the reference to this exemption.
 The OTS is taking this opportunity to reinstate the regulatory exemption as it was adopted in April, 1992.
 







III. Additional Technical Amendments 


In addition to the amendments set forth in the proposal, several technical revisions are being made to other OTS regulations.
The agency finds good cause pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553 to adopt these amendments without public notice and comment because
of their purely technical and clarifying nature. First, erroneous cross-references and obsolete titles have been
removed from the service corporation regulations. Further erroneous cross-references have been corrected in (1)
the hearing rules at section 508.13, (2) section 564.4 of the appraisal rule, and (3) the interest rate risk management
procedures at section 563.176. Third, the agency's regulations setting forth procedures to be followed in taking
possession of a savings association that has been placed into conservatorship or receivership have been modified.
Fourth, the authority citation for part 590 is being corrected. Lastly, a codification correction is being made to
the standard conversion regulations, in addition to the proposed amendment to those regulations. 


IV. Regulatory Flexibility Act 


Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 5 U.S.C. 601), it is certified
that this technical regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small savings
associations, small service corporations or other small entities. It merely revises or removes existing inconsistencies
or obsolete regulations. 


V. Executive Order 12866 


The Acting Director has determined that this document is not a ``significant regulatory action'' for purposes of
Executive Order 12866. 


VI. Paperwork Reduction Act 


The recordkeeping requirement contained in this final rule has been submitted to and approved by the Office of Management
and Budget in accordance with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)) under Control No.
1550-0083. The recordkeeping requirement contained in this rule is found at 12 CFR 563.170(c). The likely recordkeepers
will be well- or adequately-capitalized savings associations who received a CAMEL rating of 1, 2 or 3 in their most
recent examinations.

Airworthiness Directives; Boeing Model 747-400 Series Airplanes Equipped With Pratt & 
Whitney PW4000 Series Engines 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to 
certain Boeing Model 747-400 series airplanes, that requires replacement of the thrust 
reverser flow restrictor devices with one-way (check) valve restrictors. This amendment 
is prompted by reports of actuator piston seal leakage found during actuator overhaul on 
certain Model 747-400 series airplanes. The actions specified by this AD are intended to 
prevent possible deployment of a thrust reverser in flight and subsequent reduced 
controllability of the airplane. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal 
Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is 
applicable to certain Boeing Model 747-400 series airplanes was published in the 

Federal 
Register 

on April 22, 1994 (59 FR 19151). That action proposed to require replacement 
of the thrust reverser flow restrictor devices with one-way (check) valve restrictors. 


Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making 
of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received. 
The Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, on behalf of one of its 
members, requests that the proposed rule be revised to cite the latest revision of Boeing 
Alert Service Bulletin 747-78A2128. The FAA concurs. Since the issuance of the 
proposed rule, the FAA has reviewed and approved Revision 1, dated May 26, 1994, of 
the Boeing alert service bulletin. Revision 1 corrects certain discrepancies contained in 
the original issue of the alert service bulletin. The FAA has revised paragraph (a) of the 
final rule to reflect the latest revision to the alert service bulletin as an additional source 
of service information. 
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, 
the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the 
rule with the change previously described. The FAA has determined that this change will 
neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 
There are approximately 94 Model 747-400 series airplanes of the affected design 
in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 32 airplanes of U.S. registry will be 
affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 24 work hours per airplane to 
accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. 
Required parts will be supplied by the manufacturer at no cost to operators. Based on 
these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be 
$42,240, or $1,320 per airplane. 
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no 
operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no 
operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. 
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the 
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule 
does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a 
Federalism Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant 
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under 
DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will 
not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of 
small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has 
been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be 
obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

ACTION:

 Final rule.



 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to 
certain Boeing Model 737-300, -400, and -500 series airplanes, that requires 
modification, adjustments, and tests of the thrust reverser system; and repair, if necessary. 
This amendment is prompted by results of a safety review of the thrust reverser system on 
these airplanes, which revealed that the installation of additional features to further 
minimize the likelihood of an in-flight thrust reverser deployment is necessary. The 
actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent deployment of a thrust reverser in 
flight and subsequent reduced controllability of the airplane. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal 
Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is 
applicable to certain Boeing Model 737-300, -400, and -500 series airplanes was 
published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 15, 1993 (58 FR 53457). That action 
proposed to require modification, adjustments, and tests of the thrust reverser system; and 
repair, if necessary. 





Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making 
of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received. 



One commenter supports the proposed rule. 



One commenter requests that paragraph (c) of the proposal be revised to specify 
that the paragraph applies to airplanes identified in the effectivity listing of Boeing 
Service Bulletin 737-78-1058. The commenter indicates that paragraph (c), as proposed, 
would require modification of airplanes on which the sync-lock was installed in 
production, but on which no additional rework was required. Further, as proposed, 
paragraph (c) would include airplanes that are not listed in the effectivity listing of 
Boeing Service Bulletin 737-78-1058. The FAA concurs, and has revised paragraph (c) 
of the final rule accordingly. However, airplanes on which the sync-lock was installed 
during production continue to be subject to the repetitive integrity test required by 
paragraph (d) of the final rule. Paragraph (d) of the final rule has been revised to clarify 
that requirement, and a new paragraph (e) has been included in the final rule to specify 
the compliance times for accomplishment of that requirement.

The Air Transport Association (ATA) of America states that, while its members 
are not opposed to accomplishing periodic operational tests of the sync-lock following its 
installation [proposed in paragraph (d) of the AD] as part of their maintenance programs, 
these members are opposed to accomplishing the tests as part of the requirements of an 
AD. The ATA members believe that the requirement for operational tests is equivalent to 
issuing a Certification Maintenance Requirements (CMR) item by means of an AD. 



ATA adds that, if the FAA finds sufficient justification to include the requirement 
for operational tests in the AD, an alternative to accomplishment of the tests should be 
provided in the final rule. ATA reasons that an alternative is justified because no data 
exist to show that repetitive tests of a modified thrust reverser cannot be handled 
adequately through an operator's maintenance program. The suggested alternative 
follows: Within 3 months after accomplishing the sync-lock installation, revise the FAA-approved maintenance
inspection program to include an operational test of the sync-lock. 
The initial test would be accomplished within 1,000 hours time-in-service after 
modification. The AD would no longer be applicable for operators that have acceptably 
revised the maintenance program. Operators choosing this alternative could use an 
alternative recordkeeping method in lieu of that required by   91.417 or 121.380 of 
the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) (14 CFR 91.417 or 121.380). The FAA would 
be defined as the cognizant Principal Maintenance Inspector (PMI) for operators electing 
this alternative. 



The FAA recognizes the concerns of the commenter regarding the requirement for 
periodic operational tests of the sync-lock following its installation. However, the FAA 
finds that these tests are necessary to provide an adequate level of safety and to ensure the 
integrity of the sync-lock installation. The actions required by this AD are consistent 
with actions that have been identified by an industry-wide task force as necessary to 
ensure adequate safety of certain thrust reverser systems installed on transport category 
airplanes. Representatives of the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA) of America, 
Inc., and the FAA comprise that task force. Representatives from other organizations, 
such as ATA, have participated in various discussions and work activities resulting from 
the recommendations of the task force. 



The FAA acknowledges that the operational tests specified in this AD and CMR 
items are similar in terms of scheduled maintenance and recordkeeping. This AD 
addresses an unsafe condition and requires installation of the sync-lock to correct that 
unsafe condition. The FAA has determined that the requirement for operational tests is 
necessary to ensure the effectiveness of that installation in addressing the unsafe 
condition. This determination is based on the fact that the sync-lock is a new design 
whose reliability has not been adequately proven through service experience. In addition, 
service experience to date has demonstrated that failures can occur within the sync-lock 
that may not be evident during normal operation of the thrust reverser system and may 
not result in activation of the sync-lock ``unlock'' indicator. The ATA's suggested 
alternative to accomplishment of the operational tests would permit each operator to 
determine whether and how often these tests should be conducted. In light of the severity 
of the unsafe condition, however, the FAA has determined that allowing this degree of 
operator discretion is not appropriate at this time. Therefore, this AD is necessary to 
ensure that operators accomplish tests of the integrity of the sync-lock installation in a 
common manner and at common intervals. 



Two commenters question why the proposed operational tests would be required 
at more frequent intervals following installation of an additional safety feature than prior 
to its installation. One of these commenters suggests that Boeing should prove the 
reliability of the system prior to its operation, and that the operational tests should be 
required at intervals not to exceed 3,000 hours time-in-service.

Several commenters also suggest that the installation of an additional safety 
feature, in addition to the fact that no failures of the system have occurred, should allow 
tests at ``C'' check intervals. Another commenter states that accomplishment of the tests 
at ``2B'' check intervals (or 1,100 hours time-in-service) would be more appropriate. One 
of these commenters states that a trial test period of the installation by several airlines 
would be in order. 

The FAA has reconsidered the compliance time specified in paragraph (d) of the 
proposal [identified in paragraph (e) of the final rule] for accomplishment of an initial 
operational test, as well as the interval specified for accomplishment of repetitive 
operational tests. In light of the safety implications of the unsafe condition addressed and 
the practical aspects of accomplishing orderly operational tests of the fleet during 
regularly scheduled maintenance where special equipment and trained maintenance 
personnel will be readily available, the FAA finds that the compliance times specified in 
paragraph (e) of the AD may be extended without compromising safety. The FAA has 
determined that an interval of 4,000 hours time-in-service corresponds more closely to 
the interval at which most of the affected operators conduct regularly scheduled ``C'' 
checks. Therefore, paragraph (e) of the final rule has been revised to require 
accomplishment of the initial test within 4,000 hours time-in-service and accomplishment 
of repetitive tests at intervals not to exceed 4,000 hours time-in-service. 

One commenter requests that the FAA review the requirement for periodic 
operational tests specified in paragraph (d) of the proposal because these tests only 
address a sync-lock failing in the unlocked state. The commenter states that the sync-lock will be totally transparent
to the flight crew. Therefore, if a sync-lock fails in the 
``locked'' state, the only indication the flight crew will receive is that when reverse thrust 
is applied, the reverser handles will be stopped by the interlock system and not allowed to 
move into reverse thrust. 

The FAA considers that the operational tests required by paragraph (d) of this AD 
are adequate to address both the unlocked state and the locked state. The design of the 
sync-lock is fail-safe in the locked state; its failure in that state during flight would not 
result in deployment of a thrust reverser. In addition, failure of a sync-lock in the locked 
state during landing of the airplane does not present an unsafe condition. The airplane 
can be stopped within the distance specified in the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) 
without the use of thrust reversers. The stopping distance specified in the AFM does not 
take credit for the additional stopping capabilities of the thrust reverser. 

Three commenters request revisions to the compliance times specified in 
paragraph (a) of the proposal for accomplishment of initial and repetitive adjustments and 
tests of the thrust reverser system. One of these commenters requests that the proposed 
30-day compliance time for the initial adjustments and tests be extended to 60 days to 
accomplish these actions on all of the airplanes in its fleet. The commenter believes that 
a compliance time of 60 days is more appropriate in light of the fact that no major thrust 
reverser anomalies have been found. 

Two of these commenters request that the proposed compliance time for 
accomplishment of the repetitive adjustments and tests specified in paragraph (a) of the 
proposal be revised to ``3,000 hours time-in-service, or at each `C' check, whichever 
occurs later.'' One of the commenters believes that the compliance interval specified in 
the proposal is overly restrictive, and that the suggested revision would allow for 
accomplishment of testing and repairs at a time that coincides with regularly scheduled 
maintenance. 

The FAA concurs with these commenters' requests to revise the compliance times 
for the initial and repetitive adjustments and tests required by paragraph (a) of the final 
rule. The FAA's intent was that these adjustments and tests be conducted during a 
regularly scheduled maintenance visit for the majority of the affected fleet, when the 
airplanes would be located at a base where special equipment and trained personnel 
would be readily available, if necessary. In light of this consideration, the FAA has 
determined that an extension of the compliance time for the initial adjustments and tests 
to 60 days, and an extension of the repetitive interval to 4,000 hours time-in-service, will 
not affect safety adversely. Paragraph (a) of the final rule has been revised accordingly. 

Several commenters question the references to certain pages of the Boeing 737 
Maintenance Manual cited in paragraphs (a) and (d) of the proposal. ATA requests that a 
statement be added to those paragraphs to allow operators to use later versions of the 
Maintenance Manual, provided that no substantive change is included in those later 
versions. One commenter points out that since certain Maintenance Manual pages 
referenced in the proposal have already been revised, operators must seek approval from 
the FAA for an alternative method of compliance in order to deviate from the 
Maintenance Manual pages cited in the AD. One commenter mentions that the 
Maintenance Manual page numbers cited in paragraph (d) of the proposal do not exist. 
Two commenters state that the specific Maintenance Manual pages referenced in the 
proposal include a number of tests that are redundant and unnecessary. One commenter 
states that the tests specified in paragraph (a) are normally performed after component 
replacement or after a system error has occurred. The commenter indicates that 
performing the ``Normal Operation Test'' and the ``Auto-Restow Test,'' in addition to 
using the thrust reverser during normal flight operations, will satisfy all testing 
requirements for the thrust reverser. 

Boeing requests specifically that the proposal be revised to include copies of the 
procedures for the required tests so that reference to the Maintenance Manual is not 
necessary. Boeing explains that the Maintenance Manuals are customized for each 
operator to reflect all of the equipment in that operator's fleet. Therefore, the number of 
pages for any given procedure is variable, depending on the number of different 
equipment configurations documented in an operator's Maintenance Manual. Boeing also 
indicates that Maintenance Manual procedures are revised periodically for non-technical 
reasons. Boeing adds that changes to the structure of the procedures are necessary to 
accommodate an upgrade of the publishing system that is currently under way, which, in 
addition to repagination, will necessitate the issuance of revised Maintenance Manual 
pages.

Boeing states that the effect of specifying Maintenance Manual page numbers and 
revision dates in the AD is that operators may be unable to use the procedure contained in 
the Maintenance Manual to perform certain tests required by the AD. Each operator 
would be required to maintain an obsolete version of the procedure, or to request FAA 
approval of an alternative method of compliance with the AD that would allow the use of 
the current version of the Maintenance Manual. 

The FAA concurs partially. In light of the information submitted by the 
commenters, the FAA finds that specific reference to page numbers and dates of the 
Boeing 737 Maintenance Manual should not be specified in paragraph (a) of the final 
rule. However, for that paragraph, the FAA does not agree that copies of the specific 
procedures should be included in the final rule. Therefore, paragraph (a) of the final rule 
has been revised to cite only the appropriate section specified in the Maintenance Manual 
for accomplishment of the tests required by that paragraph. The procedures specified in 
that section of the Maintenance Manual contain the appropriate tests recommended by the 
manufacturer for verification of the proper operation of the thrust reverser system. 
However, the FAA would consider requests from individual operators for approval of use 
of alternative test procedures, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (f) of this 
AD. 

Subsequent to the issuance of the proposal and the receipt of Boeing's comments 
to the proposal, Boeing has submitted to the FAA separate procedures for 
accomplishment of the operational tests of the sync-lock integrity following its 
installation. The FAA has included these procedures in paragraph (d) of the final rule; 
therefore, the Maintenance Manual references specified in paragraph (d) of the proposal 
have been removed from the final rule. 

One commenter requests that the compliance times be expressed in terms of 
cycles, instead of operating hours, since degradation of the thrust reverser system is 
related to cycles. The FAA does not concur. The FAA finds that the simplest expression 
of compliance times for purposes of this AD is in terms of a specific number of hours of 
operation at which compliance is required for affected airplanes. The FAA based this 
determination on the fact that the maintenance program for these airplanes is based on 
operating hours, the Maintenance Manual specifies compliance in terms of operating 
hours, and the maintenance program is based on operating hours. Further, recommended 
compliance intervals reflected in a safety assessment completed for the affected 
airplane/engine combination were expressed in terms of hours time-in-service. 

Two commenters request that the proposed 5-year compliance time for 
accomplishing the sync-lock installation be revised to 6 years to allow airplanes to be 
modified during scheduled heavy maintenance visits. The FAA does not concur with the 
commenters' requests to extend the compliance time. In developing an appropriate 
compliance time for this action, the FAA considered the safety implications, parts 
availability, and normal maintenance schedules for timely accomplishment of the 
modification. In consideration of these items, as well as input from the manufacturer 
with regard to parts availability, and industry representatives with regard to incorporation 
schedules, the FAA has determined that 5 years represents the maximum interval of time 
allowable wherein the modification can reasonably be accomplished and an acceptable 
level of safety can be maintained.

ATA, on behalf of one of its members, requests that paragraphs (a) and (d) of the 
proposal be revised to provide an option for operators to lock out a thrust reverser that 
fails the tests required by those paragraphs in order to avoid unnecessary flight delays and 
cancellations. The commenter states that the Boeing 737 Master Minimum Equipment 
List (MMEL) presently grants this relief, provided that the thrust reverser in question is 
properly locked out. 

The FAA concurs partially. The FAA agrees that an option for dispatch relief 
should be allowed in accordance with the existing provisions and limitations specified in 
the MMEL. Paragraph (a) of the final rule has been revised accordingly. However, for 
airplanes on which a sync-lock is installed, the FAA, in conjunction with the Model 
757/767 Thrust Reverser Working Group, finds that a thrust reverser may be locked out, 
but the sync-lock must be operational at all times in order to ensure safe flight. Paragraph 
(d) of the final rule has been revised accordingly. 

The FAA also has revised paragraph (a) of the final rule to specify that only 
airplanes on which the sync-lock installation, the sync-lock wiring modification, or 
Production Revision Record (PRR) 35105 has not been accomplished are subject to the 
requirements of that paragraph. 

Two commenters suggest that the work hour estimates for accomplishment of the 
adjustments and tests [specified in paragraph (a) of the proposal] and operational tests 
[specified in paragraph (d) of the proposal] be increased. One commenter states that an 
estimate of 2 work hours is more realistic for accomplishment of the adjustments and 
tests. The second commenter states that the operational tests would actually take 
approximately 2.5 work hours. The FAA does not concur. The information provided by 
the manufacturer to the FAA indicates that the adjustments/tests and the operational tests 
each take approximately one hour to accomplish. The FAA established its work hour 
estimate based on that information. 


ATA requests that the FAA coordinate with Boeing a revision to the service 
bulletin to incorporate a change for routing certain wiring, since one ATA member had to 
deviate from the service bulletin instructions to route certain wire bundles. The 
commenter does not specify the service bulletin it recommends be revised. 

The FAA has coordinated with Boeing all requests from operators concerning 
wire bundle routing, and has ensured that any necessary changes to service bulletin 
instructions have been incorporated in subsequent revisions to the service bulletins cited 
in this final rule. A summary of service bulletin revisions reviewed and approved by the 
FAA since the issuance of the proposed rule follows: 


1. Boeing Service Bulletin 737-78-1053, Revision 2, dated February 17, 1994, 
and Revision 3, dated June 30, 1994: Revision 2 of the service bulletin adds notes 
explaining that certain wire bundles were installed in production on some of the affected 
airplanes, that installation of these wire bundles is not necessary for those airplanes, and 
that wire bundle W084 is necessary on only some of the affected airplanes. Certain 
revised drawings also are included in Revision 2, one subkit number is corrected, a list of 
fasteners is added, and procedures for installation of splices is added. 

Revision 3 of the service bulletin provides procedures for replacement of different 
aluminum foil markers on a particular circuit breaker panel on some airplanes. 

Paragraph (b) of the final rule has been revised to reflect Revisions 2 and 3 of this 
service bulletin as additional sources of service information. 

2. Boeing Service Bulletin 737-78-1058, Revision 1, dated February 17, 1994, 
and Revision 2, dated July 7, 1994: Revision 1 of the service bulletin includes a list of 
fasteners and provides procedures for removal of two panels for access to the J20 box 
assembly and related wiring. That revision also provides improved procedures for 
removal of the thrust reverser manual drive units and installation of the sync-locks.

Revision 2 of the service bulletin revises certain test procedures for the thrust 
reverser system. 

Paragraph (c) of the final rule has been revised to reflect Revisions 1 and 2 of this 
service bulletin as additional sources of service information. 

The FAA has revised the applicability of the final rule to clarify its intent that the 
AD applies to Model 737-300, -400, and -500 series airplanes equipped with CFM 
International CFM56-3 series engines. The applicability of the proposed rule stated 
incorrectly that Model 737-300, -400, and -500 series airplanes equipped with General 
Electric CFM56 series engines were affected by this AD. 

After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, 
the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the 
rule with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined that these changes 
will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the 
AD. 

It should be noted that no evidence currently exists that in-flight deployment of a 
thrust reverser was responsible for the accident involving a Boeing Model 737-300 series 
airplane that occurred on September 8, 1994. 

There are approximately 1,079 Model 737 series airplanes of the affected design 
in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 531 airplanes of U.S. registry will be 
required to accomplish adjustments and tests of the thrust reverser system, installation of 
the sync-lock, and operational tests of the sync-lock installation. The FAA estimates that 
it will take approximately 1 work hour per airplane to accomplish the required 
adjustments and tests, 198 work hours to accomplish the required installation, and 1 work 
hour to accomplish the required operational tests. The average labor rate is $55 per work 
hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators of 
airplanes on which the sync-lock feature was not installed during production or as a 
modification is estimated to be $5,841,000, or $11,000 per airplane. 

The FAA estimates that 8 airplanes of U.S. registry will be required to accomplish 
adjustments and tests of the thrust reverser, modification of the sync-lock wiring, and 
operational tests of the sync-lock installation. The FAA estimates that it will take 
approximately 1 work hour to accomplish the required adjustments and tests, 70 work 
hours to accomplish the required wiring modification, and 1 work hour to accomplish the 
required operational tests. The average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these 
figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators of airplanes on which the sync-lock feature was installed
during production or as a modification is estimated to be 
$31,680, or $3,960 per airplane. 

Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is 
estimated to be $5,872,680. 

The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no 
operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no 
operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. 

The FAA recognizes the large number of work hours required to accomplish the 
modification. The 5-year compliance time specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this AD 
should allow the sync-lock installation and wiring modification to be accomplished 
coincidentally with scheduled major airplane inspection and maintenance activities, 
thereby minimizing the costs associated with special airplane scheduling. 

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the 
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule 
does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a 
Federalism Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant 
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under 
DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will 
not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of 
small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has 
been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be

Airworthiness Directives; Consolidated Aeronautics Lake 
Model 250 Airplanes Equipped With a Bendix/King KFC 150 
Automatic Flight Control System 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; request for comments.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness 
directive (AD) that applies to Consolidated Aeronautics 
Lake Model 250 airplanes equipped with a Bendix/King 
KFC 150 automatic flight control system. This action 
requires pulling the ``A/P'' and ``TRIM'' circuit breakers, 
and fabricating and installing a placard that specifies 
the use of manual trim only. An incident where the 
elevator trim spring lever of a Lake Model 250 airplane 
failed to return to neutral following KFC 150 automatic 
flight control system autotrim operation prompted this 
action. The resulting mistrim overpowered the 
autopilot and caused the airplane to deviate from its 
flight path. The actions specified by this AD are 
intended to prevent automatic flight control system 
malfunctions caused by failure of the elevator autotrim 
to disengage, which could result in flight path 
deviations. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The FAA has received a 
report where the Bendix/King KFC 150 automatic flight 
control system malfunctioned because the elevator trim 
spring lever on a Consolidated Aeronautics Lake Model 
250 airplane failed to return to neutral following KFC 
150 automatic flight control system autotrim operation. 
This resulted in the airplane deviating from its flight 
path. 
 

This KFC 150 automatic flight control system 
incorporates a mechanical attachment to the basic 
airplane's trim system; the basic airplane in turn has 
a pilot-actuated spring-loaded lever that controls a 
hydraulic actuator. During the original type 
certification efforts of the KFC 150 automatic flight 
control system, a modification was incorporated that 
prevents the engage solenoid for the elevator autotrim 
servo from remaining occasionally engaged because of an 
opposing forced created by the spring. The 
modification provided a design where the spring would 
back-drive the servo motor, relieve the spring tension, 
and allow the solenoid to disengage; the solenoid 
engages once autotrim begins to run, and disengages 
when autotrim stops running. 
 In the referenced incident, the spring lever of 
the airplane failed to return to neutral and the pitch 
trim continued to run while the KFC 150 automatic 
flight control system was on autopilot with autotrim 
operation. The resulting mistrim overpowered the 
autopilot and caused the airplane to deviate from the 
flight path. The pilot recognized the problem, 
disengaged the autopilot, and took control of the 
airplane. Initial investigation of the incident 
reveals that the elevator autotrim servo did not 
disengage because of the loads imposed by the basic 
airplane's spring lever. 
 While testing and additional investigation 
continues in developing a modification to solve this 
problem, the FAA has determined that, in the interim, 
this Bendix/King KFC 150 automatic flight control 
system should not be utilized on Consolidated 
Aeronautics Lake Model 250 airplanes. 
 After examining the circumstances and reviewing 
all available information related to the incidents 
described above, the FAA has determined that AD action 
should be taken in order to prevent automatic flight 
control system malfunctions caused by failure of the 
elevator autotrim to disengage, which could result in 
flight path deviations. 
 Since an unsafe condition has been identified that 
is likely to exist or develop in other Consolidated 
Aeronautics Lake Model 250 airplanes of the same type 
design that are equipped with a Bendix/King KFC 150 
automatic flight control system, this AD requires 
pulling the ``A/P'' and ``TRIM'' circuit breakers, and 
fabricating and installing a placard that specifies the 
use of manual trim only.

Since a situation exists that requires the 
immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that 
notice and opportunity for public prior comment hereon 
are impracticable, and that good cause exists for 
making this amendment effective in less than 30 days. 


Comments Invited 
 

Although this action is in the form of a final 
rule that involves requirements affecting immediate 
flight safety and, thus, was not preceded by notice and 
opportunity to comment, comments are invited on this 
rule. Interested persons are invited to comment on 
this rule by submitting such written data, views, or 
arguments as they may desire. Communications should 
identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in 
triplicate to the address specified above. All 
communications received on or before the closing date 
for comments will be considered, and this rule may be 
amended in light of the comments received. Factual 
information that supports the commenter's ideas and 
suggestions is extremely helpful in evaluating the 
effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether 
additional rulemaking action would be needed. 
 Comments are specifically invited on the overall 
regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects 
of the rule that might suggest a need to modify the 
rule. All comments submitted will be available, both 
before and after the closing date for comments, in the 
Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A 
report that summarizes each FAA-public contact 
concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed 
in the Rules Docket. 
 Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt 
of their comments submitted in response to this notice 
must submit a 
self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following 
statement is made: ``Comments to Docket No. 94-CE-21-AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and
returned to 
the commenter. 
 The regulations adopted herein will not have 
substantial direct effects on the States, on the 
relationship between the national government and the 
States, or on the distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various levels of 
government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive 
Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does 
not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant 
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
 The FAA has determined that this regulation is an 
emergency regulation and that must be issued 
immediately to correct an unsafe condition in aircraft, 
and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under 
Executive Order 12866. It has been determined further 
that this action involves an emergency regulation under 
DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, 
February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this 
emergency regulation otherwise would be significant 
under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final 
regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in 
the Rules Docket (otherwise, an evaluation is not 
required). A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained 
from the Rules Docket.

Airworthiness Directives; General Electric Company CF6-80C2 Series Turbofan Engines 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to General Electric Company (GE) CF6-80C2
series turbofan engines, that requires a repetitive oil quantity check after engine start-up but prior to taxi, and
installation of a flame arrestor plug support (FAPS) in the aft end of the center vent tube as a terminating action to
the repetitive oil quantity checks. This amendment is prompted by three reports of uncontained engine failure due
to separation of the fan mid shaft. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent an uncontained engine failure
and inflight engine shutdown due to fuel contamination of the oil system.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive
(AD) that is applicable to General Electric Company (GE) CF6-80C2 series turbofan engines was published in
the 

Federal Register

 on May 2, 1994 (59 FR 22565). That action proposed to require a repetitive oil quantity check after engine start-up
but prior to taxi, and installation of a flame arrestor plug support (FAPS) in the aft end of the center vent tube (CVT)
as a terminating action to the repetitive oil quantity checks. The installation would be accomplished in accordance
with GE CF6-80C2 Service Bulletin (SB) No. 72-648, Revision 1, dated January 11, 1993, and GE CF6-80C2
SB No. 72-095, Revision 2, dated January 11, 1993. 


Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received. 
One commenter supports the rule as proposed. 
One commenter (the engine manufacturer) states that in the Summary and Discussion sections the word ``and'' should
be replaced with ``but'' to read ``* * * require a repetitive oil quantity check after engine start
up but prior to taxi.'' The commenter adds that the word ``and'' may cause some confusion and lead an operator to believe
there may be two checks. The FAA concurs and has revised this final rule accordingly. 
The commenter further states that in the Discussion section and paragraphs (a) and (b) of the compliance section the
phrase ``* * * if the oil quantity indicates 5 gallons (20 quarts) or more'' should be changed to ``* * *
if the oil quantity indicates 5.5 gallons or more on Boeing 747-200/300 aircraft or 22 units or more on all other
applications.'' The commenter notes that this change would avoid unnecessary maintenance action. Operator feedback
shows that there were too many aircraft making unnecessary trips back to the gate. The additional margin of 0.5 gallons
and 2 units was established because there was no contamination when the previous limit of 5 gallons (20 quarts) was
exceeded. Both quarts and liters are used by different operators, and in this situation the difference between quarts
and liters is negligible. The FAA concurs and has revised this final rule accordingly. 
The commenter further states that in paragraph (d) of the compliance section the clause ``* * * replace
the fan mid shaft assembly, the mid fan duct assembly'' should be changed to ``* * * replace the small
diameter mid fan duct assembly (CVT).'' The commenter notes that GE CF6-80C2 SB No. 72-095, Revision 2,
dated January 11, 1993, introduces into production a new fan mid shaft assembly, mid fan duct assembly (CVT), No. 6
bearing plug, preformed packing, and new retaining ring. That SB also provides accomplishment instructions to remove
the small diameter CVT and replace it with a larger diameter CVT that will accommodate the flame arrestor. The SB does
not require replacement of the fan mid shaft. The FAA concurs and has revised this final rule accordingly. 
The commenter further states that 14 center vent tube extension hardware kits have been provided to the fleet. Installation
of the CVT extension in accordance with GE CF6-80C2 Service Evaluation Bulletin (SEB) No. 72-628, dated
July 15, 1993, should be an acceptable means of compliance for this AD. The FAA concurs and has revised this final rule
accordingly by adding a new paragraph (f).

One commenter states that the oil quantity to initiate inspection action should be 22 quarts instead of 20. The commenter
notes that operating experience on Boeing aircraft led to a revision in the Boeing Operations Bulletin to use the 22
quart figure. The FAA concurs in part. This final rule has been revised to refer to 22 units rather than quarts, as described
in a previous response. 
The economic analysis in the proposed rule included all 1,570 engines in the fleet. The manufacturer has advised the
FAA that this number is overly conservative and that there are only approximately 300 engines installed on aircraft
of U.S. registry. Out of the 300 engines, an estimated 96% have accomplished the requirements of this AD. The economic
analysis of this final rule has been revised accordingly. 
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes described previously. The FAA has determined
that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 
The FAA estimates that 300 engines installed on aircraft of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take
approximately 8 work hours per engine to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per
work hour. Required parts will cost approximately $2,316 per engine. Out of the 300 engines, the manufacturer has
advised the FAA that 96% of the fleet have accomplished the requirements of this AD. Based on these figures, the total
cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $33,072. 
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under
the caption

Airworthiness Directives; Jetstream Model 4101 Airplanes




<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.

 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule. 






 
</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to 
certain Jetstream Model 4101 airplanes, that requires installation of a placard near the 
decouple control handle for the elevator control system to ensure that the pilots are made 
aware that maintenance action is required to reset the disconnect unit once the decouple 
control handle has been pulled. This amendment is prompted by a report that, if the 
decouple control handle for the elevator control system is pulled, the lock linkage will 
remain unlocked until it is reset during maintenance. The actions specified by this AD 
are intended to prevent reduced controllability of the airplane due to loss of the 
mechanical linkage between the pilots' elevator controls, and each pilot having control 
authority over only one-half of the elevator control system.




 </SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal 
Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is 
applicable to certain Jetstream Model 4101 airplanes was published in the 

Federal 
Register

 on May 18, 1994 (59 FR 25843). That action proposed to require installation of 
a placard on the left forward trim panel of the center console in line with the decouple 
control handle of the elevator to ensure that the pilots are made aware that maintenance 
action is required to reset the disconnect unit once the decouple control handle has been 
pulled.





Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making 
of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the single comment received.



The commenter supports the proposed rule.



After careful review of the available data, including the comment noted above, the 
FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule 
as proposed.



The FAA estimates that 8 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, 
that it will take approximately 1 work hour per airplane to accomplish the required 
actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the 
total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $440, or $55 per airplane.

The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted. 
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under
the caption

Airworthiness Directives; Pacific Scientific Company, HTL/KIN-TECH Division, Lap 
Belt Assemblies and Restraint Systems 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to 
certain Pacific Scientific lap belt assemblies and restraint systems, that requires removal 
of certain lap belt assemblies and restraint systems, and replacement with a differently 
designed assembly. This amendment is prompted by a report indicating that, subsequent 
to an accident involving a transport category airplane, some passengers experienced 
difficulty in attempting to release the buckle on their lap belts. The actions specified by 
this AD are intended to prevent the inability of passengers or crew to egress from their 
seats during an emergency situation, due to problems associated with the lap belt 
assembly. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal 
Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is 
applicable to certain Pacific Scientific lap belt assemblies and restraint systems was 
published in the 

Federal Register

 on May 31, 1994 (59 FR 28031). That action 
proposed to require the removal of certain lap belt assemblies and restraint systems, and 
replacement with another design assembly. 


Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making 
of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received. 
Two commenters support the proposal. 
One commenter supports the intent of the proposal, but suggests that it should 
have been issued as an immediately adopted rule, without prior notice and time for public 
comment. The commenter considers that the subject lap belts pose a serious and 
immediate threat to passengers and crew who could encounter difficulties in releasing the 
belts during an emergency situation. The FAA does not concur with the commenter's 
suggestion. In developing this rule and its associated compliance time, the FAA 
considered not only the degree of urgency associated with addressing the subject unsafe 
condition, but the availability of necessary parts and the practical aspect of accomplishing 
the required actions during normal maintenance schedules. Additionally, the FAA 
considered the fact there has been no adverse service history within the last two years 
related to the 27,000 subject belts currently in service. In light of all of these items, the 
FAA could not find that it was impracticable to provide for prior notice and time for 
public comment on the rule. 
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, 
the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the 
rule as proposed. 
There are approximately 27,002 lap belts of the affected design installed in 
aircraft and rotorcraft worldwide. The FAA estimates that, of this number, approximately 
10,000 are to be installed on U.S. registered aircraft and rotorcraft. It will take 
approximately .5 work hour per lap belt to accomplish the required actions, at an average 
labor rate of $55 per work hour. Required parts will be supplied by Pacific Scientific 
Company at no cost to operators. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of this AD 
on U.S. operators is estimated to be $275,000, or $27.50 per lap belt. 
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no 
operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no 
operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. 
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the 
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule 
does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant 
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under 
DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will 
not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of 
small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has 
been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be 
obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

Removal of the Prohibition Against Certain Flights Between the United States and Haiti



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule; removal.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This action removes Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) 69, which prohibits the takeoff from, landing in,
or overflight of the territory of the United States by an aircraft on a flight to or from the territory of Haiti, and which
further prohibits the landing in, takeoff from, or overflight of the territory of the United States by any aircraft
on a flight from or to any intermediate destination, if the flight's origin or ultimate destination is Haiti. This
action is taken in response to UN Security Council Resolution 944 (1994) directing, 

inter alia, 

the termination of the sanctions mandated in U.N. Security Council Resolution 917 (1994), and to the Executive Order
issued by the President on October 14, 1994, cancelling sanctions mandated in Executive Order 12914 (May 7, 1994).




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On May 18, 1994, the FAA published at 59 FR 25809 a final rule prohibiting certain aircraft operations between the United
States and Haiti. SFAR 69 was issued in response to Executive Order 12914 (May 7, 1994) and UN Security Council Resolution
917 (May 6, 1994) mandating, 

inter alia, 

an embargo of most air traffic with Haiti. SFAR 69 prohibits the takeoff from, landing in, or overflight of the territory
of the United States by an aircraft on a flight to or from the territory of Haiti. SFAR 69 also prohibits the landing in,
takeoff from, or overflight of territory of the United States by any aircraft of a flight from or to any intermediate
destination, if the flight's origin or ultimate destination is Haiti. The terms of SFAR 69 provide for exceptions
for regularly scheduled foreign air carrier passenger flights and for particular flights approved by the United
States Government.




On September 19, 1994, U.S. military forces entered Haiti in accordance with September 18, 1994, agreement between
the United States and the 

de facto 

government of Haiti. The September 18 agreement further required the leaders of the 

de facto 

government of Haiti to relinquish power and provided for the lifting of the economic embargo and sanctions imposed
in accordance with applicable Security Council Resolutions, including Security Council Resolution 917. Thereafter,
the UN Security Council decided in Resolution 944 to terminate the sanctions imposed under Security Council Resolution
917 at 12:01 am on the day after the return to Haiti of President Aristide. In an Executive Order issued on October 14,
1994, the President cancelled sanctions mandated in Executive Order 12914, including the prohibition on certain
aircraft operations between the United States and Haiti imposed under SFAR 69.

Continuation of Stay of Enforcement of Standards for the 
Flammability of Children's Sleepwear, Sizes 0 Through 6X 
and 7 Through 14 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Consumer Product Safety Commission.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Continuation of stay of enforcement.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice announces the staff's decision to extend the stay of enforcement of sleepwear requirements against (1)
garments currently being used as sleepwear that are labeled and marketed as underwear if these garments are skin-tight
or nearly skin-tight and (2) garments that are essentially identical in design, material, and fit to such ``underwear''
garments.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Elsewhere in this issue of the 

Federal Register

, the Commission is issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking (``NPR'') concerning the possible amendment of the Commission's

flammability standards for children's sleepwear in sizes 0 through 6X and 7 through 14. The current flammability
standard for children's sleepwear in sizes 0 through 6X is codified at 16 CFR Part 1615 and the standard for children's
sleepwear in sizes 7 through 14 is codified at 16 CFR Part 1616. 



On January 13, 1993, the Commission issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking concerning the possible amendment
of its flammability standards for children's sleepwear. 58 FR 4111. On that same date, the staff also issued a stay
of enforcement of the sleepwear requirements against certain garments. 58 FR 4078. That stay went into effect when
it was published on January 13, 1993. The staff is extending the stay of enforcement as previously issued while the
Commission considers the proposed amendment. 

As stated in the NPR which is published elsewhere in this issue of the 

Federal Register

, the staff has noted that many garments currently in the marketplace and labeled as ``playwear'' or ``underwear''
are suitable for use as sleepwear and are being used as sleepwear in a substantial number of cases. Pending Commission
consideration of amendments to the sleepwear standards, the Compliance staff is extending its stay of enforcement
against the following garments. The staff will continue not to enforce the sleepwear requirements against garments
currently being used as sleepwear that are labeled and marketed as underwear if those garments are relatively free
of ornamentation and are skin-tight or nearly skin tight. Such garments may be either one or two piece garments and
typically are manufactured of a fabric such as rib knit, interlock knit, or waffle knit. The stay also continues to
cover garments that are essentially identical in design, material, and fit to such ``underwear'' garments. Examples
of the types of garments covered by the stay are illustrated on pages 4 and 6 of the Supplemental CPSC Staff Guide to the
Enforcement Policy Statements of the Flammability Standard for Children's Sleepwear (1989). 

Although the staff continues to stay enforcement against these garments under its sleepwear standards, these garments
must comply with the Standard for the Flammability of Clothing Textiles, 16 CFR part 1610.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; confirmation of effective date.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is confirming the effective date of September 12, 1994, of the final rule that
appeared in the 

Federal Register

 of August 10, 1994 (59 FR 40802), that amended the color additive regulations to provide for the use of D&C Green
No. 5 for coloring drugs and cosmetics intended for use in the area of the eye.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

 In the 

Federal Register

 of August 10, 1994 (59 FR 40802), FDA amended 21 CFR 74.1205 and 74.2205 to provide for the use of D&C Green No. 5 for
coloring drugs and cosmetics intended for use in the area of the eye. 


FDA gave interested persons until September 9, 1994, to file written objections or requests for a hearing. The agency
received no objections or requests for a hearing on the final rule. Therefore, FDA has concluded that the effective
date of the final rule published in the 

Federal Register

 of August 10, 1994, should be confirmed.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Ohio submitted its Rule 3745-35-07, entitled ``federally Enforceable Limitations on Potential to Emit,''
for Federal approval. The rule would establish a mechanism for creating federally enforceable limitations that
would reduce sources' potential to emit such that sources could avoid major source permitting requirements. This
rulemaking conditionally approves this rule as satisfying the requirements, set forth in the 

Federal Register

 of June 28, 1989, and authorizes Ohio to issue federally enforceable State operating permits addressing both criteria
pollutants (regulated under section 110 of the Clean Air Act) and hazardous air pollutants (regulated under section
112). 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


I. Review of State Submittal


For many years, Ohio has been issuing permits for major new sources and for major modifications of existing sources.
Throughout this time, Ohio has also been issuing permits establishing limitations on the potential emissions from
new sources so as to avoid major source permitting requirements. This latter type of permitting has been the subject
of various guidance from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), most notably the memorandum
entitled ``Guidance on Limiting Potential to Emit in New Source Permitting'' dated June 13, 1989.
The operating permit provisions in title V of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 have created interest in mechanisms
for limiting sources' potential to emit, thereby allowing the sources to avoid being defined as ``major'' with respect
to title V operating permit programs. A key mechanism for such limitations is the use of federally enforceable State
operating permits (FESOPs). USEPA issued guidance on FESOPs in the 

Federal Register

 of June 28, 1989 (54 FR 27274). On April 20, 1994, Ohio submitted its newly adopted Rule 3745-35-07 to provide
for FESOPs in Ohio. This rule would supplement the pre-existing mechanisms for establishing federally enforceable
limitations on potential to emit (i.e., State rules, administrative orders, and in some cases new source permits).
This rulemaking evaluates whether Ohio has satisfied the requirements for this type of federally enforceable limitations
on potential to emit. 
As specified in the 

Federal Register

 of June 28, 1989, the first requirement for approval of a FESOP program is that the State must have approved operating
permit regulations. Rule 3745-35-07 supplements other rules in Ohio Chapter 3745-35 rules, collectively
entitled ``Air Permits to Operate and Variances.'' These other rules were approved on June 10, 1982 (at 47 FR 25144),
and today's rulemaking approves Rule 3745-35-07. 
The second requirement is that sources have a legal obligation to comply with permit terms, and that USEPA may deem
as ``not federally enforceable'' those permits which it finds fail to satisfy applicable requirements. Rule 3745-35-02
requires sources to obtain permits to operate, authorizes Ohio to establish terms and conditions in these permits
``to ensure compliance with [applicable requirements],'' and authorizes the State to suspend or revoke permits
if the source violates the terms or conditions. Thus, this rule imposes a legal obligation on sources to comply with
permit terms.
An associated issue is whether Ohio's rules authorize USEPA to deem selected permits ``not federally enforceable.''
Rule 3745-35-07 provides explicitly that Ohio may not issue a FESOP if USEPA objects during the public
comment period. Language inadvertently included in the adopted rule could be interpreted not to allow USEPA to object
to a permit's enforceability after permit issuance. However, this interpretation does not reflect State intent,
and USEPA instead interprets Rule 3745-35-07 to deem permits not federally enforceable after as well
as before issuance. Nevertheless, on June 16, 1994, Ohio submitted a commitment to revise its regulation to include
the language it had intended to adopt, which would remove the potential for the above misinterpretation. This commitment
serves to support a conditional approval of the rule. 
While it is Ohio's intent that USEPA be authorized to deem permits not federally enforceable after permit issuance,
Ohio also requested that USEPA make these determinations during Ohio's public comment period (prior to permit issuance)
whenever possible. Although USEPA is authorized to deem permit conditions not federally enforceable at any later
date, USEPA will strive to determine Federal enforceability during Ohio's public comment period.
The third requirement for FESOPs is that the program require all limits to be at least as stringent as other applicable
federally enforceable provisions. Rule 3745-35-02(D) provides for terms and conditions in permits
``as are necessary to ensure compliance with applicable [air pollution requirements].'' These rules contain no
provisions authorizing terms and conditions any less stringent than the applicable requirements.
The fourth requirement is that the permit provisions must be permanent, quantifiable, and otherwise enforceable
as a practical matter. Permit ``permanence'' does not mean never providing for a modification, reissuance, or revocation,
for these elements are fundamental in all air permit programs. Permanence instead is considered in terms of provisions
having continuing mandates, i.e. that USEPA has assurance that the provisions are in effect through the life of the
permit and that any reissued permit will continue the provisions in effect. In this case, the limitations on potential
to emit will generally be sought by sources so as to be redefined from ``major'' to ``minor'' for permitting purposes.
USEPA is assured that sources that obtain such limitations will keep these limitations in effect, so as never to be
a ``major'' source violating the requirement for a ``major'' source permit. The requirement for permit provisions
to be quantifiable and practically enforceable must be met on a permit-by-permit basis. Ohio's rules do provide in
general for the issuance of enforceable permits. Thus, Ohio's rules provide for legally enforceable permits that
USEPA may evaluate for practical enforceability.
The fifth requirement is that the permits be subject to public notice and review. Rule 3745-35-07 (B)(2)
provides that permits intended to establish federally enforceable limitations on potential to emit may not be issued
without first providing opportunity for public comment, ``with concurrent notice and opportunity for comment given
to [USEPA].'' 
The USEPA technical support document discusses a possible misinterpretation of Rule 3754-35-07 relating
to emissions trading. The rule provides that federally enforceable limitations on potential to emit may be established
through permits to install, permits to operate (i.e. FESOPs), or State rules or administrative orders, and provides
for sources to request provisions allowing emissions trading in any of these vehicles for emissions limitations.
USEPA identified the potential argument that this rule authorizes sources to require the State to adopt rules to provide
trading on a broad scale. However, upon reconsideration, USEPA finds this interpretation implausible, and concludes
that neither Ohio's statute nor this rule would dictate that a source could require the State to adopt such rules. 
Ohio has requested that USEPA authorize federally enforceable limitations on potential to emit both pollutants
regulated under section 110 of the Act (``criteria pollutants'') and pollutants regulated under section 112 (``hazardous
air pollutants'' or ``HAPs''). As discussed above, the June 28, 1989 

Federal Register

 notice provided five specific criteria for approval of State operating permit programs for the purpose of establishing
federally enforceable limits on a source's potential to emit. This notice, because it was written prior to the 1990
amendments, addressed only SIP programs to control criteria pollutants. Federally enforceable limits on criteria
pollutants (especially volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and particulate matter) may have the incidental effect
of limiting certain HAPs listed pursuant to section 112(b). This situation would occur when a pollutant classified
as a HAP is also classified as a criteria pollutant (e.g., benzene).

1

 As a legal matter, no additional program approval by USEPA is required in order for these criteria pollutant limits
to be recognized for this purpose.





USEPA has determined that the five approval criteria for approving FESOP programs into the SIP, as specified in the
June 28, 1989, 

Federal Register

 notice, are also appropriate for evaluating and approving the programs under section 112(l). The June 28, 1989, notice
does not address HAPs because it was written prior to the 1990 amendments to section 112 and not because it establishes
requirements unique to criteria pollutants. Hence, the five criteria discussed above are applicable to FESOP approvals
under section 112(l) as well as under section 110. 
In addition to meeting the criteria in the June 28, 1989, notice, a FESOP program for HAPs must meet the statutory criteria
for approval under section 112(l)(5). This section allows USEPA to approve a program only if it: (1) Contains adequate
authority to assure compliance with any section 112 standards or requirements; (2) provides for adequate resources;
(3) provides for an expeditious schedule for assuring compliance with section 112 requirements; and (4) is otherwise
likely to satisfy the objectives of the Act. 
USEPA plans to codify the approval criteria for programs limiting potential to emit HAPs in subpart E of part 63, the
regulations promulgated to implement section 112(l) of the Act. USEPA currently anticipates that these criteria,
as they apply to FESOP programs, will mirror those set forth in the June 28, 1989, notice, with the addition that the
State's authority must extend to HAPs instead of, or in addition to, VOCs and particulate matter. USEPA currently
anticipates that FESOP programs that are approved pursuant to section 112(l) prior to the subpart E revisions will
have had to meet these criteria, and hence, will not be subject to any further approval action.
USEPA believes it has authority under section 112(l) to approve programs to limit potential to emit HAPs directly
under section 112(l) prior to this revision to subpart E. Section 112(l)(5) requires USEPA to disapprove programs
that are inconsistent with guidance required to be issued under section 112(l)(2). This might be read to suggest that
the ``guidance'' referred to in section 112(l)(2) was intended to be a binding rule. Even under this interpretation,
USEPA does not believe that section 112(l) requires this rulemaking to be comprehensive. That is, it need not address
all instances of approval under section 112(l). USEPA has already issued regulations under section 112(l) that would
satisfy this requirement. Given the severe timing problems posed by impending deadlines under section 112 and title
V, USEPA believes it is reasonable to read section 112(l) to allow for approval of programs to limit potential to emit
prior to issuance of a rule specifically addressing this issue. 
Ohio's satisfaction of the criteria published in the 

Federal Register

 of June 28, 1989, has been discussed above. In addition, Ohio's FESOP program meets the statutory criteria for approval
under section 112(l)(5). USEPA believes that Ohio has adequate authority to assure compliance with section 112 requirements
since the third criteria of the June 28, 1989, notice is met, that is, since the program does not provide for waiving
any section 112 requirement. Nonmajor sources would still be required to meet applicable section 112 requirements.

Regarding adequate resources, Ohio has included in its request for approval under section 112(l) a commitment to
provide adequate resources to implement and enforce the program, which will be obtained from fees collected under
title V. USEPA believes that this mechanism will be sufficient to provide for adequate resources to implement this
program, and will monitor the State's implementation of the program to assure that adequate resources continue to
be available. 
Ohio's FESOP program also meets the requirement for an expeditious schedule for assuring compliance. A source seeking
a voluntary limit on potential to emit is probably doing so to avoid a Federal requirement applicable on a particular
date. Nothing in this program would allow a source to avoid or delay compliance with the Federal requirement if it fails
to obtain the appropriate federally enforceable limit by the relevant deadline. Finally, Ohio's FESOP program is
consistent with the objectives of the section 112 program since its purpose is to enable sources to obtain federally
enforceable limits on potential to emit to avoid major source classification under section 112. USEPA believes this
purpose is consistent with the overall intent of section 112. Accordingly, USEPA finds that Ohio's program satisfies
applicable criteria for establishing federally enforceable limitations on potential to emit both criteria and
hazardous air pollutants. 


II. Rulemaking Action


USEPA finds that the criteria for Ohio to be able to issue FESOPs are essentially met, and is today approving Rule 3745-35-07.
This approval is conditioned on fulfillment of Ohio's commitment to revise its rule to clarify USEPA's authority
to deem permits unenforceable after issuance. This conditional approval authorizes Ohio to establish federally
enforceable limitations on potential to emit both criteria pollutants and hazardous air pollutants. 
USEPA evaluated whether to defer Ohio's authority to issue FESOPs pending adoption and USEPA approval of Ohio's intended
rule clarification. Although Ohio's rule inadvertently included language that could be read to imply otherwise,
USEPA believes it has adequate assurances of its authority to make post-issuance determinations that State-issued
permits are not federally enforceable. First, USEPA interprets Ohio's rule to provide this authority now. Second,
this authority will be further clarified in the near future. USEPA believes that Ohio will revise its rule shortly
to clarify this authority for individual permits, possibly even before any FESOP permits are issued; but if Ohio fails
to make the expected rule revisions, today's conditional approval will revert to a disapproval, and all ``FESOP''
permit conditions will no longer be federally enforceable. 
If Ohio fulfills its commitment, this conditional approval would be converted to full approval and the FESOP permitting
authority continued. If Ohio fails to satisfy its commitment within one year of today, the conditional approval will
convert to a disapproval and Ohio's authority to issue federally enforceable limitations on potential to emit will
be rescinded. In either alternative, USEPA's authority to deem permits not federally enforceable both before and
after permit issuance will be further clarified. Consequently, this rulemaking authorizes Ohio to issue FESOPs
commencing immediately upon the effective date of this rule, which will be December 27, 1994, unless in the meantime
USEPA defers or rescinds the effective date at a commenter's request. 
This action is being taken without prior proposal because the changes are believed to be noncontroversial and USEPA
anticipates no significant comments on them. This action will be effective December 27, 1994, unless notice is received
by November 25, 1994, that someone wishes to submit adverse or critical comments. If the effective date is delayed,
timely notice will be published in the 

Federal Register

. 
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting, allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. USEPA shall consider each request for revision to the SIP in light of specific technical, economic,
and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.
This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The OMB has exempted this regulatory action from Executive Order
12866 review. 
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small
entities. (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604.) Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact
on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises,
and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The CAA forbids USEPA to base
its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

 v. 

USEPA

, 427 U.S. 246, 256-66 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2).
Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by December 27, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by
the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor
does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section
307(b)(2).)

 Direct final rule.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The EPA is approving the State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of South Dakota for the purpose
of establishing a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program
(PROGRAM). The implementation plan was submitted by the State to satisfy the Federal mandate, found in section 507
of the Clean Air Act (CAA), to ensure that small businesses have access to the technical assistance and regulatory
information necessary to comply with the CAA. The rationale for the approval is set forth in this notice; additional
information is available at the address indicated below. 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


I. Background


Implementation of the provisions of the Clean Air Act (CAA), as amended in 1990, will require regulation of many small
businesses so that areas may attain and maintain the National ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) and reduce the
emission of air toxics. Small businesses frequently lack the technical expertise and financial resources necessary
to evaluate such regulations and to determine the appropriate mechanisms for compliance. In anticipation of the
impact of these requirements on small businesses, the CAA requires that states adopt a Small Business Stationary
Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program (PROGRAM), and submit this PROGRAM as a revision
to the federally approved SIP. In addition, the CAA directs the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to oversee
these small business assistance programs and report to Congress on their implementation. The requirements for establishing
a PROGRAM are set out in section 507 of title V of the CAA. In February 1992, EPA issued 

Guidelines for the Implementation of Section 507 of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments

, in order to delineate the Federal and state roles in meeting the new statutory provisions and as a tool to provide further
guidance to the states on submitting acceptable SIP revisions.
The State of South Dakota has submitted a SIP revision to EPA in order to satisfy the requirements of section 507. In
order to gain full approval, the State submittal must provide for each of the following PROGRAM elements: (1) The establishment
of a Small Business Assistance Program (SBAP) to provide technical and compliance assistance to small businesses;
(2) the establishment of a State Small Business Ombudsman to represent the interests of small businesses in the regulatory
process; and (3) the creation of a Compliance Advisory Panel (CAP) to determine and report on the overall effectiveness
of the SBAP.
The EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial action
and anticipates no adverse comments. However, in a separate document in this 

Federal Register

 publication, the EPA is proposing approval of the South Dakota PROGRAM should adverse or critical comments be filed.
Under the procedures established in the May 10, 1994 

Federal Register

, this action will be effective on December 27, 1994, unless by November 25, 1994, adverse or critical comments are
received.
If the EPA receives such comments, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing a subsequent
document that will withdraw the final action. All public comments received will then be addressed in a subsequent
final rule based on this action serving as a proposed rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period. Any parties
interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. If no such comments are received, the public is advised
that this action will be effective on December 27, 1994.


II. Analysis


The State of South Dakota has met all of the requirements of section 507 by submitting a SIP revision that implements
all required PROGRAM elements. The South Dakota Codified Laws (SDCL) was amended effective July 1, 1992 to include
provisions (34A-1-57 through 34A-1-60, inclusive) which provide the authority to establish
and fund the PROGRAM. The authority to establish and fund the Compliance Advisory Panel is found in SDCL 1-32-4.1
through 1-32-4.4, inclusive. The South Dakota Department of Environment and Natural Resources held
a public hearing on November 6, 1992 to consider amending the South Dakota SIP to include a plan which commits to the
development and implementation of the South Dakota PROGRAM. On November 10, 1992, the Governor of South Dakota's
designee, Robert E. Roberts, Secretary of the Department of Natural Resources, submitted the South Dakota PROGRAM
to the EPA. Additional information was sent by request on January 20 and March 23, 1993. The PROGRAM was initially reviewed
for administrative and technical completeness and was deemed complete on April 5, 1993. The submittal was then reviewed
for approveability by EPA Region VIII and EPA headquarters. One of the EPA headquarters reviewers, the Office of the
Small Business and Asbestos Ombudsman, did not concur on the South Dakota PROGRAM for the following reasons: (1) The
State failed to correct deficiencies noted by EPA in their review of the proposed South Dakota PROGRAM; (2) Further
clarification and assurances are necessary to insure that the State will implement all the statutory requirements
under section 507. The State subsequently made the necessary changes to their PROGRAM, went back through public hearing
on January 12, 1994, and resubmitted the PROGRAM on April 11, 1994. The South Dakota PROGRAM then received a concurrence
from all reviewers. 


1. Small Business Assistance Program


Section 507(a) sets forth six requirements

1

 that the State must meet to have an approvable SBAP. The first requirement is to establish adequate mechanisms for
developing, collecting and coordinating information concerning compliance methods and technologies for small
business stationary sources, and programs to encourage lawful cooperation among such sources and other persons
to further compliance with the Act. The second requirement is to establish adequate mechanisms for assisting small
business stationary sources with pollution prevention and accidental release detection and prevention, including
providing information concerning alternative technologies, process changes, products and methods of operation
that help reduce air pollution. The State has met these requirements by committing in its SIP to ``Develop, collect,
and coordinate information concerning compliance methods and technologies for small businesses ...'' and to ``Assist
small businesses with pollution prevention and accidental release detection and prevention.'' The mechanisms
the State has committed to use to accomplish these commitments include: ``... workshops, electronic bulletin boards,
interaction with other states, ... public service announcements, mailings, workshops in the field and through the
Rural Development Telecommunications Network (RDTN), one-on-one with the small businesses, and any other methods
that are determined during the development and implementation of the Program.'' 





The third requirement is to develop a compliance and technical assistance program for small business stationary
sources which assists small businesses in determining applicable requirements and in receiving permits under the
Act in a timely and efficient manner. The State has met this requirement by committing in its SIP to ``Provide compliance
assistance to small businesses to help them determine applicable requirements and in receiving permits in a timely
and efficient manner.''
The fourth and fifth requirements are to develop adequate mechanisms to assure that small business stationary sources
receive notice of their rights and obligations under the Act, including mechanisms for referring such sources to
qualified auditors or, at the option of the State, for providing audits of the operations of such sources to determine
compliance with the Act. This must be done in such manner and form as to assure reasonably adequate time for such sources
to evaluate compliance methods and any relevant or applicable proposed or final regulation or standards issued under
the Act. The State has met these requirements by committing in its SIP to ``Notify small businesses of their rights
under the Federal Clean Air Act and assure reasonably adequate time for such sources to evaluate compliance methods
and any relevant or applicable proposed or final regulation or standard issued under the Federal Clean Air Act;''
and ``Inform small businesses of their obligations under the Federal Clean Air Act. If the state does not provide audits
of the operations of such sources to determine compliance with state and Federal air pollution regulations, then
the state will refer such sources to qualified auditors.'' The mechanisms the State has committed to use to accomplish
these commitments include: ``... workshops, electronic bulletin boards, interaction with other states, ... public
service announcements, mailings, workshops in the field and through the Rural Development Telecommunications
Network (RDTN), one-on-one with the small businesses, and any other methods that are determined during the development
and implementation of the Program.''
The sixth requirement is to develop procedures for consideration of requests from a small business stationary source
for modification of: (A) Any work practice or technological method of compliance; or (B) the schedule of milestones
for implementing such work practice or method of compliance preceding any applicable compliance date, based on the
technological and financial capability of any such small business stationary source. The State has met this requirement
by committing in its SIP to ``Provide procedures for considering requests from small businesses for modifications
of any work practice or technological methods of compliance or the schedule of milestones for implementing these
modifications. No such modification may be granted unless it is in compliance with the applicable state and Federal
requirements.'' 


2. Ombudsman


Section 507(a)(3) requires the designation of a State office to serve as the Ombudsman for small business stationary
sources. The State has met this requirement by stating in its SIP that the Office of the Small Business Ombudsman will
be located in the Department of Environment and Natural Resources. 


3. Compliance Advisory Panel


Section 507(e) requires the State to establish a Compliance Advisory Panel (CAP) that must include two members selected
by the Governor who are not owners or representatives of owners of small businesses; four members selected by the State
legislature who are owners, or represent owners, of small businesses; and one member selected by the head of the agency
in charge of the Air Pollution Permit Program. The State has met this requirement by committing in its SIP to appoint
the members of the CAP as stated above.
In addition to establishing the minimum membership of the CAP the CAA delineates four responsibilities of the Panel:
(1) To render advisory opinions concerning the effectiveness of the SBAP, difficulties encountered and the degree
and severity of enforcement actions; (2) to periodically report to EPA concerning the SBAP's adherence to the principles
of the Paperwork Reduction Act, the Equal Access to Justice Act, and the Regulatory Flexibility Act

2

; (3) to review and assure that information for small business stationary sources is easily understandable; and (4)
to develop and disseminate the reports and advisory opinions made through the SBAP. The State has met this requirements
by listing the duties of the CAP in its SIP, which are consistent with those stated above.





4. Eligibility


Section 507(c)(1) of the CAA defines the term ``small business stationary source'' as a stationary source that:



(A) Is owned or operated by a person who employs 100 or fewer individuals; 
(B) Is a small business concern as defined in the Small Business Act; 
(C) Is not a major stationary source; 
(D) Does not emit 50 tons per year (tpy) or more of any regulated pollutant; and 
(E) Emits less than 75 tpy of all regulated pollutants.

 

The State of South Dakota has established a mechanism for ascertaining the eligibility of a source to receive assistance
under the PROGRAM, including an evaluation of a source's eligibility using the criteria in section 507(c)(1) of the
CAA. This mechanism is contained in the State's SIP.
The State of South Dakota has provided for public notice and comment on grants of eligibility to sources that do not
meet the provisions of sections 507(c)(1)(C), (D), and (E) of the CAA but do not emit more than 100 tpy of all regulated
pollutants. This provision is contained in the State's SIP. 
The State of South Dakota has provided for exclusion from the small business stationary source definition, after
consultation with the EPA and the Small Business Administration Administrator and after providing notice and opportunity
for public comment, of any category or subcategory of sources that the State determines to have sufficient technical
and financial capabilities to meet the requirements of the CAA. This provision in contained in the State's SIP.


III. This Action 


In today's action, EPA is approving the SIP revision submitted by the State of South Dakota.
The State of South Dakota has submitted a SIP revision implementing each of the required PROGRAM elements required
by section 507 of the CAA. The members of the South Dakota CAP have been appointed, and the Ombudsman for the South Dakota
PROGRAM has been hired. EPA is therefore approving this submittal.
This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables.
On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions from the requirements
of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for 2 years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and
Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the temporary waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request.
This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September
30, 1993. 
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
By today's action, EPA is approving a State program created for the purpose of assisting small businesses in complying
with existing statutory and regulatory requirements. The program being approved today does not impose any new regulatory
burden on small businesses; it is a program under which small businesses may elect to take advantage of assistance
provided by the State. Therefore, because the EPA's approval of this program does not impose any new regulatory requirements
on small businesses, I certify that it does not have a significant economic impact on any small entities affected.

National Flood Insurance Program; Insurance Coverage and Rates, Criteria for Land Management, Use, Identification,
and Mapping of Flood Control Restoration Zones 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Insurance Administration, FEMA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This interim final rule establishes a new flood insurance rate zone for areas designated as flood control restoration
zones on National Flood Insurance Program maps. It also establishes minimum floodplain management requirements
and provides regulatory guidance for implementing statutory requirements, including procedures to identify and
map areas as flood control restoration zones. 


The intent of the interim final rule is to permit communities to regulate development through minimum floodplain
management requirements and to use flood insurance rates appropriate to the temporary nature of flood hazards during
the period when a flood protection system no longer provides 100-year flood protection until it is restored.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On April 1, 1994, FEMA published for comment in the 

Federal Register

, 59 FR 15351, a proposed rule. The proposed rule contained provisions that would establish a new flood insurance rate
zone, Zone AR, for areas designated as flood control restoration zones on National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)
maps. It would also establish minimum floodplain management requirements and would provide regulatory guidance
for implementing statutory requirements of  928 of Public Law 102-550, 42 USC 4014(f), including procedures
to identify and map areas as flood control restoration zones. Public Law 102-550 also requires FEMA to promulgate
regulations no later than October 28, 1994. 


Following publication of the proposed rule in the 

Federal Register

, copies were mailed to approximately 60 individuals and organizations that had previously expressed an interest
in the issues that the rule addresses. In addition, copies of the proposed rule were sent to communities in the Los Angeles
and Sacramento areas of California that had applied for designation as having flood control restoration zones and
were sent to the Congressional delegations representing those areas. 
During the 45-day public comment period provided for the proposed rule, FEMA received a total of twelve letters. All
but one of the letters contained multiple comments about different issues addressed in the proposed rule. Two letters
were submitted by members of the U. S. House of Representatives who represent areas of Sacramento and Los Angeles,
California. One of the letters, submitted by three sponsors of the legislation, was received after the close of the
formal comment period, but the issues raised are addressed in the supplementary language to these final regulations.
Other letters were submitted by representatives of seven local government agencies, legal representatives of two
local property owners associations, and one private citizen. In addition, comments received from the U. S. Army Corps
of Engineers immediately after the close of the formal comment period have been considered as well. 
With one exception, the letters received were from those who support the concept of the flood control restoration
zone. One letter urged FEMA to include a requirement in the regulations that prohibits the restoration from causing
an increase in flood hazards elsewhere. All letters were submitted from the Los Angeles and Sacramento, California
areas, including three Congressional representatives of those areas.

Major issues raised in the public comments included the maximum five year restoration period, the provision requiring
new construction in developed areas to be elevated to three feet above the highest adjacent grade, the absence of a
``hold harmless'' provision for delays in meeting the restoration schedule, and the definition of ``developed''
areas. Several comments suggested that the proposed regulations pertaining to these provisions be rewritten based
on concern that the regulations do not comply with Congressional intent as reflected in the legislative history.


Changes have been made since the proposed rules were published in April 1994. We decided that because of the changes,
and because of the technical nature of the issues that these regulations address, the public and all affected parties
should have another opportunity to review and comment on the rule before FEMA publishes a final rule. This interim
final rule will permit FEMA to meet the statutorily mandated date of October 28, 1994 for promulgation of regulations,
and it will give the public and all affected parties 45 days in which to review and comment on the interim final rule.
When the 45-day comment period ends, FEMA will review and evaluate all written comments received during that period,
and will publish a final rule in the 

Federal Register

. 



Definition of Developed Area 



Several comments were received on the definition of ``developed area''. One comment requested clarification on
whether open space is to be included within the definition of ``developed area''. A related comment requested that
the definition be expanded to include existing publicly-owned property that is critical to the well-being of the
community. FEMA recognizes that there may be some confusion over whether publicly-owned open space is included within
the definition of ``developed area''. These areas are meant to be included in the definition of ``developed area''
since they generally support the residential, commercial, and industrial well-being of the community. The term
``public facilities'' in paragraph (a) encompasses publicly-owned open space, buildings, and facilities, such
as schools, hospitals, public parks and open space, and historic sites. FEMA believes that it is unnecessary to alter
the regulations to clarify this point. 

One comment expressed concern that the 75% figure in the definition in which an area must be improved with residential,
industrial, and commercial structures is an arbitrary threshold. FEMA believes that the 75% figure in paragraph
(a)(1) is a reasonable threshold for determining a ``developed area'' which is considered or is generally recognized
as a city, town, or suburban area that consists of residential, commercial, and industrial buildings, structures,
and streetscape and public areas that form a distinct neighborhood or section of a city or urban place with the basic
urban infrastructure in place. 

A related comment concerned areas within a city in which there are vacant lots and parcels. Vacant land that contains
no structures or buildings may be included within a ``developed area'' if the land had been previously developed and
redevelopment of the site can be generally supported by the infrastructure in place. This vacant land is considered
``infill''. Land that is in a natural or undisturbed state or in agricultural production at the time the designation
is adopted is not considered ``vacant'' land or an ``infill site'' within a ``developed area''. 

One comment requested that non-residential subdivisions be given the same consideration as residential subdivisions
at 44 CFR 59.1(c) of the definition which addresses ``vested rights''. The intent of this paragraph is to recognize
areas as ``developed areas'' where the investment in the land and infrastructure is substantial and development
is underway and infrastructure and structures are being built on an ongoing basis. FEMA agrees that the interim final
rule should recognize and include nonresidential structures and has made changes to paragraph (c) to include nonresidential
subdivisions. In addition, FEMA includes single lot-type developments, such as planned unit developments, that
are a minimum of 20 contiguous acres. 

Concerns were raised that the proposed rule precludes all development in areas outside of the ``developed area''.
The suggestion was made that the regulations allow nonresidential construction in these areas because of the importance
of economic development to the community and because many local communities currently impose adopted floodproofing
criteria in order to minimize flood damage. The suggestion was also made that the regulations should restrict residential
construction in areas outside of the ``developed area''. 

The interim final rule does not preclude development in areas outside of the ``developed area''. The term, ``developed
area'' is a means to determine which elevation or floodproofing requirement must be applied for new construction
within Zone AR. The definition also does not classify or establish the location of residential and non-residential
construction or other land uses. The establishment of regulations governing the use of land is a decision that resides
within the state and local land use authority. Nonresidential and residential construction can be built in areas
outside of the ``developed area'' as long as they are built in accordance with the minimum NFIP floodplain management
criteria and at the elevation established at the site. While the NFIP floodplain management criteria require the
elevation of residential structures, nonresidential construction has the option of elevating or floodproofing.
Criteria for floodproofing are established in the NFIP Regulations that the NFIP community must apply, at a minimum,
if this option is chosen.

Another comment asked FEMA how the boundaries of an area will be determined to classify it as a ``developed area''.
The responsibility for designating and adopting an official map or legal description of those areas within Zones
AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AH, AR/A, or AR/AO that are designated ``developed areas'' is established in the floodplain
management criteria for flood-prone areas at 
 60.3(f)(2) and the eligibility procedures at  65.14. In accordance with these sections, it is the community's
responsibility to submit, as part of the community's application for designation of flood control restoration zones,
its proposed designation of ``developed areas'' in accordance with the definition at  59.1 to FEMA for approval.
FEMA must determine that the community designations are consistent with the definition of ``developed area'' at
 59.1. The community may use whatever method it deems appropriate to determine whether a particular parcel,
tract, or lot, or subdivision is within a ``developed area'' as defined in  59.1 or outside of a ``developed area''.
However, FEMA encourages communities to coordinate with the FEMA Regional Offices on designation of ``developed
areas'' before the community adopts an official map or legal description of ``developed areas'' within the designated
flood control restoration zone. 



Five Year Maximum Restoration Period 



The majority of the letters received objected to the maximum five year restoration period contained in the proposed
rule as being inadequate. The proposed rule limits the duration of a flood control restoration zone designation to
a maximum five year period by providing that for a community to be eligible for and to maintain such a designation, the
flood protection system must be fully restored or must have achieved ``adequate progress'' as defined in NFIP regulations
at Section 61.12 within a period not to exceed five years. Comments specifically cited experience with the ongoing
restoration of flood protection systems for both Los Angeles and Sacramento, California, which have already been
in progress for more than five years without achieving ``adequate progress''. Most comments favored a ten-year restoration
period for AR Zone designation as being a more reasonable time frame for restoring a flood protection system, particularly
because the restoration involves Federal funding. Comments also cited that the statute's legislative history supported
a ten year period for restoration. 

When establishing a time limit for the restoration of 100-year protection, FEMA recognizes the need to assess what
would be necessary to provide a reasonable time frame for restoring a flood protection system involving Federal funds
or for achieving ``adequate progress'' to satisfy the criteria in  61.12. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers submitted
comments on the proposed rule that stated that a five-year time frame may not be adequate to ensure that satisfactory
progress is made on the project restoration to meet the adequate progress requirements of  61.12 of existing
NFIP regulations. Those comments went on to indicate that ten years may be a more realistic expectation for projects
that require Congressional authorization and appropriation of funds. 

The regulations apply specifically to communities where the existing flood protection system is a Federal project
and the restoration involves Federal funds. Because the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is the Federal agency most frequently
involved in design and construction of Federal flood protection systems, FEMA believes that it is appropriate to
give considerable weight to the guidance they have provided with respect to establishing a limit on the restoration
period. Therefore, the interim final rule provides a maximum ten-year restoration period, rather than the five years
contained in the proposed regulations. This revision is cited at the appropriate locations in  65.14 of the
interim final rule.

Comments were received that expressed the opinion that Congress intended that the restoration period be negotiated
on a community-by-community basis and implied that Congress did not intend for a specific cap or limit to be applied
to the length of the restoration period. 

We respond to this latter comment by stating that, according to the statute, a community is to be considered to be in
the process of restoration as long as the restoration of the flood protection system ``* * * is scheduled
to occur within a designated time period * * *''. The term, ``designated time period'' indicates the
establishment of a specific, or definite period of time for restoration in order to confer AR Zone eligibility upon
a community. Therefore, we believe that the proposed rule is consistent with the statute by specifying a maximum time
frame for restoring the flood protection system that can be uniformly applied to eligible communities. 

Within that maximum time frame, the regulations anticipate that the community and FEMA will negotiate a specific
restoration plan for a given flood protection system that will be based on the individual requirements for restoring
that system. The plan must identify when the project will be completed or when the community will submit a request for
a finding of adequate progress that satisfies the requirements of  61.12. These dates will be dependent upon
the project which may not require the full ten-year maximum restoration period provided by these regulations. 



``Hold Harmless'' Provision for Delays in Complying With Restoration Schedule 



Several comments objected to the absence of a ``hold harmless'' provision in the regulations to address delays in
meeting the restoration schedule for any reason. It was felt that the lack of such a provision essentially holds the
community responsible for actions that may be beyond its control. For example, the community may not be the local project
sponsor of the restoration project and, as a result, may have limited influence as to whether the project's local and
federal sponsors meet the restoration schedule agreed upon by the community and FEMA as part of the community's application
for AR Zone designations. In addition, several comments cited that potential delays in Congressional authorization
and appropriation of funds could affect a community's ability to comply with the restoration schedule, as could disasters
and acts of nature, such as earthquakes or other natural hazards. These comments cite the legislative history as supporting
the position that the regulations provide maximum flexibility for the community to meet the restoration schedule.

<PARENT> FR941025-0-00018 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In addition, one comment suggested that  65.14(g) of the proposed regulations recognized the potential for
such delays in that it requires the community and the Federal sponsor to update the restoration plan and identify any
``* * * problems that will delay the project completion from the restoration plan previously submitted
* * *''. The provisions in  64.14(g) provide for relatively minor modifications to the scheduled
restoration plan, including modifying the time frames negotiated under an existing restoration plan. However,
it does not imply that the maximum restoration period provided for in the regulations can be exceeded as a result of
any modification. 

It is our position that the regulations should not include ``hold harmless'' provisions or provisions to extend,
for any reason, the AR Zone designation beyond the maximum ten-year restoration period specified in the regulations.
Central to this position is FEMA's belief that the flood control restoration zone is not a long-term or permanent flood
insurance zone designation. A provision to extend the AR Zone designation or the inclusion of a ``hold harmless''
provision would, in FEMA's opinion, be contrary to the statute. 



Delineation of ``Dual'' Zones 




Two comments expressed the concern that the ``dual'' zone provision contained in the proposed regulations is confusing
and should be eliminated if it does not benefit property owners. This provision is specifically intended to benefit
current and future owners of structures located in areas that, because of flooding from other sources that the flood
protection system does not contain, will continue to be subject to flooding after the flood protection system is completely
restored. The provision is retained in these regulations. 



Limitations on AR Zone Designation 



Comments were raised concerning the requirement in  64.14(b) of the proposed rule, which states that ``a community
may have a flood control restoration zone designation only once for the purposes of restoring a given flood protection
system''. The requirement does not limit a community's future eligibility for the AR Zone designation in the event
that a fully restored, certified and accredited flood protection system were to be decertified again. The provision
prevents a community from seeking a second flood control restoration zone designation if the initial designation
has been removed due to noncompliance with the restoration schedule or due to a finding that satisfactory progress
is not being made to complete the restoration. FEMA believes that it is unnecessary to alter the regulations to clarify
this point. 



Application and Submittal Requirements 



Several comments were made pertaining to the application and submittal requirements contained in 
 65.14(e) of the proposed regulations. 

One comment suggested that the regulations be revised to state that the local project sponsor, not the community applicant
be responsible for submitting the documentation requirements at  65.14(e) (1), (3), (5), (6), and (7). 

We believe that it is appropriate that the community be responsible for submitting documentation referenced above.
In doing so, the community does not assume financial or administrative responsibility for restoration of the flood
protection system. For certain submittal requirements, such as the restoration plan referenced at  65.14(e)(7),
the community would be expected to work with the local and federal project sponsors to complete this requirement.
Other requirements, such as a statement required of the community to accompany the Federal agency certification
required at  65.14(e)(3), would be to assure FEMA that the community is aware of the certification being made
by the Federal agency, but it does not imply any specific technical input or expertise on the part of the community.


One comment suggested that the documentation required in  65.14(e) include a statement that the flood protection
system under restoration will not increase flood hazards in surrounding areas. Such a provision relates directly
to the design requirements for constructing a restoration project that is not within the scope of the statute or these
regulations. It is appropriate that concerns about induced flooding be addressed by the local and Federal sponsors
of the restoration project. Therefore, such a provision has not been included in these regulations.

One comment objected to the requirement in 
 65.14(e)(1) that the community submit, as part of its application for designation of AR Zones, a statement
whether the flood protection system is the subject of pending litigation or administrative actions. FEMA believes
that the information is pertinent to FEMA's determination whether the restoration project is viable and likely to
be completed in accordance with the restoration plan required in  65.14(e)(7). An affirmative response would
not necessarily result in FEMA's denial of the community's application. It is imperative that FEMA be aware of any
and all existing and potential obstacles to the timely restoration of a flood protection system so that the Director
can accurately evaluate a community's application for designation of AR Zones. 
Comments were raised regarding the application requirement in  65.14(e)(5) that the community applicant
submit a feasibility study performed by a Federal agency that deems that the flood protection system is restorable.
Several comments observed that the term ``feasibility study'' as used by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is a specific
document within the framework of the project planning process, and depending on the type of restoration project,
a feasibility study may not always be performed. Other comments were concerned about the length of time that may be
required to prepare a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers feasibility study and the associated delay in the community's eligibility
for AR Zone designation. At least one comment suggested that for projects sponsored by the 
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, a ``reconnaissance'' level study would provide the assurances that FEMA requires by
demonstrating a Federal interest in the project that would restore a minimum 100-year level protection and which
would identify a local sponsor for the restoration project. 
The interim final rule has been revised to delete the reference to ``feasibility study'' at  65.14(e)(5) and
instead to refer to a study performed by a federal agency that would demonstrate that there is a federal interest in
the restoration of the system and that it is deemed to be feasible to restore the system to provide at least 100-year
protection. 
One comment suggested that the application requirement to submit a feasibility study would delay the community's
eligibility for AR Zone designation which would be contrary to legislative intent. This comment implies that community
eligibility for an AR Zone designation should follow immediately after the decertification of the existing flood
protection system. 
The eligibility requirements contained in the statute refer to a level of activity that would not likely be in place
as soon as the system was decertified. Therefore, FEMA anticipates that communities would be mapped as special flood
hazard areas with flood elevations (AE Zones), until such time as the progress on the restoration of the flood protection
system reached a point that would meet the eligibility requirements for AR Zone designation. This process is similar
to the process used to designate A99 Zones under provisions in the NFIP regulations at 44 CFR 61.12. 
Several comments objected to the certification requirement in  65.14(e)(6) that the design and construction
of the restoration project involve Federal funds in order for the community to be eligible for AR Zone designation.
One specific comment noted that the statute does not specify a Federal flood protection system. As stated in the supplementary
information of the proposed rule, the existing FEMA regulations, 44 CFR 61.12, limit A99 Zone designation to communities
that have made adequate progress on the construction of a flood protection system involving Federal funds. Requiring
that the restoration project involve Federal funds is consistent with the existing regulatory provisions of  61.12.

Furthermore, the statute provided for floodplain management provisions that permit development in flood control
restoration zones to take place at elevations below the base flood elevation (BFE) that would apply in the absence
of a flood protection system. Not only will new structures be exposed to increased flood risk until the flood protection
system is fully restored, but those same new structures can be insured at less than actuarial rates. The insurance
subsidy established in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) was originally intended for the benefit of those
who built without knowledge of the risk. In contrast, the subsidy for AR Zone designations is extended to those who
are aware, or ought to be aware, of the increased risk. This special consideration is granted on the specific assumption
that the increased risk is temporary and will be mitigated in the near term. Therefore, in extending the subsidy in
the AR Zones, there has to be a high degree of assurance that the restoration project will be completed.

FEMA recognizes that there are local jurisdictions that may have the resources to build and to restore flood protection
systems without Federal financial support. On the other hand, the subsidy and the less restrictive flood plain management
criteria could reduce a community's incentive to press for timely completion of its restoration project. FEMA cannot
compel the completion of a restoration project. Without Federal participation in a restoration project, the Federal
government cannot insure that the anticipated flood protection will be achieved within the time allowed by the rule.
FEMA concludes that a lack of Federal involvement in the restoration process would introduce too great an uncertainty
that the restoration projects will be completed in a timely manner. 
The public policy concern is that, if restoration of the flood protection system is never completed, or is completed
only after a lengthy delay, the owners and occupants of structures built during the restoration period at elevations
below the actual 100-year flood level will permanently be at a greater risk of flooding than they would otherwise have
been, and this regulation would have contributed directly to that greater risk. This is contrary to the basic purpose
of the NFIP. (See 42 USC  4001(c)). Therefore, the interim final rule retains the requirement that a Federal
agency be involved in the funding of the restoration in order to establish an essential assurance that the restoration
will be completed. 
One comment requested that the regulations at 
 65.14(e)(8) allow changes to the community's adopted map or legal description that designates the ``developed
areas'' to accommodate minor errors and omissions. FEMA recognizes that errors or omissions may occur in the drafting
of a map or legal description of the designated ``developed areas'' that the community then officially adopts. In
such cases, FEMA would allow the community to submit a revised map or legal description that identifies the error or
omission. Communities would be required to submit evidence to FEMA that the specific land areas to be designated as
``developed areas'' satisfy the requirements of the definition of ``developed areas'' at the time the initial designation
was adopted. Communities would not be allowed to modify the map or legal description to redesignate ``developed areas''
at their discretion while the flood control restoration zone designation remains in effect. 
One comment suggested that the regulations provide for reconsideration when the Director determines that a community
is ineligible for a flood control restoration zone designation under the provisions contained in the proposed rule
at  65.14(f). The interim final rule provides for processing a community's application according to procedures
specified in existing NFIP regulations at 44 CFR 65.9. FEMA believes that these procedures are adequate. Furthermore,
there is no prohibition against resubmitting an application for AR Zone designation. 
Another comment suggested that the procedures cited in the proposed regulations at  65.14(i) for removing
the flood control restoration zone designation provide for a prior written notice to the community and an opportunity
to remedy the situation. 
FEMA agrees that the community should be given prior written notice of the Director's determination and an opportunity
to submit information to support retaining the AR designation. The interim final rule at  65.14(i) was revised
accordingly. However, the time frame specified in the restoration plan shall not exceed the ten year maximum restoration
period. In addition, the interim final rule states that the revision of the Flood Insurance Rate Map to remove the flood
control restoration zone designation will be accomplished in accordance with the existing regulations at 44 CFR
Part 67. Finally, the term ``procedures'' has been substituted for the term ``criteria'' in the description of  65.14
(h) and (i) since this term better describes the content of these sections.

Floodplain Management and Land Use Requirements in a Flood Control Restoration Zone 


There were several comments concerning the elevation requirements in the proposed rule. One comment suggested that
the local community should be the responsible entity for determining which structures should be elevated and also
for determining the level at which these structures should be elevated. There were several comments requesting that
FEMA apply the two-foot elevation that was supported in the legislative history instead of the three-foot requirement
as established in the proposed rule for ``developed areas''. Two comments requested that structures be allowed to
be constructed at grade in deep flood areas because elevating to three feet will not significantly reduce flood damages.
Concern was also expressed that the elevation requirement was unreasonable because of the costs associated with
the three foot elevation requirement and that this elevation would not aesthetically fit in with existing structures
not built at this elevation. 
Congress, under Section 928 of Public Law 102-550, 42 U.S.C. 4014(f), directed FEMA to ``develop and promulgate
regulations to implement this subsection, including minimum floodplain management criteria, within 24 months
after the date of enactment of this subsection''. The law is specific in stipulating that the NFIP minimum elevation
requirements for new construction in impacted areas subject to flood depths less than five feet and for infill, redevelopment
and rehabilitation, regardless of flood depth, could not exceed three feet. 
FEMA believes the law is clear in establishing the floodplain management criteria in a flood control restoration
zone. FEMA also believes that it is in the best interest of the NFIP to require structures to be elevated to the lower
of either the AR BFE or the three-foot elevation permitted by the statute because of the increased flood risk to which
properties will be exposed during the restoration period. Furthermore, the three-foot elevation of structures
would afford additional protection from flood events that may exceed the capacity of the decertified flood protection
system, which at a minimum must provide at least a 35-year level of protection in order to be eligible for a flood control
restoration zone. The floodplain management criteria established for a flood control restoration zone also recognize
that there is a chance that the project will not be restored. Consequently, the elevation requirement of three feet
limits the exposure to the National Flood Insurance Fund if the project is not restored. 
The floodplain management criteria established are the minimum standards for the adoption of floodplain management
regulations within those areas designated as a flood control restoration zone (Zone AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AH,
AR/AO, or AR/A). Any community may exceed the minimum standards by adopting more restrictive requirements. 
Those seeking variances would use procedures that communities have established to deal with hardship and other unusual
conditions. Communities administer the variances according to 44 CFR 60.6(a). We emphasize that while variances
may reduce floodplain management requirements, they do not reduce flood insurance rates. By law, flood insurance
rates must be charged commensurate with the risk to which a building is exposed. Any person seeking a variance to reduce
floodplain management requirements should investigate the impact of the variance on the cost of flood insurance.

Furthermore, the widely accepted protection techniques available for new construction of residential structures
and non-residential structures provide practical and affordable alternatives that can be designed to be compatible
with existing construction in a flood control restoration zone. For non-residential construction, the NFIP provides
the option of elevation or floodproofing to resist the effects of flooding. Rather than specify an elevation or floodproofing
method, the regulations give the property owner or builder the flexibility to choose the most appropriate technique.
Similarly, there are several common, affordable methods of elevating residential structures, including elevation
on earth fill, foundation walls, posts, piles, and piers. In some cases, it may be advantageous to use a combination
of elevation methods.

One comment requested that the regulations clarify the use of the term ``highest adjacent grade'' compared to the
term ``existing grade'' that is used in the statute. The term ``highest adjacent grade'' is used in the interim final
rule at paragraph 60.3(f)(3)(i). This paragraph establishes the elevation that must be used for applying the floodplain
management requirements in areas within Zone AR designated as a ``developed area'' for new construction and in other
areas in Zone AR where the AR flood depth is five feet or less. In these areas, the requirement is to apply the lower of
either the AR base flood elevation or the elevation that is three feet above highest adjacent grade. FEMA used the term
``highest adjacent grade'' since it is already defined in the regulations. ``Highest adjacent grade'' in the NFIP
regulations is defined as ``the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the
proposed walls of a structure''. The definition in the regulations provides guidance on the reference point from
which to measure the elevation of three feet when a proposed site is sloped. Also, by applying a single reference point,
communities can consistently apply the elevation requirements to structures. Therefore, FEMA does not believe
the term ``highest adjacent grade'' is inconsistent with the Act. 


National Environmental Policy Act 


FEMA has determined, based upon an environmental assessment, that this interim final rule will not have a significant
impact upon the quality of the human environment. As a result, an Environmental Impact Statement will not be prepared.
A finding of no significant impact is included in the formal docket file and is available for public inspection and
copying at the Rules Docket Clerk, Office of the General Counsel, Federal Emergency Management Agency, 500 C Street,
SW., Washington, DC 20472. 


Regulatory Flexibility Act 


The Director certifies that this interim final rule is exempt from the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility
Act because the proposed flood control restoration zone is required by statute, 42 U.S.C. 4014(f), and is required
to enhance and maintain community eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program during the period needed to
restore flood protection systems to provide a minimum 100-year level of protection required for accreditation on
National Flood Insurance Program maps. A regulatory flexibility analysis has not been prepared. 


Paperwork Reduction Act 


This interim final rule contains collections of information as described the Paperwork Reduction Act that are covered
by the following OMB Control Numbers: 3067-0020; 3067-0022; 3067-0127; and 3067-0147. 


Executive Order 12612, Federalism


This interim final rule involves no policies that have federalism implications under Executive Order 12612, Federalism,
dated October 26, 1987. 


Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform


This interim final rule meets the applicable standards of section 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778. 


Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review 


Promulgation of this interim final rule is required by statute, 42 U.S.C. 4014(f), which also specifies the regulatory
approach taken in the proposed rule. To the extent possible under the statutory requirements of 42 U.S.C. 4014(f),
this proposed rule adheres to the principles of regulation as set forth in Executive Order 12866.

Suspension of community eligibility. 


(a) A community eligible for the sale of flood insurance shall be subject to suspension from the Program for failing
to submit copies of adequate floodplain management regulations meeting the minimum requirements of paragraphs
(b), (c), (d), (e) or (f) of  60.3 or paragraph (b) of  60.4 or  60.5, within six months from the date
the Director provides the data upon which the flood plain regulations for the applicable paragraph shall be based.
Where there has not been any submission by the community, the Director shall notify the community that 90 days remain
in the six month period in order to submit adequate flood plain management regulations. Where there has been an inadequate
submission, the Director shall notify the community of the specific deficiencies in its submitted flood plain management
regulations and inform the community of the amount of time remaining within the six month period. If, subsequently,
copies of adequate flood plain management regulations are not received by the Director, he shall, no later than 30
days before the expiration of the original six month period, provide written notice to the community and to the state
and assure publication in the 

Federal Register

 under part 64 of this subchapter, of the community's loss of eligibility for the sale of flood insurance, such suspension
to become effective upon the expiration of the six month period. Should the community remedy the defect and the Director
receive copies of adequate flood plain management regulations within the notice period, the suspension notice shall
be rescinded by the Director. If the Director receives notice from the State that it has enacted adequate flood plain
management regulations for the community within the notice period, the suspension notice shall be rescinded by the
Director. The community's eligibility shall remain terminated after suspension until copies of adequate flood
plain management regulations have been received and approved by the Director.

 [Redesignated as  65.15] 



10. Part 65 is amended by redesignating  65.14 as 
 65.15. 

11. Part 65 is amended by adding a new  65.14 to read as follows: 



 65.14

Remapping of areas for which local flood protection systems no longer provide 100-year flood protection. 



(a) 

General

. (1) This section describes the procedures to follow and the types of information FEMA requires to designate flood
control restoration zones. A community may be eligible to apply for this zone designation if the Director determines
that it is engaged in the process of restoring a flood protection system that was: 

(i) Constructed using Federal funds; 

(ii) Recognized as providing 100-year flood protection on the community's effective Flood Insurance Rate Map; and


(iii) Decertified by a Federal agency responsible for flood protection design or construction. 

(2) Where the Director determines that a community is in the process of restoring its flood protection system to provide
100-year minimum flood protection, a Flood Insurance Rate Map will be prepared that designates the temporary flood
hazard areas as a flood control restoration zone (Zone AR). Existing Special Flood Hazard Areas shown on the community's
effective Flood Insurance Rate Map that are further inundated by Zone AR flooding shall be designated as a ``dual''
flood insurance rate zone, Zone AR/AE or AR/AH with Zone AR base flood elevations, and AE or AH with base flood elevations
and Zone AR/AO with Zone AR base flood elevations and Zone AO with flood depths, or Zone AR/A with Zone AR base flood elevations
and Zone A without base flood elevations. 

(b) 

Limitations

. A community may have a flood control restoration zone designation only once for the purposes of restoring a given
flood protection system and must complete restoration of the system or meet the requirements of 44 CFR 61.12 within
a specified period, not to exceed ten (10) years from the date of submittal of the community's application for designation
of a flood control restoration zone. The community may not extend this period. The information specified in this section
must be supplied to FEMA by the community as part of its request for designation of a flood control restoration zone.


(c) 

Exclusions

. The provisions of these regulations do not apply in a coastal high hazard area as defined in 44 CFR 59.1, including
areas that would be subject to coastal high hazards as a result of the decertification of a flood protection system
shown on the community's effective Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) as providing 100-year protection. 

(d) 

Effective date for risk premium rates

. The effective date for any risk premium rates established for Zone AR shall be the effective date of the revised Flood
Insurance Rate Map showing AR Zone designations. 

(e) 

Application and submittal requirements for designation of a flood control restoration zone

. A community must submit a written request to the Director, signed by the community's Chief Executive Officer, for
a flood plain designation as a flood control restoration zone. The request must include a legislative action by the
community requesting the designation. The Director will not initiate any action to designate flood control restoration
zones without receipt of the formal request from the community that complies with all requirements of this section.
The Director reserves the right to request additional information from the community to support or further document
the community's formal request for designation of a flood control restoration zone, if deemed necessary. At a minimum,
each request must include the following:

(1) A statement whether, to the best of the knowledge of the community's Chief Executive Officer, the flood protection
system is currently the subject matter of litigation before any Federal, State or local court or administrative agency,
and if so, the purpose of that litigation; 
(2) A statement whether the community has previously requested a determination with respect to the same subject matter
from the Director, and if so, a statement that details the disposition of such previous request; 
(3) A statement from the community and certification by a Federal agency responsible for flood protection design
or construction that the existing flood control system shown on the effective Flood Insurance Rate Map was built using
Federal funds, that it no longer provides 100-year flood protection, but that it continues to provide at least a 
35-year level of protection; 
(4) A statement identifying the local project sponsor responsible for restoration of the flood protection system
to the 100-year or greater level of flood protection; 
(5) a copy of a study, performed by a Federal agency responsible for flood protection design or construction in consultation
with the local project sponsor, which demonstrates a Federal interest in restoration of the system and which deems
that the flood protection system is restorable to a 100-year or greater level of flood protection. 
(6) A joint statement from the Federal agency responsible for flood protection design or construction involved in
restoration of the flood protection system and the local project sponsor certifying that the design and construction
of the flood control system involves Federal funds, and that the restoration of the flood protection system will provide
100-year or greater flood protection; 
(7) A restoration plan to return the system to a 
100-year or greater level of protection. At a minimum, this plan must: 
(i) List all important project elements, such as acquisition of permits, approvals, and contracts and construction
schedules of planned features; 
(ii) Identify anticipated start and completion dates for each element, as well as significant milestones and dates;

(iii) Identify the date on which ``as built'' drawings and certification for the completed restoration project will
be submitted. This date must provide for a restoration period not to exceed, ten (10) years from the date of submittal
of the community's application for designation as a flood control restoration zone, or; 
(iv) Identify the date on which the community will submit a request for a finding of adequate progress that meets all
requirements of  61.12. This date may not exceed ten (10) years from the date of submittal of the community's
application for designation as a flood control restoration zone; 
(8) An official map of the community or legal description, with supporting documentation, that the community will

Requirements for maintaining designation of a flood control restoration zone. 

During the restoration period, the community and the cost-sharing Federal agency must certify annually to the FEMA
Regional Office having jurisdiction that the restoration will be completed in accordance with the restoration plan
within the time period specified by the plan. In addition, the community and the Federal agency will update the restoration
plan and will identify any permitting or construction problems that will delay the project completion from the restoration
plan previously submitted to the Director. The FEMA Regional Office having jurisdiction will make an annual assessment
and recommendation to the Director as to the viability of the restoration plan and will conduct periodic on-site inspections
of the flood protection system under restoration.

(h) 

Procedures for removing flood control restoration zone designation due to adequate progress or complete restoration
of the flood protection system. 

At any time during the restoration period, the community may provide written evidence of certification from a Federal
agency having flood protection design or construction responsibility that the necessary improvements have been
completed and that the system has been restored to provide a minimum 100-year level of protection, or may submit a request
for a finding of adequate progress that meets all requirements of section 61.12. If the Director determines that adequate
progress has been made, FEMA will revise the zone designation from a flood control restoration zone designation to
Zone A99. After the improvements have been completed and certified by a Federal agency as providing a minimum 100-year
level of protection, FEMA will revise the Flood Insurance Rate Map to reflect the completed flood control system.

(i) 

Procedures for removing flood control restoration zone designation due to non-compliance with the restoration
schedule or as a result of a finding that satisfactory progress is not being made to complete the restoration. 

At any time during the restoration period, should the Director determine that the restoration will not be completed
in accordance with the time frame specified in the restoration plan, or that satisfactory progress is not being made
to restore the flood protection system to provide complete flood protection in accordance with the restoration plan,
the Director shall notify the community and the responsible Federal agency, in writing, of the determination, the
reasons for that determination, and that the Flood Insurance Rate Map will be revised to remove the flood control restoration
zone designation. Within thirty (30) days of such notice, the community may submit written information that provides
assurance that the restoration will be completed in accordance with the time frame specified in the restoration plan,
or that satisfactory progress is being made to restore complete protection in accordance with the restoration plan,
or that, with reasonable certainty, the restoration will be completed within the maximum restoration period, which
may not exceed ten (10) years from the date of submittal of the community's application for designation of a flood control
restoration zone. On the basis of this information the Director may suspend the decision to revise the Flood Insurance
Rate Map to remove the flood control restoration zone designation. If the community does not submit any information,
or if, based on a review of the information submitted, there is sufficient cause to find that the restoration will not
be completed as provided for in the restoration plan, the Director shall revise the Flood Insurance Rate Map, in accordance
with 44 CFR Part 67, and shall remove the flood control restoration zone designations and shall redesignate those
areas as Zone A1-30, AE, AH, AO, or A. 



PART 70_PROCEDURE FOR MAP CORRECTION 


12. The authority citation for Part 70 is revised to read as follows:






Authority:

in designated A, AO, A1-30, AE, AH, A99, AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, VO, V1-30, VE, and
V Zones, as a result of the transposition of the curvilinear line to either street or to other readily identifiable
features. The necessity for this part is due in part to the technical difficulty of accurately delineating the curvilinear
line on either a Flood Hazard Boundary Map or Flood Insurance Rate Map. These procedures shall not apply when there
has been any alteration of topography since the effective date of the first National Flood Insurance Program map (i.e.,
Flood Hazard Boundary Map or Flood Insurance Rate Map) showing the property within an area of special flood hazard.
Appeals in such circumstances are subject to the provisions of part 65 of this subchapter.

PART 75_EXEMPTION OF STATE-OWNED PROPERTIES UNDER SELF-INSURANCE PLAN 



17. The authority citation for Part 75 is revised to read as follows: 






Authority:

 42 U.S.C. 4001 et seq.; Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1978, 3 CFR, 1978 Comp., p. 329; E.O. 12127, 3 CFR, 1979 Comp., p.
376. 






18. Section 75.1 is revised to read as follows: 



 75.1

 Purpose of part. 



The purpose of this part is to establish standards with respect to the Director's determinations that a State's plan
of self-insurance is adequate and satisfactory for the purposes of exempting such State, under the provisions of
section 102(c) of the Act, from the requirement of purchasing flood insurance coverage for State-owned structures
and their contents in areas identified by the Director as A, AO, AH, A1-30, AE, AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AO,
AR/AH, AR/A, A99, M, V, VO, V1-30, VE, and E Zones, in which the sale of insurance has been made available, and to
establish the procedures by which a State may request exemption under section 102(c). 




19. Section 75.10 is revised to read as follows: 



 75.10

 Applicability. 



A State shall be exempt from the requirement to purchase flood insurance in respect to State-owned structures and,
where applicable, their contents located or to be located in areas identified by the Director as A, AO, AH, A1-30,
AE, AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, A99, M, V, VO, V1-30, VE, and E Zones, and in which the sale of
flood insurance has been made available under the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, provided that
the State has established a plan of self-insurance determined by the Director to equal or exceed the standards set
forth in this subpart. 




20. Paragraphs (a)(4), (a)(5), and (a)(7) of section 75.11 are revised to read as follows: 



 75.11

 Standards. 



(a) * * * 

(4) Consist of a self-insurance fund, or a commercial policy of insurance or reinsurance, for which provision is made
in statute or regulation and that is funded by periodic premiums or charges allocated for state-owned structures
and their contents in areas identified by the Director as A, AO, AH, A1-30, AE, AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AO,
AR/AH, AR/A, A99, M, V, VO, V1-30, VE, and E Zones. The person or persons responsible for such self-insurance
fund shall report on its status to the chief executive authority of the State, or to the legislature, or both, not less
frequently than annually. The loss experience shall be shown for each calendar or fiscal year from inception to current
date based upon loss and loss adjustment expense incurred during each separate calendar or fiscal year compared to
the premiums or charges for each of the respective calendar or fiscal years. Such incurred losses shall be reported
in aggregate by cause of loss under a loss coding system adequate, as a minimum, to identify and isolate loss caused
by flood, mudslide (i.e., mudflow) or flood-related erosion. The Director may, subject to the requirements of paragraph
(a)(5) of this section, accept and approve in lieu of, and as the reasonable equivalent of the self-insurance fund,
an enforceable commitment of funds by the State, the enforceability of which shall be certified to by the State's Attorney
General, or other principal legal officer. Such funds, or enforceable commitment of funds in amounts not less than
the limits of coverage that would be applicable under Standard Flood Insurance Policies, shall be used by the State
for the repair or restoration of State-owned structures and their contents damaged as a result of flood-related losses
occurring in areas identified by the Director as A, AO, AH, A1-30, AE, AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH,
AR/A, A99, M, V, VO, V1-30, VE, and E Zones. 



(5) Provide for the maintaining and updating by a designated State official or agency not less frequently than annually
of an inventory of all State-owned structures and their contents within A, AO, AH, A1-30, AE, AR, AR/A1-30,
AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, A99, M, V, VO, V1-30, VE, and E zones. The inventory shall:

(i) Include the location of individual structures; 

(ii) Include an estimate of the current replacement costs of such structures and their contents, or of their current
economic value; and 

(iii) Include an estimate of the anticipated annual loss due to flood damage. 



* * * * * 



(7) Include, pursuant to  60.12 of this subchapter, a certified copy of the flood plain management regulations
setting forth standards for State-owned properties within A, AO, AH, A1-30, AE, AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE,
AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, A99, M, V, VO, V1-30, VE, and E Zones. 



* * * * * 



21. The heading and paragraph (c) of section 75.13 are revised to read as follows: 



 75.13

 Review by the Director. 



* * * * * 



(c) Upon determining that the State's plan of self-insurance equals or exceeds the standards set forth in  75.11
of this subpart, the Director shall certify that the State is exempt from the requirement for the purchase of flood
insurance for State-owned structures and their contents located or to be located in areas identified by the Director
as A, AO, AH, A1-30, AE, AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, A99, M, V, VO, V1-30, VE, and E Zones.
Such exemption, however, is in all cases provisional. The Director shall review the plan for continued compliance
with the criteria set forth in this part and may request updated documentation for the purpose of such review. If the
plan is found to be inadequate and is not corrected within ninety days from the date that such inadequacies were identified,
the Director may revoke his certification.

Shrimp Fishery of the Gulf of Mexico



<AGENCY>

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Emergency interim rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS publishes this emergency interim rule at the request of the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council (Council)
to increase the domestic quota for royal red shrimp from the Gulf of Mexico. The intent of this action is to prevent an
unnecessary closure of the royal red shrimp fishery.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The shrimp fishery of the Gulf of Mexico is managed under the Fishery Management Plan for the Shrimp Fishery of the Gulf
of Mexico (FMP) and its implementing regulations at 50 CFR part 658. The FMP was prepared by the Council under the authority
of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act).



The FMP establishes an optimum yield (OY) equal to the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) for royal red shrimp from the
Gulf of Mexico of 177.8 metric tons (mt) and estimates the domestic annual harvest (DAH) at 111.6 mt. All weights are
tail weights. As specified in section 201(d) of the Magnuson Act, the difference between OY and DAH, 66.2 mt, is designated
as the total allowable level of foreign fishing (TALFF). Accordingly, the shrimp regulations at 50 CFR 658.21 specify
a domestic quota for royal red shrimp of 111.6 mt and require the Director, Southeast Region, NMFS, to close the fishery
for royal red shrimp when the quota is reached.

The TALFF for royal red shrimp was published on February 3, 1987 (52 FR 3248). Since that time, there has been no foreign
harvest of royal red shrimp from the Gulf of Mexico.

As of July 30, 1994, the domestic harvest of royal red shrimp was 88.3 mt. At the present rate of harvest, the domestic
quota is expected to be reached in early October 1994, and the fishery must be closed. Such a closure, although required
by the regulations, would be contrary to the goals of the FMP and the Magnuson Act because it would prevent attainment
of the OY from the fishery.

In anticipation of an increase in the domestic harvesting capacity to take royal red shrimp, the Council initiated

Amendment 7 to the FMP, which, among other things, would increase the domestic quota for royal red shrimp to 195.6 mt.
The proposed rule to implement Amendment 7 was published for public comment on September 12, 1994 (59 FR 46810). The
public comment period closes October 24, 1994. Accordingly, a final rule to implement Amendment 7 cannot be published
prior to the time when the domestic quota is expected to be reached. Without this emergency interim rule, the royal
red shrimp fishery would have to be closed when the current domestic quota is reached. Such a disruption in the harvest
of royal red shrimp is unnecessary for effective conservation and management of the resource and constitutes an economic
emergency for participants in the fishery.

As explained in Amendment 7, the data for determining the MSY for royal red shrimp are sparse, that is, catch and effort
data are limited. The FMP indicates that MSY falls within a range between 159.66 mt and 294.84 mt. The MSY has been set
at the single point estimate of 177.8 mt, which is near the lower end of the range.

The Council and NMFS believe that harvest above the point estimate of MSY for a limited time would contribute additional
current catch and effort data that are necessary to ascertain the appropriate MSY for royal red shrimp. Accordingly,
at the Council's request, this emergency interim rule establishes a domestic quota for royal red shrimp that exceeds
MSY for the fishing year that ends December 31, 1994.

The Council requested a domestic quota of 251 mt for the emergency rule. That amount was based on data that show that
landings of royal red shrimp have fallen short of the MSY in each of the last 2 fishing years as follows:






The Council's requested domestic quota is the sum of the MSY (177.8 mt) and the average harvest shortfall for the last
2 fishing years (116.9 mt+29.4 mt


'

2=73.15 mt, rounded to 73.2 mt). Because the royal red shrimp fishery consists of multiple year classes, portions
of prior years' foregone harvests are available for harvest in subsequent years. However, such a calculation is not
scientifically defensible_a portion of each year's foregone harvests would not be available in subsequent years
because of natural mortality.

Nevertheless, some amount of harvest over the point estimate of MSY is (1) Necessary both to address the economic emergency
and to obtain current additional catch and effort data for future refinements of MSY, and (2) justified and supportable.
Accordingly, this emergency interim rule establishes for 1994 a domestic quota of 215 mt. This amount represents
the reasonably expected domestic annual harvest based on the most recent landings and effort data, and is somewhat
higher then the domestic quota proposed in Amendment 7.

The Council and NMFS believe that establishing the domestic quota above the MSY point estimate for the current fishing
year has scientific merit (it would contribute current catch and effort data that are necessary to better estimate
MSY) and would not jeopardize the long-term biological integrity of the resource for the following reasons:

(1) The fishery exploits only 3 of the 5 year classes of royal red shrimp;

(2) The fishery operates in only a small portion of the Gulf of Mexico, whereas the resource exists throughout the Gulf
of Mexico;

(3) Some amount of surplus production, that is, the difference between the point estimate of MSY and landings in previous
years, is available for harvest; and

(4) The increased domestic quota is well within the current range of acceptable values for MSY.



Compliance With NMFS Guidelines for Emergency Rules



The Council and NMFS have concluded that the present situation constitutes an economic emergency, which is properly
addressed by this emergency interim rule, and that the situation meets NMFS's policy guidelines for the use of emergency
rules, published on January 6, 1992 (57 FR 375). The situation: 

1. Results from recent, unforeseen events or recently discovered circumstances. While the domestic harvest of royal
red shrimp in the Gulf of Mexico increased in 1993, the increased rate of harvest in 1994 was unanticipated.

2. Presents serious management problems in the fishery. A developing fishery will be unnecessarily disrupted, OY
will not be attained, and necessary catch and effort data will not be obtained, unless the emergency rule is issued.

3. Can be addressed through emergency regulations for which the immediate benefits outweigh the value of advance
notice, public comment, and deliberative consideration of the impacts on participants to the same extent as would
be expected under the normal rulemaking process. This emergency interim rule would temporarily relieve a restriction
on the participants in the fishery without the likelihood of jeopardizing the long-term biological viability of
the royal red shrimp resource. 

NMFS concurs with the Council's findings about the economic emergency and the need for immediate regulatory action.
Accordingly, NMFS publishes this emergency interim rule, effective from October 19, 1994, through December 31,
1994, as authorized by section 305(c)(1) and (c)(3) of the Magnuson Act.



Classification



The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA), has determined that this rule is necessary to respond to an
emergency situation and is consistent with the Magnuson Act and other applicable law. 

This emergency interim rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866. 

The AA finds that the immediate need to relieve an economic emergency in the royal red shrimp fishery constitutes good
cause to waive the requirement to provide prior notice and an opportunity for public comment, pursuant to authority
set forth at 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B), as such procedures would be impracticable and contrary to the public interest.
Similarly, the need to implement these measures in a timely manner to address the economic emergency constitutes
good cause under authority contained in 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3) to waive the 30-day delay in effective date.
