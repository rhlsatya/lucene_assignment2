Importation of Fruits and Vegetables


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are proposing to allow a number of previously prohibited fruits and vegetables to be imported into the United States
from certain parts of the world. All of the fruits and vegetables, as a condition of entry, would be subject to inspection,
disinfection, or both, at the port of first arrival as may be required by a U.S. Department of Agriculture inspector.
In addition, some of the fruits and vegetables would be required to undergo prescribed treatments for fruit flies
or other injurious insects as a condition of entry, or to meet other special conditions. This proposed action would
provide the United States with additional kinds and sources of fruits and vegetables while continuing to provide
protection against the introduction and dissemination of injurious plant pests by imported fruits and vegetables.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background 


The regulations in 7 CFR 319.56 through 319.56-8 (referred to below as the regulations) prohibit or restrict
the importation of fruits and vegetables into the United States from certain parts of the world to prevent the introduction
and dissemination of injurious insects that are new to or not widely distributed within and throughout the United
States. 
We are proposing to amend the regulations to allow additional fruits and vegetables to be imported into the United
States from certain parts of the world under specified conditions. The importation of these fruits and vegetables
has been prohibited because of the risk that the fruits and vegetables could introduce injurious insects into the
United States. We are proposing to allow these importations at the request of various importers and foreign ministries
of agriculture, and after conducting pest risk analyses
 that indicate the fruits or vegetables can be imported under certain conditions without significant pest risk.





All of the fruits and vegetables included in this document would be subject to the requirements in  319.56-6
of the regulations. 
Section 319.56-6 provides, among other things, that all imported fruits and vegetables, as a condition of entry,
shall be subject to inspection, disinfection, or both, at the port of first arrival, as may be required by a U.S. Department
of Agriculture (USDA) inspector to detect and eliminate plant pests. Section 319.56-6 also provides that any
shipment of fruits and vegetables may be refused entry if the shipment is infested with fruit flies or other dangerous
plant pests and an inspector determines that it cannot be cleaned by disinfection or treatment. 
Some of the fruits and vegetables proposed for importation also would be required to undergo prescribed treatments
for fruit flies or other insect pests as a condition of entry, or to meet other special conditions. 
The proposed conditions of entry, which are discussed in greater detail below, appear adequate to prevent the introduction
and dissemination of injurious plant pests by the importation of fruits and vegetables from certain foreign countries
and localities into the United States.



Subject to Inspection and Treatment Upon Arrival



We are proposing to allow the following fruits and vegetables to be imported into the United States from the country
or locality indicated in accordance with  319.56-6 and all other applicable requirements of the regulations:

Pest risk analyses conducted by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) have shown that the fruits
and vegetables listed above are not attacked by fruit flies or other injurious plant pests, either because they are
not hosts to the pests or because the pests are not present in the country or locality of origin. In addition, we have
determined that any other injurious plant pests that might be carried by the listed fruits or vegetables would be readily
detectable by a USDA inspector. Therefore, the provisions in  319.56-6 concerning inspection, disinfection,
or both, at the port of first arrival, appear adequate to prevent the introduction into the United States of injurious
plant pests by the importation of these fruits and vegetables. 



Treatment Required 



Additionally, we are proposing to allow the fruits and vegetables listed below to be imported into the United States.
These fruits and vegetables are attacked by the Mediterranean fruit fly (Medfly) or other injurious insects, as specified
below, in their country or locality of origin. Visual inspection cannot be relied upon to detect the insects. However,
the fruits and vegetables listed below can be treated to destroy the Medfly or other injurious insects. Therefore,
we propose to allow these fruits and vegetables to be imported into the United States, or specified parts of the United
States, only if they have been treated in accordance with the Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) Treatment Manual,
which has been incorporated by reference into the Code of Federal Regulations at 7 CFR 300.1. 


We would revise the PPQ Treatment Manual to show that treatments are required as follows for the fruits and vegetables
listed below:

The treatments described above have been determined to be effective against the specified insects. This determination
is based on research evaluated and approved by the Department. A bibliography and additional information on this
research may be obtained from the Hoboken Methods Development Center, PPQ, APHIS, USDA, 209 River Street, Hoboken,
NJ, 07030. 

In accordance with  319.56-2x(b) of the regulations, the fruits and vegetables listed above and required
to be treated for fruit flies would be restricted to ports of arrival at Wilmington, NC, and the North Atlantic if treatment
has not been completed before the fruits and vegetables arrive in the United States. Climatic conditions at Wilmington,
NC, and at North Atlantic ports are unsuitable for the fruit flies listed above. Therefore, in the unlikely event that
any fruit flies escape before treatment, they will not become established pests in the United States. The designated
North Atlantic ports are: Atlantic Ocean ports north of, and including, Baltimore; ports on the Great Lakes and St.
Lawrence Seaway; Canadian border ports on the North Dakota border and east of North Dakota; and, for air shipments,
Washington, DC (including Baltimore-Washington International and Dulles International airports). 

Pest risk analyses conducted by APHIS have determined that any other injurious plant pests that might be carried by
the fruits and vegetables listed above would be readily detectable by a USDA inspector. As noted, the fruits and vegetables
would be subject to inspection, disinfection, or both, at the port of first arrival, in accordance with  319.56-6.




Use of Methyl Bromide 



Methyl bromide is currently in widespread use as a fumigant. It is prescribed as a treatment for three of the commodities
included in this proposal (blueberries from Argentina, garden beans from El Salvador, and lettuce from Israel).
The environmental effects of using methyl bromide, however, are being scrutinized by international, Federal, and
State agencies. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), based on its evaluation of data concerning the ozone
depletion potential of methyl bromide, published a notice of final rulemaking in the 

Federal Register

 on December 10, 1993 
(58 FR 65018-65082). This rulemaking freezes methyl bromide production at 1991 levels and requires the phasing
out of domestic use of methyl bromide by the year 2001. APHIS is studying the effectiveness and environmental acceptability
of alternative treatments to prepare for the eventual unavailability of methyl bromide fumigation. Our current
proposal assumes the continued availability of methyl bromide for use as a fumigant for at least the next few years.




Apples From Spain 



Section 319.56-2r contains administrative instructions governing the entry of apples and pears from certain
countries in Europe. Currently, pears, but not apples, may be imported from Spain under the conditions prescribed
in  319.56-2r, which include a preclearance program and cold treatment. Based on our review of the pest
risk associated with the importation of apples and pears from Spain, it appears that apples may be imported under these
conditions without presenting a significant pest risk. Therefore, we are proposing to amend  319.56-2r
to allow the importation of apples from Spain under the same conditions that apply to pears from Spain. 



Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 



This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The rule has been determined to be not significant
for purposes of Executive Order 12866, and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.


In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 603, we have performed an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, which is set out below,
regarding the impact of this proposed rule on small entities. However, we do not currently have all the data necessary
for a comprehensive analysis of the effects of this rule on small entities. Therefore, we are inviting comments concerning
potential effects. In particular, we are interested in determining the number and kind of small entities that may
incur benefits or costs from implementation of this proposed rule. 

Under the Plant Quarantine Act and the Federal Plant Pest Act (7 U.S.C. 150dd, 150ee, 150ff, 151-167), the Secretary
of Agriculture is authorized to regulate the importation of fruits and vegetables to prevent the introduction of
injurious plant pests. 

This proposed rule would amend the regulations governing the importation of fruits and vegetables by allowing a number
of previously prohibited fruits and vegetables to be imported into the United States from certain foreign countries
and localities under specified conditions. The importation of these fruits and vegetables has been prohibited because
of the risk that they could introduce injurious plant pests into the United States. This proposed rule would revise
the status of certain commodities from certain countries and localities, allowing their importation into the United
States for the first time. 

Our proposed changes are based on biological risk analyses that were conducted by APHIS at the request of various importers
and foreign ministries of agriculture. The risk analyses indicate that the fruits or vegetables listed in this proposed
rule could, under certain conditions, be imported into the United States without significant pest risk. All of the
fruits and vegetables, as a condition of entry, would be subject to inspection, disinfection, or both, at the port
of first arrival as may be required by a USDA inspector. In addition, some of the fruits and vegetables in this proposal
also would be required to undergo mandatory treatment for fruit flies or other injurious insects as a condition of
entry, or to meet other special conditions. Our proposed action would provide the United States with additional kinds
and sources of fruits and vegetables while continuing to provide protection against the introduction into the United
States of injurious plant pests by imported fruits and vegetables. 



Apples

This proposed rule would allow apples to be imported into the United States from Spain under certain conditions. Spain's
production of apples in 1993 was approximately 821,000 metric tons (mt). Spain's export level over the past 5 years
has averaged 20,000 mt. In the unlikely event that Spain's apple exports were fully diverted to the United States,
they would represent about 0.4 percent of U.S. production, an amount that would not significantly affect the U.S.
market. Moreover, there would not be any off-season advantages, since Spain's main production season, June through
September, inclusive, is the same as for U.S. apple producers. 

In addition, the United States is a net exporter of apples. Total U.S. utilized production of apples in 1993 was 4,760,682
mt (fresh equivalent). (Utilized production of apples refers to the amount of apples sold plus the quantities of apples
used on farms where grown and quantities of apples held in storage, thus those apples actually used in some way). Imports
of fresh apples in 1992 totaled 120,412 mt, or 2.5 percent of domestic utilized production that year, whereas exports
totaled 507,614 mt, or 10.7 percent. Given this trade flow, the U.S. market for apples is not expected to exhibit the
excess demand in the near future that could encourage increased foreign supply. The main commercial varieties grown
in Spain (Golden Delicious, 50 percent; Granny Smith, 30 percent) are common varieties in the United States, and their
export, therefore, would not satisfy any special market demand. 


Asparagus (White) 



This proposed rule would allow white asparagus to be imported into the United States from Austria under certain conditions.
Total U.S. asparagus production in 1993 was 2,204,000 hundredweight (cwt), or 99,973 mt. Austria's current production
of asparagus is around 400 mt, 95 percent of which is white asparagus. 

APHIS expects that annual exports to the United States may reach between 1 and 2 tons. This quantity represents less
than 0.002 percent of U.S. production, and therefore would not affect prices received by U.S. growers. 


Blueberries 



This proposed rule would allow blueberries to be imported into the United States from Argentina under certain conditions.
Total U.S. blueberry production in 1993 was 170,397,000 pounds, or 77,292 mt. About 40 percent was produced for the
fresh fruit market, and about 60 percent was processed. APHIS estimates Argentina's current production of blueberries
to be 40 mt per year, and we expect that figure to expand to 200 mt by 1997-98. At present, all blueberry exports
from Argentina (80 percent of production) are sent to Europe. If approved for entry into the United States, we expect
that 19.2 mt or 60 percent of blueberry exports from Argentina would be directed to U.S. ports. This quantity represents
less than 0.03 percent of U.S. production, and therefore would not noticeably affect prices received by U.S. growers.



Carambola 



This proposed rule would allow carambola to be imported into the United States from Taiwan under certain conditions.
Carambola (starfruit) is not currently imported into the United States. Ninety percent of domestic production takes
place in southern Florida, where 60 to 90 growers cultivate a total of about 400 acres. Most of the producers would be
considered small entities, according to the Small Business Administration definition of annual gross receipts
of $500,000 or less. U.S. production of carambola in 1994 will reach between 5 and 6 million pounds, a quantity expected
to gradually increase as consumer familiarity with carambola grows. At present, carambola is unknown to most U.S.
consumers, and the industry faces the challenge of creating broader market appeal for this fruit. 

Besides Florida, a relatively small amount of carambola is produced in Hawaii (58,400 pounds in 1992). A regulatory
change last year now allows carambola grown in Hawaii to be marketed on the mainland. The initial volume to be shipped
this year is estimated at 1,500 to 3,000 pounds. 

Taiwan is reportedly the world's largest producer of carambola. In 1992, 35,738 mt (78.8 million pounds) were produced,
about 12 times that of the United States. However, less than 10 mt (0.03 percent) of Taiwan's production is exported
annually, mainly to Hong Kong and Canada. As an initial trial shipment, about 1 mt is expected to be exported to the United
States per year. 

California is a large and growing domestic market for carambola and the likely destination of carambola from Taiwan.
It receives from 40 to 50 percent of Florida's carambola crop. California requires that carambola from Florida be
cold treated, and APHIS requires cold treatment for shipments from Hawaii to the mainland. Imports from Taiwan would
also require cold treatment.

<TEXT>
 

Average prices received by U.S. carambola producers between 1989 and 1993 ranged from about $0.67 to $1.55 per pound.
Farm prices in Taiwan vary from $0.60 to $4.00 per kg ($0.27 to $1.81 per pound), depending on the quality, size of production,
and season. Thus, prices are generally lower in Taiwan, but price differences between the two countries are not as
great as might be expected. Moreover, high quality carambolas suitable for export sell well in Taiwan's domestic
market. Relatively high farm prices and the fruit's well-established domestic market largely explain Taiwan's
limited exports. 
Carambola is sensitive to chilling, which can cause the skin to turn brown and become pitted. Since all carambola entering
California would require cold treatment, effects of the treatment on the appearance and marketability of the fruit
would be similar, whether the carambola comes from Florida, Hawaii, or Taiwan. 
Assuming the market for carambola expands, and fruit from Taiwan is routinely imported, domestic producers' income
will be less than it would be otherwise, due to a price decline and/or lower volumes than would be sold were there not
imports. The critical question is what this reduction in income would be. There is no evidence to suggest that it would
be significant. 
From a broader perspective, sales and income lost by domestic producers should be balanced against benefits to U.S.
consumers in terms of greater availability and/or lower prices. Again, lack of information on how much carambola
prices can be expected to decline as a result of imports, and the responsiveness of producers and consumers to a decline,
precludes estimation of consumers' gains and domestic producers' losses. Nevertheless, APHIS believes that the
net benefit to the U.S. economy would be positive. 


Currants and Gooseberries 


This proposed rule would allow currants and gooseberries to be imported into the United States from Argentina under
certain conditions. Argentina's area of ribes production totals only four hectares, one of which is being used for
experiments on the suitability of various species. The Economic Research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture,
estimates the annual crop at 30 mt, of which 40 percent, or 12 mt, could be exported to the United States. 
Although published data on U.S. ribes production has not been found, trade statistics show the United States to be
a net importer. In 1992, 64 mt of currants and gooseberries were exported, and 264 mt of currants were imported. The
quantity of ribes expected to be imported from Argentina is only 6 percent of 1992 net imports for the United States.
APHIS does not expect this relatively small change in the quantity imported to significantly affect the market for
U.S. producers. 


Eggplant 


This proposed rule would allow eggplant to be imported into the United States from South Korea under certain conditions.
U.S. commercial production of eggplant in 1993 was 776,000 cwt (35,199 mt). South Korea's annual production of eggplant
in 1993 totaled 22,751 mt, of which 30.3 mt were exported to Japan and Guam. If all of South Korea's eggplant exports
were sent to the United States, it would represent less than 0.09 percent of U.S. commercial production.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941025-1-00008 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941025-1-00001 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Even in the very unrealistic scenario of South Korea's exports of eggplant being fully diverted to the United States,
the quantities would not be large enough to affect the U.S. market. 


Kiwi 


This proposed rule would allow kiwi to be imported into the United States from South Korea under certain conditions.
Utilized U.S. production of kiwi in 1992 totaled 47,700 mt. Imports of kiwi into the United States for 1992 were estimated
at 20,236 mt, or more than 40 percent of domestic production. South Korea's annual production of kiwi in 1993 totaled
8,538 mt, of which none was exported. Assuming 5 percent of South Korea's production (426.9 mt) were exported to the
United States, this amount would represent only about 0.6 percent of U.S. supply (produced domestically and imported)
in 1991. 
Even in the very unrealistic scenario of South Korea exporting 5 percent of its kiwi production to the United States,
the quantities would not be large enough to affect the U.S. market. 


Lettuce 


This proposed rule would allow lettuce to be imported into the United States from Israel and South Korea under certain
conditions. Total U.S. production of head, leaf, and romaine lettuce in 1993 was 82,790,000 cwt (3,755,330 mt). In
Israel, insect-free lettuce produced in greenhouses for the 1993/94 season reached about 4,480,000 pounds. Exports
planned for 1994/95 are estimated at 1,600,000 pounds. If all of these exports were destined for the United States,
they would comprise less than 0.02 percent of U.S. production and, therefore, would not noticeably affect the U.S.
market. 
South Korea's annual production of leaf lettuce in 1993 totaled 149,611 mt, of which 23.9 mt were exported to Japan,
Guam, Hong Kong, and Saipan. If all of South Korea's lettuce exports were sent to the United States, it would represent
only about 0.0006 percent of U.S. production. 
Even in the very unrealistic scenario of South Korea's export of lettuce being fully diverted to the United States,
the quantities would not be large enough to affect the U.S. market. 
Impacts on U.S. producers for several of the other commodities that could be imported into the United States under
this proposal could not be assessed because of a lack of data. However, none of these products is a significant U.S.
crop. The herbs, in particular, are often grown to supplement other farm income. Others, such as arugula and lambs
quarters, have limited markets. APHIS anticipates, therefore, that no significant economic impacts would result
from the importation of these commodities for which analysis has not been possible. 
The aggregate economic impact of this proposed rule is expected to be positive. U.S. consumers would benefit from
a greater availability of fruits and vegetables. U.S. importers would also benefit from a greater availability of
fruits and vegetables to import. 
The alternative to this proposed rule was to make no changes in the fruits and vegetables regulations. After consideration,
we rejected this alternative since there was no pest risk reason to maintain the prohibitions on the affected produce.

This proposed rule contains no paperwork or recordkeeping requirements. 


Executive Order 12778 


This proposed rule would allow certain fruits and vegetables to be imported into the United States from certain parts
of the world. If this proposed rule is adopted, State and local laws and regulations regarding the importation of fruits
and vegetables under this rule would be preempted while the fruits and vegetables are in foreign commerce. Fresh fruits
and vegetables are generally imported for immediate distribution and sale to the consuming public, and would remain
in foreign commerce until sold to the ultimate consumer. The question of when foreign commerce ceases in other cases
must be addressed on a case-by-case basis. If this proposed rule is adopted, no retroactive effect will be given to
this rule, and this rule will not require administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court challenging
this rule. 


National Environmental Policy Act 


An environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact have been prepared for this proposed rule. The assessment
provides a basis for the conclusion that the importation of fruits and vegetables under the conditions specified
in this proposed rule would not present a significant risk of introducing or disseminating plant pests and would not
have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment. Based on the finding of no significant impact, the
Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that an environmental impact statement
need not be prepared. 
The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact were prepared in accordance with: (1) The National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 

et seq.

), (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40
CFR parts 1500-1508), (3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA (7 CFR part 1b), and (4) APHIS Guidelines Implementing
NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384, August 28, 1979, and 44 FR 51272-51274, August 31, 1979). 
Copies of the environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact are available for public inspection
at USDA, room 1141, South Building, 14th Street and Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC, between 8 a.m. and 4:30
p.m., Monday through Friday, except holidays. In addition, copies may be obtained by writing to the individuals listed
under 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT.


Paperwork Reduction Act 


This proposed rule contains no information collection or recordkeeping requirements under the Paperwork Reduction
Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 


et seq

.).

Viruses, Serums, Toxins, and Analogous Products; Test Animals


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

We are proposing to amend the regulations to allow appropriate treatment of sick or injured test animals or the human
destruction of dying animals used in the testing of veterinary biological products. The effect of this action would
eliminate unnecessary discomfort to animals used in vaccine testing. This amendment would provide the firms with
a previously unauthorized option for test animals that are accidentally injured or become ill or exhibit unfavorable
reactions for reasons not due to the test. These animals may be removed from the test and treated or humanely destroyed.
In addition, test animals that show clinical signs of illness resulting from the test may be treated or humanely destroyed
when death is certain to occur without therapeutic intervention. This action is necessary to provide for the treatment
or humane destruction of ill or injured test animals under defined conditions, an option not currently allowed by
the regulations for test animals as a group.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background


Veterinary biological products are licensed under the Virus-Serum-Toxin Act on the basis of their purity, safety,
potency, and efficacy. In the course of evaluating a biological product, it may be necessary to conduct potency, safety,
or efficacy tests in animals.
The current regulations in 9 CFR part 117 require that once an animal test has begun, no treatment which could interfere
with a true evaluation of the biological product may be used (

see 

 117.4(c)). However, test animals may become accidently injured or ill or exhibit unfavorable reactions as
a result of factors not due to the test. These occurrences are unpredictable, and no provisions are available in the

When animal tests involve challenge with infectious microorganisms in order to establish that the biological product
can elicit protection against disease, the challenge with infectious microorganisms may produce an illness which
is characteristic of a natural infection. Therefore, we are also proposing to amend  117.4 by adding new paragraphs
(d) and (e), to allow for the treatment or humane destruction of test animals which show clinical signs of illness attributable
to the challenge microorganism, which are likely to result in death.

The proposed amendment would have the objective of eliminating unnecessary discomfort resulting from injury, unfavorable
reactions, or illness when conducting tests in animals.



Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act



This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866.

The effect of the rule would be to provide that animals used in testing biological product which become ill, accidentally
injured, or exhibit unfavorable reactions could be removed from the test and be treated or humanely destroyed. The
objective of the rule would be to eliminate any unnecessary discomfort to animals.

The rule would require no additional testing of animals. It would simply provide an option which was not previously
available. Therefore, the rule is not anticipated to increase costs to producers of veterinary biological products.

Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.



Executive Order 12372



This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive

Availability of NPRMs 



Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by 
submitting a request to the FAA, Central Region, Office

Discussion 



The FAA has received a report of the right lower 
aft wing attachment nut assembly separating in two 
pieces on a Beech Model 
T-34C-1 airplane. Laboratory investigation of the nut 
assembly revealed that stress corrosion caused the 
failure. If the separated assembly is not detected and 
corrected, and is operated in that condition, the wing 
could separate from the fuselage. 

Beech has issued Service Bulletin (SB) No. 2487, 
dated August 1993, which specifies procedures for 
installing Inconel wing attachment hardware on Models 
34C, T-34C, and T-34C-1 airplanes. 

After examining the circumstances and reviewing 
all available information related to the incidents 
described above, the FAA has determined that AD action 
should be taken to prevent the wing from separating 
from the fuselage because of failure of this assembly. 

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that 
is likely to exist or develop in other Beech 34C, T-34C, and T-34C-1 airplanes of the same type design,
the 
proposed AD would require replacing the eight wing 
attachment steel bolts and hardware with Inconel bolts 
and hardware. The proposed actions would be 
accomplished in accordance with Beech SB No. 2487, 
dated August 1993. 

The compliance time for the proposed AD is 
presented in calendar time instead of hours time-in- 
service (TIS). The FAA has determined that a calendar 
time for compliance is the most desirable method 
because the unsafe condition described by the proposed 
AD is caused by stress corrosion. Stress corrosion 
initiates as a result of airplane operation, but can 
continue to develop regardless of whether the airplane 
is in service or in storage. Therefore, to ensure that 
the above-referenced condition is detected and 
corrected on all airplanes within a reasonable period 
of time without inadvertently grounding any airplanes, 
a compliance schedule based upon calendar time instead 
of hours TIS is proposed. 

The FAA estimates that 494 airplanes in the U.S. 
registry would be affected by the proposed AD, that it 
would take approximately 8 workhours per airplane to 
accomplish the proposed action, and that the average 
labor rate is approximately $55 an hour. Parts cost 
approximately $800 per airplane. Based on these 
figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on 
U.S. operators is estimated to be $612,560. This 
figure is based on the assumption that no affected 
airplane owners/operator has accomplished the proposed 
replacement. 

The Beech Aircraft Company has informed the FAA 
that 89 wing attachment assembly kits have been sold. 
Assuming that each of these kits is installed on an 
affected airplane, this would reduce the cost impact of 
the proposed AD upon U.S. operators of the affected 
airplanes by $110,360 from $612,560 to $502,200. 

The regulations proposed herein would not have 
substantial direct effects on the States, on the 
relationship between the national government and the 
States, or on the distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various levels of 
government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive 
Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would 
not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant 
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that 
this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory 
action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a 
``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and 
Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if 
promulgated, will not have a significant economic 
impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number 
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory 
evaluation prepared for this action has been placed in 
the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by

Discussion


The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, recently notified
the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on Pilatus Britten-Norman BN2A, BN2B, and BN2T Islander and BN2A Mk III Trislander
series airplanes that are equipped with a nose wheel steering disconnect system with either a Modification NB/M/503
or Modification NB/M/733 nose undercarriage unit. The CAA advises that the rudder pedals jammed in the central position
during a takeoff run on a BN2B Islander series airplane. Initial investigation revealed that the nose wheel steering
drive ring had fractured and the broken portion of the ring became snagged in the cut-away section of frame 19 where
the steering cables pass through. This caused the inability to move the rudder pedals. Further investigation showed
that the drive ring had cracked from the small radius of the left front lug across the ring and also through the grease
nipple hole at the rear left side of the ring.
Pilatus Britten-Norman has issued Service Bulletin No. BN-2/SB.214, Issue 1, dated September 23, 1993, which
specifies procedures for inspecting the nose wheel steering drive ring. In order to assure the continued airworthiness
of these airplanes in the United Kingdom, the CAA listed the actions specified in this service bulletin in the Mandatory
Aircraft Modifications and Inspections Summary, Issue 8, dated March 1994, as UK CAA AD 005-09-93.
This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the United States
under the provisions of  21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral
airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed
of the situation described above.
The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is
necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that 
is likely to exist or develop in other Pilatus Britten- 
Norman BN2A, BN2B, and BN2T Islander and BN2A Mk III 
Trislander series airplanes of the same type design 
that are equipped with a nose wheel steering disconnect 
system with either a Modification NB/M/503 or 
Modification NB/M/733 nose undercarriage unit, the 
proposed AD would require repetitively inspecting the 
nose wheel steering drive ring for cracks, and 
replacing any cracked drive ring. The proposed 
inspection would be accomplished in accordance with 
Pilatus Britten-Norman Service Bulletin No. 
BN-2/SB.214, Issue 1, dated September 23, 1993. The 
drive ring replacement, if necessary, would be 
accomplished in accordance with the applicable 
maintenance manual. 
 
The FAA estimates that 15 airplanes in the U.S. 
registry would be affected by the proposed AD, that it 
would take approximately 1 workhour per airplane to 
accomplish the proposed action, and that the average 
labor rate is approximately $55 an hour. Based on 
these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD 
on U.S. operators is estimated to be $825. This figure 
does not take into account the cost of repetitive 
inspections nor the cost of replacing any cracked drive 
ring. The FAA has no way of determining how many 
repetitive inspections each operator would incur over 
the lifetime of the airplane or how many drive rings 
may be cracked. 
 
The regulations proposed herein would not have 
substantial direct effects on the States, on the 
relationship between the national government and the 
States, or on the distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various levels of 
government. Therefore, in 
accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined

 Proposed amendments. 



 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Commission proposes to amend flammability standards 
applicable to children's sleepwear in sizes 0 through 6X and 
sizes 7 through 14. The amendments proposed below would revise 
the definition of ``children's sleepwear'' in the standard for 
sizes 0 through 6X to exclude garments in some infant sizes and 
tight-fitting garments from the products which are subject to the 
standard, and would revise the definition of ``children's 
sleepwear'' in the standard for sizes 7 through 14 to exclude 
``tight-fitting garments.'' The Commission is proposing these 
amendments because it has reason to believe that the existing 
children's sleepwear standards may not be limited to those 
sleepwear garments which present an unreasonable risk of burn 
deaths and injuries. Information available to the Commission 
indicates that by removing certain garments which do not present 
that unreasonable risk of injury, the proposed amendments would 
afford consumers a wider selection of sleepwear garments for 
children without diminishing the protection provided by the 
children's sleepwear standards.

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

A. Background 


Provisions of the Flammable Fabrics Act (FFA) (15 U.S.C. 
1191 et seq.) authorize issuance of flammability standards and 
regulations to protect the public from unreasonable risks of 
death, injury, and property damage from fires associated with 
products of wearing apparel made from fabric and related 
materials. 
 
In 1971, the Secretary of Commerce issued a flammability 
standard for children's sleepwear in sizes 0 through 6X to 
protect young children from death and serious burn injuries which 
had been associated with ignition of sleepwear garments, such as 
nightgowns and pajamas, by small open-flame sources. The 
standard for sleepwear in sizes 0 through 6X became effective in 
1972 and is now codified at 16 CFR part 1615. In 1973, authority 
to issue flammability standards under provisions of the FFA was 
transferred from the Department of Commerce to the Consumer 
Product Safety Commission by section 30(b) of the Consumer 
Product Safety Act (CPSA) (15 U.S.C. 2079(b)). In 1974, the 
Commission issued a flammability standard for children's 
sleepwear in sizes 7 through 14. That standard became effective 
in 1975 and is now codified at 16 CFR part 1616. 

Both standards prescribe a test which requires that 
specimens of fabrics, seams, and trim of children's sleepwear 
garments must self-extinguish after exposure to a small-open 
flame. Both standards require manufacturers of children's 
sleepwear subject to their provisions to test prototypes of 
sleepwear garments with acceptable results before beginning 
production. Both standards also require manufacturers to sample 
and test garments from regular production. Failure to comply 
with the sampling and testing requirements of the standards is a 
violation of section 3 of the FFA (15 U.S.C. 1192). The 
standards do not require or prohibit the use of any particular 
type of fabric or garment design as long as the manufacturer 
successfully completes the prescribed prototype and production 
testing.

Each standard defines the term ``children's sleepwear'' to mean ``any product of wearing apparel'' in the sizes covered
by the standard ``such as nightgowns, pajamas, or similar or related items, such as robes, intended to be worn primarily
for sleeping or activities related to sleeping.'' Each standard excludes diapers and underwear from its coverage.
See 16 CFR 1615.1(a) and 1616.2(a). 


B. Garments Subject to the Sleepwear Standards 


Before the effective date of the standard for children's sleepwear in sizes 0 through 6X, questions arose about the
specific types of garments which are subject to the requirements of that standard because they are ``intended to be
worn primarily for sleeping and activities related to sleeping.'' To respond to those questions, the Federal Trade
Commission (FTC), the agency responsible for enforcement of the standard at that time, published an enforcement
polity statement in the 

Federal Register

 of March 23, 1972 (37 FR 5982). Briefly summarized, that policy statement announced that in determining whether a
garment is ``intended to be worn primarily for sleeping or activities related to sleeping'' the FTC would consider
(1) the nature of the garment and its suitability for use by children for sleeping or activities related to sleeping;
(2) the manner in which the garment is distributed and promoted; and (3) the likelihood that the garment will be used
by children for sleeping or activities related to sleeping in a substantial number of cases. 
After the Commission issued the flammability standard for children's sleepwear in sizes 7 through 14, the agency
became aware of various ``borderline'' garments which may or may not be intended ``primarily for sleeping or activities
related to sleeping.'' Some of these garments were described in packaging, labeling, and advertising as ``playwear,''
``daywear,'' or ``underwear.'' Because the FTC policy statement applied only to sleepwear garments in sizes 0 through
6X, the Commission decided to issue a new policy statement concerning the scope of the standard for sleepwear in sizes
7 through 14, and to revise and reissue the policy statement concerning the scope of the standard for sizes 0 through
6X. 
The Commission published a proposed revision of the policy statement concerning the scope of the sleepwear standard
for sizes 0 through 6X and a new policy statement concerning the scope of the standard for sizes 7 through 14 in 1979;
in 1980 the Commission issued final policy statements. Those policy statements were the subject of an action for judicial
review and were set aside by a U.S. Court of Appeals in 1981. See 

National Knitwear Manufacturers Association v. CPSC,

 606 F2d 81 (4th Cir. 1981). 
In 1984, the Commission issued new policy statements to replace the ones set aside on judicial review. The Commission's
1984 policy statements incorporate and amplify the factors which were identified in the FTC policy as relevant to
determining whether a garment is an item of ``children's sleepwear'' because it is intended to be worn ``primarily
for sleeping and activities related to sleeping.'' (1)

2

 The 1984 policy statements are codified at 16 CFR 1615.64 and 1616.65. 




The Commission's issuance of policy statements in 1983 did not definitively resolve all questions about the differences
between those children's garments which are sleepwear and are subject to the sleepwear standards and those which
are not. In 1984, the Commission staff developed a pamphlet entitled 

Enforcement Policy on Children's Sleepwear,

 which described and illustrated various styles of sleepwear and non-sleepwear garments. Since its initial publication,
the Commission staff has revised this pamphlet five times. The last publication was in 1989, entitled 

Supplemental CPSC Staff Guide to the Enforcement Policy Statements of the Flammability Standard for Children's
Sleepwear

 (2). 
Nevertheless, the Commission staff continued to receive a large volume of inquiries about the status of particular
garments as sleepwear or non-sleepwear as well as complaints about alleged violations of the children's sleepwear
standards by firms manufacturing or importing garments which were subject to the standards' definitions of ``children's
sleepwear'' but which did not meet the requirements of the applicable standard. During the same time, the staff also
became aware of an increased demand by consumers for children's sleepwear made from 100 per cent untreated cotton
fabric. Although the standards do not prohibit any specific type of fabric in the production of children's sleepwear,
100 per cent cotton fabric cannot pass the flammability tests in the standards unless treated with a flame retardant.

In 1991, the Commission decided to re-examine the scope of the children's sleepwear standards and to consider the
possibility of amending the definitions of the term ``children's sleepwear'' in the two standards. This undertaking
resulted in the initiation of this rulemaking proceeding in 1993. 



C. Statutory Provisions



Section 4(g) of the FFA (15 U.S.C. 1193(g)) provides that a proceeding for issuance or amendment of a flammability
standard is initiated by publication in the 

Federal Register

 of an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR). Section 4(g) of the FFA requires that the ANPR must describe the
product and the risk of injury under consideration; summarize the regulatory alternatives being considered; provide
information about existing standards which may be relevant; invite interested persons to submit comments on the
product, risk of injury, and regulatory alternatives under consideration; invite interested persons to submit
an existing standard or portion of a standard to the Commission for publication as the proposed standard or amendment;
and invite interested persons to submit a statement of intent to develop or modify a voluntary standard to address
the risk of injury under consideration. 

If the Commission decides to continue the proceeding after consideration of comments and submissions received in
response to the ANPR, section 4(i) of the FFA requires the Commission to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR).
The NPR must set forth the text of the proposed rule and a preliminary regulatory analysis containing a discussion
of the anticipated benefits and costs of the proposed rule and other regulatory alternatives considered by the Commission.
Provisions of section 4(d) of the FFA provide that interested persons shall be given the opportunity to make oral presentations
of data, views, or arguments as well as to submit written comments on the proposed rule. 

To issue a final standard or amendment, section 4(j) of the FFA requires the Commission to publish a notice of final
rulemaking setting forth the text of the final rule and the Commission's final regulatory analysis of costs, benefits,
and alternatives to the rule. Section 4(j) also requires that the notice of final rulemaking must contain the Commission's
findings with regard to the provisions and extent of compliance with any voluntary standard that may be applicable
to the risk of injury under consideration. Additionally, section 4(b) of the FFA requires the notice of final rulemaking
to contain findings that the standard or amendment is needed to protect the public from the unreasonable risk of death,
injury, or significant property damage from fires associated with the fabric or product under consideration; is
reasonable, technologically practicable and appropriate; and is limited to those fabrics or products which have
been determined to present an unreasonable risk of death, injury, or significant property damage. 



D. Publication of ANPR 



The Commission began this proceeding to consider amendment of the children's sleepwear standards by publication
of an ANPR in the 

Federal Register

 of January 13, 1993 (58 FR 4111). The ANPR identified the products under consideration as children's sleepwear garments
in sizes 0 through 14, and the risk of injury as death or personal injury from fires resulting from ignition of children's
sleepwear (4). 

As required by section 4(g) of the FFA, the ANPR also described the regulatory alternatives being considered by the
Commission. Briefly summarized, the alternatives listed in the ANPR were: 

(1) Amendment of the children's sleepwear standards to exempt tight-fitting sleepwear garments and sleepwear garments
in infant sizes. Children's sleepwear garments exempted from the requirements of the sleepwear standard would be
subject to the provisions of the Standard for the Flammability of Clothing Textiles (16 CFR part 1610). That standard
prohibits the manufacture, importation, or sale of garments which are ``dangerously flammable because of rapid
and intense burning,'' but does not require garments to self-extinguish when exposed to a small open-flame ignition
source, or

(2) Issuance of an enforcement policy statement to announce that the Commission will not apply the requirements of
the children's sleepwear standards to tight-fitting sleepwear garments and garments in infant sizes as long as those
garments meet the requirements of the clothing textiles flammability standard. 

Section 4(g) also requires the ANPR to include information about all standards known by the Commission to be relevant
to the proceeding. The ANPR discussed provisions of flammability standards for children's sleepwear issued by Australia,
Canada, and New Zealand. The Canadian and New Zealand standards have less stringent flammability performance requirements
for tight-fitting children's sleepwear garments than for loose-fitting children's sleepwear. The Canadian standard
also makes special provisions for sleepwear garments in infant sizes and children's sleepwear intended for use in
hospitals. It is noteworthy that there have been no burn deaths associated with children's sleepwear reported in
Canada since its standard was promulgated in 1987.

At the same time the Commission published the ANPR, it also announced that it would not enforce the children's sleepwear
standards in instances involving garments in sizes 0 through 14 which are labeled and marketed as ``underwear'' if
those garments are skin-tight or nearly skin-tight and are essentially identical in design and fit to underwear garments
(5). See 58 FR 4078, January 13, 1993.

E. Response to ANPR 


In response to the ANPR, the Commission received more than 2,100 written comments from individuals, firms, and organizations.
Comments were received from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and from
United States citizens living abroad (3), (6). More than 95 percent of these comments favored modification of the
standards to exempt some or all children's sleepwear garments from their requirements. More than one-third of all
comments received in response to the ANPR were in the form of prepared letters with space for the commenter's name,
or letters that were identical in their wording (3), (6). 
The significant issues raised by those comments and the Commission's assessment of those issues is set forth below.



1. Should Consumers Be Able To Purchase Non-Complying Sleepwear Garments if They Desire? 


Several comments express the view that consumers should be able to purchase children's sleepwear which does not meet
the flammability requirements of the children's sleepwear standards_ specifically, children's sleepwear made
from untreated 100 percent cotton_rather than garments which are manufactured to comply with the children's sleepwear
standards if they choose to do so. Many of these comments state that parents are the parties with primary responsibility
for their children's safety. A large number of comments from consumers stated that parents prefer to dress their children
in cotton garments for sleeping. Reasons given for preferring untreated 100 percent cotton sleepwear include lower
price, increased comfort to the wearer, and the avoidance of skin irritation or unpleasant odors which some comments
assert are associated with certain man-made fabrics or fabrics with flame-retardant treatment. Some of these comments
express the view that both children's sleepwear standards should be revoked in their entirety (6). 
Other comments express the view that the government has a duty to establish mandatory safety requirements to protect
children from risks of death and serious injury, and that consumer preference must yield to mandatory requirements
needed to protect children from serious burn hazards (6). 
Some comments urge the Commission to extend the flammability requirements of the children's sleepwear standards
to cover other children's garments_specifically garments made from light-weight fabrics and long underwear (6).

The Commission observes that section 4 of the FFA (15 U.S.C. 1193) authorizes the agency to issue or amend mandatory
requirements for the flammability of wearing apparel only when such requirements are ``

needed to adequately protect the public 

against 

unreasonable risk of the occurrence of fire 

leading to death, injury, or significant property damage.'' (Emphasis added.) If a flammability standard has been
issued under the FFA to address an unreasonable risk of fire deaths or injuries associated with a particular type or
class of garments, that standard cannot be amended or revoked solely to accommodate consumer preference for noncomplying
garments. 
However, section 4 of the FFA further requires that in order to issue or amend a standard, the Commission must find,
among other things, that the standard or amendment is ``limited'' to include only those garments which have been determined
to present an ``unreasonable risk'' of burn deaths or injuries, or significant property damage. Consequently, if
the coverage of the children's sleepwear standards currently includes garments which do not present an unreasonable
risk of fire leading to death, injury, or significant property damage, the Commission concludes that the scope of
the standards could be narrowed to remove those garments from the coverage of the standards. 
For the same reasons, a flammability standard cannot be broadened to include other types of garments unless the Commission
finds that those other types of garments present an ``unreasonable risk'' of fire resulting in death, injury, or significant
property damage. 
In the course of this rulemaking proceeding, the Commission has reviewed information about burn injuries and deaths
associated with children's sleepwear garments and other types of children's clothing since 1980. On average, each
year about four children younger than fifteen years of age died from fires associated with clothing of all types (10).

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941025-1-00025 </DOCNO>

<TEXT>
 

From its review of burn injury data, the Commission estimates that on average, about 1,150 children were treated each
year in hospital emergency rooms for burn injuries associated with clothing of all types during the period from 1980
through 1993. Of that total, the Commission estimates that each year, about 90 burn injuries to children were associated
with sleepwear, about 860 were associated with day wear, and about 200 were associated with other types of clothing
or unspecified types of clothing (10). 
From available data, the Commission estimates that virtually no infants younger than one year old were treated in
hospital emergency rooms for burn injuries associated with clothing. The Commission also found that most thermal
burn injuries associated with sleepwear involved females, whereas most burn injuries associated with daywear involved
males. Thermal burn injuries from nightwear were usually associated with nightgowns or pajamas that probably were
not tight-fitting (10). 
This review of information about burn deaths and injuries associated with children's clothing suggests that the
children's sleepwear standards in their current form may cover certain garments which do not present an unreasonable
risk of burn deaths or injuries: specifically, sleepwear garments for infants younger than one year of age, and some
tight-fitting sleepwear garments for children ranging in age from one to about fifteen years old. 
This information also indicates that notwithstanding the existence of mandatory flammability requirements for
children's sleepwear for more than 20 years, burn injuries to children continue to be associated with sleepwear,
particularly nightgowns and pajamas (10). For this reason, the Commission concludes that the injury data do not support
revocation of the children's sleepwear standards in their entirety. Finally, from this review of information about
burn deaths and injuries, the Commission is unable to identify other specific types of children's clothing which
may present an unreasonable risk of burn deaths or injuries. For this reason, the Commission is unable to find support
from the injury data for extension of the requirements of the children's sleepwear standards to other types of children's
garments. 


2. Can the Protection Afforded to Children by the Sleepwear Standards Be Maintained if Garments in Infant Sizes and
Tight-Fitting Garments Are Exempted From the Standards? 


This question is the principal issue raised by the ANPR and was the subject of many comments. In order to address this
issue, the Commission must also consider its correlative: To what extent have the sleepwear standards prevented
burn deaths and injuries to children? 
After careful consideration of the events leading to issuance of the children's sleepwear standards and all available
information about burn injuries and deaths associated with children's sleepwear, the Commission is not able to estimate
quantitatively the number of burn deaths and injuries which may have been avoided because of the requirements of those
standards. Statistically projectable data are not available about the numbers of deaths and burn injuries associated
with children's sleepwear before the issuance of the standard for sizes 0 through 6X (6). Data compiled by the Commission
show a measurable reduction in burn deaths and injuries associated with all types of clothing, including children's
sleepwear, during the past 20 years (6). 
However, as many commenters observed, the household environment has also changed during that time period. The number
of persons who smoke cigarettes has declined, contributing to a reduction in the number of lighters and matches in
the nation's households (6), (14). Voluntary standards have been issued or revised to address many sources of ignition
in the household, including gas-fueled ranges and space heaters and kerosene heaters. As noted in the ANPR, sales
of both gas-fueled ranges and kerosene heaters have declined in recent years (4). 
After considering all available information, the Commission has reason to believe that the children's sleepwear
standards have contributed to the general decline in burn deaths and injuries associated with clothing, but cannot
quantitatively assess the extent of that contribution. 


a. Can Sleepwear Garments for Infants Be Exempted From the Standard for Sizes 0 Through 6X Without Reducing the Level
of Protection That Standard Provides? 


Many comments urge the Commission to exempt sleepwear garments intended to be worn by infants younger than one year
old from the requirements of the standard. These comments observe that infants who are not capable of moving by themselves
are not at risk of exposing their clothing to an ignition source (6). 
Another group of comments opposes exempting garments in infant sizes. These comments state that the Commission considered
and rejected such an exemption in 1978. Other comments opposed to such an exemption state that sleepwear garments
for infants are not labeled to specify the age of the intended wearer, but rather the body measurements of the intended
wearer (6).

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941025-1-00026 </DOCNO>

<TEXT>
 

The Commission has reviewed information about burn deaths and injuries to children younger than one year old associated
with sleepwear, including a report prepared in 1978 in conjunction with a proposed exemption for sleepwear garments
smaller than size 1 (11). The 1978 report discussed 66 cases in which children younger than one year old sustained burn
injuries associated with clothing. In ten cases, the clothing involved was specifically identified as sleepwear;
nine of these involved whole-house conflagrations and the other involved a home-made sleepwear garment. Consequently,
none of these cases involved risks of injury which the sleepwear standards were intended to address. In all but two
of the ten cases involving sleepwear garments, the burn victims were older than six months (11). 
After considering comments received in response to the ANPR (6), child development literature (12), and available
injury data (10), the Commission finds that the sleepwear garments intended for children younger than six months
of age may not present an unreasonable risk of burn deaths or injuries to children. For this reason, the Commission
has reason to believe that the standard for sizes 0 through 6X in its existing form may not be limited to those garments
which present an unreasonable risk of fire leading to death, personal injury, or significant property damage, as
required by section 4(b) of the FFA. Consequently, the Commission has preliminarily decided that garments in sizes
suitable for children younger than six months of age could be exempted from the requirements of the sleepwear standard
for sizes 0 through 6X without decreasing the protection afforded by that standard. The Commission also concludes
that the exemption should be stated in terms of maximum dimensions for the chest and length of the garment. Separate
maximum length dimensions are specified for one-piece and two-piece garments. The maximum dimensions specified
were selected by considering body sizes of children approximately six months old as set forth in ASTM standard D 4910-89
``Standard Tables of Body Measurements for Infants, Ages 0 to 18 months,'' published by ASTM (formerly the American
Society for Testing and Materials) (12). 
The proposed amendment also requires that an exempted infant garment must be labeled with the words and figures ``0
to 6 mos.'' The label required by the proposed amendment is for the use of the Commission staff when determining whether
a garment is exempted from the requirements of the children's sleepwear standard because it is intended to be worn
by infants younger than six months old. For this reason, it is not required to be permanently attached to the garment,
but must be visible to the consumer when the garment is offered for sale at retail. 
In addition to meeting the dimensional and labeling requirements, garments in infant sizes must meet the applicable
requirements of the flammability standards for clothing textiles and vinyl plastic film (16 CFR parts 1610 and 1611)
to be eligible for the exemption from the children's sleepwear standard made by the amendment proposed below. 


b. Can Tight-Fitting Garments Be Exempted From the Sleepwear Standards Without Reducing the Protection They Provide?



Many of the comments favoring exemption of tight-fitting garments from the children's sleepwear standard express
the view that cotton sleepwear is as safe or safer than sleepwear which complies with the applicable standard. Other
comments express support for an exemption of tight-fitting garments from the sleepwear standards if available information
demonstrates that such an exemption would not reduce the protection against burn injuries provided by the standards.
A small number of comments express the view that the standards should not be changed because they have effectively
reduced risks of serious burn injuries to children from ignition of sleepwear garments (6). 
After careful consideration of all comments on this issue (6), technical literature (8), (11), injury data (10),
and provisions of sleepwear standards in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom (11), the Commission
concludes that tight-fitting garments could be exempted from the standards without reducing the level of protection
against burn injuries which they provide to children. 
Currently available information from technical literature demonstrates that tight-fitting garments are less
likely to contact an ignition source and, if ignited, burn less rapidly than loose-fitting garments (8), (11). Burn
injury data indicate that in the event of clothing ignition, burn injuries associated with close-fitting garments
are less severe than those associated with loose-fitting garments (10).

As noted in the ANPR, the Canadian standard for children's sleepwear prescribes flammability requirements for pajamas,
nightgowns, and robes which are similar to the requirements of the sleepwear standards codified at 16 CFR parts 1615
and 1616. However, the Canadian standard provides that close-fitting polo pajamas and sleepers, as well as sleepwear
garments in infant sizes and sleepwear garments used in hospitals shall meet less stringent flammability requirements
which are similar to those of the standard for clothing textiles codified at 16 CFR part 1610 (4). 
By letter dated September 13, 1993, the Director of Product Safety of the Canadian government advised the Commission
that since promulgation of the Canadian sleepwear standards in 1987, no burn deaths associated with children's sleepwear
have been reported in Canada. The Director of Product Safety added that a planned five-year study to collect data about
burn injuries associated with children's sleepwear in Canada had been discontinued because of a lack of burn cases
(11). 
For these reasons, the Commission concludes that to the extent the children's sleepwear standards in their current
form are applicable to tight-fitting sleepwear garments, they may apply to some garments which are not associated
with an unreasonable risk of burn deaths and injuries and may not be limited to those garments which present an unreasonable
risk, as required by section 4(b) of the FFA. 
Several comments address the issue of defining the term ``tight-fitting'' garment. Some comments suggest exempting
specific types of garments such as ``ski pajamas'' or ``long johns.'' Others state that exempted garments should
be required to have specific features, such as tight cuffs at the wrists and ankles. Some comments observe that the
Department of Commerce has withdrawn the commercial standard for sizing of children's apparel which is cited in both
children's sleepwear standards (6). 
Section 4(b) of the FFA requires that a flammability standard must be ``stated in objective terms.'' The amendments
proposed below exempt ``tight-fitting'' sleepwear garments from the standard for sizes 0 through 6X and the standard
for sizes 7 through 14. The proposed amendments define the term ``tight- fitting garment'' by specifying maximum
dimensions for the following parts of the garment: Chest, waist, seat, upper arm, thigh, wrist, and ankle (12). The
proposed amendments specify the specific points on the garment at which measurements are taken to calculate the maximum
dimensions. 
The maximum dimensions specified for garments in sizes for infants six to 24 months old were selected by considering
body sizes of children approximately six months old set forth in a proposed revision of ASTM standard D 4910 (12). The
maximum dimensions selected for the various locations on the garment in each size from 2 through 6X are based on dimensions
specified in a draft ASTM standard tentatively designated ``Standard Table of Body Measurements for Pre-School
Children Sizes 2-6X/7.'' (12) The ASTM committee which is developing this draft standard has several members
who are employed by manufacturers of children's garments as well as members from academic institutions. 
Maximum dimensions of the specified locations on garments in sizes 7 through 14 are based on a report of an anthropometric
study of children ranging in age from infancy to the age of 18 years, conducted in 1977 by the University of Michigan
(12). Maximum dimensions are given for both boys' and girls' garments in the proposed definition of ``tight-fitting
garment'' for the standard for sizes 7 through 14. The Commission is aware that at this time sleepwear garments are
not marketed in girls' sizes 9, 11, and 13. However, dimensions for those sizes are provided in the proposed amendments
to the standard for size 7 through 14 published below. Garments which are not explicitly labeled and promoted for use
by girls must meet the maximum dimensions listed for boys' garments in each size to be exempted from the requirements
of the sleepwear standard for sizes 7 through 14. 
To be eligible for the exemption from the requirements of the children's sleepwear standards, a tight-fitting garment
must not exceed the maximum dimensions specified for each size in the amendments proposed below. The proposed amendments
also require that an exempted garment must be labeled to indicate the size to which it was manufactured. The size label
required by the proposed amendment is for the use of the Commission staff when determining whether a garment meets
the dimensional requirements for an exempt sleepwear garment. For this reason, the label is not required to be permanently
affixed to the garment, but it must be visible when the garment is offered for sale to consumers. 
The proposed amendments also require that when offered for sale to consumers, exempted garments in sizes for 6 to 9
months and larger must be clearly and conspicuously labeled with a statement to advise consumers that the garment
is not flame-resistant and should be tight-fitting for the safety of the child. If the proposed amendments are issued
on a final basis, this labeling statement will be one component of an information and education campaign to advise
consumers that the safety of these sleepwear garments is dependent upon their tight fit. 
Finally, garments exempted from the flammability requirements of the amendments proposed below must comply with
applicable provisions of the flammability standards for clothing textiles and vinyl plastic film (16 CFR parts 1610
and 1611). 


c. Alternatives to an Exemption for Sleepwear Garments in Infant Sizes and for Tight-fitting Garments 


Some comments suggest that rather than exempt sleepwear garments in infant sizes and tight-fitting garments from
the sleepwear standards, the Commission should provide additional guidance about the differences between children's
sleepwear and non-sleepwear garments, including long underwear (6).

As discussed above, since 1984, the Commission staff has 
attempted to clarify the standards' definitions of ``children's 
sleepwear'' garments by written descriptions and drawings and to 
distinguish sleepwear from non-sleepwear garments in a 
publication distributed to the children's garment industry. 
However, the staff has not been able to provide definitive 
guidance that resolves all questions about the distinction 
between sleepwear and non-sleepwear garment. Constantly changing 
styles and fashions in children's apparel have been a major 
obstacle to this effort. The Commission has reason to believe 
that further attempts to provide guidance through additional 
revisions of the staff enforcement policy guides are not likely 
to meet with success (6), (17). 
 Some comments suggest that the Commission should require 
labeling of all children's sleepwear garments to indicate their 
relative flammability. Other comments urge the Commission to 
require labeling of those sleepwear garments which do not meet 
the flammability requirements of the children's sleepwear 
standards. These comments state that labeling of some or all 
children's sleepwear garments would be preferable to prohibiting 
the sale of garments which do not comply with the requirements of 
the children's sleepwear standards (6). 
 Research into the effectiveness of labeling indicates that 
in order for a label to be effective, it must be: (1) Noticed, 
(2) read and understood, and (3) acted upon. That research also 
indicates that as consumers become more familiar with a product, 
they are more likely to ignore information about the product. 
Additionally, if a product is not perceived as hazardous, the 
likelihood is greater that a label will go unnoticed (12). 
 Children's sleepwear garments are products that are familiar 
to most consumers. Generally, those garments are not perceived 
as presenting a safety hazard. Most sleepwear garments offered 
for sale to consumers bear labels stating size, price, fiber 
content, and laundering instructions. All of these factors 
decrease the likelihood that consumers would notice and read 
additional label information about the flammability of the 
garment (12). 
 Even if a label is noticed and read, its message must also 
be understood before it can be acted upon. Explaining the nature 
of the flammability hazard associated with children's sleepwear 
and the steps that should be taken to avoid the hazard would be 
extremely difficult given the limited space that would be 
available on a label (12). For these reasons, the Commission 
concludes that labeling some or all children's sleepwear garments 
would not be effective as the sole means to communicate the 
flammability hazard associated with those garments or a practical 
alternative to the performance requirements of the standards. 


F. Preliminary Regulatory Analysis 
 

As noted above, section 4(i) of the FFA requires the notice 
of proposed rulemaking to contain a regulatory analysis 
consisting of: (1) A preliminary description of potential 
benefits and potential costs of the proposed standard or 
amendment, and an indication of those likely to receive the 
benefits and to bear the costs; (2) a discussion of the reasons 
for not publishing any existing standard submitted in response to 
the ANPR as the proposed standard or amendment, and for 
concluding that any statement of intent to develop or modify a 
voluntary standard to address the risk of injury under 
consideration is not likely to result in the development of an 
adequate voluntary standard; and (3) a description of any 
reasonable alternatives to the proposed standard or amendment, 
together with a summary description of potential benefits and 
costs of each alternative and a brief explanation of why each 
such alternative has not been published as the proposed standard 
or amendment. 


1. Potential Benefits of the Proposed Amendments 
 

One potential benefit of the proposed amendments is that a 
greater variety of children's sleepwear will be available to 
consumers (14).

Consumers may also benefit from decreases in relative prices of children's sleepwear because of increased penetration
of the sleepwear market by imported goods. Costs of testing and uncertainty about the applicability of the children's
sleepwear standards may have restrained imports of sleepwear to the United States in recent years. Imported garments
account for only nine percent of all children's sleepwear sold in 1992, whereas imported garments constituted 52
percent of all sales of adult sleepwear. The exemptions from the children's sleepwear standards made by the amendments
proposed below are expected to increase imports of lower- and mid-priced garments, resulting in greater competition
within the sleepwear industry, and lower prices to consumers (14). 
If consumers elect to dress their children in tight-fitting sleepwear garments which are exempted from the requirements
of the children's sleepwear standards by the amendments proposed below in place of loose-fitting non-sleepwear
garments, the number of burn deaths and injuries associated with non-sleepwear garments worn by children when sleeping
may decrease (8), (12), (14). 
Additionally, domestic manufacturers who decide to produce garments exempted by the proposed amendments may also
enjoy greater sales. The ability of domestic manufacturers to produce children's sleepwear garments from cotton
rather than man-made fabrics customarily used in the production of complying children's sleepwear may lead to reduced
prices of children's sleepwear (14). 


2. Potential Costs of the Proposed Amendments 


The potential cost of the exemptions to the children's sleepwear standards made by the proposed amendment is the possibility
of increased societal costs of future burn deaths or injuries associated with the exempted garments (14). However,
the Commission has reason to believe that few if any additional burn deaths or injuries to children will result from
the proposed amendments. 
On the basis of epidemiological data, the Commission expects that exempting sleepwear garments in infant sizes from
the requirements of the sleepwear standards will not result in increased risk of burn injuries to children younger
than six months of age. Infants younger than six months old are not capable of moving by themselves, and for that reason
are not likely to come within range of ignition sources when an adult is not present (11), (12). 
As noted above, the household environment in which children wear sleepwear has changed since the first sleepwear
standard was issued in 1971. The number of adults who smoke cigarettes has declined by about 20 million since 1974,
resulting in the presence of fewer matches and lighters in the nation's households. Ignition hazards presented by
ranges and space heaters have also decreased (6), (14).

<PARENT> FR941025-1-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Commission also observes that in 1970, sales of all children's sleepwear garments averaged about one and one-half
garments per child (14), (15). The average number of sleepwear garments purchased per child each year has not changed
appreciably since 1970 (14), (15). Because it is reasonable to assume that children use several garments as sleepwear
during the course of a year, a logical inference is that children have probably always used more non-sleepwear garments
for sleeping than garments manufactured to comply with the children's sleepwear standards (14). Consequently,
providing an exemption from the requirements of the standards for a limited class of sleepwear garments in infant
sizes and tight-fitting garments is not expected to increase risks of burn deaths and injuries associated with children's
sleepwear. 


3. Existing Standards and Statements of Intent To Develop a Voluntary Standard 


No existing standard was submitted for publication as the proposed standard in response to the ANPR. No statement
of intent to develop or modify a voluntary standard was submitted in response to the ANPR. 


4. Alternatives to the Proposed Amendments 


a. Make No Change to the Standards 


There would be no change in burn deaths and injuries to children which might otherwise be attributable to the proposed
amendments. Consumers would forgo all potential benefits of increased choice of children's sleepwear garments
and reductions in prices that might result from issuance of the proposed amendments (14). 


b. Do Not Amend the Standards; Issue a Statement of Policy to the Effect That the Commission Will Not Apply the Standards
to Garments in Infant Sizes or Tight-fitting Sleepwear Garments


While this alternative might result in some benefits of increased choice and lower prices to consumers, domestic
manufacturers and importers might be reluctant to change business practices in reliance on such a policy statement
because of uncertainty about future Commission decisions to change that policy. Such uncertainty might result in
continued low levels of imported sleepwear garments and little if any domestic production of exempted garments subject
to the provisions of the policy statement (14). 


G. Impact on Small Businesses 


In accordance with section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the Commission hereby certifies
that the amendments to the children's sleepwear standards proposed below will not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities, including small businesses, if issued on a final basis (14). 
The amendments proposed below would provide an exemption from the requirements of the children's sleepwear standards
for certain sleepwear garments in infant sizes and certain tight-fitting sleepwear garments. However, no importer
or domestic manufacturer is required to produce the exempted garments. Consequently, any economic impact of the
proposed amendments, either positive or negative, will result from business decisions of regulated firms rather
than any provision of the proposed amendments (14). 


H. Environmental Considerations 


The proposed amendments fall within the categories of Commission actions described at 16 CFR 1021.5(c) that have
little or no potential for affecting the human environment. Because the proposed amendments, if issued on a final
basis, will not change any aspect of the testing required by the standard, the proposed action does not have any potential
to produce significant environmental effects. For that reason, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.

ACTION:

 Proposed rule.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 USEPA proposes to approve Ohio's Rule 3745-35-07, entitled ``Federally Enforceable Limitations on Potential to
Emit'' and submitted April 20, 1994, as a revision to Ohio's State Implementation Plan (SIP). USEPA further proposes
to authorize Ohio to include such limitations as conditions within federally enforceable State operating permits
(FESOPs). In the final rules section of this Federal Register, the USEPA is approving Ohio's Rule 3745-35-07 as a direct
final rule without prior proposal because USEPA views the action as noncontroversial and anticipates no adverse
comments. A detailed rationale for the approval is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received
in response to that direct final rule, no further activity is contemplated in relation to the proposal of that action.
If USEPA receives adverse public comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received
will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed rule. USEPA will not institute a second comment
period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The EPA is proposing to approve the State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of South Dakota
for the purpose of establishing a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance
Program (PROGRAM). The implementation plan was submitted by the State to satisfy the Federal mandate, found in section
507 of the Clean Air Act (CAA), to ensure that small businesses have access to the technical assistance and regulatory
information necessary to comply with the CAA. In the final rules section of this 

Federal Register

, the EPA is approving the South Dakota PROGRAM in a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views
this submittal as noncontroversial and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval is
set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to this proposed rule, no further
activity is contemplated in relation to this rule. If the EPA receives adverse comments, then the direct final will
be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed rule.
The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this document. Any parties interested in commenting on this document
should do so at this time.

Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Notice of Public Hearings and Reopening of Comment Period on Proposed
Extension of Endangered Status for the Jaguar in the United States 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of public hearings and reopening of comment period.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) gives notice that three public hearings will be held, and the comment
period reopened, regarding the proposed rule to extend endangered species status to the jaguar (

Panthera onca

) in the United States. These hearings and reopening of the comment period will allow all interested parties to submit
oral or written comments on the proposal.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


The jaguar is currently listed as endangered from the border between the United States and Mexico southward including
Mexico, Central America, and South America. In the United States the primary threat to this species is from shooting.
Loss and modification of the jaguar's habitat may have also contributed to their decline.

While no breeding population of the jaguar is known to survive in the U.S., the species is present in northern Mexico,
and wandering individuals occasionally cross the border. Jaguars historically occurred in Arizona, New Mexico,
Texas, and possibly, Louisiana and California. A minimum of 64 jaguars were killed in Arizona since 1900. The most
recent was in 1986. A proposed rule to extend endangered status to the jaguar in the U.S., without critical habitat,
was published in the 

Federal Register

 on July 13, 1994 (59 FR 35674).

Pursuant to 50 CFR 424.16(c)(2), the Service may extend or reopen a comment period upon finding that there is good cause
to do so. The Service has determined that good cause exists, in that full participation of the affected public in the
species listing process will allow the Service to consider the best scientific and commercial data available in making
a final determination on the proposed action. 
Section 4(b)(5)(E) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq

.), requires that a public hearing be held if requested within 45 days of the publication of a proposed rule. In response
to numerous requests, the Service is holding three hearings. The three public hearings will be held on the dates and
at the addresses described above. 
Anyone wishing to make an oral statement for the record is encouraged to provide a written copy of their statement and
present it to the Service at the start of the hearing. In the event there is a large attendance, the time allotted for
oral statements may have to be limited. Oral and written statements receive equal consideration. There are no limits
to the length of written comments presented at the hearings or mailed to the Service. To facilitate the uninhibited
exchange of information, cameras and videotape recorders will not be allowed within the public hearing rooms. Legal
notices announcing the dates, times, and locations of the hearings will be published in newspapers concurrently
with this 

Federal Register

 notice.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) gives notice that the comment period on the data pertaining to the subspecies
taxonomy of the California gnatcatcher is extended for a third time. The notice of availability opening the public
comment period was published on June 2, 1994, which opened the comment period until August 1, 1994. On July 28, 1994,
the Service extended the comment period to August 31, 1994. On August 26, 1994, the Service extended the comment period
again to October 31, 1994. This notice extends the comment period until December 1, 1994, as a result of a court order
made on September 30, 1994.

Background




On March 30, 1993, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) published a final rule in the 

Federal Register

 determining the coastal California gnatcatcher to be a threatened species (58 FR 16741). In its decision to the list
the gnatcatcher, the Service relied, in part, on taxonomic studies conducted by Dr. Jonathan Atwood of the Manomet
Bird Observatory, Manomet, Massachusetts. As is the standard practice in the scientific community, the Service
did not request, nor was it offered, the data collected and used by Dr. Atwood in reaching his conclusions. Instead,
the Service depended upon the conclusions published by Dr. Atwood in a peer-reviewed scientific article on the subspecific
taxonomy of the California gnatcatcher (Atwood 1991).

In response to a suit filed by the Endangered Species Committee of the Building Industry Association of Southern California
and the other plaintiffs, the United States District Court of the District of Columbia vacated the listing of the coastal
California gnatcatcher because the Service did not make available Atwood's data for public review and comment. In
response to the court decision, Dr. Atwood released his data to the Service, which the agency made available to the
public for review and comment on June 2, 1994 (59 FR 28508). On June 16, 1994, the court reinstated threatened status
for the coastal California gnatcatcher until the Secretary of the Interior determines in a finding whether the listing
should be revised or revoked in light of his review of the subject data and public comments received during the comment
period. As a result of the court order of July 27, 1994, the Secretary must publish this finding in the 

Federal Register

 by December 31, 1994.

On July 1, 1994, the plaintiffs requested a 100-day extension in the comment period. Because the Secretary had no objection
to a 30-day extension, both parties agreed to an extension in the comment period to August 31, 1994, which the Service
published in the 

Federal Register

 on July 28, 1994 (59 FR 38426). On July 27, 1994, the court ordered the comment period extended to October 31, 1994. The
Service published this extension in the 

Federal Register

 on August 26, 1994 (59 FR 44125).

In order that the plaintiffs may depose Dr. Atwood regarding his studies of the gnatcatcher, the court ordered on September
30, 1994, that the comment period be extended again to December 1, 1994. In addition, the court ordered that the Secretary
publish the finding whether the listing should be revised or revoked in the 

Federal Register

 by February 1, 1995.

ACTION: 

Proposed rule; notice of reopening of comment period.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announces a reopening of the comment period on the proposed rule to list the
goliath frog (

Conraua goliath

) as threatened through to November 1, 1994, in order to allow additional time for receipt of comments from affected
countries.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background


Following the receipt and review of a petition dated April 9, 1991, to add the goliath frog to the List of Endangered
and Threatened Wildlife, the Service proposed in a September 12, 1991, 

Federal Register 

notice (56 FR 46397) to list the goliath frog as threatened. The information received in response to the request for
comments contained in the proposed rule, as well as the comments received at the March 2-13, 1992, meeting of
the Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), left questions
as to whether listing under the Act is warranted. Consequently, a final decision has yet to be announced, and the comment
period was reopened on July 19, 1994 (59 FR 36737) to close on October 17, 1994.

Additional information was requested from the CITES Management Authorities of the range countries, i.e., Cameroon,
Equatorial Guinea, and Gabon, before September 10, 1994. However, the official contact with those countries through
the U.S. Embassies in those countries was completed at a later date. Therefore, in order to provide adequate opportunity
to receive additional information those countries were informed that their comments would be accepted until November
1, 1994.

 Notice of proposed rulemaking. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In response to a recommendation by the National Performance Review, this proposed revision to the grants management
common rule, ``Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements to State and Local Governments,''
originally issued in the March 11, 1988, 

Federal Register

, is issued to raise the dollar threshold for simplified procedures for small purchases (simplified acquisition
threshold) by State and local grantees. The agencies' common rule provides uniform fiscal and administrative requirements
applicable to all types of grants and cooperative agreements to State and local governments.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


Background 


In 1983, a 20-agency task force explored streamlining grants management and reviewed OMB Circular A-102, ``Uniform
Administrative Requirements for Grants to State and Local Governments.'' As part of that effort, on June 18, 1984,
OMB published a Notice in the 

Federal Register

 (49 FR 24958-24959) seeking comments on over 50 issues and possible options for each. 



OMB and the agencies then drafted a governmentwide ``common rule.'' The proposed common rule contained fiscal and
administrative requirements for grants and cooperative agreements to State and local governments (grantees) and
subrecipients which are State and local governments (subgrantees). At the same time, OMB and the agencies prepared
a revised OMB Circular A-102_directed solely to Federal agencies_containing guidance to Federal agencies
on how they should manage the award and administration of Federal grants. 



On March 12, 1987, the President directed all affected agencies to simultaneously propose and subsequently adopt
a common rule verbatim, except where inconsistent with specific statutory requirements. Twenty-three agencies
proposed a governmentwide grants management common rule in the June 9, 1987 

Federal Register

 (52 FR 21820-21862). 



On March 11, 1988, OMB published the final revised Circular A-102, dated March 3, 1988, in the 

Federal Register

 (53 FR 8028-8032). On the same date, 24 Federal agencies published the final governmentwide common rule in the


Federal Register

 (53 FR 8034-8103). The Circular became effective immediately while the common rule did not become effective
until October 1, 1988. On June 30, 1992, the Commission on the Bicentennial of the United States Constitution closed
and thus will not be joining this proposed rulemaking. On November 24, 1992 and August 16, 1993, two more agencies co-signed
the governmentwide common rule (at 57 FR 55092 and 58 FR 43270). On April 4, 1994, the functions of ACTION were transferred
to the Corporation for National and Community Service. 



On November 4, 1988, OMB published a proposal in the 

Federal Register

 (53 FR 44710-44714) to replace OMB Circulars A-102 and A-110 with a circular that would provide OMB
guidance to Federal agencies on how they should manage the award and administration of Federal grants to both governmental
and non-governmental organizations. In addition, the Federal agencies simultaneously issued a proposed rule in
the 

Federal Register

 (53 FR 44716-44812) to amend the March 11, 1988, common rule to establish fiscal and administrative requirements
on non-governmental grantees as well. However, based on comments received, on October 29, 1990, in the Unified Agenda
of Federal Regulations, OMB stated that it ``no longer plans to merge these circulars'' (55 FR 45289-45290).




In September 1993, in 

Creating a Government that Works Better and Costs Less,

 the National Performance Review (NPR) made a recommendation to ``Simplify administration by modifying the common
grant rules on small purchases'' (FSL05). Specifically, NPR recommended an increase in the dollar threshold for
small purchases (simplified acquisition threshold) by local governments from $25,000 to $100,000. NPR also made
a companion recommendation in the area of reinventing Federal procurement to ``Establish new simplified acquisition
threshold and procedures'' (PROC04). This recommendation sought legislation to simplify small purchases by raising
the threshold for the use of simplified acquisition procedures from $25,000 to $100,000. 



In a February 1994 accompanying report of the NPR entitled 

Creating a Government that Works Better & Costs Less_Strengthening the Partnership in Intergovernmental Service
Delivery,

 NPR elaborated on recommendation FSL05. NPR stated, ``Local governments have found the $25,000 limit to be overly
restrictive, especially for the purchase of small vehicles that often exceed this amount. For example, to procure
one small van with federal funds to satisfy Americans with Disabilities Act requirements, grantees must formally
advertise and solicit sealed public bids. This requirement delays the procurement process and prevents grantees
from acquiring rolling stock quickly'' (page 21). 



Therefore, we are proposing to amend the grants management common rule accordingly.

In many cases, State and local governments set a small purchase threshold below the Federal small purchase threshold.
State and local governments are encouraged to amend their thresholds in similar fashion so that grantees will be able
to more fully benefit from the change in Federal requirements that will result from this rulemaking. 




Impact Analysis 



Executive Order 12866 





Executive Order 12866 requires that a regulatory impact analysis be prepared for ``major'' rules which are defined
in the Order as any rule that has an annual effect on the national economy of $100 million or more, or certain other specified
effects. 



The participating agencies do not believe that this proposed modification to the common rule will have an annual impact
of $100 million or more or the other effects listed in the Order. However, the proposed rule would result in some savings
to governmental organizations receiving grants or subgrants. For this reason, the participating agencies have
determined that this proposed rulemaking would not create a major rule within the meaning of the Order. 




Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 





The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)) requires that, for each rule with a ``significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities,'' an analysis must be prepared describing the rule's impact on small entities
and identifying any significant alternatives to the rule that would minimize the economic impact on small entities.




The participating agencies certify that this proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. The proposed rule does not affect the amount of funds provided in the covered programs, but
rather modifies and updates an administrative and procedural requirement that reduces burden on small entities.





Paperwork Reduction Act 





The participating agencies certify that this proposed rule would not impose any additional reporting or recordkeeping
requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35. 








Text of the Proposed Common Rule 


The text of this common rule as proposed for amendment in this document appears below: 



PART

* * * * * 





(d) 

Methods of procurement to be followed. 

(1) Procurement by 

small purchase procedures.

 Small purchase procedures are those relatively simple and informal procurement methods for securing services,
supplies, or other property that do not cost more than the greater of $100,000 or the small purchase threshold (simplified
acquisition threshold) fixed at 41 U.S.C. 403(11) (currently set at $25,000). If small purchase procedures are used,
price or rate quotations shall be obtained from an adequate number of qualified sources.

(2) Grantees and subgrantees must on request make available for awarding agency pre-award review procurement documents,
such as requests for proposals or invitations for bids, independent cost estimates, etc., when: 


* * * * * 


(ii) The procurement is expected to exceed the greater of $100,000 or the small purchase threshold and is to be awarded
without competition or only one bid or offer is received in response to a solicitation; or 
(iii) The procurement, which is expected to exceed the greater of $100,000 or the small purchase threshold, specifies
a ``brand name'' product; or 
(iv) The proposed award is more than the greater of $100,000 or the small purchase threshold and is to be awarded to other
than the apparent low bidder under a sealed bid procurement; or 
(v) A proposed contract modification changes the scope of a contract or increases the contract amount by more than
the greater of $100,000 or the small purchase threshold. 


* * * * * 


(h) Bonding requirements. 

For construction or facility improvement contracts or subcontracts more than the greater of $100,000 or the small
purchase threshold, the awarding agency may accept the bonding policy and requirements of the grantee or subgrantee
provided the awarding agency has made a determination that the awarding agency's interest is adequately protected.
If such a determination has not been made, the minimum requirements shall be as follows:
