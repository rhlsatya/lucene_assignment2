<USBUREAU>Forest Service</USBUREAU>


<DOCTITLE>Boise River Wildfire Recovery Project, Boise National Forest, Idaho</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Forest Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice; intent to prepare environmental impact statement.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Rabbit Creek, Bannock Creek and Star Gulch Wildfires burned a total of 182,000 acres in July, August, and September
of 1994. Approximately 173,000 acres burned within the boundaries of National Forest System lands. Personnel on
the Boise National Forest intend to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement to assess opportunities to salvage
the economic value of fire killed and imminently dead trees in combination with treatments to promote regeneration
of trees on forested areas, maintain or improve hydrologic conditions of affected watersheds, and protect long-term
soil site productivity. These activities are to occur on 95,000 acres of the Idaho City and Mountain Home Ranger Districts.



All proposals will provide visual resource needs on river segments eligible for wild, scenic, or recreational classification
under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, and provide for wildlife and fisheries habitat.

Past experience with wildfire timber recovery efforts on the Boise National Forest have proved that prompt action
is required to recover the economic value of fire killed trees. The trees, mostly ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir,
are expected to lose 20 to 80 percent of their economic value after just one summer season. In addition, there is an expected
benefit to watershed recovery from the slash that is created by salvage harvest operations.

Proposals for treatment of the area will be based on area burn intensity, slope characteristics, soil and land types,
wildlife habitat needs, soil erosion and sediment reduction techniques, visual quality protection, and economics.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

There are approximately 23,000 acres burned within Inventoried Roadless Areas (IRAs). The IRAs affected are Breadwinner,
Grand Mountain, Mt. Heinen and Ten Mile/Black Warrior. In addition, approximately 35,000 acres of an area recommended
for wilderness designation burned. Approximately 30,000 acres burned within the Sawtooth Wilderness.




Within the burn area are approximately 1,000 acres of the 6,865-acre Boise Basin Experimental Forest, slightly more
than 300 acres of the 445-acre Bannock Creek Research Natural Area, and approximately 100 acres of the proposed 874-acre
North Fork Boise River Research Natural Area.

Approximately 45 miles of eligible Wild, Scenic and Recreational River segments (North Fork Boise, Middle Fork Boise,
Crooked, and Bear Rivers) were included in the fire area. Many acres of wildlife and fish habitat were affected.

Burn intensities in the fire area varied considerably. Within the fire perimeter, approximately 46,000 acres burned
at high intensity, 46,000 acres burned at moderate intensity and 85,000 acres burned at low intensity. Approximately
5,000 acres inside the fire perimeter did not burn.



Proposed Action



Treat approximately 95,000 acres of National Forest System lands to recover the economic value of the timber, promote
regeneration of trees on forested areas, maintain or improve hydrologic conditions of affected watersheds, and
protect long-term soil site productivity.

Approximately 18,000 acres of suitable timber lands are not expected to regenerating naturally, and will be planted.
Of these, approximately 4,000 acres are within the IRAs. All other suitable timber acres are projected to reforest
naturally and will be monitored for natural regeneration success.

The fire area includes the Boise Basin Experimental Forest which will be treated as lands suitable for harvest.

Salvage harvest may occur in the IRAs (Breadwinner, Grand Mtn., Mt. Heinen, and Ten Mile/Black Warrior outside of
Management Area 28).

No harvest will occur within the Recommended Wilderness (Forest Plan Management Area 28 portion of the Ten Mile/Black
Warrior IRA) or the Sawtooth Wilderness.

No harvest will occur within the Research Natural Areas, or within the one-quarter mile corridor of river segments
eligible for wild or scenic classification.

In moderate to high intensity burn areas, only dead trees will be harvested. In low intensity burn areas, dead and imminently
dead trees (those with more than 75 percent of the crown scorched or infested with bark beetles) will be harvested.

Snags required for wildlife habitat or shade for regeneration will be left in all areas.

Protection of bald eagle and osprey roost trees will be achieved by maintaining a strip at least 200 feet wide along
the North Fork Boise River. Trees may be removed for public safety.

Visual quality objectives will be met on river segments eligible for recreational classification, and on trails
and roads.

Cultural resource sites will be protected.

Riparian areas will be protected.

Sensitive plant habitat which remains will be protected.

The Cottonwood drainage is important for elk calving and big game summer range, and receives high levels of use from
people. In recognition of this, the treatment prescription for this area will maintain security habitat for big game.

On areas where surplus trees occur, a combination of helicopter, skyline, jammer and tractor systems will be used
in the harvest effort. To protect watersheds and fisheries habitat, tractor logging will be limited to slopes less
than 30 percent in moderate to high intensity burn areas, and less than 40 percent in low intensity burn areas. Harvest
trees will be fully suspended from the ground during logging operations in riparian areas. One end suspension will
be allowed in skyline areas unless analysis shows full suspension is needed to limit erosion. The Idaho Forest Practices
Act and watershed and fisheries evaluation guidelines will be used to determine protection measures on streams.


Some temporary road construction will be required to access helicopter landings. Minor amounts of reconstruction
of existing roads will also be required. No roads or log landings will be constructed in the IRAs.



Issues



Initial scoping has indicated that a key issue to the Proposed Action is salvage harvesting in IRAs and the potential
effect it may have on the wilderness attributes of the area.



Alternatives to the Proposed Action



Two alternatives to the Proposed Action have been identified. They are the No Action alternative and an alternative
that would not include salvage harvesting in the IRAs. Other alternatives may be developed as issues are raised and
information is received.



Decision To Be Made



The Boise National Forest Supervisor will decide the following: what amount, type and distribution of dead and imminently
dead trees, within the fire areas are needed to maintain post-fire ecological function, how should dead and imminently
dead trees within fire areas, not needed to maintain ecosystem function be harvested, and still protect those functions,
and what forested acres need to be planted to aid ecosystem recovery.



Public Involvement Meetings



Open houses have been conducted in Boise and Idaho City, Idaho in October, 1994. Additional presentations will be
made upon request.



Agency/Public Contacts



Contacts have been made with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as to threatened and endangered species listed for
the project area, area residents, conservation groups, and timber industry. A summary of the project methodology
was mailed to key individuals, groups and agencies for a response to the Proposed Action and issues identification.
This mailing list consisted of about 350 people who are generally interested in the Boise National Forest and Idaho
City NEPA projects, and people who were interested in the Boise National Forest's Foothills Wildfire Timber Recovery
Project in 1992.



Schedule



Draft Environmental Impact Statement, November 30, 1994. Final EIS, January, 1995. Implementation, March, 1995.

Comments 


Comments concerning the proposed project and analysis should be received in writing on or before November 26, 1994.
Mail comments to Terry Padilla, Idaho City Ranger District, Boise National Forest, PO Box 129, Idaho City, ID 83631,
Telephone, (208) 364-4330. Further information can be obtained at the same location.
The comment period on the Draft Environmental Impact will be 45 days from the date the Environmental Protection Agency
publishes the notice of availability in the 

Federal Register.

The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers notice of several court rulings
related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of Draft Environmental Impact
Statements must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful
and alerts an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions. 

Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. 

v. 

NRDC, 

435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978). Also, environmental objections that could be raised at the Draft Environmental Impact Statement
stage but that are not raised until after completion of the final environmental impact statement may be waived or dismissed
by the courts. 

City of Angoon 

v. 

Hodel, 

803 F.2d 1016, 1002 (9th Cir., 1986) and 

Wisconsin Heritages, Inc. 

v. 

Harris, 

490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980). Because of these court rulings, it is very important that those interested
in this Proposed Action participate by the close of the 45 day comment period so that substantive comments and objections
are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final
environmental impact statement.

To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the Proposed Action, comments
on the Draft Environmental Impact Statement should be specific as possible. It is also helpful if comments refer to
specific pages or chapters of the draft statement. Comments may also address the adequacy of the Draft Environmental
Impact Statement or the merits of the alternatives formulated and discussed in the statement. Reviewers may wish
to refer to the Council on or chapters of the draft statement. Comments may also address the adequacy of the Draft Environmental
Impact Statement or the merits of the alternatives formulated and discussed in the statement. Reviewers may wish
to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the National
Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these points.

of information under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. chapter 35).



Agency: 

Bureau of the Census.


Title: 

1995 Panel Dress Rehearsal for the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) Redesign.


Agency Approval Number: 

None.


Type of Request: 

New collection.


Burden: 

15,230 hours.


Number of Respondents: 

15,230.


Avg Hours Per Response: 

30 minutes.


Needs and Uses: 

The proposed 1995 Dress Rehearsal is part of a program of evaluation and development emerging from a comprehensive
reassessment of SIPP. The SIPP redesign is an evolving process that has multiple developmental and testing stages.
The initial stage involved developing an automated survey instrument that incorporated numerous content and forms
design changes. The next stage involved small-scale pretests to make sure the components of the automated instrument
and case management system interact as planned. These pretests were approved under OMB number 0607-0779. The
third stage involved content tests to evaluate changes made to the pretest instrument based largely on cognitive
research and reactions to the pretest instrument. These content tests were approved under OMB number 0607-0783.
The fourth stage, the subject of this request, is a national sample dress rehearsal scheduled for February 1995, during
which the SIPP will be managed in a fully automated production environment. Full implementation is scheduled for
February 1996. These developmental stages are interspersed by an ongoing series of smaller, specifically-focused
content, instrument, and systems tests.

<USBUREAU>Foreign-Trade Zones Board</USBUREAU>





Proposed Foreign-Trade Zone_St. Clair County, Michigan; (Port Huron Customs Port of Entry) Application and Public
Hearing 



An application has been submitted to the Foreign-Trade Zones Board (the Board) by the Port Huron-St. Clair County
Industrial Development Corporation (IDC), (a Michigan non-profit corporation), requesting authority to establish
a general-purpose foreign-trade zone in St. Clair County, Michigan, within the Port Huron Customs port of entry.
The application was submitted pursuant to the provisions of the Foreign-Trade Zones Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a-81u),
and the regulations of the Board (15 CFR Part 400). It was formally filed on October 17, 1994. The applicant is authorized
to make the proposal under Act No. 154 of the Public Acts of 1963 of the State of Michigan. 

The proposed zone would consist of four sites (326 acres) in the Cities of Port Huron and Marysville and in Port Huron
Township: 

Site 1

 (Port Huron Seaway Terminal_2 acres), 2336 Military Street, Port Huron, owned by the City of Port Huron; 

Site 2

 (Port Huron Industrial Park_300 acres), 16th and Dove Streets, Port Huron, owned by the City of Port Huron; 

Site 3

 (International Industrial Park, Inc.,_15 acres), 330 Griswold Rd., Port Huron Township, owned by CIPA-USA;
and, 

Site 4

 (Wilkie Brothers Warehouse_9 acres), 1765 Michigan Avenue, Marysville, owned by Wilkie Investment and Blue Water
Investment. 

The application contains evidence of the need for zone services in the Port Huron area. Several firms have indicated
an interest in using zone procedures for warehousing/distribution of such items as sugar beet pellets, corn gluten
pellets, grain screening pellets, cull beans, woodpulp, copper and steel. No manufacturing approvals are being
sought for either site at this time. Such approvals would be requested from the Board on a case-by-case basis. 

In accordance with the Board's regulations (as revised, 57 FR 50790-50808, 10-8-91), a member of
the FTZ Staff has been designated examiner to investigate the application and report to the Board. 

As part of the investigation, the Commerce examiner will hold a public hearing on November 17, 1994, 9:00 a.m., in the
Public Meeting Room at the Municipal Office Center, 100 McMorran Boulevard, Port Huron, Michigan 48060. 

Public comment on the application is invited from interested parties. Submissions (original and 3 copies) shall
be addressed to the Board's Executive Secretary at the address below. The closing period for their receipt is December
27, 1994. Rebuttal comments in response to material submitted during the foregoing period may be submitted during
the subsequent 15-day period (to January 9, 1995). 

A copy of the application and accompanying exhibits will be available during this time for public inspection at the
following locations:




Office of the Port Director, U.S. Customs Service, 526 Water Street, Room 301, Port Huron, Michigan 48060-5471.


Office of the Executive Secretary, Foreign-Trade Zones Board, Room 3716,

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In accordance with Executive Order 11625 and 15 U.S.C. 1512, the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) is soliciting
competitive applications for its Boston Minority Business Development Center (MBDC). The purpose of the MBDC Program
is to provide business development services to the minority business community to help establish and maintain viable
minority businesses. To this end, MBDA funds organizations to identify and coordinate public and private sector
resources on behalf of minority individuals and firms; to offer a full range of client services to minority entrepreneurs;
and to serve as a conduit of information and assistance regarding minority business. The MBDC will provide service
in the Boston Metropolitan Area. The award number of the MBDC will be 01-10-95001-01.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Contingent upon the availability of Federal funds, the cost of performance for the first budget period (12 months)
from March 1, 1995 to February 29, 1996, is estimated at $222,196. The total Federal amount of $188,867 and is composed
of $184,260 plus the Audit Fee amount of $4,607. The application must include a minimum cost share 15% ($33,329) in
non-federal (cost sharing) contributions for a total project cost of $222,196. Cost sharing contributions may be
in the form of cash, client fees, third party in-kind contributions, non-cash applicant contributions or combinations
thereof.


The funding instrument for this project will be a cooperative agreement. Competition is open to individuals, non-profit
and for-profit organizations, state and local governments, American Indian tribes and educational institutions.
Applications will be evaluated on the following criteria: the knowledge, background and/or capabilities of the
firm and its staff in addressing the needs of the business community in general and, specifically, the special needs
of minority businesses, individuals and organizations (45 points), the resources available to the firm in providing
business development services (10 points); the firm's approach (techniques and methodologies) to performing the
work requirements included in the application (20 points); and the firm's estimated cost for providing such assistance
(25 points). An application must receive at least 70% of the points assigned to each evaluation criteria category
to be considered programmatically acceptable and responsive. Those applications determined to be acceptable and
responsive will then be evaluated by the Director of MBDA. Final award selections shall be based on the number of points
received, the demonstrated responsibility of the applicant, and the determination of those most likely to further
the purpose of the MBDA program. Negative audit findings and recommendations and unsatisfactory performance under
prior Federal awards may result in an application not being considered for award. The applicant with the highest point
score will not necessarily receive the award.
The MBDC shall be required to contribute at least 15% of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions.
To assist in this effort, the MBDC may charge client fees for services rendered. Fees may range from $10 to $60 per hour
based on the gross receipts of the client's business.
Periodic reviews culminating in year-to-date evaluations will be conducted to determine if funding for the project
should continue. Continued funding will be at the total discretion of MBDA based on such factors as the MBDC's performance,
the availability of funds and Agency priorities.
Anticipated processing time of this award is 120 days. Executive order 12372, ``Intergovernmental Review of Federal
Programs'', is not applicable to this program. Federal funds for this project include audit funds for non-CPA recipients.
In the event that a CPA firm wins the competition, the funds allocated for audits are not applicable. Questions concerning
the preceding information can be answered by the contact person indicated above, and copies of application kits and
applicable regulations can be obtained at the above address. The collection of information and requirements for
this project have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and assigned OMB control number 0640-0006.

Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Corporation for National and Community Service (the Corporation) is announcing that it is soliciting cash donations
and donations of goods and services from private sector companies, foundations, and individuals in order to leverage
federally appropriated resources in carrying out its national service program.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Corporation is a new government corporation that encompasses the work and staff of two previously existing federal
agencies, the Commission on National and Community Service and ACTION. The Corporation's mission is to engage Americans
of all ages and backgrounds in community-based service. This service will address the nation's education, public
safety, human, and environmental needs to achieve direct and demonstrable results. In doing so, the Corporation
will foster civic responsibility, strengthen the ties that bind us together as a people, and provide education opportunity
for those who make a substantial commitment to service.


The Corporation funds a new national service initiative called AmeriCorps that includes a wide variety of programs
operated by grantees, the National Civilian Community Corps, and the Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA) program.
The Corporation also supports service-learning initiatives for elementary and secondary schools and institutions
of higher education called Learn and Serve America, and operates the senior volunteers programs previously supported
by ACTION.
Pursuant to the National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993 (the Act), the Corporation may ``solicit, accept,
hold, administer, use, and dispose of, in furtherance of [the purposes of national service], donations of any money,
or property, real, personal, or mixed, tangible or intangible, received by gift, devise, bequest, or otherwise.''
42 U.S.C. 12651g(a)(2)(A). Such donations ``shall be considered to be a gift, devise, or bequest to, or for the use
of, the United States,'' 42 U.S.C. 12651g(a)(2)(B), and therefore may be allowable as a charitable tax deduction
under the Internal Revenue Code. 26 U.S.C. 170. The Corporation may also ``solicit and accept the voluntary services
of individuals'' to assist the Corporation in carrying out the national service program. 42 U.S.C. 12651g(a)(2)(A).
The Corporation is striving to build innovative public/private partnerships that support national and community
service programs throughout the country. The Corporation's primary goal is to foster strategic linkages between
private sector companies, foundations, government agencies, and community service organizations, in order to
multiply their combined abilities to address shared community problems. To this end, the Corporation seeks to leverage
its federally appropriated resources with donations of goods and services from private sector companies, foundations,
and individuals. Such goods and services include, but are not limited to, the following:
 apparel;
 footwear;
 food and beverages;
 communication equipment and services;
 transportation (air, bus, train tickets)
 print and broadcast media services;
 transportation equipment and services;
 computer equipment and services;
 gardening and building supplies;
 office equipment and supplies;
 books and other printed material;
 printing and duplication services;
 facilities for training and special events;
 audiovisual equipment and services;
 sporting equipment;
 arts and crafts supplies;
 marketing, public relations, and advertising services;
 financial, accounting, and legal services;
 any other goods and services that will further the mission and goals of the Corporation.



The Corporation is also interested in receiving cash donations.

the donations must further the goals and missions of the Corporation and must be economically advantageous to the
Corporation, considering foreseeable expenditures for matters such as storage, transportation, maintenance,
and distribution. The CEO will only solicit or accept, donations if the solicitation or acceptance ``will not reflect
unfavorably upon the ability of the Corporation, or of any officer or employee of the Corporation, to carry out the
responsibilities or official duties of the Corporation in a fair and objective manner; and * * * will
not compromise the integrity of the programs of the Corporation or any official or employee of the Corporation involved
in such programs.'' 42 U.S.C. 12651g(a)(2)(C). In addition, the CEO will not solicit or accept, products or services
from the manufacturers, distributors, or sellers of alcohol, tobacco, or firearms products.

 Notice of intent.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary and proposed action:

 The Los Angeles District (LAD) and the Port of Long Beach (POLB) are proposing to dredge a navigation channel from the
Queens Gate entrance of the harbor to the ^76 foot contour depth to allow vessels to enter the harbor fully loaded. The
dimensions of the proposed navigation channel are approximately 1,200 feet in width, 15,000 feet in length, to a depth
of ^76 feet MLLW (from current depths of between ^59 and ^69 MLLW). Alternative disposal scenarios for the five (5)
million cubic yards of material generated by dredging include beach nourishment (i.e., on and or near shore) at Alamitos
Peninsula, Seal, and/or Surfside/Sunset Beaches, disposal in the borrow pits located off the Long Beach oil islands
in San Pedro Bay and/or the POLB shipping channel, and/or disposal at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approved
offshore disposal site known as LA-2. Figure 1 identifies the overall project area; Figure 2 delineates the
proposed dredge area, and Figure 3 depicts potential renourishment and disposal areas. Because of the complexity
of the Figures referenced in this summary, they cannot be printed in the 

Federal Register

 but are available from the address given for the Los Angeles District, Mr. Russell Kaiser, Environmental Planning
Section.



alternatives:

 A full array of alternatives will be developed for future analyses.


The proposed plan, viable project alternatives, and the ``no action'' plan will be carried forward for detailed analysis
in the National Environmental Policy Act/California Environmental Quality Act document.



scoping process:

 Potential impacts associated with the proposed action and alternatives will be fully evaluated. Resource categories
that will be analyzed include: geology oceanography/water quality, air and noise quality, marine resources, cultural
resources, socioeconomics, land/water use, recreation, ground and vessel traffic and safety, energy, and aesthetics.
The Los Angeles District will be conducting a public scoping meeting with the Port of Long Beach on 1 November 1994,
at 7 p.m., in the Board room at the Port of Long Beach Administrative Building, 925 Harbor Plaza, Long Beach, California.

Office of Educational Research and Improvement_National Diffusion Network (NDN); Program Effectiveness Panel
(PEP) Notice of Deadline for Submitting Projects for Validation by PEP for NDN Grants


Summary:

 The NDN is a federally funded dissemination system that helps improve the quality of public and private schools, colleges,
and other educational institutions by sharing information about and assisting in the implementation of successful
education programs, products, and processes. The Department conducts a grants competition each spring to fund the
dissemination and implementation of new projects.


To be eligible to compete for NDN funds, projects must have obtained validation from the Program Effectiveness Panel
(PEP). The PEP is the NDN's primary mechanism for validating the effectiveness of educational programs developed
by schools, universities, and other entities. Based on evidence which applicants submit, the PEP judges the difficulties
of the goals which particular programs are designed to meet, whether those programs are effective in attaining their
goals, and whether similar results are likely to be attained by others who use the program. Any project or product approved
by the PEP becomes a member of the National Diffusion Network, and may begin to disseminate that project under the auspices
of the NDN, and also becomes eligible to compete for NDN funding, as desired.
This notice establishes an annual deadline by which projects must be submitted to PEP for validation. Projects received
by PEP by the deadline will receive validation results in sufficient time to determine whether the project is eligible
to compete for NDN funds in the following spring grant competition.
State educational agencies, local educational agencies, institutions of higher education, and other public or
non-profit private agencies, organizations and institutions are eligible to submit applications to PEP.


Deadline to Submit Projects for PEP Approval:

 December 31, 1994.


Submission Criteria and Information Contact:

 Notice of Arbitration Panel Decision Under the Randolph-Sheppard Act.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Notice is hereby given that on July 31, 1991, an arbitration panel rendered a decision in the matter of 

Minnesota Department of Jobs and Training, State Services for the Blind and Visually Handicapped v. Department of
Veterans Affairs (Docket No. R-S/87-8). 

This panel was convened by the Secretary of Education pursuant to the Randolph-Sheppard Act (the Act), 20 U.S.C. 107d-1(b),
upon receipt of a complaint filed by the Minnesota Department of Jobs and Training, State Services for the Blind and
Visually Handicapped on January 15, 1987. The Randolph-Sheppard Act creates a priority for blind individuals to
operate vending facilities on Federal property. Under section 107d-1(b), the State licensing agency (SLA) may file
a complaint with the Secretary if the SLA determines that an agency managing or controlling Federal property fails
to comply with the Act or regulations implementing the Act. The Secretary then is required to convene an arbitration
panel to resolve the dispute.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Pursuant to the Randolph-Sheppard Act, 20 U.S.C. 107d-2(c), the Secretary publishes a synopsis of arbitration panel
decisions affecting the administration of vending facilities on Federal property. 



Background 



The Minnesota Department of Jobs and Training, the SLA, filed an arbitration complaint under the Act stating that
it had provided vending machine services at the St. Cloud Veterans Administration Hospital since 1977 pursuant to
a contract with the Veterans Canteen Service (VCS) under which the SLA paid commissions to VCS. The contract expired
in June 1986, and the SLA requested from VCS that it be given a priority to operate the vending machines under the Act.
Subsequently, the SLA submitted to the Veterans Administration (now the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA)) a
non-competitive bid that did not include the payment of commissions to DVA by blind vendors. 
DVA denied the permit application on the grounds that the Act does not apply to DVA medical and domiciliary facilities
served by the VCS, and, therefore, all potential contractors, including the SLA, had to comply with the DVA's competitive
bidding procedures. On June 19, 1987, the U.S. Department of Education (ED), Rehabilitation Services Administration
(RSA), convened an arbitration panel to hear this dispute. In conjunction with the filing of the arbitration complaint
against DVA/VCS, the SLA obtained a Federal court injunction. On July 2, 1987, the court enjoined VCS from awarding
a vending machine contract to anyone other than the SLA pending the completion of the arbitration panel's decision.


In an Opinion and Order dated September 2, 1988, the arbitration panel convened by the Secretary (1) rejected DVA's
claim that medical facilities served by VCS were exempt from the priority provisions of the Act, finding that the narrow
exemption afforded VCS (and the military exchanges) from the income-sharing requirements of the statute did not
incorporate a broader exemption from the priority provisions; and (2) found that both the Act and the VCS statute serve
important public purposes and that the two statutes could be harmonized. The panel issued additional findings, conclusions,
and orders as follows: the priority requirement of the Act is met when prior right or an opportunity exists for a licensed
blind person to operate a vending facility. Normally this is accomplished through a permit application and approval
process. However, in particular instances negotiated arrangements other than the standard permit application
and approval process might be used that are mutually acceptable to all parties. While holding that VCS is not required
to approve the SLA's permit application for vending machine services at the Medical Center, the arbitration panel
maintained that VCS could not deny the SLA a priority for a licensed blind person to provide these services. 

The panel also held that the 17 percent commission rate on gross sales payable by the blind vendor, considering his
income, was inequitable. Because of insufficient basis or guidelines in the record, the panel withheld prescribing
any specific commission rate and ordered DVA to continue without interruption the existing arrangement under which
the blind vendor provided vending machine services at the Medical Center. However, the panel ruled that commission
payments were to be suspended until the SLA and the DVA could reach a new agreement or, in the absence of an agreement,
until the panel issued a final award. The panel retained jurisdiction during a mandated six-month negotiation period.


On February 10, 1989, DVA requested the panel to reconsider its decision, arguing that arbitration panels have no
authority to issue binding rules and orders against Federal agencies and that contracting decisions made by the VCS
Administrator are committed by law to that Administrator's sole discretion and are judicially unreviewable. 

On November 30, 1989, the panel issued an Interim Opinion and Directive. In this opinion, the panel rejected DVA's
challenge to its authority to issue orders. The panel concluded that its powers under the Act were not limited to mere
declaratory findings. The panel further ordered the parties to continue negotiations and to report back within 45
days if there were any unresolved issues at that time. The parties were specifically directed to present to the panel
a joint submission of issues, if any, that remained unresolved.

On January 24, 1990, the parties joined in a letter report to the panel stating they had not reached a contract or agreement
and that other issues still remained unresolved. 

On February 12, 1990, the SLA and DVA sent to the panel a joint statement listing the unresolved issues. By letter dated
June 19, 1990, RSA authorized the panel to reconvene and decide the issues jointly agreed upon by the parties, with
any modifications deemed appropriate by the panel. 



Arbitration Panel Decision 



After reviewing the evidence and arguments at the original hearings in 1988, DVA's Petition for Reconsideration
in 1989, and the evidence and arguments submitted at the reconvened hearing in 1990, the panel issued a final Decision
and Order dated July 31, 1991. The panel reaffirmed the findings contained in its original Opinion and Order that the
priority requirement of the Act is met when a prior right or an opportunity exists for a licensed blind person to operate
a vending facility. In view of the longstanding and recognized practice of DVA in contracting out vending machine
services and receiving commissions pursuant to authority granted to the VCS Administrator to enter into agreements
with outside suppliers for canteen services, the panel found that these contract arrangements have carried out the
mission of VCS in an effective, high-quality, and self-sustaining manner. Accordingly, the panel concluded that
the SLA, in providing vending service under a contract or agreement with VCS, should pay a commission to VCS. Upon concluding
that a 17 percent commission rate on gross sales generated at the St. Cloud Medical Center was in fact fair and equitable,
the panel ordered the SLA to pay a commission to the VCS of 17 percent effective as of the date of the issuance of the Decision
and Order. The panel found that the SLA need not pay commissions to the VCS from the effective date of the panel's order
dated September 2, 1988, suspending payment of commissions, to the effective date of this current Decision and Order.
In addition, the panel (1) held that the SLA in providing services under contract or agreement with VCS need not pay
for costs of storage and utilities; (2) concluded that, under the terms of the contract to be negotiated and executed
between the parties, VCS should have no right to install and operate its own vending machines at the Veterans Administration
Medical Center in St. Cloud; (3) directed the parties to proceed to implement by contractual arrangement the elements
tentatively agreed upon for providing vending services at the St. Cloud Medical Center as indicated in the parties'
joint progress report on July 24, 1990; (4) ordered that the contract be entered into between the SLA and VCS for a term
of five years subject to renegotiation; 
(5) ordered that disputes that may arise in negotiating the contract between the SLA and VCS be resolved in accordance
with the procedures under the Randolph-Sheppard Act until there is further clarification or delineation as to the
proper forum for resolving the particular dispute; and (6) ordered the parties to enter into an agreement for the continued
operation of vending machines by a blind person at the Medical Center in St. Cloud consistent with the Decision and
Order. 

One panel member concurred in part and dissented in part, concluding that (1) the VCS may not require the SLA or its assigned
blind vendor to pay a commission as a condition for the right to operate vending machines at the VA Medical Center in
St. Cloud; and (2) the blind vendor's assignment to a facility under the Act being for an indefinite period, the vendor's
license to operate the facility may not expire except for cause. 

The decision of the arbitration panel was appealed to the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota
by the State of Minnesota, Department of Jobs and Training, State Services for the Blind and Visually Handicapped
and, subsequently, to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit by the Department of Veterans Affairs
and the Department of Education. On March 11, 1994, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit upheld the District
Court's findings that the DVA/VCS is not exempt from the Randolph-Sheppard Act and must comply with ED regulations
on blind vendors' operation of vending facilities. Specifically, the court found that the regulations require the
issuance of permits for an indefinite period of time and prohibit the charging by VCS of commissions on sales from blind
vendors' operations without the approval of the Secretary of Education. The court rejected the VCS contention that
the Randolph-Sheppard Act's permit system interferes with its mission to provide merchandise to hospitalized veterans
at reasonable prices and to remain self-sustaining. Although the Veterans Canteen Act empowers the VCS to operate
canteens on DVA property, nothing in the Veterans Canteen Act authorizes the VCS to exercise this statutory control
over Randolph-Sheppard vendors who also operate on DVA property. Because blind vendors operate vending facilities
under the Randolph-Sheppard Act and ED regulations, the blind vendors' operation is neither a VCS canteen nor subject
to the Veterans Canteen Act and the VCS regulations. 

The views and opinions expressed by the arbitration panel do not necessarily represent the views and opinions of the
U.S. Department of Education.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Notice is hereby given that on April 13, 1992, an arbitration panel rendered a decision in the matter of 

Malcolm Graham 

v. 

Texas Commission for the Blind 

(Docket No. R-S/90-2). This panel was convened by the U.S. Department of Education pursuant to 20 U.S.C.
107d-1(a) upon receipt of the original complaint filed by petitioner Malcolm Graham on January 8, 1990. The
Randolph-Sheppard Act (the Act) creates a priority for blind individuals to operate vending facilities on Federal
property and also governs the operation of blind-operated vending facilities on State or other property. Under section
107d-1(a), a blind licensee dissatisfied with the State's operation or administration of the vending facility
program authorized under the Act may request a full evidentiary hearing from the State licensing agency (SLA). If
the licensee is dissatisfied with the State agency's decision, the licensee may complain to the Secretary, who is
then required to convene an arbitration panel to resolve the dispute. 




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Pursuant to the Randolph-Sheppard Act (20 U.S.C. 107d-2(c)), the Secretary publishes a synopsis of arbitration
panel decisions affecting the administration of vending facilities on Federal property. 


Background 


The complainant, Malcolm Graham, is a blind vendor licensed by the Texas Commission for the Blind, the SLA under the
provisions of the Act. He entered the Texas Business Enterprise Program (BEP) in April 1985 and received academic
and on-the-job training in all phases of management of a vending facility. Subsequently, Mr. Graham operated a vending
facility at the La Costa Office Park and then in 1986 moved to the Texas Supreme Court Building. 


During the early part of 1989, Mr. Graham became delinquent in payment of his quarterly sales taxes and did not respond
to payment requests from the Texas Comptroller's office. On June 15, 1989, Mr. Graham, recuperating from an accident,
went to his vending facility and encountered two agents from the Comptroller's office attempting to seize complainant's
cash register because of non-payment of sales taxes. The complainant allegedly verbally and physically assaulted
one of the agents from the Comptroller's office, who summoned police.

On June 16, 1989, the then Director of the BEP telephoned the complainant informing him of his removal from the operation
of the vending facility in the Texas Supreme Court Building. This action was followed by a written notification to
Mr. Graham detailing the reasons for his removal: failure to pay sales taxes as required by section 10 of the Texas Business
Enterprise Operations Manual; lack of proper standards of conduct and behavior as required by section 12(F) of the
manual; and endangering the SLA's investment in a facility per section 15.8(A). Mr. Graham was informed that his license
to operate a Business Enterprise Vending Facility was revoked effective July 15, 1989. The complainant was also informed
of his right to an administrative review. Subsequently, on September 28, by telegram to the Texas Commission for the
Blind, Mr. Graham requested an administrative review or full evidentiary hearing. 

The evidentiary hearing occurred on October 24, 1989, and on November 28, 1989, the hearing officer sustained the
actions of the Texas Commission for the Blind. Subsequently, Mr. Graham requested the Secretary of Education to convene
an arbitration panel to overturn the hearing officer's decision and the SLA's final agency action. A hearing of this
matter was held on February 14, 1992. 


Arbitration Panel Decision 


The arbitration panel addressed two major concerns. The first issue was whether Mr. Graham had been denied due process,
and the second issue was whether the revocation of his vendor's license constituted an appropriate response to his
violation of the Texas Business Enterprise Operations Manual. 

The arbitration panel reviewed section 16 of the Texas Commission for the Blind's BEP Operations Manual regarding
resolution of vendor dissatisfaction. The procedures provide for, first, an administrative review. If the vendor's
dissatisfaction is not resolved, the second step is a full evidentiary hearing. If the vendor is still dissatisfied,
the vendor may request that an arbitration panel be convened to resolve the dispute. 

The panel ruled that Mr. Graham did not receive an informal administrative review. However, the panel felt that the
absence of such a review did not constitute harm to the due process rights of the complainant for several reasons. The
SLA postponed the revocation of Mr. Graham's license, taking into consideration his injuries from the accident.
After the notice of license revocation on July 15, 1989, Mr. Graham responded in a telegram on September 28, 1989, with
a request for either an informal administrative review or a formal evidentiary hearing. During testimony at the arbitration
hearing, complainant acknowledged that his request was deliberate in that he did not specify which type of hearing
he was seeking. However, Mr. Graham stated he was aware of the SLA rules regarding the two types of hearings. 


The panel ruled that the Texas Commission for the Blind acted appropriately in granting the complainant's request
for an evidentiary hearing. The panel further noted that the Texas BEP Operations Manual states that revocation of
a vendor's license is not final until after a full evidentiary hearing. 

The panel concluded that the SLA did not have to wait indefinitely for a hearing request from complainant and that the
SLA's process did not harm Mr. Graham's due process rights. 


Concerning the SLA's proper termination of the vendor's license, the panel ruled that documents and testimony clearly
established the vendor's sales tax delinquency, as well as his behavior on June 15, 1989. 


Therefore, the majority of the panel ruled that the SLA's decision to revoke Mr. Graham's license rather than put him
on probation was reasonable and justified. The action taken by the SLA resulted from complainant's delinquent sales
tax liability and his inappropriate verbal and physical behavior on June 15, 1989, toward the State Comptroller's
office agent. The complainant's conduct constituted multiple violations of the SLA's Operations Manual. One panel
member dissented but declined to write a dissenting opinion. 

The views and opinions expressed by the panel do not necessarily represent the views and opinions of the U.S. Department
of Education.

<DOCTITLE>Southern Natural Gas Co.; Notice of Petition for Declaratory Order</DOCTITLE>



October 19, 1994.



Take notice that on October 13, 1994, Southern Natural Gas Company (Southern) filed in Docket No. RP95-12-000
a Petition for Declaratory Order pursuant to Rule 207 of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (Commission)
Rules of Practice and Procedure. Southern requests that the Commission declare that a certain payment that Southern
proposes to make to purchase an annuity for purposes of reducing the payment obligations arising under a restructuring
of Southern's gas purchase contract with Jim Walter Resources, Inc. (JWR), pursuant to the Commission's Order No.
636, 

et al.,

 will qualify as a GSR cost as that term is defined in Section 31.2 of the General Terms and Conditions of Southern's FERC
Gas Tariff, Seventh Revised Vol. No. 1. The petition is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.

Southern's GSR settlement with JWR provides that Southern will make monthly payments of $675,000 to JWR through the
year 2001. In order to reduce the total amount of this GSR cost, Southern proposes to make a lump-sum payment to a financial
institution to purchase an annuity or other similar financial instrument (Annuity) at a net present discounted value
to provide these monthly payments.

Southern does not seek as part of this Declaratory Order any determination on the prudence or eligibility of such one-time
payment or the prudence and eligibility of the settlement payments to JWR. Nor does Southern seek to revise its Tariff
or GSR recovery mechanisms to allow for open-ended recovery of hedging costs or the costs of other financial instruments.
Southern seeks in this proceeding the Commission's determination regarding whether the proposed purchase of an
Annuity (which would eliminate Southern's need to include in its quarterly GSR filing the $675,000 monthly payments
to JWR) would constitute an appropriate incurred cost under Section 31.2(a) of Southern's Tariff, and thereby qualify
as a GSR expense that Southern has incurred for which Southern could file to recover in accordance with the GSR recovery
mechanisms provided for in Southern's Tariff.

Upon receipt of the requested declaratory order and completion of the proposed transaction, Southern would make
a compliance filing to remove the charges presently associated with the monthly payments of $675,000 and replace
such with the Annuity purchase amount as recovered under the 3-year period provided for in Southern's Tariff.

Any person desiring to be heard or make any protest with reference to said petition should file a motion to intervene
or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with the requirements
of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211). All such motions or protests should
be filed on or before November 2, 1994. All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in determining
the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person
wishing to become a party to must file a motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. Copies of this
filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.

<AGENCY>

Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice amends the notice of a major disaster for the State of Georgia (FEMA-1033-DR), dated July 7,
1994, and related determinations.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Notice is hereby given that, in a letter dated October 13, 1994, the President amended the cost-sharing arrangements
concerning the Federal funds provided under the authority of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency
Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 

et seq

.), in a letter to James L. Witt, Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, as follows:





I have determined that the damage in certain areas of the State of Georgia, resulting from torrential rain, high wind,
tornadoes and flooding resulting from Tropical Storm Alberto on July 3 through July 25, 1994, is of sufficient severity
and magnitude that special conditions are warranted regarding the cost-sharing arrangements concerning Federal
funds provided under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (``the Stafford Act'')
for the Public Assistance program.

Therefore, I amend my previous declaration to authorize Federal funds for Public Assistance at 90 percent of total
eligible costs. This 90 percent reimbursement applies to all authorized Public Assistance costs, including debris
removal to eliminate immediate threats to public health and safety, emergency work to save lives and protect public
health and safety, and repair or reconstruction of uninsured public and private non-profit facilities.

This adjustment to State and local cost sharing applies only to Public Assistance costs eligible for such adjustment
under the law. The law specifically prohibits a similar adjustment for funds provided to States for the Individual
and Family Grant program. These funds will continue to be reimbursed at 75 percent of total eligible costs.

Please notify the Governor of the State of Georgia and the Federal Coordinating Officer of this amendment to my major
disaster declaration.

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Notice is hereby given that, in a letter dated October 18, 1994, the President declared a major disaster under the authority
of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 

et seq

.), as follows:




I have determined that the damage in certain areas of the State of Texas, resulting from severe thunderstorms and flooding
on October 14, 1994, and continuing, is of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant a major disaster declaration
under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (``the Stafford Act''). I, therefore,
declare that such a major disaster exists in the State of Texas.

In order to provide Federal assistance, you are hereby authorized to allocate from funds available for these purposes,
such amounts as you find necessary for Federal disaster assistance and administrative expenses.

You are authorized to provide Individual Assistance in the designated areas. Public Assistance may be added at a later
date, if requested and warranted. Consistent with the requirement that Federal assistance be supplemental, any
Federal funds provided under the Stafford Act for Public Assistance will be limited to 75 percent of the total eligible
costs.





The time period prescribed for the implementation of section 310(a), Priority to Certain Applications for Public
Facility and Public Housing Assistance, 42 U.S.C. 5153, shall be for a period not to exceed six months after the date
of this declaration.

Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the authority vested in the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency
under Executive Order 12148, I hereby appoint R. Dell Greer of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to act as the
Federal Coordinating Officer for this declared disaster.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Trade Commission publishes the Report of the Tar, Nicotine, and Carbon Monoxide Content of 933 Varieties
of Domestic Cigarettes.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

These are the most recent test results of the tar, nicotine, and carbon monoxide levels of the smoke of domestic cigarettes
reported by the FTC. The Tobacco Institute Testing Laboratory (TITL), a private laboratory operated by the cigarette
industry, conducted the tar, nicotine, and carbon monoxide testing for the widely-available domestic cigarette
varieties. This testing was conducted under the review of a representative of the FTC through periodic unannounced
inspections. TITL provided the results to the respective cigarette companies. The companies provided the data generated
by TITL regarding their own brands to the FTC in response to compulsory process issued by the Commission. Cigarette
smoke from generic (no brand-name), private label, and not-widely-available cigarettes was not tested by TITL,
but was tested by the cigarette companies and provided under compulsory process to the FTC. The methodology, processes
and procedures that the companies and TITL employed are the same as those the Commission has followed in the past.

<DOCTITLE>Granting of Request for Early Termination of the Waiting Period Under the Premerger Notification Rules</DOCTITLE>



Section 7A of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 18a, as added by Title II of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements
Act of 1976, requires persons contemplating certain mergers on acquisitions to give the Federal Trade Commission
and the Assistant Attorney General advance notice and to wait designated periods before consummation of such plans.
Section 7A(b)(2) of the Act permits the agencies, in individual cases, to terminate this waiting period prior to its
expiration and requires that notice of this action be published in the 

Federal Register

.

The following transactions were granted early termination of the waiting period provided by law and the premerger
notification rules. The grants were made by the Federal Trade Commission and the Assistant Attorney General for the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice. Neither agency intends to take any action with respect to these proposed
acquisitions during the applicable waiting period.

Child Abuse and Neglect Prevention 
and Treatment; Proposed Research and Demonstration Priorities 
for Fiscal Years 1995 and 1996

 National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect (NCCAN), Administration on Children, Youth and Families (ACYF), Administration
for Children and Families (ACF), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Proposed Fiscal Years 1995 and 1996 Child Abuse and Neglect Research and Demonstration Priorities for the
Administration for Children and Families.

 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect (NCCAN) within the Administration on Children, Youth and Families
(ACYF) announces the proposed priorities for research on the causes, prevention, identification, and treatment
of child abuse and neglect; on appropriate and effective judicial procedures; and for demonstration or service programs
and projects designed to prevent, identify, and treat child abuse and neglect. 



Comments on the proposed priorities and suggestions for other topics are invited at this time. The actual solicitation
of grant applications will be published separately in the 

Federal Register

, at a later date, for each fiscal year, respectively. Solicitations for contracts will be announced, at a later date,
in the Commerce Business Daily. Though these priority areas are proposed for Fiscal Years 1995 and 1996, NCCAN recognizes
that, pending the reauthorization of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA), these priorities may
be supplemented and amended accordingly. Comments and recommendations about the reauthorization, though welcome,
are not the focus of this announcement. In addition, no proposals, concept papers, or other forms of applications
for funding should be submitted at this time. 

Section 105(a)(2)(B) of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act of 1988 (CAPTA), as amended, requires the Department
to publish proposed priorities for research and demonstration activities for the purpose of soliciting comments
from the public, including individuals knowledgeable in the field of child abuse and neglect prevention and treatment.
No acknowledgment will be made of the comments submitted in response to this notice, but all comments received by the
deadline will be reviewed and given thoughtful consideration in the preparation of the final funding priorities
over the next two years. Copies of the final program announcement will be sent to all persons who comment on these proposed
priorities. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Background



The proposed new research and demonstration priority areas have been developed from recommendations from several
sources.

 The National Research Council (NRC), Commission on Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education (CBASSE),
Panel on Research on Child Abuse and Neglect report, 

Understanding Child Abuse and Neglect 

(hereafter referenced as the NRC report) was produced by CBASSE in response to a request from the Administration on
Children, Youth and Families (ACYF) in the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) to undertake a comprehensive
review and synthesis of research on child abuse and neglect and to recommend research needs and priorities for the
remainder of the decade; 

 The American Psychological Society (APS) report on the field in Human Capital Initiative: Report of the National
Behavioral Science Research Agenda Committee (APS Observer, February 1992); 

 The Child Welfare League of America (CWLA) report on the field, 

A Research Agenda for Child Welfare: 

A Special Issue of 

Child Welfare

, LXXIII, No. 5 (September-October, 1994); 

 Reviews of current literature on child abuse and neglect; 

 Findings from recently completed studies; 

 Suggestions received from the field; 

 Hearings and reports of the Advisory Board on Child Abuse and Neglect; 

 Meetings held by the Inter-Agency Task Force on Child Abuse and Neglect and its Research Committee; and 

 Other Departmental organizations and professional associations. 

These recommendations have been considered in light of the vision and values of the Administration for Children and
Families. The priorities described below especially embody the vision of building partnerships between the Federal
government and individuals, families, front-line service providers, communities, American Indian tribes and
Native communities, States and Congress to seek solutions that transcend traditional agency boundaries. More responsive
services can be designed when gaps across services are bridged: when practitioners and researchers work together
to ask and answer questions that will empower individuals to achieve active, healthy, productive lives in strong,
supportive communities. Prevention efforts, especially, will have a positive impact on the quality of life and the
development of children. 

Since 1975, NCCAN has funded hundreds of research and demonstration projects addressing prevention, intervention,
and treatment issues in child abuse and neglect. The topics over these 19 years have spanned the many and diverse interests
of the field, the needs of public social service agencies, and the private sector, providing seed money for some efforts
and platforms for others. Descriptions of these discretionary activities are available from The Clearinghouse
on Child Abuse and Neglect Information, P.O. Box 1182, Washington, D.C. 20013 (1-800-394-3366),
hereafter referred to as the NCCAN Clearinghouse, in the following volumes: Compendium of Discretionary Grants:
Fiscal Years 1975-1991 (April 1992); NCCAN Discretionary Grants: Profiles for Fiscal Year 1992 (June 1993);
Profiles of Research and Demonstration Grants Addressing Issues of Child Neglect (June 1993); Profiles of Research
Grants Funded by NCCAN: Fiscal Years 1988-1992 (March 1993); and Emergency Child Abuse and Neglect Prevention
Services Program (Fiscal Year 1991) (Revised April 1993).

In addition to projects funded under priority areas selected as a result of this announcement, NCCAN intends to continue
funding for: 

 The Clearinghouse on Child Abuse and Neglect Information; 

 The National Information Clearinghouse for Infants With Disabilities and Life-Threatening Conditions;


 The National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System (NCANDS); 

 The Consortium for Longitudinal Studies of Child Maltreatment; 

 The National Data Archive on Child Abuse and Neglect; and 

 The project ``Measurement in Child Abuse and Neglect Research: An Update and Critical Review.'' 

NCCAN is also actively pursuing Interagency Agreements to develop collaborative research and demonstration activities
with members of the Inter-Agency Task Force on Child Abuse and Neglect. 

More detailed information on these continuing projects supported by NCCAN as well as on other studies of child maltreatment
are available through the NCCAN Clearinghouse. 

Since the amount of Federal funds available for new grants in FY 1995 and 1996 is limited, respondents are encouraged
to recommend how proposed issues should be prioritized. 

The remainder of this document presents the proposed research and demonstration priorities; it is organized according
to the following headings:



A. Proposed Research Priorities 


1. Family Preservation and Family Support for Targeted CAN Populations 
2. Model Development for Centers of Excellence in Research 



B. Proposed Demonstration and Service Priorities 


1. Demonstration Models on Neglect 
2. Guardian ad Litem Model Demonstration 



C. Working Groups

A. Proposed Research Priorities 



1. Research on Child Abuse and Neglect With a Focus on the Impact of Community-Based Family Support and Family Preservation
Programs on Child Abuse and Neglect. 



The research areas to be addressed in this priority are those that will expand the current knowledge base, build on
prior research, contribute to practice, and provide insights into new approaches to the prevention of child maltreatment
and preservation of families (i.e., physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional maltreatment, or neglect) by family
support and family preservation services as defined by the newly enacted Family Preservation and Family Support
Services Program (Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Subpart 2 of Title IV-B, the Child and Family Services
Program of the Social Security Act). Congress has noted its interest in the outcomes and effectiveness of this legislation.
For definitions of these services, see the legislation and Program Instructions. The Congressional intent of the
legislative definition was further clarified in the Conference Committee Report. 

Copies of the Family Preservation and Family Support legislation, Program Instruction, and additional information
about family support and family preservation programs are available from the NCCAN Clearinghouse_Child Welfare
Desk (1-800-394-3366). Copies are also available on the ACF electronic bulletin board system (1-800-627-8886).


States have reported to the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System (NCANDS) that in 1992 their child protective
service (CPS) agencies received and referred for investigation approximately 1.9 million reports involving approximately
2.9 million children who were the alleged victims of child abuse and neglect. 

Over half of the reports were received from professionals in the community, including educators, social service
professionals, health professionals, and representatives of law enforcement and justice agencies. Following
investigations conducted by CPS agencies, nearly 1 million children, approximately 39 percent of those reported,
were found to be substantiated or indicated victims of child maltreatment. Based on data from 37 States, it is estimated
that approximately 18 percent of children who were the substantiated victims of maltreatment were removed from the
home. Extrapolating this ratio to all States, it suggests that in 1992 an estimated 82 percent (800,000) substantiated
victims of child maltreatment remained at home, where they may have received further services. These findings also
suggest that, in 1992, 61 percent of those cases reported for child abuse and neglect are unsubstantiated and those
children also remain in their homes. At this time, it is not known whether any follow-up, family preservation, or family
support services are available for unsubstantiated cases to prevent the potential for future abuse and reporting.


Given this lack of knowledge about these families, NCCAN is particularly interested in four populations and four
outcomes. The proposed research studies should examine one or more of the populations to examine service outcomes
of family support and family preservation services. The first group consists of families who receive family support
services, but have had no previous contact with child protective services, otherwise known as families who are not
``in the system.'' The second group consists of families who have been referred to child protective services, whose
cases were unsubstantiated or unfounded, but were found to need services, and were referred to family support programs.
The third group consists of families who have been ``in the system,'' whose child abuse or neglect cases were substantiated,
who received family preservation or family support services, and whose cases are now closed. The fourth, and final,
population would be those families whose child abuse or neglect cases have been substantiated, whose cases are ``open,''
whose children have not been removed, and who are receiving family preservation services.

<TEXT>
 

Outcomes of interest to NCCAN are: ``case-finding'' (families who have not been previously referred to CPS but, through
participation in family support services, are discovered to be appropriate for reporting); the impact of family
support and/or family preservation services on prevention; on recidivism; and on removal or non-removal of children.
These four outcomes suggest a variety of research questions, as well as descriptive and/or experimental designs.


Applicants should plan and design the proposed studies in collaboration with State and/or local CPS/IV-B agencies
as well as community-based organizations (CBO) providing family support services for a CPS/IV-B agency (e.g.,
Family Resource Center, Head Start Center, non-custodial father program). Comments are also solicited regarding
the suitability of denying consideration to applications that do not achieve and document this collaboration. 



2. Model Development for Centers for Excellence in Research 



NCCAN is interested in funding one or more multi-disciplinary Centers for Excellence in Child Abuse and Neglect Research.
These Centers would be partnerships among university and State or community-based agencies that provide child welfare
services, including mental health services. Special consideration will be given to locating at least one such Center
at a historically black college or university. All proposals submitted for this priority must describe and defend
the model proposed for the Center. The primary goal of these Centers is to foster collaboration, building on models
used in medical research at the National Institutes of Health and the Preventive Intervention Research Center (PIRC)
that successfully focused efforts on cancer and diabetes. Models are described below (for more details, see NRC,
pp. 358-359). At this time, NCCAN does not endorse any particular model. Comments are solicited regarding the
merits of requiring that models proposed under this announcement make provisions for multi-disciplinary research
that include social work, law, nursing, medicine, psychology, sociology, social anthropology, and education and
demonstrate respect for cultural diversity and provide opportunities and services with cultural sensitivity.


Since 1982, the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), has supported a number of Preventive Intervention Research
Centers (PIRC). The PIRCs were developed, in part, as a response to several major problems faced similar to those currently
being experienced by the field of child abuse and neglect. The goal of a PIRC is to provide a productive research environment
where teams of investigators from a variety of disciplines interact and develop a program focused on the promotion
of mental health and the prevention of mental and behavioral disorders and dysfunctions. Historically, the Centers
provide support for a set of interrelated research projects and core or infrastructure functions. For more details
about this model, see the NIMH Program Announcement PAR 94-038 (January, 1994). 

The National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), funds
10 

Injury Control Research Centers

. The Centers are multi-disciplinary and each is housed in a university. Each Center focuses on a unique aspect of injury
control appropriate to its technical expertise and community setting. The Centers conduct applied research; provide
opportunities for faculty development; provide training for community practitioners, other scientists, and students;
provide technical assistance; disseminate findings and materials; and promote specific prevention initiatives
relevant to their research findings and community needs. 

Activities undertaken by the proposed Centers for Excellence in Research on Child Abuse and Neglect would include
but not be limited to: 

 Guidance and management of graduate and post-graduate Research and Medical Research Fellowships in Child
Abuse and Neglect; 

 Research opportunities for new researchers/career development (faculty); 

 Support for the development of minority researchers; 

 Training for professionals which replicates, adapts, and builds on the culturally relevant needs assessment
and curriculum tools including, but not limited to, those developed under an NCCAN grant (

#

90-CA-1443) by the People of Color Leadership Institute (POCLI). 

These products are available through the NCCAN Clearinghouse (1-800-394-3366); and 

 Development and piloting of new methodologies and measures, or refinement of existing measures, for research
and evaluation in child abuse and neglect. Development activities must include testing the validity and reliability
of new and/or existing instruments with new populations and across cultures.

The themes for Centers for Excellence should include identification, prevention and treatment, with a special focus
on, but not limited to, neglect, cultural sensitivity, disability, and training about child abuse and neglect. 



B. Proposed Demonstration and Service Priorities 



1. Demonstration Models on Neglect 



The intent of this priority is to fund service models for the prevention of neglect. These models should make provision
for both the early identification of families at risk of neglect and the identification of chronically neglectful
families, and neglected children (in placements or reunified) who may be in need of special services. 

Designing services for families that neglect children is a challenge. Both ecological and psychosocial factors
influence the manifestation of neglect. The many differences and distinctions among neglectful families, including
cultural distinctions, dictate a service model based on careful assessment of the family and services designed specifically
for them. 

The U.S. Advisory Board on Child Abuse and Neglect focuses on the ecological aspects. The Advisory Board's report,


Neighbors Helping Neighbors

, (1993), recommends several strategies for strengthening neighborhoods and improving the quality of support available
to families within their own communities, as a national strategy for the protection of children. Their recommendations
include: involving residents as participants, planners and managers of neighborhood services; the encouragement
of foster grandparent programs; empowerment through home ownership; the implementation of prevention zones by
public/private partnerships; and the funding of more family resource centers.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941025-2-00064 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941025-2-00045 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The importance of neighborhoods in combatting neglect is also emphasized in the 

1994 Kids Count Data Book

 (The Annie E. Casey Foundation, pp. 4-7). 

The report issued by the National Research Council (NRC, 1993, pp. 50-52) also highlights the ecological aspects.
The report suggests that ``dysfunctional families are often part of a dysfunctional environment'' (p. 50). Its recommendations
for intervention programs include: home-based approaches (p. 264), impacts on socio-economic conditions (p. 134),
and impacts on social isolation 
(p. 135). 

Recent research focuses on the psychosocial foundations of neglect. DiLeonardi (1993), for example, reported that
``family empowerment, the use of groups to develop social support networks, and the assistance of volunteers or paraprofessionals
as home visitors or parent aides, appear to be beneficial'' (p. 557) to prevent neglect among families reported for
neglect. The study concluded that families were able to reverse their neglectful child-rearing patterns with this
model of services. 

Gaudin, Zuravin, and Polansky also found that family dynamics explains ``a significant portion of the variance in
quality of parenting/neglect'' (Gaudin, 1993). Depression and substance abuse, for example, have been suggested
as powerful forces in family dynamics and mediators of neglect. 

In June of 1993, NCCAN sponsored a symposium on chronic neglect. The issues addressed included consensus building
on definitions, strategies for change through empowerment, research, treatment and policy topics. The 

Proceedings

 from this symposium will be available from the NCCAN Clearinghouse. A number of studies, referred to in the 

Proceedings

, suggest that programs for neglectful families based on building interpersonal strengths, fostering individual
empowerment, and ensuring the provision of basic human needs in a safe environment were most likely to improve parenting,
self-esteem and coping ability among the neglectful population. 

Recent work by the Kansas Cooperative Extension Service (Smith, C.A., Cudaback, D., Goddard, H.W., & Myers-Walls,
J., 1994, 

National Extension Parent Education Model

) may provide a useful guide for designing the parent education component of a comprehensive psycho-social model.
Parent education can help parents in many ways including: learning to care for themselves, managing personal stress,
managing family resources; providing children with developmentally appropriate opportunities and learning appropriate
disciplinary techniques; maintaining developmentally appropriate expectations of children; improving communication
skills, building social support systems; and learning to access community, social service, and family support resources.


Projects may either present innovative approaches or be replications of previously evaluated and promising models.
Proposed models should build on previous research and NCCAN-sponsored Symposium findings and incorporate mental
health, parenting education components and family support services. They should collect data on the costs and potential
cost-benefits of providing the proposed services. 

These projects may be based on one of two types of models described above: either the ecological, i.e., neighborhood
model, or the psycho-social model. If a project chooses the ecological model, it must be aggressive in its outreach
to the community; conversely, if a project chooses to follow the psycho-social model, it must include home-based/family
support services, parenting education, and mental health services in its approach to addressing neglect. 

NCCAN intends to fund up to ten demonstration projects on neglect (five in each model). Structurally, these projects
are intended to function cooperatively as a cluster. Participation in a cluster affords the grantees the greatest
opportunities to cooperate and collaborate. NCCAN will assist this cooperation by providing assistance through
a technical assistance contract, encouraging meetings to develop use of common evaluation criteria, data elements,
and measures to maximize comparability of evaluation findings. Evaluations will be required of each demonstration
project. Priority will be given to those who provide evidence of a partnership between CPS/IV-B agencies which provide
Family Preservation/Family Support services and community-based mental health/family resource centers. 



2. Guardian ad Litem Model Demonstration 



Since 1975, the Congress has required States to provide a guardian ad litem in every case of alleged child abuse or neglect
that results in a judicial proceeding as a condition of eligibility for a grant under the Child Abuse Prevention and
Treatment Act (CAPTA). Though there are enough attorneys in every jurisdiction to meet the needs of children for legal
representation as attorneys or guardians ad litem (GAL), many States do not have funds to pay the attorneys, and most
abused and neglected children and their parents are unable to afford attorneys' fees. As a result, in many locations,
the juvenile court depends upon attorneys to represent children on a voluntary (

pro bono

) basis. 







</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941025-2-00065 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941025-2-00045 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

However, there are not enough attorneys who chose to provide free representation to children, especially since some
proceedings are complicated and cases may last for 21 years. The Court-Appointed Special Advocate (CASA) movement
developed in the 1980's and has spread throughout the nation to address these unmet needs. These well-trained volunteers
help meet the need for representation of child clients. The impact on the outcomes for children of the GAL and CASA services
is not known (NRC, p. 273). 

In 1988, the Research, Demonstration and Evaluation Branch, Division of Program Evaluation, Administration on
Children, Youth and Families conducted a study of the Guardian ad litem system. The report indicated that no single
GAL model studied (Private Attorney, Staff Attorney, and CASA) was consistently superior to the others across five
GAL roles (fact-finding and investigation, legal representation, negotiation/mediation, monitoring, and resource
brokering). The findings also suggest that an optimal approach may be a ``mixed model'' and involve having a GAL who
possesses, or has access to, the expertise and resources of attorneys, lay volunteers, and caseworkers to perform
the broad range of functions and services contained in the definition of the child advocate (Final Report on the Validation
and Effectiveness Study of Legal Representation through Guardian ad Litem, 

#

105-89-1727). 

The ``mixed model'' uses a combination of attorneys, volunteers, and/or trained staff members to perform the broad
range of functions and services, resources and expertise, for child advocacy. The intent of this priority is for a
demonstration project of this ``mixed model'' to explore, in greater detail, service delivery with this approach.
If this ``mixed model'' is not currently in place, resources might be added on to an existing GAL representation model
for this demonstration. 

Based on four broad recommendations made in the report, the demonstration should design, justify, implement, and
evaluate: 

 A prototype for a formal, national system of GAL training, standards, and certification employed with a ``mixed
model'' design; 

 Recommendations for court-implemented formal terms of appointment, descriptions, and supervision of the
GAL role with a ``mixed model'' design; 

 Standards for caseload size that maximize effective and ethical representation within a ``mixed model''
design; and

 Estimations of the magnitude of resources required and costs of a ``mixed model'' design with selected cases.

Applicants must establish working relationships with the appropriate local juvenile court system and child welfare
agency and demonstrate cognizance of the positions and activities of national organizations (e.g., the National
Association of the Counsel for Children, the National Court Appointed Special Advocates Association, and the ABA
Center on Children and the Law). 



C. Working Groups 



The NCCAN proposes to establish two working groups during FY 1995 and/or 1996. The working groups would be composed
of less than ten experts, chosen by the Commissioner in consultation with NCCAN and the field, and less than 6 Federal
representatives representing those stakeholder agencies participating in the Inter-Agency Task Force on Child
Abuse and Neglect and the Interagency Research Committee. The working groups would meet several times over the course
of a year in person and by telephone conference calls, with technical assistance provided through a contractor, to
plan symposia (for the following fiscal year), identify appropriate ``next steps,'' and produce one or several working
papers on selected topics. Two topics are proposed here. 

 Research Definitions: Creating Consensus for Research Purposes. 

Researchers acknowledge, and the NRC report confirms, that the quality of information available to us for improving
practice and informing policy about child abuse and neglect is hampered by the lack of agreement in current research
definitions of abuse, neglect, intensity, and other characteristics of maltreatment. NCCAN will be providing assistance
to the field by sponsoring and co-sponsoring efforts to standardize definitions of data collection categories and
measurable attributes common to maltreatment participants and situations. Considerable collaboration through
the Interagency Task Force on Child Abuse and Neglect, Interagency Research Committee is being pursued. Potential
products of these activities include working paper(s) of standard data terms, behavior-driven operational definitions
and parameters. (For additional information on this topic, see the NRC report, pp. 62-63.) 

 Ethics, Confidentiality, Informed Consent, and Reporting: Issues for the Research Community.

<TEXT>
 

Researchers struggle alone or in small groups with the ramifications of the research process. Some are unclear about
their obligations to report disclosures of abuse or neglect in research situations. Researchers also are of varied
opinions about: 

 Inquiring directly of young children about abuse and neglect; 

 Reporting families to systems where services are unavailable or may be punitive; and 

 Providing treatment services within their projects designed for research. 

With a working group, NCCAN intends to provide assistance to the field in cooperation with the Inter-Agency Task Force
by providing a forum for the development of consensus on ethical issues as recommended in the NRC report. (For details,
see NRC, ``Ethical and Legal Issues in Child Maltreatment Research,'' pp. 324-336.) Background papers could
include working papers on legal ethical issues, treatment issues, and reporting issues. Products could include:
policy recommendations for Institutional Review Boards (IRBs), policy guidelines for grantees and others conducting
research in child abuse and neglect, and (pending the cooperation of a professional association or journal) a summary
monograph or special journal issue publication. Coordination with the NCCAN Clearinghouse project on State statutes
would be required. 



D. Symposia 



In addition to the above activities, NCCAN proposes to convene symposia in FY 1995 and 1996 with selected experts on
subject areas of critical concern to the field of child abuse and neglect. The selection of topics for the symposia
will focus on issues in which some research and demonstration efforts have occurred but for which there may be no synchronized
or congruous direction. 

The purpose of each symposium is to review what is known to the field, but needs further exploration, and to identify
areas about which little is known and which require closer examination. The symposia should result in recommendations
for multi-year strategies for further exploring some topics and for identifying new areas for examination. 

Comments are requested on the following symposia topics which NCCAN proposes to address in FY 1995 or 1996: 
 Domestic Violence and Child Abuse and Neglect 

Studies of domestic violence indicate that child abuse and neglect frequently occur within families where there
is violence between the adults (Strauss, Gelles and Steinmetz, 1980; Walker, 1985; Stark and Flitcraft, 1985, 1988;
Bowker, 1988; McCloskey and Koss, 1992). There is also a growing awareness that children who witness physical violence
between their parents are at risk of emotional abuse and neglect (Rosenbaum and O'Leary, 1981; Goodman and Rosenberg,
1987; Crites and Coker, 1988). 

In the 1980's NCCAN supported demonstration projects to provide services to children whose mothers are in domestic
violence shelters, to train clinicians to identify both domestic violence and child abuse in families in a hospital
setting, to prevent both domestic violence and child abuse. NCCAN also supported a research project on psychiatric
and behavioral consequences for children of battered women during this period. 

Programs that train child welfare practitioners in the clinical issues of domestic violence or vice versa, and programs
that link domestic violence shelters and child welfare agencies have been created in a number of communities.

In 1993, NCCAN planned the Tenth National Conference on Child Abuse and Neglect in conjunction with the First National
Family Violence Conference so that participants could attend both conferences during the same week. Moreover, each
conference contained presentations about the relationship between family violence and child abuse and neglect.
In June 1994, the Ford Foundation funded a meeting on ``Domestic Violence and Child Welfare: Integrating Policy and
Practice for Families'' at the Wingspread Center, Racine Wisconsin. The meeting identified existing and potential
projects and initiatives that integrate domestic violence and family preservation clinical issues, and that integrate
an awareness of domestic violence concerns into child protective services programs and policies. 

In collaboration with the Family Violence Prevention and Services Program in the Office of Community Services, NCCAN
proposes to conduct one or more working meetings with national experts to build upon the work of the June 1994 meeting
and previous programmatic efforts. The goals of the meeting(s) are to identify and refine further programmatic initiatives
and policy directions that promote the safety and well-being of all family members. 

 Prevention 

In 1991, NCCAN sponsored a national child maltreatment prevention symposium. The Proceedings of that meeting (DePanfilis
and Birch, Eds.) are available through the NCCAN Clearinghouse (1-800-394-3366). More than 100
invited participants, researchers and practitioners, took part in five separate work groups. Each considered what
had been done to prevent child maltreatment, identified successful efforts, and examined the factors that lead to
success in each of five areas: preventing sexual abuse, preventing maltreatment in substance abusing families,
preventing neglect, changing public attitudes, examining the effects of neighborhood environments, and improving
parenting in high-risk families. 

The symposium participants made 18 recommendations for future research which helped shape subsequent priority
area announcements, meeting agenda, and policy. NCCAN believes that, at the 5-year mark another symposium would
be beneficial. 



In addition to the topics cited above, practitioners and researchers are encouraged to propose other relevant subjects
for symposia deliberations.

SmithKline Beecham Animal Health, et al.; Withdrawal of Approval of NADA's


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is withdrawing approval of three new animal drug applications (NADA's) and
those portions of a fourth NADA providing for the use of nitrofurazone solution drug products. This action is being
taken at the written request of the sponsors. In a final rule published elsewhere in this issue of the 

Federal Register

, FDA is amending the regulations by removing the entries which reflect approval of the NADA's.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

FDA is withdrawing approval of three NADA's and those portions of a fourth NADA (6-475) providing for the use
of nitrofurazone solution drug products. The NADA's are: 




The NADA's provide for over-the-counter use of 0.2 percent nitrofurazone solution on dogs, cats, and horses for prevention
or treatment of topical bacterial infections, and prescription use for female equine genital tract infections and
impaired fertility due to strains of certain bacteria.
One of the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for receiving approval of a new animal drug is that
the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling are reasonably certain to be
followed in practice (21 U.S.C. 360b (c)(2)). New information has established that the labeled directions for use
of the nitrofurazone solution products have not been followed in practice. When FDA informed the products' sponsors
of this situation, they requested voluntary withdrawal of approval of their applications. By so doing they have waived
their right to a hearing.
The withdrawals of approval are effective November 3, 1994. All manufacturing of the products must cease on this date.
FDA, however, will exercise its enforcement discretion and will not take regulatory action, based on lack of approval,
against the subject products if distributed from sponsor-owned facilities through December 31, 1994, and used before
their expiration date.
Therefore, under authority delegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs (21 CFR 5.10) and redelegated to the Center
for Veterinary Medicine (21 CFR 5.84), and in accordance with  514.115 

Withdrawal of approval of applications

 (21 CFR 514.115), notice is given that approval of NADA's 121-559, 126-023, and 126-950 and those
portions of NADA 6-475 providing for the use of nitrofurazone solution drug products and all supplements and
amendments thereto is hereby withdrawn, effective November 3, 1994. This withdrawal of approval does not affect
the nitrofurazone-containing ointment and soluble powder products covered by NADA 6-475.
In a final rule published elsewhere in the issue of the 

Federal Register

, FDA is removing and reserving  524.1580d which reflects the approval of the NADA's.

Office of External Affairs, Eastern States, 7450 Boston Blvd., Springfield, VA 22153




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The PRMP/FEIS presents and analyzes alternatives for managing BLM-administered public lands throughout the State
of Florida. These lands include approximately 395,000 acres of split-estate federal mineral ownership (where federal
ownership is limited to mineral interests and the surface estate is owned by either the State of Florida or private
interests) and several hundred acres of public land, comprised of small tracts, located in seven counties throughout
the State.





Under the PRMP, federally-owned minerals underlying state-owned lands would be available to the State of Florida
in exchange for lands identified for acquisition by the U.S. Department of the Interior and/or the U.S. Forest Service.

A portion (approximately 60 acres) of the Jupiter Inlet tract, located in Palm Beach County, is proposed to be designated
an Area of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC). The ACEC would be managed to maintain a viable scrub vegetation
community and improve habitat conditions for Florida scrub jay, gopher tortoise, and other endemic scrub species,
and to interpret natural and cultural resources to provide recreation opportunities. Motorized vehicle use would
be limited to designated routes. The ACEC would be withdrawn from entry under the 1872 mining law, closed to mineral
material sales and mineral lease, and would be an avoidance area for rights-of-way. The ACEC would be available for
cooperative management with other government agencies and/or private organizations, or for conveyance under the
Recreation and Public Purposes Act, provided that the proposed use would follow the stated management objectives
and land-use allocations.

The Cape San Blas tract, located in Gulf County, is also proposed for ACEC designation. The tract would be managed to
protect the coastal dune habitat. The tract would be closed to motorized vehicle use, would be classified as an avoidance
area for rights-of-way, would be withdrawn from entry under the 1872 mining law, and closed to mineral material sales
and lease of solid minerals. Oil and gas leasing would be subject to a no surface occupancy stipulation. The tract would
be available for cooperative management with other government agencies and/or private organizations, or for conveyance
under the Recreation and Public Purposes Act, provided that the proposed use would follow the stated management objectives
and land-use allocations.

A tract of public land adjacent to the Peace River was evaluated to determine if it was eligible to be studied for possible
inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic River System. It was determined that it was ineligible for further study
because it would be unmanageable due to the lack of other public lands adjacent to the river. The 37-acre tract of BLM-administered
land adjacent to the river comprises only one percent of the land area within a corridor of one-quarter mile on either
side of the River for the nine-mile segment evaluated. The remaining acres in the corridor are predominantly under
private ownership and are used for agricultural and ranchland purposes.

 Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of document availability. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announces the availability for public review of a draft recovery plan
for spectacled eiders (

Somateria fischeri

). The species occurs in arctic and sub-arctic regions of western and northern Alaska and along the arctic coast of
Russia. The Service is proposing emphasis on recovery actions in these geographic areas. The Service solicits review
and comment from the public on this draft plan.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 



Restoring an endangered or threatened animal or plant to the point where it is again a secure, self-sustaining member
of its ecosystem is a primary goal of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's endangered species program. To help guide
the recovery effort, the Service is working to prepare recovery plans for most of the listed species native to the United
States. Recovery plans describe actions considered necessary for conservation of the species, establish criteria
for the recovery levels for downlisting or delisting them, and estimate time and cost for implementing the recovery
measures needed. 

The Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq

.) (Act) requires the development of recovery plans for listed species unless such a plan would not promote the conservation
of a particular species. Section 4(f) of the Act, as amended in 1988, requires that public notice and an opportunity
for public review and comment be provided during recovery plan development. The Service will consider all information
presented during the public comment period prior to approval of each new or revised Recovery Plan. The Service and
other Federal agencies will also take these comments into account in the course of implementing approved recovery
plans. 

The spectacled eider is a large-bodied sea duck and one of three species in the genus 

Somateria.

 Spectacled eiders historically nested discontinuously along the west coast of Alaska from Nushagak Peninsula north
to Barrow and east nearly to the Yukon Territory border (Bailey 1948; Dau and Kistchinski 1977; Derksen et al. 1981;
Johnson and Herter 1989; Warnock and Troy 1993). They also have nested on St. Lawrence Island, Alaska, in the Bering
Sea (Fay 1961). Along the arctic coast of Russia, spectacled eiders nest from the north side of the Chukotsk Peninsula
west to the Lena River Delta and Novosibirski Islands (Buturlin 1910; Dementev and Gladkov 1952; Portenko 1972).
Today, primary nesting grounds are the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta and north central arctic coast (Cape Simpson to the
Sagavanirktok River, hereafter referred to as the North Slope) of Alaska and the Chaun Gulf and Kolyma, Indigirka
and Yana river deltas in Russia.

The Service estimates that the number of nesting spectacled eiders on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta has rapidly and continuously
declined by over 96 percent in the past 20 years (Stehn et al. 1993; Warnock and Troy 1993; Ely et al., in press). Information
from researchers in the Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, oilfields (Warnock and Troy 1993) and Native elders at Wainwright (R.
Suydam, pers. comm.) suggest local population declines on the North Slope. No data are available for examining overall
trends on the North Slope or in Arctic Russia. 
The Service responded to a December 1990 petition to list the spectacled eider as endangered. After review of the best
available commercial and scientific data the species was designated as threatened on May 10, 1993 (FR 58(88):24474-27480).
The primary reason for listing spectacled eiders was their rapid and continuing decline on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta
breeding grounds, and indications that they may have declined on Alaska's North Slope, as well. Other factors that
contributed to the Service's concern for the species' status were varying impacts due to human activities and population
growth. 
Causes of this species' dramatic decline, as well as the identification and determination of relative importance
of current obstacles to recovery, have yet to be determined. Several current and historical causes of mortality have
been identified; they are predation by fox and gulls, subsistence and sport harvest, egg and scientific collecting,
and environmental contamination. Other causes of mortality are suspected, such as collisions with commercial fishing
vessels, changes in the food web, global climatic changes, competition from other marine species, and diseases and
parasites.
 
Basic natural history information to elucidate the causes for decline and obstacles for recovery is lacking. Information
about the distribution and abundance of spectacled eiders throughout the year is fragmentary, as is our understanding
of the demography and population dynamics of this species. Whether the nesting populations of spectacled eiders
in the three primary geographic areas are genetically or demographically distinct is unknown, yet specific recovery
actions and priorities may hinge on such a determination. 
In light of these significant data gaps, an exhaustive list of tasks required to achieve recovery cannot yet be presented.
Instead, interim recovery efforts that proceed simultaneously along three fronts_preliminary management actions
to eliminate known sources of mortality; exploratory data collection and analysis; and hypothesis-testing regarding
the causes of the species' decline and obstacles to its recovery_are recommended. Over the next several years, recovery
efforts should focus on the following topics: 
(1) Through meaningful participation, involve Native Alaskans living within the historical range of the species
in recovery and management efforts; 
(2) Increase efforts to reduce mortality; 
(3) Quantify and monitor existing breeding populations; 
(4) Determine molting, migration, and wintering areas and habitats; 
(5) Conduct research on the demography and biology of the species and develop demographic models; and 
(6) Attempt to determine causes for the species' decline and obstacles to its recovery. 
The geographic areas of emphasis for these recovery efforts are the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, the North Slope, and to
a lesser degree St. Lawrence Island, and Seward Peninsula, Alaska, and Arctic Russia.

<DOCTITLE>Clark County Wetlands Park Master Plan, East Las Vegas, NV</DOCTITLE>


Agency: 

Bureau of Reclamation, Interior. 




Action: 

Notice of intent to prepare a draft environmental impact statement and notice of scoping meeting for Clark County
Wetlands Park Master Plan. 





<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Clark County Departments of Comprehensive Planning and Parks and Recreation propose to develop a desert wetlands
park in Las Vegas Wash, between the Sam Boyd Stadium and Lake Las Vegas, east of the City of Las Vegas, Nevada. A portion
of the park would be on Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) land. Reclamation proposes to prepare a draft environmental
impact statement (EIS) to address the impacts associated with construction and operation of the park. A scoping meeting
is planned to provide information and receive oral comments from interested parties. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Since 1970, 470 acres of wetlands in Las Vegas Wash have been lost to erosion, and hundreds of thousands of tons of eroded
material deposited downstream in Lake Mead. Las Vegas Wash is a unique desert wetland with important recreation and
conservation potential. Four alternative plans have been developed in a Wetlands Park Master Plan being prepared
by the Clark County Departments of Comprehensive Planning and Parks and Recreation. These alternatives, plus a no
action alternative, will be evaluated in the EIS. All action alternatives include approximately 15 erosion control
structures in Las Vegas Wash, as well as extensive wetlands enhancement. Each alternative focuses on a concept of
intensity and type of park use: conservation, recreation, full development, and a balance of the three. The draft
EIS is expected to be available for public review and comment by the middle of 1995. 


Public workshops with agency representatives and interested parties have been held on the Master Plan to ensure that
the park components are appropriate to the community and the environment. Future public meetings will include an
EIS scoping meeting and a public hearing to ensure that a full range of all issues related to the proposed action are
identified and addressed.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Labor (DOL) is publishing, for public 
information, a list of the following health care facilities that have submitted attestations (Form ETA 9029 and explanatory
statements) to one of four Regional Offices of DOL (Boston, Chicago, Dallas and Seattle) for the purpose of employing
nonimmigrant alien nurses. A decision has been made on these organizations' attestations and they are on file with
DOL. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
The Immigration and Nationality Act requires that a health care facility seeking to use nonimmigrant aliens as registered
nurses first attest to the Department of Labor (DOL) that it is taking significant steps to develop, recruit and retain
United States (U.S.) workers in the nursing profession. The law also requires that these foreign nurses will not adversely
affect U.S. nurses and that the foreign nurses will be treated fairly. The facility's attestation must be on file with
DOL before the Immigration and Naturalization Service will consider the facility's H-1A visa petitions for
bringing nonimmigrant registered nurses to the United States. 26 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(a) and 1181(m). The
regulations implementing the nursing attestation program are at 20 CFR Parts 655, Subpart D, and 29 CFR Part 504, (January
6, 1994). The Employment and Training Administration, pursuant to 20 CFR 655.310(c), is publishing the following
list of facilities which have submitted attestations which have been accepted for filing and those which have been
rejected. 


The list of facilities is published so that U.S. registered nurses, and other persons and organizations can be aware
of health care facilities that have requested foreign nurses for their staff. If U.S. registered nurses or other persons
wish to examine the attestation (on Form ETA 9029) and the supporting documentation, the facility is required to make
the attestation and documentation available. Telephone numbers of the facilities chief executive officer also
are listed to aid public inquiries. In addition, attestations and explanatory statements (but not the full supporting
documentation) are available for inspection at the address for the Employment and Training Administration set forth
in the 

ADDRESSES

 section of this notice. 
If a person wishes to file a complaint regarding a particular attestation or a facility's activities under the 
attestation, such complaint must be filed at the address for the Wage and Hour Division of the Employment Standards
Administration set forth in the 

ADDRESSES 

section of this notice.

The Company requested that the Department review its certification for workers of the subject firm. New information
from the company shows worker separations at various field offices in several states.


The findings show that workers at Billerica, Brighton and Lawrence produced the same adversely affected product_computers.
Other findings show that some of the workers at Billerica transferred to Brighton or Lawrence, Massachusetts. The
findings show nearly a 3-month coverage gap that prevents workers who transferred from Billerica to Brighton or Lawrence
from collecting TAA if they were separated during the coverage gap.


The intent of the certification is to include all the workers at Bull HN Information Systems who were adversely affected
by increased imports of computers, including workers in the various field offices.


Accordingly, the Department is terminating TAA coverage for workers filing under TA-W-29,860 and TA-W-29,860A
and including them under TA-W-29,522ZA and TA-W-29,522ZB, respectively.


The amended notice applicable to TA-W-29,522 is hereby issued as follows:







All workers of Bull HN Information Systems, Inc., Billerica, Massachusetts; Lawrence, Massachusetts and Brighton,
Massachusetts and at various field offices in Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Colorado,
Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Maryland, Maine, Michigan,
Minnesota, Missouri, Mississippi, North Carolina, North Dakota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico,

Texas, Utah, Virginia, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin engaged in employment related to the production of computers
who became totally or partially separated from employment on or after February 4, 1993 are eligible to apply for adjustment
assistance under Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974.


I further determine that certifications TA-W-29,860 and TA-W-29,860A are terminated effective
October 11, 1994, because the workers are covered under TA-W-29,522ZA and TA-W-29,522ZB
effective October 11, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Philips Lighting Company, Philips Electronics North American, Washington, PA; Notice of Negative Determination
on Reconsideration</DOCTITLE>



On September 6, 1994, the Department issued an Affirmative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration
for workers and former workers of the subject firm. This notice was published in the 

Federal Register 

on September 23, 1994 (59 FR 48914).

Counsel for the workers claim that the worker group eligibility test is met for the Washington workers because the
workers had a reduced demand for their warehousing services from Philips's Fairmont plant which was certified for
TAA.

Workers providing a service are certifiable only in very limited circumstances which were explained in the Department's
initial negative determination. The certification circumstances are that the worker separations must be caused
by a reduced demand for their services from a parent or controlling firm whose workers produce an article and who are
currently under a certification for TAA.

Findings on reconsideration show that Washington is not a 

source distribution center 

that warehouses finished products from a certain plant but is a 

field service distribution center 

(emphasis supplied) which warehouses inventory based on forecasted customer orders.

Accordingly, the Fairmont certification (TA-W-29,343) which was based on company imports would not
have adversely affected workers at the Washington facility since the products warehoused at Washington were based
on forecasted customer orders.

The reconsideration findings also show that only a very small amount of Washington's inventory originated from Fairmont.

Other findings show that the product previously warehoused in Washington is being stocked at Mountaintop, Pennsylvania;
Roselle, Illinois and Atlanta, Georgia.



Conclusion



After reconsideration, I affirm the original notice of negative determination of eligibility to apply for transitional
adjustment assistance to workers and former workers of Philips Lighting Company, Philips, Electronics North American
in Washington, Pennsylvania.




Signed at Washington, D.C, this 17th day of October, 1994.

A. Effective August 12, 1994, the restrictions of 
sections 406(a) and 407(a) of the Act and the taxes imposed by section 4975  (a) and (b) of the Code by reason of section
4975(c)(1) (A) through (D) of the Code shall not apply to the following transactions involving trusts and certificates
evidencing interests therein: 



(1) The direct or indirect sale, exchange or transfer of certificates in the initial issuance of certificates between
the sponsor or underwriter and an employee benefit plan when the sponsor, servicer, trustee or insurer of a trust,
the underwriter of the certificates representing an interest in the trust, or an obligor is a party in interest with
respect to such plan; 



(2) The direct or indirect acquisition or disposition 
of certificates by a plan in the secondary market for such certificates; and 



(3) The continued holding of certificates acquired by a plan pursuant to subsection I.A. (1) or (2). 



Notwithstanding the foregoing, section I.A. does not provide an exemption from the restrictions of sections 406(a)(1)(E),
406(a)(2) and 407 for the acquisition or holding of a certificate on behalf of an Excluded Plan by any person who has
discretionary authority or renders investment advice with respect to the assets of that Excluded Plan.
 







B. Effective August 12, 1994, the restrictions of sections 406(b)(1) and 406(b)(2) of the Act and the taxes imposed
by section 4975 (a) and (b) of the Code by reason of section 4975(c)(1)(E) of the Code shall not apply to: 



(1) The direct or indirect sale, exchange or 
transfer of certificates in the initial issuance of certificates between the sponsor or underwriter and a plan when
the person who has discretionary authority or renders investment advice with respect to the investment of plan assets
in the certificates is (a) an obligor with respect to 5 percent or less of the fair market value of obligations or receivables
contained in the trust, or (b) an affiliate of a person described in (a); if: 



 (i) The plan is not an Excluded Plan; 



 (ii) Solely in the case of an acquisition of certificates in connection with the initial issuance of the certificates,
at least 50 percent of each class of certificates in which plans have invested is acquired by persons independent of

independent of the Restricted Group; 



 (iii) A plan's investment in each class of certificates does not exceed 25 percent of all of the certificates of that
class outstanding at the time of the acquisition; and 



 (iv) Immediately after the acquisition of the 
certificates, no more than 25 percent of the assets of a plan with respect to which the person has discretionary authority
or 
renders investment advice are invested in certificates 
representing an interest in a trust containing assets sold or 
serviced by the same entity.
 For purposes of this paragraph B.(1)(iv) only, an entity will not be considered to service assets contained in a trust
if it is merely a subservicer of that trust; 







(2) The direct or indirect acquisition or disposition of certificates by a plan in the secondary market for such certificates,

with the servicing, management and operation of a trust, provided: 


 (1) Such transactions are carried out in accordance 
with the terms of a binding pooling and servicing arrangement; and

Notwithstanding the foregoing, section I.C. does not provide an exemption from the restrictions of section 406(b)
of the Act or from the taxes imposed by reason of section 4975(c) of the Code for the receipt of a fee by a servicer of the
trust from a person other than the trustee or sponsor, unless such fee constitutes a ``qualified administrative fee''
as defined in section III.S. 


 

D. Effective August 12, 1994, the restrictions of sections 406(a) and 407(a) of the Act, and the taxes imposed by sections
4975(a) and (b) of the Code by reason of sections 4975(c)(1)(A) through (D) of the Code, shall not apply to any transactions
to which those restrictions or taxes would otherwise apply merely because a person is deemed to be a party in interest
or disqualified person (including a fiduciary) with respect to a plan by virtue of providing services to the plan (or
by virtue of having a relationship to such service provider described in section 3(14)(F), (G), (H) or (I) of the Act
or section 4975(e)(2) (F), (G), (H) or (I) of the Code), solely because of the plan's ownership of certificates. 



II. General Conditions 


 

A. The relief provided under Part I is available only if the following conditions are met: 


 (1) The acquisition of certificates by a plan is on terms (including the certificate price) that are at least as favorable
to the plan as they would be in an arm's-length transaction with an unrelated party; 


 (2) The rights and interests evidenced by the certificates are not subordinated to the rights and interests evidenced
by other certificates of the same trust; 


 (3) The certificates acquired by the plan have received a rating at the time of such acquisition that is in one of the

Service, Inc. (Moody's), Duff & Phelps Inc. (D & P) or Fitch Investors Service, Inc. (Fitch); 


 (4) The trustee is not an affiliate of any member of the Restricted Group. However, the trustee shall not be considered
to be an affiliate of a servicer solely because the trustee has succeeded to the rights and responsibilities of the
servicer pursuant to the terms of a pooling and servicing agreement providing for such succession upon the occurrence
of one or more events of default by the servicer; 


 (5) The sum of all payments made to and retained by the underwriters in connection with the distribution or placement
of certificates represents not more than reasonable compensation for underwriting or placing the certificates;
the sum of all payments made to and retained by the sponsor pursuant to the assignment of obligations (or interests
therein) to the trust represents not more than the fair market value of such obligations (or interests); and the sum
of all payments made to and retained by the servicer represents not more than reasonable compensation for the servicer's
services under the pooling and servicing agreement and reimbursement of the servicer's reasonable expenses in connection
therewith; and 


 (6) The plan investing in such certificates is an ``accredited investor'' as defined in Rule 501(a)(1) of 
Regulation D of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933.

B. Neither any underwriter, sponsor, trustee, servicer, 
insurer, or any obligor, unless it or any of its affiliates has discretionary authority or renders investment advice
with respect to the plan assets used by a plan to acquire certificates, shall be denied the relief provided under Part
I, if the provision of subsection II.A.(6) above is not satisfied with respect to acquisition or holding by a plan of
such certificates, provided that (1) such condition is disclosed in the prospectus or private placement memorandum;
and (2) in the case of a private placement of certificates, the trustee obtains a representation from each initial
purchaser which is a plan that it is in compliance with such condition, and obtains a covenant from each initial purchaser
to the effect that, so long as such initial purchaser (or any transferee of such initial purchaser's certificates)
is required to obtain from its transferee a representation regarding compliance with the Securities Act of 1933,
any such transferees 
will be required to make a written representation regarding compliance with the condition set forth in subsection
II.A.(6) above.

purchase or sale of one or more certificates to be delivered at an agreed future settlement date. The term includes
both mandatory contracts (which contemplate obligatory delivery and acceptance of the certificates) and optional
contracts (which give one party the right but not the obligation to deliver certificates to, or demand delivery of
certificates from, the other party). 
R. ``Reasonable compensation'' has the same meaning as that 
term is defined in 29 CFR 2550.408c-2. 
S. ``Qualified Administrative Fee'' means a fee which meets 
the following criteria: 
(1) The fee is triggered by an act or failure to act 
by the obligor other than the normal timely payment of amounts 
owing in respect of the obligations; 
(2) The servicer may not charge the fee absent the act 
or failure to act referred to in (1); 
(3) The ability to charge the fee, the circumstances 
in which the fee may be charged, and an explanation of how the fee is calculated are set forth in the pooling and servicing
agreement; and 
(4) The amount paid to investors in the trust will 
not be reduced by the amount of any such fee waived by the servicer. 
T. ``Qualified Equipment Note Secured By A Lease'' means an 
equipment note:

(2) Which is secured by the obligation of the lessee 
to pay rent under the equipment lease; and

vehicle is at least as protective of the trust's rights as the trust would receive under a motor vehicle installment
loan contract. 
V. ``Pooling and Servicing Agreement'' means the agreement or agreements among a sponsor, a servicer and the trustee
establishing a trust. In the case of certificates which are denominated as debt instruments, ``Pooling and Servicing
Agreement'' also includes the indenture entered into by the trustee of the trust issuing such certificates and the

Summary of Facts and Representations 


1. ABS, an investment banking firm, provides financial advice to, and raises capital for, a broad range of domestic
and international clients. ABS conducts business from its headquarters in Baltimore and in various cities across
the United States, as well as London and Geneva. ABS is the oldest banking firm in the United States, having been in business
since 1800. Since its inception, ABS has been very active in the government bond, corporate equity and municipal finance
and housing finance areas. As of December 31, 1993, ABS had total assets of over $1.2 billion and total shareholder's
equity of over $345 million. For the year ended December 31, 1993, ABS had gross revenues of over $628 million and net
earnings, after income taxes, of over $89 million. 


Trust Assets 


2. ABS seeks exemptive relief to permit plans to invest in pass-through certificates representing undivided interests
in the following categories of trusts: (1) Single and multi-family residential or commercial mortgage investment
trusts;
 (2) motor vehicle receivable investment trusts; (3) consumer or commercial receivables investment trusts; and
(4) guaranteed governmental mortgage pool certificate investment trusts.
 







3. Commercial mortgage investment trusts may include mortgages on ground leases of real property. Commercial mortgages
are frequently secured by ground leases on the underlying property, rather than by fee simple interests. The separation
of the fee simple interest and the ground lease interest is generally done for tax reasons. Properly structured, the
pledge of the ground lease to secure a mortgage provides a lender with the same level of security as would be provided
by a pledge of the related fee simple interest. The terms of the ground leases pledged to secure leasehold mortgages
will in all cases be at least ten years longer than the term of such mortgages.

Trust Structure 


4. Each trust is established under a pooling and servicing agreement between a sponsor, a servicer and a trustee. The
sponsor or servicer of a trust selects assets to be included in the trust. These assets are receivables which may have
been originated by a sponsor or servicer of the trust, an affiliate of the sponsor or servicer, or by an unrelated lender
and subsequently acquired by the trust sponsor or servicer. 
On or prior to the closing date, the sponsor acquires legal title to all assets selected for the trust, establishes
the trust and designates an independent entity as trustee. On the closing date, the sponsor conveys to the trust legal
title to the assets, and the trustee issues certificates representing fractional undivided interests in the trust
assets. ABS, alone or together with other broker-dealers, acts as underwriter or placement agent with respect to
the sale of the certificates. The majority of the public offerings of certificates made to date have been underwritten
on a firm commitment basis. However, some may be undertaken on a best efforts basis. In addition, ABS has privately
placed certificates on both a firm commitment and an agency basis. ABS may also act as the lead underwriter for a syndicate
of securities underwriters. ABS may also act as the servicer or seller to the trust of the receivables or the trust sponsor.

Certificate holders are entitled to receive monthly, quarterly or semi-annually installments of principal and/or
interest, or lease payments due on the receivables, adjusted, in the case of payments of interest, to a specified rate_the
pass-through rate_which may be fixed or variable. 
When installments or payments are made on a semi-annual basis, funds are not permitted to be commingled with the servicer's
assets for longer than would be permitted for a monthly-pay security. A segregated account is established in the name
of the trustee (on behalf of certificate holders) to hold funds received between distribution dates. The account
is under the sole control of the trustee, who invests the account's assets in short-term securities which have received
a rating comparable to the rating assigned to the certificates. In some cases, the servicer may be permitted to make
a single deposit into the account once a month. When the servicer makes such monthly deposits, payments received from
obligors by the servicer may be commingled with the servicer's assets during the month prior to deposit. Usually,
the period of time between receipt of funds by the servicer and deposit of these funds in a segregated account does not
exceed one month. Furthermore, in those cases where distributions are made semi-annually, the servicer will furnish
a report on the operation of the trust to the trustee on a monthly basis. At or about the time this report is delivered
to the trustee, it will be made available to certificate holders and delivered to or made available to each rating agency
that has rated the certificates.

5. Some of the certificates will be multi-class certificates. ABS requests exemptive relief for two types of multi-class
certificates: ``strip'' certificates and ``fast-pay/slow-pay'' certificates. Strip certificates are a type
of security in which the stream of interest payments on receivables is split from the flow of principal payments and
separate classes of certificates are established, each representing rights to disproportionate payments of principal
and interest.

7

 




``Fast-pay/slow-pay'' certificates involve the issuance of classes of certificates having different stated maturities
or the same maturities with different payment schedules. In certain transactions of this type, interest and/or principal
payments received on the underlying receivables are distributed first to the class of certificates having the earliest
stated maturity of principal, and/or earlier payment schedule, and only when that class of certificates have been
paid in full (or has received a specified amount) will distributions be made with respect to the second class of certificates.
Distributions on certificates having later stated maturities will proceed in like manner until all the certificateholders
have been paid in full. The only difference between this multi-class pass-through arrangement and a single-class
pass-through arrangement is the order in which distributions are made to certificateholders. In each case, certificateholders
will have a beneficial ownership interest in the underlying assets. In neither case will the rights of a plan purchasing
a certificate be subordinated to the rights of another certificateholder in the event of default on any of the underlying
obligations. In particular, if the amount available for distribution to certificateholders is less than the amount
required to be so distributed, all senior certificateholders then entitled to receive distributions will share
in the amount distributed on a pro rata basis.

8

 




6. For tax reasons, the trust must be maintained as an essentially passive entity. Therefore, both the sponsor's discretion
and the servicer's discretion with respect to assets included in a trust are severely limited. Pooling and servicing
agreements provide for the substitution of receivables by the sponsor only in the event of defects in documentation
discovered within a short time after the issuance of trust certificates. Any receivable so substituted is required
to have characteristics substantially similar to the replaced receivable and will be at least as creditworthy as
the replaced receivable.

In some cases, the affected receivable would be repurchased, with the purchase price applied as a payment on the affected
receivable and passed through to certificateholders. 



 

Parties to Transactions 


 

7. The 

originator

 of a receivable is the entity that initially lends money to a borrower (obligor), such as a homeowner or automobile
purchaser, or leases property to the lessee. The originator may either retain a receivable in its portfolio or sell
it to a purchaser, such as a trust sponsor. 


 Originators of receivables included in the trusts will be entities that originate receivables in the ordinary course
of their business, including finance companies for whom such origination constitutes the bulk of their operations,
financial institutions for whom such origination constitutes a substantial part of their operations, and any kind
of manufacturer, merchant, or service enterprise for whom such origination is an incidental part of its operations.
Each trust may contain assets of one or more originators. The originator of the receivables may also function as the
trust sponsor or servicer. 


 8. The 

sponsor

 will be one of three entities: (i) A special-purpose corporation unaffiliated with the servicer, (ii) a special-purpose
or other corporation affiliated with the servicer, or (iii) the servicer itself. Where the sponsor is not also the
servicer, the sponsor's role will generally be limited to acquiring the receivables to be included in the trust, establishing
the trust, designating the trustee, and assigning the receivables to the trust. 


 9. The 

trustee

 of a trust is the legal owner of the obligations in the trust. The trustee is also a party to or beneficiary of all the documents
and instruments deposited in the trust, and as such is responsible for enforcing all the rights created thereby in
favor of certificateholders. 
 

 The trustee will be an independent entity, and therefore will be unrelated to ABS, the trust sponsor or the servicer.
ABS represents that the trustee will be a substantial financial institution or trust company experienced in trust
activities. The trustee receives a fee for its services, which will be paid by the servicer, sponsor or the trust as
specified in the pooling and servicing agreement. The method of compensating the trustee which is specified in the
pooling and servicing agreement will be disclosed in the prospectus or private placement memorandum relating to
the offering of the certificates. 


 10. The 

servicer

 of a trust administers the receivables on behalf of the certificateholders. The servicer's functions typically
involve, among other things, notifying borrowers of amounts due on receivables, maintaining records of payments
received on receivables and instituting foreclosure or similar proceedings in the event of default. In cases where
a pool of receivables has been purchased from a number of different originators and deposited in a trust, it is common
for the receivables to be ``subserviced'' by their respective originators and for a single entity to ``master service''
the pool of receivables on behalf of the owners of the related series of certificates. Where this arrangement is adopted,
a receivable continues to be serviced from the perspective of the borrower by the local subservicer, while the investor's
perspective is that the entire pool of receivables is serviced by a single, central master servicer who collects payments
from the local subservicers and passes them through to certificateholders. 
 

 In some cases, the originator and servicer of receivables to be included in a trust and the sponsor of the trust (though
they themselves may be related) will be unrelated to ABS. In other cases, however, affiliates of ABS may originate
or service receivables included in a trust, or may sponsor a trust. 



Certificate Price, Pass-Through Rate and Fees 


 

11. Where the sponsor of a trust is not the originator of receivables included in a trust, the sponsor generally purchases
the receivables in the secondary market, either directly from the originator or from another secondary market participant.
The price the sponsor pays for a receivable is determined by competitive market forces, taking into account payment
terms, interest rate, quality, and forecasts as to future interest rates. 


 As compensation for the receivables transferred to the trust, the sponsor receives certificates representing the
entire beneficial interest in the trust, or the cash proceeds of the sale of such certificates. If the sponsor receives
certificates from the trust, the sponsor sells all or a portion of these certificates for cash to investors or securities
underwriters. In some transactions, the sponsor or an affiliate may retain a portion of the certificates for its own
account. In addition, in some transactions the originator may sell receivables to a trust for cash. At the time of the
sale, the trustee would sell certificates to the public or to underwriters and use the cash proceeds of the sale to pay
the originator for receivables sold to the trust. The transfer of the receivables to the trust by the sponsor, the sale
of certificates to investors, and the receipt of the cash proceeds by the sponsor generally take place simultaneously.

12. The price of the certificates, both in the initial offering and in the secondary market, is affected by market forces,
including investor demand, the pass-through interest rate on the certificates in relation to the rate payable on
investments of similar types and quality, expectations as to the effect on yield resulting from prepayment of underlying
receivables, and expectations as to the likelihood of timely payment. 


 The pass-through rate for certificates is equal to the interest rate on receivables included in the trust minus a specified
servicing fee.

9

 This rate is generally determined by the same market forces that determine the price of a certificate. The price of
a certificate and its pass-through, or coupon, rate together determine the yield to investors. If an investor purchases
a certificate at less than par, that discount augments the stated pass-through rate; conversely, a certificate purchased
at a premium yields less than the stated coupon. 

 



13. As compensation for performing its servicing duties, the servicer (who may also be the sponsor, and receive fees
for acting in that capacity) will retain the difference between payments received on the receivables in the trust
and payments payable (at the pass-through rate) to certificateholders, except that in some cases a portion of the
payments on receivables may be paid to a third party, such as a fee paid to a provider of credit support. The servicer
may receive additional compensation by having the use of the amounts paid on the receivables between the time they
are received by the servicer and the time they are due to the trust (which time is set forth in the pooling and servicing
agreement). The servicer will be required to pay the administrative expenses of servicing the trust, including,
in some cases, the trustee's fee, out of its servicing compensation. 


 The servicer is also compensated to the extent it may provide credit enhancement to the trust or otherwise arrange
to obtain credit support from another party. This ``credit support fee'' may be aggregated with other servicing fees,
and is either paid out of the interest income received on the receivables in excess of the pass-through rate or paid
in a lump sum at the time the trust is established. 


 14. The servicer may be entitled to retain certain administrative fees paid by a third party, usually the obligor.
These administrative fees fall into three categories: 
(a) Prepayment fees; (b) Late payment and payment extension fees; and (c) Fees and charges associated with foreclosure
or repossession, or other conversion of a secured position into cash proceeds, upon default of an obligation. 
 

 Compensation payable to the servicer will be set forth or referred to in the pooling and servicing agreement and described
in reasonable detail in the prospectus or private placement memorandum relating to the certificates. 


 15. Payments on receivables may be made by obligors to the servicer at various times during the period preceding any
date on which pass-through payments to the trust are due. In some cases, the pooling and servicing agreement may permit
the servicer to place these payments in non-interest bearing accounts in itself or to commingle such payments with
its own funds prior to the distribution dates. In these cases, the servicer would be entitled to the benefit derived
from the use of the funds between the date of payment on a receivable and the pass-through date. Commingled payments
may not be protected from the creditors of the servicer in the event of the servicer's bankruptcy or receivership.
In those instances when payments on receivables are held in non-interest bearing accounts or are commingled with
the servicer's own funds, the servicer is required to deposit these payments by a date specified in the pooling and
servicing agreement into an account from which the trustee makes payments to certificateholders. 
 

 16. ABS and any other participating underwriter will receive a fee in connection with the securities underwriting
or private placement of certificates. In a firm commitment underwriting, this fee would normally consist of the difference
between what ABS receives for the certificates that it distributes and what it pays the sponsor for those certificates.
In a private placement, the fee may also take the form of an agency commission paid by the sponsor. Such fees are negotiated
at arm's-length with the sponsor, originator or unrelated lender and are affected by fees in comparable offerings.




Purchase of Receivables by the Servicer 


 

17. The applicant represents that as the principal amount of the receivables in a trust is reduced by payments, the
cost of administering the trust generally increases, making the servicing of the trust prohibitively expensive
at some point. 
Consequently, the pooling and servicing agreement generally provides that the servicer may purchase the receivables
remaining in the trust when the aggregate unpaid balance payable on the receivables is reduced to a specified percentage
(usually 5 to 10 percent) of the initial aggregate unpaid balance.

<DOCNO> FR941025-2-00113 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941025-2-00065 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The purchase price of a receivable is specified in the pooling and servicing agreement and will be at least equal to:
(1) The unpaid principal balance on the receivable plus accrued interest, less any unreimbursed advances of principal
made by the servicer; or (2) The greater of (a) the amount in (1) or (b) the fair market value of such obligations in the
case of a REMIC, or the fair market value of the certificates in the case of a trust that is not a REMIC. 


Certificate Ratings 


18. The certificates will have received one of the three highest ratings available from either S&P's, Moody's,
D&P or Fitch. Insurance or other credit support (such as surety bonds, letters of credit, guarantees, or the creation
of a class of certificates with subordinated cash flow) will be obtained by the trust sponsor to the extent necessary
for the certificates to attain the desired rating. The amount of this credit support is set by the rating agencies at
a level that is a multiple of the worst historical net credit loss experience for the type of obligations included in
the issuing trust. 


Provision of Credit Support 


19. In some cases, the master servicer, or an affiliate of the master servicer, may provide credit support to the trust
(i.e. act as an insurer). In these cases, the master servicer, in its capacity as servicer, will first advance funds
to the full extent that it determines that such advances will be recoverable (a) out of late payments by the obligors,
(b) out of liquidation proceeds, (c) from the credit support provider (which may be itself) or, (d) in the case of a trust
that issues subordinated certificates, from amounts otherwise distributable to holders of subordinated certificates,
and the master servicer will advance such funds in a timely manner. When the servicer is the provider of the credit support
and provides its own funds to cover defaulted payments, it will do so either on the initiative of the trustee, or on its
own initiative on behalf of the trustee, but in either event it will provide such funds to cover payments to the full
extent of its obligations under the credit support mechanism. In some cases, however, the master servicer may not
be obligated to advance funds but instead would be called upon to provide funds to cover defaulted payments to the full
extent of its obligations as insurer. However, a master servicer typically can recover advances either from the provider
of credit support or from future payments on the affected assets. 
If the master servicer fails to advance funds, fails to call upon the credit support mechanism to provide funds to cover
delinquent payments, or otherwise fails in its duties, the trustee would be required and would be able to enforce the
certificateholders' rights, as both a party to the pooling and servicing agreement and the owner of the trust estate,
including rights under the credit support mechanism. Therefore, the trustee, who is independent of the servicer,
will have the ultimate right to enforce the credit support arrangement. 
When a master servicer advances funds, the amount so advanced is recoverable by the servicer out of future payments
on receivables held by the trust to the extent not covered by credit support. However, where the master servicer provides
credit support to the trust, there are protections in place to guard against a delay in calling upon the credit support
to take advantage of the fact that the credit support declines proportionally with the decrease in the principal amount
of the obligations in the trust as payments on receivables are passed through to investors. These safeguards include:

(a) There is often a disincentive to postponing credit losses because the sooner repossession or foreclosure activities
are commenced, the more value that can be realized on the security for the obligation; 
(b) The master servicer has servicing guidelines which include a general policy as to the allowable delinquency period
after which an obligation ordinarily will be deemed uncollectible. The pooling and servicing agreement will require
the master servicer to follow its normal servicing guidelines and will set forth the master servicer's general policy
as to the period of time after which delinquent obligations ordinarily will be considered uncollectible; 
(c) As frequently as payments are due on the receivables included in the trust (monthly, quarterly or semi-annually,
as set forth in the pooling and servicing agreement), the master servicer is required to report to the independent
trustee the amount of all past-due payments and the amount of all servicer advances, along with other current information
as to collections on the receivables and draws upon the credit support. Further, the master servicer is required to
deliver to the trustee annually a certificate of an executive officer of the master servicer stating that a review
of the servicing activities has been made under such officer's supervision, and either stating that the master servicer
has fulfilled all of its obligations under the pooling and servicing agreement or, if the master servicer has defaulted
under any of its obligations, specifying any such default. The master servicer's reports are reviewed at least annually
by independent accountants to ensure that the master servicer is following its normal servicing standards and that
the master servicer's reports conform to the master servicer's internal accounting records. The results of the independent
accountants' review are delivered to the trustee; and

<TEXT>
 

(d) The credit support has a ``floor'' dollar amount that protects investors against the possibility that a large
number of credit losses might occur towards the end of the life of the trust, whether due to servicer advances or any
other cause. Once the floor amount has been reached, the servicer lacks an incentive to postpone the recognition of
credit losses because the credit support amount becomes a fixed dollar amount subject to reduction only for actual
draws. From the time that the floor amount is effective until the end of the life of the trust, there are no proportionate
reductions in the credit support amount caused by reductions in the pool principal balance. Indeed, since the floor
is a fixed dollar amount, the amount of credit support ordinarily increases as a percentage of the pool principal balance
during the period that the floor is in effect. 


Disclosure 


20. In connection with the original issuance of certificates, the prospectus or private placement memorandum will
be furnished to investing plans. The prospectus or private placement memorandum will contain information material
to a fiduciary's decision to invest in the certificates, including: 
(a) Information concerning the payment terms of the certificates, the rating of the certificates, and any material
risk factors with respect to the certificates; 
 (b) A description of the trust as a legal entity and a description of how the trust was formed by the seller/servicer
or other sponsor of the transaction; 
 (c) Identification of the independent trustee for the trust; 
(d) A description of the receivables contained in the trust, including the types of receivables, the diversification
of the receivables, their principal terms, and their material legal aspects; 
(e) A description of the sponsor and servicer;

<PARENT> FR941025-2-00065 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(f) A description of the pooling and servicing agreement, including a description of the seller's principal representations
and warranties as to the trust assets and the trustee's remedy for any breach thereof; a description of the procedures
for collection of payments on receivables and for making distributions to investors, and a description of the accounts
into which such payments are deposited and from which such distributions are made; identification of the servicing
compensation and any fees for credit enhancement that are deducted from payments on receivables before distributions
are made to investors; a description of periodic statements provided to the trustee, and provided to or made available
to investors by the trustee; and a description of the events that constitute events of default under the pooling and
servicing contract and a description of the trustee's and the investors' remedies incident thereto; 

(g) A description of the credit support; 
(h) A general discussion of the principal federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition
of the pass-through securities by a typical investor; 
(i) A description of the underwriters' plan for distributing the pass-through securities to investors; and 
(j) Information about the scope and nature of the secondary market, if any, for the certificates. 
21. Reports indicating the amount of payments of principal and interest are provided to certificateholders at least
as frequently as distributions are made to certificateholders. Certificateholders will also be provided with periodic
information statements setting forth material information concerning the underlying assets, including, where
applicable, information as to the amount and number of delinquent and defaulted loans or receivables. 
22. In the case of a trust that offers and sells certificates in a registered public offering, the trustee, the servicer
or the sponsor will file such periodic reports as may be required to be filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Although some trusts that offer certificates in a public offering will file quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and
Annual Reports on Form 10-K, many trusts obtain, by application to the Securities and Exchange Commission,
a complete exemption from the requirement to file quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and a modification of the disclosure
requirements for annual reports on Form 10-K. If such an exemption is obtained, these trusts normally would
continue to have the obligation to file current reports on Form 8-K to report material developments concerning
the trust and the certificates. While the Securities and Exchange Commission's interpretation of the periodic reporting
requirements is subject to change, periodic reports concerning a trust will be filed to the extent required under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
23. At or about the time distributions are made to certificateholders, a report will be delivered to the trustee as
to the status of the trust and its assets, including underlying obligations. Such report will typically contain information
regarding the trust's assets, payments received or collected by the servicer, the amount of prepayments, delinquencies,
servicer advances, defaults and foreclosures, the amount of any payments made pursuant to any credit support, and
the amount of 
compensation payable to the servicer. Such report also will be delivered to or made available to the rating agency
or agencies that have rated the trust's certificates. 
In addition, promptly after each distribution date, certificateholders will receive a statement prepared by the
servicer, paying agent or trustee summarizing information regarding the trust and its assets. Such statement will
include information regarding the trust and its assets, including underlying receivables. Such statement will
typically contain information regarding payments and prepayments, delinquencies, the remaining amount of the
guaranty or other credit support and a breakdown of payments between principal and interest. 


Secondary Market Transactions 


24. It is ABS's normal policy to attempt to make a market for securities for which it is lead or co-managing underwriter,
and it is ABS's intention to attempt to make a market for any certificates for which ABS is lead or co-managing underwriter.
In general, it is also ABS's policy to facilitate sales by investors who purchase certificates if ABS has acted as agent
or principal in the original private placement of the certificates and if such investors request ABS's assistance.

Retroactive Relief 


25. ABS represents that it has engaged in transactions related to mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities based
on the assumption that retroactive relief would not be granted. However, it is possible that some transactions may
have occurred that would be prohibited. For example, because many certificates are held in street or nominee name,
it is not always possible to identify whether the percentage interest of plans in a trust is or is not ``significant''
for purposes of the Department's regulation relating to the definition of plan assets (29 CFR 2510.3-101(f)).
These problems are compounded as transactions occur in the secondary market. In addition, with respect to the ``publicly-offered
security'' exception contained in that regulation (29 CFR 2510.3-101(b)), it is difficult to determine whether
each purchaser of a certificate is independent of all other purchasers. 
Therefore, ABS requests relief retroactive for transactions which have occurred on or after August 12, 1994, the
date ABS originally filed its exemption application with the Department. 


Summary 


26. In summary, the applicant represents that the 
transactions for which exemptive relief is requested satisfy the statutory criteria of section 408(a) of the Act
due to the following: 
(a) The trusts contain ``fixed pools'' of assets. There is little discretion on the part of the trust sponsor to substitute
receivables contained in the trust once the trust has been formed; 
(b) Certificates in which plans invest will have been rated in one of the three highest rating categories by S&P's,
Moody's, D&P or Fitch. Credit support will be obtained to the extent necessary to attain the desired rating; 
(c) All transactions for which ABS seeks exemptive relief will be governed by the pooling and servicing agreement,
which is made available to plan fiduciaries for their review prior to the plan's investment in certificates; 
(d) Exemptive relief from sections 406(b) and 407 for 
sales to plans is substantially limited; and 
(e) ABS has made, and anticipates that it will 
continue to make, a secondary market in certificates.

Discussion of Proposed Exemption 



I. Differences between Proposed Exemption and Class Exemption 
PTE 83-1 


 

The exemptive relief proposed herein is similar to that provided in PTE 81-7 [46 FR 7520, January 23, 1981], Class
Exemption for Certain Transactions Involving Mortgage Pool Investment Trusts, amended and restated as PTE 83-1
[48 FR 895, January 7, 1983]. 
 

 PTE 83-1 applies to mortgage pool investment trusts consisting of interest-bearing obligations secured by
first or second mortgages or deeds of trust on single-family residential property. The exemption provides relief
from sections 406(a) and 407 for the sale, exchange or transfer in the initial issuance of mortgage pool certificates
between the trust sponsor and a plan, when the sponsor, trustee or insurer of the trust is a 
party-in-interest with respect to the plan, and the continued holding of such certificates, provided that the conditions
set forth in the exemption are met. PTE 83-1 also provides exemptive relief from section 406(b)(1) and (b)(2)
of the Act for the above-described transactions when the sponsor, trustee or insurer of the trust is a fiduciary with
respect to the plan assets invested in such certificates, provided that additional conditions set forth in the exemption
are met. In particular, section 406(b) relief is conditioned upon the approval of the transaction by an independent
fiduciary. Moreover, the total value of certificates purchased by a plan must not exceed 
25 percent of the amount of the issue, and at least 50 percent of the aggregate amount of the issue must be acquired by
persons independent of the trust sponsor, trustee or insurer. Finally, PTE 83-1 provides conditional exemptive
relief from section 406(a) and (b) of the Act for transactions in connection with the servicing and operation of the
mortgage trust. 


 Under PTE 83-1, exemptive relief for the above transactions is conditioned upon the sponsor and the trustee
of the mortgage trust maintaining a system for insuring or otherwise protecting the pooled mortgage loans and the
property securing such loans, and for indemnifying certificateholders against reductions in pass-through payments
due to defaults in loan payments or property damage. This system must provide such protection and indemnification
up to an amount not less than the greater of one percent of the aggregate principal balance of all trust 
mortgages or the principal balance of the largest mortgage. 
 

 The exemptive relief proposed herein differs from that provided by PTE 83-1 in the following major respects:
(1) The proposed exemption provides individual exemptive relief rather than class relief; (2) The proposed exemption
covers 
transactions involving trusts containing a broader range of assets than single-family residential mortgages;
(3) Instead of requiring a system for insuring the pooled receivables, the proposed exemption conditions relief
upon the certificates having received one of the three highest ratings available from S&P's, Moody's, D&P
or Fitch (insurance or other credit support would be obtained only to the extent necessary for the certificates to
attain the desired rating); and (4) The proposed exemption provides more limited section 406(b) and section 407 relief
for sales transactions. 



II. Ratings of Certificates 


 

After consideration of the representations of the applicant and information provided by S&P's, Moody's, D&P
and Fitch, the Department has decided to condition exemptive relief upon the certificates having attained a rating
in one of the three highest generic rating categories from S&P's, Moody's, D&P or Fitch. The Department believes
that the rating condition will permit the applicant flexibility in structuring trusts containing a variety of mortgages
and other receivables while ensuring that the interests of plans investing in certificates are protected. The Department
also believes that the ratings are indicative of the relative safety of investments in trusts containing secured
receivables. The Department is conditioning the proposed exemptive relief upon each particular type of asset-backed
security having been rated in one of the three highest rating categories for at least one year and having been sold to
investors other than plans for at least one year.

III. Limited Section 406(b) and Section 407(a) Relief for Sales 


 

ABS represents that in some cases a trust sponsor, trustee, servicer, insurer, and obligor with respect to receivables
contained in a trust, or an underwriter of certificates may be a pre-existing party in interest with respect to an investing
plan.

11

 In these cases, a direct or indirect sale of certificates by that party in interest to the plan would be a prohibited
sale or exchange of property under section 406(a)(1)(A) of the Act.

12

 Likewise, issues are raised under section 406(a)(1)(D) of the Act where a plan fiduciary causes a plan to purchase
certificates where trust funds will be used to benefit a party in interest. 
 





Additionally, ABS represents that a trust sponsor, servicer, trustee, insurer, and obligor with respect to receivables
contained in a trust, or an underwriter of certificates representing an interest in a trust may be a fiduciary with
respect to an investing plan. ABS represents that the exercise of fiduciary authority by any of these parties to cause
the plan to invest in certificates representing an interest in the trust would violate section 406(b)(1), and in some
cases section 406(b)(2), of the Act. 


 Moreover, ABS represents that to the extent there is a plan asset ``look through'' to the underlying assets of a trust,
the investment in certificates by a plan covering employees of an obligor under receivables contained in a trust may
be prohibited by sections 406(a) and 407(a) of the Act. 


 After consideration of the issues involved, the Department has determined to provide the limited sections 406(b)
and 407(a) relief as specified in the proposed exemption. 


 

Notice to Interested Persons 


 

The applicant represents that because those potentially interested participants and beneficiaries cannot all
be identified, the only practical means of notifying such participants and beneficiaries of this proposed exemption
is by the publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

. Comments and requests for a hearing must be received by the Department not later than 30 days from the date of publication
of this notice of proposed exemption in the 

Federal Register

 The Masters, Mates and Pilots Pension Plan 
(the Pension Plan) and Individual Retirement 
Account Plan (the IRAP; Together, the Plans) 
Located in Linthicum Heights, Maryland 



[Application Nos. D-9618 and D-9619] 



Proposed Exemption 



The Department is considering granting an exemption under the authority of section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code and in accordance with the procedures set forth in 29 CFR Part 2570, Subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August
10, 1990). If the exemption is granted, the restrictions of sections 406(a), 406(b)(1) and (b)(2) and 407(a) of the
Act and the sanctions resulting from the application of section 4975 of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1)(A)
through (E) of the Code, shall not apply to the continued holding by the Plans of their shares of stock (the Stock) in
American Heavy Lift Shipping Company (AHL), provided that (a) the Plans' independent fiduciary has determined that
the Plans' holding of the Stock is appropriate for the Plans and in the best interests of the Plans' participants and
beneficiaries; and (b) the Plans' independent fiduciary continues to monitor the Plans' holding of the Stock and
determines at all times that such transaction remains in the best interests of the Plans. 



Temporary Nature of Exemption 



If the proposed exemption is granted, the exemption will be effective until the later of: (1) December 31, 1995, or
(2) December 31, 1996 provided another application for exemption is filed with the Department prior to December 31,
1995. 



Summary of Facts and Representations 



1. The Pension Plan is a defined benefit plan that currently has approximately 5,800 participants. As of December
31, 1992, the Pension Plan had approximately $673 million in assets. The IRAP is a defined contribution plan that currently
has approximately 5,200 participants. As of December 31, 1992, the IRAP had approximately $87 million in assets.
The Plans principally cover members of the International Organization of Masters, Mates and Pilots. 

2. Bear Stearns Fiduciary Services, Inc. (BSFS) is a registered investment advisor which serves as the Named Fiduciary
for the Special Assets Portfolio of the Plans. The Special Assets Portfolio consists of various venture capital and
other non-liquid investments which were made by a former investment manager of the Plans, Tower Asset Management,
Inc. (Tower), and which were the subject of protracted litigation (the Litigation) between the Department, Tower,
the Plans and certain of their trustees, and certain plan participants.

13

 The Litigation ultimately was settled pursuant to Court Order entered by the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York (the Court). 





3. In the course of the Litigation, BSFS was appointed Named Fiduciary for the Plans' Special Assets Portfolio by Court
Order dated September 18, 1990 (the Court Order). BSFS assumed its responsibilities on November 8, 1990. The Court
Order provided that the Named Fiduciary, rather than the Plans' trustees, has the ``sole, exclusive, full and complete
authority and discretion concerning the control, management and disposition of the Special Assets Portfolio''.


4. Since February, 1987, the Plans have each owned 45 shares of the Stock, which Stock represents all of the outstanding
shares of AHL. AHL is a Delaware corporation, headquartered in Houston, Texas, that is engaged in the shipping industry.
Its principal assets consist of four single-hulled tankers, built in the 1950's, that are used primarily for the transportation
of petroleum products in the Jones Act trade (i.e., American-flagged tankers in the domestic intra-coastal trade).
The Plans' Stock can be traced back to certain prior investments made by Tower and is held in the Plans' Special Assets
Portfolio, along with the Plans' other remaining Tower-initiated investments. 

5. Since AHL is an employer of employees covered under the Plans, the Stock constitutes employer securities under
section 407(d)(1) of the Act. The applicants represent that the Stock constituted qualifying employer securities
within the meaning of section 407(d)(5) of the Act at the time of its acquisition, but as of January 1, 1993, the Stock
ceased to be a qualifying employer security because the Stock is wholly-owned by the Plans and thus cannot meet the
requirements of section 407(f) of the Act. However, the Plans' continued holding of the Stock is currently exempt
from the prohibited transaction restrictions of the Act pursuant to Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption No.
79-15 as a result of a court order, dated November 2, 1992, entered in the Litigation (the PTE 79-15 Order).
Under the terms of the PTE 79-15 Order, this exemption is effective until the later of: a) December 31, 1993; or
b) December 31, 1994, provided the Plans make application to the Department for an exemption to permit the continued
holding of the Stock. By filing the request which is the subject of the exemption proposed herein, the exemption provided
under the PTE 79-15 Order has been automatically extended to December 31, 1994.

6. While BSFS, in its capacity as Named Fiduciary, has ultimate investment management responsibility for the Special
Assets Portfolio, it does not exercise investment management discretion over the portfolio's assets on a day-to-day
basis. Rather, as contemplated by the Court Order, responsibility for the day-to-day management and supervision
of the portfolio's assets has been delegated at all times to independent investment managers selected by BSFS. With
respect to the Plans' investment in the Stock, such responsibility was first delegated to Sunwestern Advisors, L.P.
(Sunwestern), which served as the investment manager for this investment until July 14, 1992. Effective that date,
Sunwestern's responsibilities were assumed by a new investment manager, Potomac Asset Management, Inc. (Potomac),
which continues to serve in that capacity. 

7. Potomac, a registered investment adviser founded in 1978, is owned by three principals, all of whom are analysts
as well as portfolio managers. In addition to the principals, Potomac has an experienced fixed-income manager, equity
manager, and corporate finance consultant. In addition to its traditional investment management of $165 million
in bond and stock portfolios, Potomac maintains a corporate finance business consisting of private placement consulting
and monitoring for pension funds, fair market value analysis for various clients, restructuring and financing of
private companies and related activities. Potomac has had experience in managing investments by multi-employer
plans in privately-held companies, similar to the situation involving the Plans' investment in the Stock. 

8. Potomac represents that aggressive efforts were made by Sunwestern to sell the Plans' Stock in 1991 and 1992. These
efforts were unsuccessful largely due to the age of AHL's ships and market uncertainties created by the Oil Pollution
Act of 1990 (OPA 1990). By the time these sales efforts were discontinued in mid-1992, no bona fide offers for any price
above essentially scrap value had materialized. Under OPA 1990, every single-hull tanker engaged in the domestic
petroleum trade must be converted to a double-hulled tanker or it will be phased out of service beginning in 1995, depending
upon its year of construction. AHL's four tankers were constructed between 1957 and 1960. Therefore, AHL must either
double-hull two of the tankers before the end of 1995 and the other two by the end of 1996, or those ships will be prohibited
from engaging in the domestic petroleum trade. If AHL chooses not to double-hull the ships, it will have to depend on
the less consistent grain, vegetable oil, etc. trade for business. 

9. Potomac represents that, in its judgment, there has been no change in market conditions that would permit a sale
of the Plans' interest in the near term, and, more importantly by year end when the exemption pursuant to the PTE 79-15
Order expires. While AHL has returned to profitability (see reps. 10 and 11, below), the twin problems that plagued
prior sales efforts (see rep. 8, above) still remain and make the sale of AHL on a going concern basis, in Potomac's opinion,
a virtual impossibility. The only expressions of interest that Potomac has received since becoming investment manager
in 1992 have consisted of casual inquiries concerning whether AHL would sell one of its vessels at slightly below scrap
value. In addition, the scrapping of AHL's ships is not feasible at the present time due to existing contractual commitments.
Currently, several of AHL's ships are on extended term charter and thus, with the possible exception of a single ship,
AHL could not now scrap its fleet without abrogating its contractual obligations.

10. Potomac represents that while no sale of AHL is currently feasible on favorable terms, AHL has returned to profitability
following the difficulties it experienced over the last half of 1991 and during 1992. Potomac states that these profitable
operations will result in a very significant return to the Plans on their investment over the near term, particularly
when compared to the only viable alternative, a sale of AHL's ships at a price approximating their scrap value. Since
a scrap value sale of the ships remains available after the relatively short period of profitable operations permitted
under OPA 1990, 
Potomac believes that the Plans' retention of their investment is the preferable investment course of action over
the near term, even if OPA 1990's requirements ultimately end the useful life of AHL's ships. 


11. Potomac represents that AHL's Board, subject to Potomac's review as investment manager, has instituted a number
of measures designed to return AHL to profitability. These measures included a change in AHL's key management, the
ability of new management to secure term, as opposed to spot charters, and the installation of more refined and sophisticated
cash management and management information systems. In addition, AHL had significant necessary maintenance performed,
including the successful completion of total drydock on three of AHL's four ships. During the first quarter of 1994,
AHL earned a net profit of $787,284 from operations, and shareholders' equity rose to the highest level in AHL's history.
Potomac represents that it believes that in 1994, AHL will earn between $1.2 million and $1.6 million from operations.
Potomac further represents that the scrap value of the ships will not decline significantly from today's values,
if at all, over the near term. Thus, even if AHL found that OPA 1990's requirements left it with no option other than scrapping
its vessels after 1996, the continued operation of the company, so long as it is profitable, will leave the Plans with
the added value generated by such profitability, plus roughly the same scrap value that they could now realize. In
addition, this investment option allows AHL to continue to study other options and await market developments that
may significantly enhance the value of its assets to a potential buyer and thus significantly enhance the value of
the Plans' investment. 

12. One such potential market development involves the reconstruction of existing single-hulled vessels to meet
the requirements of OPA 1990, which may present a cost-effective alternative to the building of new ships. This alternative
entails attaching new, double-hulled cargo bodies to the engine and crew sections of existing ships. Potomac represents
that discussions it has had with Avondale Industries, Inc. (Avondale), one of the nation's leading shipbuilding
companies, suggest that the cost of rebuilding an existing vessel in this fashion would be approximately 50% of the
cost of a new vessel. This potential cost savings represents an important value potential for AHL's existing ships
that Potomac represents would exceed the ship's scrap value and may be attractive to a possible buyer should a demand
for rebuilt ships, in fact, develop. Potomac has been exploring this option in discussions with Avondale and representatives
of the United States Coast Guard. In addition, preliminary discussions have been held with the Federal Maritime Administration
concerning the potential financing of such a project, by whomever is the owner, with federal loan guarantees. Potomac
emphasizes in exploring this option that it does not intend the Plans either to make any additional investment in AHL
for this purpose, or to guarantee any financing for AHL. In fact, BSFS, in its capacity of named fiduciary for the Plans
with oversight responsibility over Potomac (see rep. 13., below), has made it clear to Potomac that any such investment
by the Plans, either directly or in the form of guarantees, is out of the question. Rather, it is Potomac's goal to advance
this conversion project so as to make AHL and its ships attractive to a potential buyer/investor in the event a market
for reconfigured vessels develops as a cost-effective alternative to new construction. 

13. BSFS represents that its obligations under the Court Order to monitor and report on the activities of the investment
managers for the Special Assets Portfolio sharply restrict Potomac's opportunity to perpetuate unduly the Plans'
continued ownership of AHL. Pursuant to the investment management agreement with Potomac that BSFS negotiated on
behalf of the Plans, Potomac is obligated to supply detailed quarterly reports on each of the Special Assets it manages
and to comply with written investment guidelines. Those guidelines state that Potomac ``shall seek, among other
prudent objectives, to: (A) Maximize the Plans' net, long-term investment return [and] (B) Liquidate each such investment
when and insofar as prudent * * *'' Furthermore, the guidelines require Potomac to prepare and update
on a quarterly basis an ``action plan'' for each asset, including AHL. The action plan requires the investment manager
to state the timetable for achieving a sale (if sale is intended) or for achieving any other stated objective. In short,
BSFS represents that significant mechanisms are in place to prevent Potomac from improperly seeking to continue
indefinitely to manage the Plans' Stock in AHL. BSFS represents that in its capacity as Named Fiduciary, it has reviewed
in depth Potomac's analysis of the various options available and has accepted Potomac's conclusion that the continued
ownership of the Stock is in the best interests of the Plans.

14. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transaction satisfies the criteria contained in section
408(a) of the Act because: (a) the proposed exemption would continue for a limited period of time a transaction permitted
by the PTE 79-15 Order; (b) the Plans' independent investment manager, Potomac, has reviewed the Plans' holding
of the Stock and has determined that it is in the best interest of both Plans to continue holding the Stock; (c) Potomac
will continue to monitor the transaction to determine whether it remains in the Plans' best interests to retain the
Stock; d) BSFS, which has the overall responsibility as Named Fiduciary over the Plans' investment in the Stock, has
reviewed Potomac's findings and agrees with Potomac's determination that the Plans' continued holding of the Stock
is in the best interests of both Plans; and e) the Plans will make no additional investment in AHL, nor will they guarantee
any financing to AHL, for the purpose of double-hulling of the ships.

General Information 



The attention of interested persons is directed to the following: 

(1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest of disqualified person from certain other provisions
of the Act and/or the Code, including any prohibited transaction provisions to which the exemption does not apply
and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act, which among other things require a
fiduciary to discharge his duties respecting the plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries
of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(b) of the act; nor does it affect the requirement
of section 401(a) of the Code that the plan must operate for the exclusive benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining
the plan and their beneficiaries; 

(2) Before an exemption may be granted under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2) of the Code, the Department
must find that the exemption is administratively feasible, in the interests of the plan and of its participants and
beneficiaries and protective of the rights of participants and beneficiaries of the plan; 

(3) The proposed exemptions, if granted, will be supplemental to, and not in derogation of, any other provisions of
the Act and/or the Code, including statutory or administrative exemptions and transitional rules. Furthermore,
the fact that a transaction is subject to an administrative or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the
transaction is in fact a prohibited transaction; and 

(4) The proposed exemptions, if granted, will be subject to the express condition that the material facts and representations
contained in each application are true and complete, and that each application accurately describes all material
terms of the transaction which is the subject of the exemption.

<DOCTITLE>Grant of Individual Exemptions; Raytech Corporation Salaried Employees Savings Plan </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration, Labor. 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Grant of individual exemptions. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document contains exemptions issued by the Department of Labor (the Department) from certain of the prohibited
transaction restrictions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (the Act) and/or the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986 (the Code). 



Notices were published in the 

Federal Register

 of the pendency before the Department of proposals to grant such exemptions. The notices set forth a summary of facts
and representations contained in each application for exemption and referred interested persons to the respective
applications for a complete statement of the facts and representations. The applications have been available for
public inspection at the Department in Washington, DC. The notices also invited interested persons to submit comments
on the requested exemptions to the Department. In addition the notices stated that any interested person might submit
a written request that a public hearing be held (where appropriate). The applicants have represented that they have
complied with the requirements of the notification to interested persons. No public comments and no requests for
a hearing, unless otherwise stated, were received by the Department. 

The notices of proposed exemption were issued and the exemptions are being granted solely by the Department because,
effective December 31, 1978, section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1978 (43 FR 47713, October 17, 1978) transferred
the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to issue exemptions of the type proposed to the Secretary of Labor. 


Statutory Findings 


In accordance with section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2) of the Code and the procedures set forth in 29
CFR Part 2570, Subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August 10, 1990) and based upon the entire record, the Department makes
the following findings: 
(a) The exemptions are administratively feasible; 
(b) They are in the interests of the plans and their participants and beneficiaries; and 
(c) They are protective of the rights of the participants and beneficiaries of the plans.

Savings Plan (the Hourly Plan; together, the Plans); Located in Shelton, Connecticut; [Prohibited Transaction
Exemption 94-75; Exemption Application Nos. D-9722 and D-9723] 



Exemption 



The restrictions of sections 406(a), 406(b)(1) and (b)(2) of the Act and the sanctions resulting from the application
of section 4975 of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1) (A) through (E) of the Code, shall not apply to (1) the extension
of credit by Raytech Corporation (Raytech) to the Plans in the form of payments (the Makeup Payments) with respect
to group annuity contract CG01274B3A (the GIC) issued by Executive Life Insurance Company (ELIC); and (2) the Plans'
potential repayment of the Makeup Payments (the Repayments), provided: (a) all terms of such transactions are no
less favorable to the Plans than those which the Plans could obtain in arm's-length transactions with an unrelated
party; (b) no interest and/or expenses are paid by the Plans; (c) the Makeup Payments are made only in lieu of payments
due from ELIC with respect to the accumulated book value of the GIC at the time of the Makeup Payments; (d) the Repayments
are restricted to the amounts, if any, paid to the Plans after March 27, 1994, by ELIC or other responsible third parties
with respect to the GIC (the GIC Proceeds); (e) the Repayments do not exceed the total amount of the Makeup Payments;
and (f) the Repayments are waived to the extent the Makeup Payments exceed the GIC Proceeds. 


For a more complete statement of the facts and representations supporting the Department's decision to grant this
exemption, refer to the notice of proposed exemption published on July 27, 1994, at 59 FR 38207. 





Notice to Interested Persons: 

The applicant represents that it was unable to comply with the notice to interested persons requirement within the
time frame stated in its application. However, the applicant has represented that it notified all interested persons,
in the manner agreed upon between the applicant and the Department, by September 13, 1994. Interested persons were
notified that they had until October 16, 1994 to comment or request a hearing with respect to the proposed exemption.
No comments or hearing requests were received by the Department.

<USDEPT>NATIONAL ARCHIVES AND RECORDS ADMINISTRATION</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Records Schedules; Availability and Request for Comments</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
agency: 

Office of Records Administration, National Archives and Records Administration.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
action: 

Notice of availability of proposed records schedules; request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) publishes notice at least once monthly of certain Federal
agency requests for records disposition authority (records schedules). Records schedules identify records of
sufficient value to warrant preservation in the National Archives of the United States. Schedules also authorize
agencies after a specified period to dispose of records lacking administrative, legal, research, or other value.
Notice is published for records schedules that (1) propose the destruction of records not previously authorized
for disposal, or (2) reduce the retention period for records already authorized for disposal. NARA invites public
comments on such schedules, as required by 44 USC 3303a(a).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information: 

Each year U.S. Government agencies create billions of records on paper, film, magnetic tape, and other media. In order
to control this accumulation, agency records managers prepare records schedules specifying when the agency no longer
needs the records and what happens to the records after this period. Some schedules are comprehensive and cover all
the records of an agency or one of its major subdivisions. These comprehensive schedules provide for the eventual
transfer to the National Archives of historically valuable records and authorize the disposal of all other records.
Most schedules, however, cover records of only one office or program or a few series of records, and many are updates
of previously approved schedules. Such schedules also may include records that are designated for permanent retention.




Destruction of records requires the approval of the Archivist of the United States. This approval is granted after
a thorough study of the records that takes into account their administrative use by the agency of origin, the rights
of the Government and of private persons directly affected by the Government's activities, and historical or other
value.

This public notice identifies the Federal agencies and their subdivisions requesting disposition authority, includes
the control number assigned to each schedule, and briefly describes the records proposed for disposal. The records
schedule contains additional information about the records and their disposition. Further information about the
disposition process will be furnished to each requester.

<USDEPT>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION</USDEPT>






Options Price Reporting Authority; Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of Amendment to OPRA Fee Schedule
Establishing a One Year Pilot Program Providing an Alternative Means of Charging for Dial-Up Market Data.



October 18, 1994.



Pursuant to Rule 11Aa3-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), notice is hereby given that on
September 6, 1994, the Options Price Reporting Authority (``OPRA'')
 submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') an amendment to the Plan for Reporting
of Consolidated Options Last Sale Reports and Quotation Information (``Plan''), establishing a pilot program providing
an alternative means of charging for dial-up market data. OPRA has designated this proposal as concerned solely with
the administration of the plan permitting it to become effective upon filing pursuant to Rule 11Aa3-2(c)(3)(ii)
under the Act. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments from interested persons on the amendment.





I. Description and Purpose of the Amendment



The purpose of the amendment is to respond to requests from OPRA vendors, who make options information available to
their customers via a PC dial-up service, to establish a usage-based fee as an alternative to the existing port charge.
Currently, vendors interested in offering this service must pay a Dial-Up Data Service Utilization Fee based on the
peak number of ports of a vendor's computer that are simultaneously used to provide the service during the month for
which the charge is assessed. Under the proposed pilot program, a vendor would have the alternative of paying a fee
determined by the total number of inquiries for options quotations and last sale reports received by the service during
the month. The usage-based fee is proposed to be established at the rate of $0.02 for each ``quote packet'' which would
consist of any one or more of the following values: last sale, bid/ask, and related market data for a single series of
options or a related index. All inquiries, except those for historical information (

i.e., 

prior to the current trading day), would be counted for purposes of calculating the fee.


During the pilot period, vendors who have entered into a Dial-Up Market Data Service Rider and Vendor Agreement with
OPRA may elect to pay the usage-based fee by submitting a written election to that effect to OPRA. The form for electing
this option will require vendors to provide OPRA with a description of its systems and procedures used to count the
number of inquiries for options quotations and last sale reports received by the service, and will permit OPRA to inspect
its records and systems pertaining to such count.

OPRA is proposing to introduce the fee initially for a one year pilot period in order to evaluate the usefulness of a
usage-based fee and to measure its impact on OPRA's revenue. The pilot program will continue for one year from the time
that the first dial-up vendor elects to be subject to the usage-based fee proposed herein, unless the pilot program
is extended or made permanent at the end of this period.



II. Solicitation of Comments



Pursuant to Rule 11Aa3-2(c)(3), the amendment is effective upon filing with the Commission. The Commission
may summarily abrogate the amendment within 60 days of its filing and require refiling and approval of the amendment
by Commission order pursuant to Rule 11Aa3-2(c)(2), if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary
or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors and maintenance of fair and orderly markets,
to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanisms of a National Market System, or otherwise in furtherance of the
purposes of the Act.

Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street NW., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, and all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those withheld from the public in accordance
with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's Public Reference
Room. Copies of the filing also will be available at the principal offices of OPRA. All submissions should refer to
File No. S7-8-90 and should be submitted by November 5, 1994.




For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority, 17 CFR 200.30-3(a)(29).

<DOCTITLE>Options Price Reporting Authority; Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of Amendment to the National Market
System Plan of the Options Price Reporting Authority</DOCTITLE>



October 18, 1994.



Pursuant to Rule 11Aa3-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), notice is hereby given that on
September 26, 1994, the Options Price Reporting Authority (``OPRA'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission
(``SEC'' or ``Commission'') an amendment to the Plan for Reporting of Consolidated Options Last Sale Reports and
Quotation Information (``Plan''), extending until January 1, 1996, the pilot program providing for the dissemination
of certain implied volatility quotations on selected foreign currency options (``FCO's'') to vendors outside of
the OPRA system.

OPRA has designated this proposal as concerned solely with the administration of the plan permitting it to become
effective upon filing pursuant to Rule 11Aa3-2(c)(3)(ii) under the Act. The Commission is publishing this
notice to solicit comments from interested persons on the amendment.



I. Description and Purpose of the Amendment



OPRA requests an extension of the pilot program that was the subject of an amendment previously filed on May 14, 1992,
 providing for the dissemination of certain implied volatility quotations in FCO's directly by the Philadelphia
Stock Exchange (``PHLX'') through selected vendors, rather than through the OPRA network. This pilot has been extended
twice, first until September 1, 1993 pursuant to a letter amendment dated March 26, 1993,
 and then until November 1, 1994, pursuant to a letter amendment dated August 12, 1993.







The purpose of the pilot program is to permit PHLX to accommodate those institutional investors in foreign currency
options who desire to receive indications of the current state of the FCO market expressed in implied volatility quotations.
These quotations serve only as indications of the state of the market; actual trading in FCO's continues to be conducted
through bids and offers expressed in terms of the prices at which options may be bought or sold which continue to be disseminated
over the OPRA system. Because the existing specifications of the OPRA system were not designed to accommodate implied
volatility quotations, OPRA has consented to PHLX's arranging for the transmission of this information through
selected vendors.

OPRA plans to extend the pilot once more until January 1, 1996, the date proposed for the unbundling within OPRA of market
information services pertaining to FCO's. Prior to that date, a decision will be made concerning the continued availability
of implied volatility quotations in FCO's.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change by the Pacific
Stock Exchange, Inc., Relating to a Waiver of Certain Fees for Floor Members</DOCTITLE>



October 18, 1994.




Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 notice is hereby given that on September 23, 1994, the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II,
and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing
this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The PSE proposes to waive certain fees for Floor Members set forth in the Schedule of Rates for Exchange Services. The
waiver would be in effect for a three month period.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B) and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



The Exchange is proposing to waive the following monthly fees that are applicable to its Equity and Option Floor Members:
(1) Equity Floor Broker Booth Fees of $125, $250, and $375 for small, large, and area booths, respectively; (2) Equity
Floor Privilege Fees of $165 per registered floor member and registered clerk; (3) approximately 50% of the Systems
Fee of $1,700 per post on the Equity Floor; (4) approximately 61% of the Options Floor Booth Fees of $275, $350, and $450
for retail booths, clearing booths, and stock execution booths, respectively, and approximately 61% of the $300
surcharge for prime location booths; (5) approximately 61% of the Options Market Maker Fees of $660 per month; and
(6) a waiver of 100% of the $0.02 per contract options independent broker fee up to a maximum of $100 per broker per month.
The Exchange proposes that the waiver be in effect for three months.

The purpose of the proposed waivers is to provide the Exchange's Floor Members, who have borne the most significant
burden of fee increases in recent years, with a discount in floor fees in response to increased revenues. The discount
will apply to three months of 1994.

The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and Section
6(b)(4), in particular, in that it provides for the equitable allocation of reasonable charges among its members.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Chicago Stock Exchange, Incorporated; Application for Unlisted Trading Privileges
in Seven Over-the-Counter Issues and to Withdraw Unlisted Privileges in Seven Over-the-Counter Issues</DOCTITLE>


October 19, 1994.


On October 6, 1994, the Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CHX''), submitted an application for unlisted trading privileges
(``UTP'') pursuant to Section 12(f)(1)(C) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') in the following over-the-counter
(``OTC'') securities, 

i.e.,

 securities not registered under Section 12(b) of the Act.






The above-referenced issues are being applied for as replacements for the following securities, which form a portion
of the Exchange's program in which OTC securities are being traded pursuant to the granting of UTP.
The CHX also applied to withdraw UTP pursuant to Section 12(f)(4) of the Act for the following issues:





Replacement issues are being requested due to lack of trading activity.



Comments


Interested persons are invited to submit, on or before November 9, 1994, written comments, data, views and arguments
concerning this application. Persons desiring to make written comments should file three copies with the Secretary,
Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20549.
Commentators are asked to address whether they believe the requested grant of UTP as well as the withdrawal of UTP would
be consistent with Section 12(f)(2), which requires that, in considering an application for extension or withdrawal
of UTP in an OTC security, the Commission consider, among other matters, the public trading activity in such security,
the character of such trading, the impact of such extension on the existing markets for such security, and the desirability
of removing impediments to and the progress that has been made toward the development of a national market system.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc.
Relating to Warrants on the Nikkei Stock Index 300</DOCTITLE>



October 18, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C.  78S(b)(1), notice
is hereby given that on September 2, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in
Items I, II and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing
this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The CBOE proposes to list and trade warrants on the Nikkei Stock Index 300 (``Nikkei 300'' or ``Index''). The text of
the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, CBOE, and at the Commission.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
or and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



1. Purpose



The Exchange is permitted to list and trade index warrants under CBOE Rule 31.5(E). The Exchange is now proposing to
list and trade index warrants based on the Nikkei 300. The listing and trading of index warrants on the Nikkei 300 would
comply in all respects with CBOE Rule 31.5(E). CBOE has received the Commission's approval to list and trade options
on the Nikkei 300.








Index design. 

The Nikkei 300 is a broad-based, capitalization-weighted index designed to be representative of stocks on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange. It was designed by and is maintained by Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Inc. The Index is fully described in SR-CBOE-94-14,
the Exchange's rule filing relating to the listing and trading of options on the Nikkei 300.








Index warrant trading. 

The warrants on the Index would be direct obligations of their issuers and would be cash-settled in U.S. dollars. The
warrants would have either American or European style exercise. Upon exercise, or at the warrant expiration date
in the case of warrants with European style exercise, the holder of a warrant structured as a ``put'' would receive
payment in U.S. dollars to the extent that the index value has declined below a pre-stated cash settlement value. Conversely,
holders of a warrant structured as a ``call'' would, upon exercise or at expiration, receive payment in U.S. dollars
to the extent that the index value has increased above the pre-stated cash settlement value. Warrants that are out-of-the-money
at the time of expiration would expire worthless.



Warrant listing standards and customer safeguards. 

In SR-CBOE-90-08,
 the Exchange established generic listing standards for index warrants, which are contained in CBOE Rule 31.5(E).
The filing also established certain sales practice rules for the trading of index warrants, which are contained in
Chapter IX of the Exchange's Rules. The listing and trading of index warrants on the Nikkei 300 would be subject to those
guidelines and rules.





Under Rule 31.5(E), (i) issuers shall meet the CBOE's size and earnings criteria for equity issues and have assets
in excess of $100,000,000; (ii) the term of the warrants shall be for a period ranging from one to five years from the
date of issuance; and (iii) the minimum public distribution of such issues shall be 1,000,000 warrants, together
with a minimum of 400 public holders, and have an aggregate market value of $4,000,000.

Because index warrants are derivative in nature and closely resemble index options, CBOE would also require safeguards
designed to meet the investor protection concerns raised by the trading of index options. The Exchange would require
that index warrants on the Nikkei 300 be sold only to customers whose accounts have been approved for options trading
under CBOE Rule 9.7.
 CBOE Rule 30.50, Interpretation .02 also applies the suitability standards of CBOE Rule 9.9 to recommendations in
index warrants.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941025-2-00140 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941025-2-00075 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In addition, CBOE Rule 30.50, Interpretation .04 requires that the standards of Rule 9.10(a) regarding discretionary
orders be applied to index warrants. It requires a branch office manager or registered options principal to approve
and initial a discretionary order in index warrants on the day entered. Also, prior to commencement of trading, the
Exchange would distribute a circular to its members calling attention to specific risks associated with warrants
calling attention to specific risks associated with warrants on the Index if the Exchange is required to do so by Commission
policy.



2. Statutory Basis



The listing and trading of warrants on the Nikkei 300 is consistent with Section 6(b) of the ACt in general and furthers
the objectives of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act in particular because it will help remove impediments to a free and open
securities market and facilitate transactions in securities because the Index warrants will provide investors
a means by which to hedge investments in the Japanese equity market and provide a surrogate instrument for trading
in the Japanese securities market.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The proposed rule amendments will not impose any burden on competition.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants
or Others



Comments were neither solicited nor received.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



Within 35 days of the publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such other period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such if it finds such longer period to
be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:

(A) by order approve the proposed rule change, or

(B) institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect at the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of the CBOE. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-CBOE-94-32
and should be submitted by November 15, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Cincinnati Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Granting Approval to Proposed Rule Change
Relating to Exchange Membership Fees</DOCTITLE>



October 19, 1994.



On August 16, 1994, the Cincinnati Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CSE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and
Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change to amend the membership application fees imposed by the Exchange.







The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34654 (September 12, 1994),
59 FR 47964 (September 19, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal. 

The CSE is increasing its membership application fees as follows: 






The increases apply to the initial application fee, as well as the fee to exercise a Chicago Board Options Exchange
(``CBOE'') membership.
 Additionally, intra-firm transfers of individuals assigned to a membership are being raised to reflect the cost
of processing the transfers. The Exchange states that the increase in fees will more accurately reflect the costs
associated with the processing of applications and will make the fees comparable to those charged by other markets.






The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements
of Section 6(b).
 In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the Section 6(b)(4) requirements that the
rules of an exchange provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and other charges among its members,
issuers, and other persons using the Exchange's facilities.
 The Commission believes that the increases in membership application fees are equitable because the Exchange has
proposed the increases to offset rising costs, and the fees do not have a discriminatory or anti-competitive effect.
Accordingly, the Commission believes that it is appropriate to approve the proposed rule change. 





It is therefore ordered, Pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (SR-CSE-94-08) is approved.





For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change by the New
York Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating to Elimination of Monthly Fee Charged for Obtaining Certain Statistical Reports
on Extensions of Time</DOCTITLE>



October 19, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on October 5, 1994, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below,
which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to
solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change




The NYSE is proposing to eliminate the monthly fifteen dollar fee charged margin extension system users for obtaining
certain statistical reports on extensions of time. The fee elimination is effective upon filing with the SEC.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change





In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



1. Purpose




In March 1984, four statistical reports were created as part of the redesign of the Exchange's computerized margin
extension system. The purpose of these reports is to provide member organizations with information to assist them
in controlling and monitoring ``extension of time'' requests. Further, these reports act as a surveillance tool
for member organizations and the Exchange, to ensure compliance with the rules and regulations that govern extension
requests and procedures.

The reports currently are distributed at no charge on a quarterly basis to all member organizations submitting their
``extensions of time'' to the Exchange. Member organizations may request one or more of the reports on a monthly basis,
for a fee of fifteen dollars ($15) for each report requested. This charge was instituted to cover the Exchange's cost
for producing and processing the reports.

The Exchange is eliminating the fifteen dollar fee for these additional statistical reports and will furnish statistical
reports produced through the computerized extension system to member organizations monthly at no charge beginning
with the October 1994 reports.






2. Statutory Basis



The proposed rule change is consistent with the requirement under Section 6(b)(4) of the Act that an exchange have
rules that provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees and other charges among its members and issuers
and other persons using its facilities.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change will impose no burden on competition not necessary or appropriate
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others



The Exchange has not solicited, and does not intend to solicit, comments regarding the proposed rule change. The Exchange
has not received any unsolicited written comments from members or other interested parties.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action 



The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act and subparagraph (e) of
Rule 19b-4 thereunder because it establishes or changes a due, fee, or other charge imposed by the Exchange.
At any time within 60 days of the filing of such proposed rule change, the Commission may summarily abrogate such rule
change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the
protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. 



IV. Solicitation of Comments 



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of the NYSE. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-NYSE-94-36
and should be submitted by November 15, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; New York Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Approving a Proposed Rule Change Relating
to Examination Specifications for the General Securities Registered Representative (Series 7) Examination, and
the Corresponding Content Outline</DOCTITLE>



October 18, 1994.



I. Introduction


On June 30, 1994, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (``Commission'') pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 proposed rule changes (File Nos. SR-NYSE-94-26 and SR-NYSE-94-27) to revise
the General Securities Registered Representative (Series 7) Examination Specifications and the corresponding
Content Outline.






The proposed rule changes were published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 34340 (July 8, 1994),
59 FR 35959 (July 14, 1994); and 34341 (July 8, 1994), 59 FR 35960 (July 14, 1994). No comments were received on the proposals.
This order approves the proposed rule changes contingent upon the filing of the revised Examination Specifications
and Content Outline by other appropriate self-regulatory organizations (``SROs''), and approval of those filings
by the Commission.



II. Description of the Proposal




The NYSE is revising, updating and seeking approval for the Series 7 Examination, Specifications and Content Outline.
The Series 7 Examination was created in 1974 as an industry-wide qualification examination for persons seeking registration
as general securities representatives. The Series 7 Examination is generally required under SRO rules for persons
who are engaged in the solicitation, purchase, or sale of securities for the accounts of customers. The purpose of
the Series 7 Examination is to ensure that registered representatives have the basic knowledge necessary to perform
their functions and responsibilities. The Series 7 Specifications detail the areas covered by the examination and
break down the number of examination questions culled from each area, while the Content Outline details the subject
coverage and question allocation of the examination.


Revision of the Series 7 Examination, Specifications and Content Outline was initiated in April 1993 by an industry
committee of SROs and representatives from broker-dealers in order to update the examination in view of changes in
the securities industry, including changes in relevant rules and regulations, the development of new securities
products, and changes in the job of registered representatives as firms offer an increasingly wide range of financial
services.
 The Examination Specifications and Content Outline for the Series 7 have not been revised since 1986.








The industry committee updated the existing statements of the critical functions of registered representatives
to ensure current relevance and appropriateness and drafted statements of tasks expected to be performed by entry-level
registered representatives and conformed the existing Content Outline to the task statements. The Content Outline
reflects the revised content of the examination. Under the proposed rule change, the total number of questions in
the Series 7 Examination will remain at 250, and the revised examination will cover all financial product areas covered
on the present Series 7 Examination as well as several new products, including collateralized mortgage obligations
(``CMOs''), long term equity anticipation securities (``LEAPS'') and CAPS,
 with reduced emphasis on direct participation programs.




Under the proposed rule change, the NYSE will appoint a committee to review the Series 7 Content Outline and Specifications
periodically to determine any adjustments that may be required. The committee will represent a broad range of expertise,
such as practicing registered representatives, branch managers, compliance officers, training personnel, and
SRO representatives. The review will address any new information that registered representatives need to know,
information currently specified in the examination that should be deleted and any adjustments that need to be made
in the emphasis on various topics.

<PARENT> FR941025-2-00078 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Commission anticipates that the other appropriate SRO participants also will file the revised specifications
for approval by the Commission. The NYSE, and these other SROs, may use the revised Examination, Specifications and
Content Outline after the Commission has approved the proposed rule changes of the other appropriate SRO participants.



III. Discussion



After careful review, the Commission finds that the proposed rule changes are consistent with the requirements of
the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and in particular,
with the requirements of Sections 6(b)(5) and 6(c)(3)(B) of the Act.
 Section 6(b)(5) requires, among other things, that the rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable
principles of trade, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market
system, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. Section 6(c)(3)(B) provides that a national
securities exchange may examine and verify the qualifications of an applicant to become a person associated with
a member in accordance with procedures established by the rules of the exchange, and may require any person associated
with a member, or any class of such persons, to be registered with the exchange in accordance with procedures so established.






The Commission also believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 15(b)(7) of the Act
 which stipulates that prior to effecting any transaction in, or inducing the purchase or sale of any security, a registered
broker or dealer must meet certain standards of operational capability, and that such broker or dealer must meet certain
standards of training, experience, competence, and such other qualifications as the Commission finds necessary
or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.




The Commission believes that revising the Series 7 Examination, Specifications and Content Outline should help
to ensure that only those securities representatives with a comprehensive knowledge of current Exchange rules,
as well as an understanding of the Act, will be able to solicit, purchase or sell securities for the accounts of customers.
The Commission believes that the revised areas covered by the Examination, Specifications and Content Outline are
appropriate subject matters and include a sufficiently broad range of topics to ensure an appropriate level of expertise
by representatives.



Additionally, the revised examination tests relevant subject matters in view of changes in applicable laws, rules,
regulations, products, and industry practices. By ensuring this requisite level of knowledge, the NYSE can remain
confident that securities representatives have demonstrated an acceptable level of securities knowledge to carry
out their responsibilities.


The Commission has determined that the Content Outline for the revised Series 7 Examination is sufficiently detailed
and covers appropriate information so as to provide an adequate basis for studying the new topics covered on the revised
examination. The revised Content Outline should help ensure that those persons taking the revised examination understand
the full range of subject matters included in the examination.

The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder.



IV. Conclusion




It is therefore ordered, 

Pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (File Nos. SR-NYSE-94-26 and SR-NYSE-94-27) are
approved contingent upon the filing of the Examination Specifications and Content Outline by the order appropriate
SROs and the approval of those filings by the Commission.





For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc., Relating
to the Execution of Cross Transactions on the PSE Equities Floors</DOCTITLE>


October 18, 1994.


Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on August 18, 1994, the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which
Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. On October 13, 1994, the Exchange submitted Amendment
No. 1.
 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.




I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


The Exchange is proposing to add a new commentary to its Rule 5.14(b), relating to the execution of cross transactions
on the Equities Floors. The text of the proposed rule change is as follows: 

italicizing

 indicates new language:
Rule 5.14(a)_No change.
Rule 5.14(b)_No change.
Commentary .01_.04_No change.


.05 Agency orders to cross 25,000 shares or more at or within the prevailing quotation will be permitted to
establish precedence without regard to priority of existing bids or offers at that price. Members will be allowed
to better the proposed cross price, but in doing so shall be required to satisfy all other existing bids or offers at
that price. For purposes of this Commentary .05, proprietary orders of members, member organizations, and non-member
broker dealers shall not be considered ``agency.''


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.


A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


1. Purpose


The PSE is proposing to amend its rules regarding the execution of stock cross transactions (i.e.,

 Rules 5.14(a) and 5.14(b)) by adding a new commentary to Rule 5.14(b). Proposed Commentary .05 will govern large agency
crosses.


Proposed Commentary .05.

 Proposed Commentary .05 is designed to permit the execution of ``clean'' agency crosses of 25,000 shares or more at
or within the prevailing quotation without regard to the priority of existing bids or offers.
As with the Rule 72(b) of the New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE'') and the Rule 126(g), Commentary .02, of the American
Stock Exchange (``Amex''), this proposal to allow ``clean'' crosses is designed to facilitate the execution of agency
cross transaction at the PSE. Although the proposal would allow such cross transactions to be executed without regard
to priority of existing bids or offers, it will still specifically allow members an opportunity to better the price
of the cross transaction.
The PSE has also written this new rule with a specific limitation that it be allowed only for ``agency'' order, 

i.e.

 non-proprietary orders of members, member organizations and non-member broker/dealers. This approach to agency
orders is consistent with that taken by the Amex and NYSE. It is designed to provide an environment for the facilitation
of true agency crosses without giving an unfair advantage to the proprietary orders of members, member organizations
or non-member broker/dealers over other orders being held in the specialist books.


2. Statutory Basis 


The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and Section
6(b)(5), in particular, in that it is designed to facilitate transactions in securities, to promote just and equitable
principles of trade, and to protect investors and the public interest.


B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition that is not necessary
or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants

Written comments on the proposed rule change were neither solicited nor received. 



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action 



Within 35 days of the publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such longer period (i) As the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will: 

(A) By order approve the proposed rule change, or 

(B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved. 



IV. Solicitation of Comments 



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street NW., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available

<DOCTITLE>Norwest Bank Minnesota, N.A., et al.; Notice of Application</DOCTITLE>


October 19, 1994.


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'').


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Application for an Order under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``Act'').





APPLICANTS: 

Norwest Bank Minnesota, N.A. (``Bank''); Norwest Funds; Forum Financial Services, Inc. (``Forum''); Core Trust
(Delaware) (``Core Trust''); and Schroder Capital Management International, Inc. (``Schroder'').



RELEVANT ACT SECTIONS: 

Order requested under sections 6(c) and 17(b) of the Act that would grant an exemption from sections 12(d)(1), 17(a)(1),
and 17(a)(2) of the Act, and under section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 thereunder to permit certain transactions.


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: 

Applicants request an order to permit certain series of the Norwest Funds to invest portions of their assets in certain
portfolios of Core Trust.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.


Applicants' Representations


1. The Bank is the sponsor of a number of collective investment funds (``CIFs'') that serve as investment vehicles
for qualified and non-qualified employee benefit plans for which the Bank serves as trustee, investment manager,
or custodian. The Bank intends to convert fourteen of the CIFs into corresponding new series of the Norwest Funds,
an open-end series investment company.
 The new series, together with the new Advantage Class of an existing money market fund, will be known as the Advantage
Funds. The Bank will serve as investment adviser to the Advantage Funds, and Schroder will serve as subadviser to those
portions of the Advantage Funds that invest in international securities. The Advantage Funds will be offered without
a sales load or redemption fee and will not bear distribution expenses pursuant to a plan adopted under rule 12b-1
under the Act, although applicants may revise these arrangements in the future.




2. Core Trust is an open-end series investment company. Although Core Trust will register under the Act, it does not
intend to make a public offering of its securities and does not intend to register its shares under the Securities Act
of 1933. Core Trust includes a portfolio that intends to invest in securities issued by small companies (``Small Company
Portfolio''), a portfolio that intends to invest in securities of foreign issuers (``International Portfolio''),
and a portfolio that will be designed to replicate the performance of the Standard & Poor's 500 Composite Index
(``Index Portfolio'') (such three series are the ``Portfolios''). The Bank is the investment adviser to the Small
Company and S&P 500 Index Portfolios of Core Trust, and Schroder is the investment adviser to the International
Portfolio. The Portfolios will be offered only to certain Advantage Funds and eligible Future Funds (as hereinafter
defined) relying on an order issued pursuant to the application. Shares of these Portfolios will be offered without
a sales load or redemption fee, and Core Trust will not bear distribution expenses pursuant to a plan adopted under
rule 12b-1 under the Act.

3. Forum provides management, administrative, and distribution related services to Norwest Funds and will provide
similar services to the Advantage Funds and Core Trust.

4. The fifteen Advantage Funds will consist of seven equity funds (Diversified Equity Fund, Growth Equity Fund, Large
Company Growth Fund, Small Company Growth Fund, Income Equity Fund, Index Fund, and International Fund); three balanced
funds (Conservative Balanced Fund, Moderate Balanced Fund, and Growth Balanced Fund), and five fixed income funds
(Intermediate U.S. Government Fund, Managed Fixed Income Fund, Stable Income Fund, Short Maturity Investment Fund,
and Ready Cash Investment Fund).

5. Five of the Advantage Funds_Diversified Equity Fund, Growth Equity Fund, Conservative Balanced Fund, Moderate
Balanced Fund, and Growth Balanced Fund (the ``Blended Funds'')_will continue their predecessor CIFs' practice
of allocating specified percentages of their assets among several different investment styles. The Diversified
Equity Fund and the Growth Equity Fund (the ``Blended Equity Funds'') seek to achieve long term capital appreciation
by investing in equity securities. Consistent with their investment objectives, the Blended Equity Funds allocate
a fixed percentage of their assets to several investment styles. Each Blended Equity Fund allocates a significant
portion of its assets to investments in large, high quality domestic companies that, in the view of its adviser, have
superior growth potential as well as, in the case of the Diversified Equity fund, equities that may provide above average
dividend income. In addition, each Blended Equity Fund allocates a portion of its assets to investment in equity securities
of small companies and a portion to investment in non-U.S. issuers. The Diversified Equity Fund also invests in a group
of securities representing 96% or more of the capitalization-weighted market value of the stocks in the S&P 500
Index. The Conservative Balanced Fund, the Moderate Balanced Fund, and the Growth Balanced Fund (collectively,
``Blended Balanced Funds'') invest in a balanced portfolio of fixed income and equity securities. Like the Blended
Equity Funds, the Blended Balanced Funds allocate portions of their assets among different investment styles.

6. To an extent consistent with its investment objectives, each Blended Fund will invest directly in equity securities
and, in the case of the Blended Balanced Funds, fixed income securities. Applicants believe that investors in the
Blended Funds can obtain substantial benefits, however, if the Blended Funds pool the assets they allocate for investment
in the securities of small companies, non-U.S. issuers, and companies listed in the S&P 500 Index. Accordingly,
applicants propose that the Blended Funds invest those portions of their portfolios in the Small Company, International,
and Index Portfolios of Core Trust. Although at present only the Blended Funds intend to rely on the order, applicants
also propose that any other series of Norwest Funds for which the Bank or any company controlling, controlled by, or
under common control with the Bank acts as adviser, or any open-end investment company for which the Bank or any company
controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Bank acts as adviser in the future (collectively the
``Future Funds''), be permitted to invest in the Small Company, International, and Index Portfolios of Core Trust
in the same manner as the Blended Funds.

7. Each existing CIF will convert into a corresponding series of the Advantage Funds by transferring the securities
and cash in its portfolio to the corresponding Advantage Fund in exchange for shares of the Advantage Fund. Each CIF
will then distribute shares of the Advantage Funds to each employee benefit plan 

pro rata

 according to its interest in the terminating CIF. When the Portfolios commence operations, each Blended Fund will
contribute the small company, international, and S&P 500 Index securities in its portfolio to the corresponding
Portfolio in exchange for shares of that Portfolio.

8. All portfolio securities contributed in-kind will be appropriate investments for the Portfolios. Such in-kind
transactions will comply with the provisions of paragraphs (a) through (f) of rule 17a-7, except that the consideration
for the securities contributed to Core Trust will be Core Trust shares rather than cash. After the initial contribution
of securities, the Portfolios will buy and sell portfolio securities at the discretion of their respective portfolio
managers.

<TEXT>
 

9. Each Blended Fund will treat its investment in each Portfolio of Core Trust as subject to the requirements of Guide
3 of the Guidelines for the Preparation and Filing of Form N-1A so that the level of disclosure in the prospectus
will be governed by the level of its investment in the portfolio of Core Trust. Thus, a Blended Fund that maintains an
investment in a Portfolio in an amount of less than 5% of its net assets will include a brief description of the Portfolio,
whereas a Blended Fund that invests 5% or more of its net assets in a Portfolio will include a more detailed description
of the Portfolio and its objectives, risks, and manner of operation. In addition, each Blended Fund will list the securities
held by the Portfolios in which it invests and the amount and value of its 

pro rata

 interest in each such security in its reports to shareholders under section 30(d) of the Act and rule 30d-1 thereunder
to the same extent as if the Blended Fund held the securities directly.

10. The Blended Funds may invest directly in some securities also held by the three Portfolios. Applicants believe
that it is unlikely that any Blended Fund will incur unnecessary brokerage costs because it sells a security at the
same time a Portfolio buys the same security, or vice versa. First, the actual overlap between the various portfolios
is very small. Moreover, all portfolios of the Blended Funds and the Portfolios are expected to have very low turnover
ratios, making the possibility of opposing buy/sell orders even less likely. In addition, the Blended Funds and the
Index and Small Company Portfolios will all be managed by the Bank, which will monitor for offsetting buy/sell orders.
Although the Bank and Schroder do not share portfolio information in advance, applicants believe that because Norwest
and Schroder employ substantially different criteria for their investment decisions, they would rarely engage
in transactions in the same security on the same day. Indeed, the historical experience of the CIFs indicates the possibility
is remote that two portfolios managers might enter buy and sell orders for the same security at the same time. A review
of the portfolios of the component CIFs from January 1, 1994 to May 31, 1994 reveals only one occasion on which one portfolio
sold a security on the same day another purchased the same security. The brokerage costs associated with this transaction
were $142.00.



Applicants' Legal Analysis



1. Section 12(d)(1)(A) of the Act provides that no registered investment company may acquire securities of another
investment company representing more than 3% of the acquired company's outstanding voting stock, more than 5% of
the acquiring company's total assets, or, together with the securities of other investment companies, more than
10% of the acquiring company's total assets. Section 12(d)(1)(B) provides that no registered open-end investment
company may sell its securities to another investment company if the sale will cause the acquiring company to own more
than 3% of the acquired company's voting stock, or if the sale will cause more than 10% of the acquired company's voting
stock to be owned by investment companies. Section 6(c) provides that the SEC may exempt persons or transactions from
any or all sections of the Act when necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection
of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act.

2. Applicants request an exemption under section 6(c) of the Act from section 12(d)(1) to the extent necessary to permit
the Blended Funds' proposed investments in the Portfolios. Applicants believe that the proposed investment structure
will not be subject to any of the abuses that section 12(d)(1) was intended to prevent. There is no risk that management
of the Blended Funds will exercise inappropriate control over the management of Core Trust because (a) the Bank will
be the investment adviser for all Blended Funds, as well as any Blended Funds, that may invest in the Small Company,
International, or Index Portfolios of Core Trust; and (b) the Blended Funds and Future Funds will be the only investors
in the Portfolios.

3. If large-scale redemptions by public shareholders require a major change in the level of investment by a Blended
Fund in the Portfolios such that the Portfolios might be required to liquidate securities in their portfolios in such
a manner that the shareholders in other non-redeeming Blended Funds would be prejudiced, the Portfolios may make
the redemptions in-kind by distributing securities in its portfolios, rather than cash, to the redeeming Blended
Fund. Such in-kind transactions would comply with the provisions of paragraphs (a) through (f) of rule 17a-7,
except that the consideration for the portfolio securities would be shares in the Portfolio rather than cash.

4. Applicants believe that the Blended Funds' investment in Core Trust will not result in significant duplication
of the costs of distribution, portfolio management, fund administration, or operations. Core Trust shares will
not be subject to any sales load or rule 12b-1 fees. The Bank will waive its advisory fee for serving as investment
adviser to the Small Company and Index Portfolios of Core Trust and will reimburse the International Portfolio of
Core Trust an amount equal to the advisory fees the Portfolio pays to Schroder, and Forum will not receive any fees for
administering that portion of any Blended Fund that invests in Core Trust. Although there will be some duplication
of custodial, transfer agency, and other expenses, applicants believe that the layering of these expenses will be
minimal, and that the efficiencies that the Blended Funds should achieve in portfolio management and fund operations
will result in net cost savings.

5. To a limited extent, the Blended Funds may invest directly in some securities also held by the Portfolios.

Applicants believe it is unlikely that any Blended Fund will incur unnecessary brokerage costs because it sells a
security at the same time a Portfolio buys the same security, or vice versa. The actual overlay between the various
portfolios is very small. Moreover, all portfolios of the Blended Funds and Core Trust are expected to have very low
turnover ratios, making the possibility of opposing buy/sell orders even less likely. In addition, the Blended Funds
and the Index and Small Company Portfolios of Core Trust will all be managed by the Bank, which will monitor for offsetting
buy/sell orders.

6. Applicants also request an exemption under sections 6(c) and 17(b) of the Act from section 17(a) of the Act, which
prohibits certain purchases and sales of securities between investment companies and their affiliated persons.
Because the Blended Funds may individually own more than 5% of individual Portfolios and also may be deemed to be under
common control with Core Trust, the Blended Funds and Core Trust may be deemed to be affiliated persons of one another.
Purchases by the Blended Funds of shares of Core Trust or sales by Core Trust of their shares to the Blended Funds could
be deemed to be principal transactions by affiliated persons under section 17(a). Similarly, the i
