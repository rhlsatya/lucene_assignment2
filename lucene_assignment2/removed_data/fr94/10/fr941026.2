<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are advising the public that the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has prepared two environmental assessments
and findings of no significant impact for the shipment of unlicensed veterinary biological products for field testing.
Risk analyses, which form the bases for the environmental assessments, have led us to conclude that shipment of the
unlicensed veterinary biological products for field testing will not have a significant impact on the quality of
the human environment. Based on our findings of no significant impact, we have determined that environmental impact
statements need not be prepared.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A veterinary biological product regulated under the Virus-Serum Toxin Act (21 U.S.C. 151 

et seq.

) must be shown to be pure, safe, potent, and efficacious before a veterinary biological product license may be issued.
A field test is generally necessary to satisfy prelicensing requirements for veterinary biological products. In
order to ship an unlicensed product for the purpose of conducting a proposed field test, a person must receive authorization
from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). 


In determining whether to authorize shipment for field testing of the unlicensed veterinary biological products
referenced in this notice, APHIS conducted risk analyses to assess the products' potential effects on the safety
of animals, public health, and the environment. Based on those risk analyses, APHIS has prepared environmental assessments.
APHIS has concluded that shipment of the unlicensed veterinary biological products for field testing will not significantly
affect the quality of the human environment. Based on these findings of no significant impact, we have determined
that there is no need to prepare environmental impact statements.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The NOAA Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management (OCRM) announces its intent to evaluate the performance
of the New Jersey Coastal Management Program, and the Padilla Bay (Washington) and Waquoit Bay (Massachusetts) National
Estuarine Research Reserves. 



These evaluations will be conducted pursuant to section 312 and section 315 of the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972
(CZMA), as amended. The CZMA requires a continuing review of the performance of Coastal Management Programs (CMPs)
and National Estuarine Research Reserves (NERRs). Evaluation of CMPs requires findings concerning the extent to
which a State has met the national coastal management objectives, adhered to its Coastal Management Program approved
by the Secretary of Commerce, and adhered to the terms of financial assistance awards funded under the CZMA. Evaluation
of NERRs requires findings concerning the operation and management of the reserve including education and interpretive
activities, the consistency of research activities with the approved research guidelines, and the existence of
a basis for the continued support of the findings for designation. The evaluations will include a site visit, consideration
of public comments, and consultations with interested Federal, State, and local agencies and members of the public.
Public meetings are held as part of the site visits. 

Notice is hereby given of the dates of the site visits for the listed evaluations, and the dates, local times, and locations
of public meetings during the site visits. 

The New Jersey Coastal Management Program evaluation site visit will be from December 5 to December 9, 1994. A public
meeting will be held on Monday, December 6, 1994 at 7:00 p.m., at the New Jersey DEP Headquarters Public Hearing Room,
1510 Hooper Avenue, Room 140, Trenton, New Jersey 08625. 

The Waquoit Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve site visit will be from December 5 to December 9, 1994. A public
meeting will be held on Wednesday, December 7, 1994 at 7:30 p.m., at the Reserve Headquarters (the former Sergeant
Estate), 149 Waquoit Highway, Waquoit, Massachusetts 02536. 

The Padilla Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve site visit will be from December 5, to December 9, 1994. A public
meeting will be held on Wednesday, December 7, 1994 at 7:00 p.m., at the Breazeale-Padilla Interpretive Center, 1043
Bayview-Edison Road, Mt. Vernon, Washington 98273. 

Each State will issue notice of the public meeting(s) in a local newspaper(s) at least 45 days prior to the public meeting(s),
and will issue other timely notices as appropriate. 

Copies of the States' most recent performance reports, as well as OCRM's notifications and supplemental request
letters to the States, are available upon request from OCRM. Written comments from interested parties regarding
these Programs are encouraged and will be accepted until 15 days after the site visit. Please direct written comments
to Vickie A. Allin, Chief, Policy Coordination Division, Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management, NOS/NOAA,

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of receipt of application for a scientific research permit (P430A).





Notice is hereby given that Thomas F. Savoy and Deborah J. Shake of the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection
have applied in due form to take listed shortnose sturgeon (

Acipenser

 

brevirostrum

) as authorized by the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) (16 U.S.C. 1531-1543) and the NMFS regulations governing
listed fish and wildlife permits (50 CFR parts 217-227).
The applicant requests a 5-year permit to take 800 shortnose sturgeon from the Connecticut River to be measured, weighed,
sexed, examined, and tagged. The applicant wishes to determine current numbers, locations, and movement patterns
of shortnose sturgeon within the Connecticut River.
Written data or views, or requests for a public hearing on this application should be submitted to the Director, Office
of Protected Resources, NMFS, 1335 East-West Hwy., Silver Spring, MD 20910-3226, within 30 days of the publication
of this notice. Those individuals requesting a hearing should set out the specific reasons why a hearing on this particular
application would be appropriate. The holding of such hearing is at the discretion of the Assistant Administrator
for Fisheries, NOAA. All statements and opinions contained in this application summary are those of the Applicant
and do not necessarily reflect the views of NMFS.
Documents submitted in connection with the above application are available for review by interested persons in the
following offices by appointment:
Office of Protected Resources, NMFS, 1315 East-West Hwy., Room 13229, Silver Spring, MD 20910-3226 (301-713-2322);

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Receipt of an Application for a Modification to Scientific Research Permit 818 (P211C).





Notice is hereby given that the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) has applied in due form for a modification
to Permit 818 (P211C) requesting an increase in the take of listed species as authorized by the Endangered Species
Act of 1973 (ESA) (16 U.S.C. 1531-1543) and the NMFS regulations governing listed fish and wildlife permits (50 CFR
parts 217-227).
ODFW requests authorization for an increase in the take of juvenile, endangered, Snake River spring/summer chinook
salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) because of their plans to expand their research sampling at Catherine Creek as
a part of their life history, smolt migration, and habitat studies in the upper Grande Ronde and Imnaha River basins.
In addition, an unexpectedly high production of juveniles in 1994, partially attributed to recent progeny production
from listed Rapid River Hatchery adults passed above the hatchery to spawn, is resulting in greater capture numbers
and associated indirect mortality. The juvenile salmon's larger than expected escapement in the spring of 1995 will
allow ODFW to increase the sample size for their scientific research. A larger number of juveniles would be captured,
handled, and receive passive integrated transponder tags for the modification and the increased take would be authorized
for 1994 and 1995 only.
Written data or views, or requests for a public hearing on this application should be submitted to the Director, Office
of Protected Resources, NMFS, 1335 East-West Hwy., Silver Spring, MD 20910-3226, within 30 days of the publication
of this notice. Those individuals requesting a hearing should set out the specific reasons why a hearing on this particular

ACTION:

 Notice of Record of Decision.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Bonneville Power Administration has issued a 
Record of Decision (ROD) to purchase electrical power from the 
proposed Newberry Geothermal Pilot Project (Newberry Project), to 
provide billing credits
 to Eugene Water & Electric Board 
(EWEB), and to provide wheeling services to EWEB for the 
transmission of this power to their system. BPA has decided to 
acquire 20 average megawatts (aMW) of electrical power from a 
privately-owned geothermal power plant on the west flank of 
Newberry Volcano in Deschutes County, Oregon. The Newberry 
Project will generate 30 aMW and will be developed, owned, and 
operated by CE Newberry, Inc. of Portland, Oregon. In addition, 
BPA has decided to grant billing credits to EWEB for 10 aMW of 
electrical power and to provide wheeling services to EWEB for the 
transmission of this power to their system. BPA expects the 
Newberry Project to be in commercial operation by November 1997. 





BPA has statutory responsibilities to supply electrical power to 
its utility, industrial and other customers in the Pacific 
Northwest. The Newberry Project will be used to meet the 
electrical power supply obligations of these customers. The 
Newberry Project will also demonstrate the availability of 
geothermal power to meet power supply needs in the Pacific 
Northwest and is expected to be the first commercial geothermal 
plant in the region

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Purpose and Background 



The Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) is a self-financing 
Federal power marketing agency with statutory responsibility to 
supply electricity to utility, industrial, and other customers in 
the Pacific Northwest. The Pacific Northwest Electric Power 
Planning and Conservation Act (Northwest Power Act) requires BPA 
to meet its customers' electric power requirements. 
16 U.S.C. 839d(a)(2). As part of its mission, BPA is 
responsible for acquiring conservation and additional generation 
resources sufficient to meet the future needs of its utility 
customers. Section 6(d) of the Northwest Power Act authorizes 
BPA to acquire experimental, developmental, demonstration, or 
pilot projects of a type with potential for providing cost- 
effective service to the region. 16 U.S.C. 839d(d). 

The Pacific Northwest Electric Power and Conservation Planning 
Council (Council), in its 1986 Power Plan, noted that 
``* * * approximately 4,400 megawatts of cost-effective electrical 
energy could be obtained through the development of regional 
geothermal resource areas.'' However, because the resource had 
not been confirmed, it was not included in the portfolio of the 
1986 Plan. The Power Plan called for methods of confirming this 
resource so that it would be available when needed. Newberry 
Volcano, Oregon, was identified as one of the most promising 
sites. 

The Newberry Project was selected under the BPA Geothermal Pilot 
Project Program. The goal of the Program is to initiate 
development of the Pacific Northwest's large, but essentially 
untapped, geothermal resources, and to confirm the availability 
of this resource to meet the energy needs of the region. The 
primary underlying objective of this Program is to assure the 
supply of alternative sources of electrical power to help meet 
growing regional power demands and needs. 


BPA's purposes for this action are to: 

(1) Meet contractual obligations to supply requested, cost-effective power to BPA customers, having considered
potential environmental impacts and 
mitigation measures in its decision; 

(2) Assure consistency with BPA's statutory responsibilities, including the Pacific Northwest Electric Power
Planning and Conservation Act (Northwest Power Act), while taking into consideration the Pacific Northwest 
Electric Power and Conservation Planning Council's (Council) 
Conservation and Electric Power Plan (Power Plan) and Fish and 
Wildlife Program; and 


(3) Test the availability of geothermal energy to provide a reliable, economical, and environmentally acceptable
alternative energy source to help meet the region's power needs. 

To make these decisions, BPA cooperated on and adopted the 
Newberry Geothermal Pilot Project Final Environmental Impact 
Statement (FEIS) (DOE/EIS_0207, June 1994). The FEIS was 
tiered to the Resource Programs Environmental Impact Statement 
(RPEIS-DOE/EIS-0162), which considered the environmental 
tradeoffs among the resource types available to meet BPA's needs. 

The FEIS evaluated the exploration, development, utilization, and 
decommissioning phases of the Newberry Project as well as related 
transmission, wheeling, and billing credit components. 
Alternative A is the CEC/EWEB proposal, and Alternative B is the 
three Federal agencies' modification of the proposal. In 
addition to identifying and analyzing the environmental impacts 
of these two alternatives for the Newberry Project, the FEIS also 
evaluated the No Action alternative. By contract, the Newberry 
Project is required to meet all Federal, state, and local 
requirements. The FEIS fulfills the requirements of the National 
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and meets the needs of the U.S. 
Forest Service (USFS) and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), 
who have documented their decisions in a separate, joint ROD. 
BPA has also determined that this action is consistent with the 
Council's 1991 Power Plan. 

Based on the information analyzed and disclosed in the FEIS and 
associated documents, including the USFS/BLM ROD, BPA has 
determined that the preferred alternative is Alternative B with 
the conditions and mitigation and monitoring elements described 
in the USFS/BLM ROD. A Mitigation Action Plan (MAP) developed 
from the FEIS analysis is available. It requires implementation 
of the specific mitigation requirements described in the FEIS and 
USFS/BLM ROD.

BPA develops and publishes a biennial integrated least cost plan, 
the Resource Program. In its Draft 1990 Resource Program, BPA 
said it would be willing to participate in up to three geothermal 
pilot projects. The purpose of these projects would be to 
initiate development, confirm resources, and determine the 
ability to develop three of the largest, most promising sites in 
the region. BPA agreed to purchase_in joint ventures with 
regional utilities_up to 10 average megawatts (aMW) from each 
of three projects. After receiving comments from customers 
supporting the projects, and after the Council approved this 
approach in its 1991 Power Plan, BPA published a solicitation 
that resulted in seven proposals. 

The objectives of BPA's solicitation were to: 

(1) Meet contractual obligations to supply requested, cost-effective power 
to BPA customers, having considered potential environmental impacts and mitigation measures in its decision; 

(2) Assure consistency with BPA's statutory responsibilities, including the Northwest Power Act, while taking
into consideration the Council's Power Plan and Fish and Wildlife Program; and 

(3) Test the availability of geothermal energy to provide a reliable, 
economical, and environmentally acceptable alternative energy 
source to help meet the region's power needs. Three projects 
were selected for contract negotiations on December 17, 1991. 
One of the selected projects was a proposal by the California 
Energy Company (CEC) and the Eugene Water & Electric Board (EWEB) 
to develop a 30-aMW geothermal power plant and supporting 
facilities at Newberry Volcano, Oregon. 


This Administrative Record of Decision sets out the reasons for 
BPA's decision to execute a Power Purchase Agreement with CE 
Newberry, Inc. (a subsidiary of CEC), through which BPA will 
purchase electrical output from the proposed Newberry Project; to 
execute a Billing Credits Generation Agreement with EWEB for a 
portion of the output from the Newberry Project; and to provide 
wheeling services to EWEB for the transmission of this 
electricity to their system. 



Legal Authority 



BPA is a self-financing power marketing agency with the United 
States Department of Energy. BPA was established by the 
Bonneville Project Act of 1937, 16 U.S.C. 832 

et seq., 

to 
market wholesale power from the Bonneville Dam and to construct 
power lines for the transmission of this power to load centers in 
the Northwest. As other Federal dams and transmission lines were 
built, the combined power and transmission facilities have been 
integrated into a single power supply system. Today, BPA markets 
power from 30 Federal hydroelectric projects and two nuclear 
plants. BPA's transmission systems contain 14,797 circuit miles 
and provide about half of the region's power and three-fourths of 
its transmission capacity. 

BPA sells wholesale electric power to 126 utilities, 13 direct 
service industrial customers (DSIs), and several government 
agencies. BPA's primary marketing area is the Pacific Northwest 
region, comprised of the states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, 
that portion of Montana lying west of the continental divide, and 
small portions of California, Utah, Wyoming, and Nevada. 
16 U.S.C. 837 and 839a(14). BPA also has congressional 
authorization to sell or exchange wholesale power outside the 
Pacific Northwest to the extent that such power is surplus to 
the needs of the region. 

See 

16 U.S.C. 837a. 

The Northwest Power Act directs BPA to serve the net power 
requirements of any Pacific Northwest electric utility requesting 
service, and to serve existing DSIs in the Pacific Northwest. 
16 U.S.C. 839c(b)(1) and (d). Although BPA cannot own or 
construct electric generating facilities, the Northwest Power Act 
permits BPA to acquire rights to the output or capability of 
electric power resources. 

See 

16 U.S.C. 839a(1) and 
16 U.S.C. 839d. BPA may acquire a major resource (a resource 
having a planned capability greater than 50 aMW and acquired for 
more than 5 years, 16 U.S.C. 839a(12)) if it is consistent with 
the Council's Power Plan. 16 U.S.C. 839d(c)(1)(D). If the 
resource is not major, the Northwest Power Act instructs that the 
resource must be consistent with the priorities required of the 
Plan. 16 U.S.C. 839d(b)(1) and (2). 


The Northwest Power Act authorizes BPA to acquire experimental, 
developmental, demonstration, or pilot projects of a type with 
potential for providing cost-effective service to the region. 
16 U.S.C. 839d(d). 

BPA is also directed by the Northwest Power Act to grant billing 
credits to a customer, if requested. 16 U.S.C. 839d(h). A 
billing credit agreement is a contract between BPA and a 
customer, under which BPA gives the customer a credit on its 
power bill for the difference between BPA's wholesale power rate 
and the cost of power from a new resource. The energy and 
capacity on which the credit is based is the net amount the 
resource reduces the customer's load on BPA. 

Finally, BPA must satisfy all requirements of the National 
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). 42 U.S.C. 4321 

et seq. 




Description of Need 



BPA load forecasts for the 1990 Resource Program showed that if 
the medium load growth rate occurs, BPA must acquire 500 aMW by 
the year 2000 to meet customers' needs. Pacific Northwest Loads 
and Resources Study, 1990. If utility and DSI loads grow at the 
medium-high rate, BPA will need to acquire an additional 1,500 
aMW by the year 2000. The analysis in BPA's Resource Programs 
Environmental Impact Statement (RPEIS) showed that geothermal is 
a reliable source of electric power that can help meet energy 
needs in the Pacific Northwest. Final Environmental Impact 
Statement: Resource Programs, 1993. 



1990 Resource Program 



BPA's 1990 Resource Program, issued July 1990, defined the 
actions BPA would take to develop new resources to meet the power 
requirements of its customers. The 1990 Resource Program focused 
on Fiscal Years 1992 and 1993, and included near-term actions to 
prepare for these years. One of these actions was an offer to 
participate in geothermal pilot projects aimed at confirming 
resources and determining developability at three of the largest, 
most promising sites in the Pacific Northwest. 

The 1990 Resource Program was developed through an extensive 
public process that included a technical review panel. Many of 
the comments received supported BPA's participation in geothermal 
pilot projects. 



Council Plan 



The Council's 1991 Power Plan noted that the geothermal 
confirmation program in BPA's 1990 Resource Program was 
consistent with the recommendations of the Council's Research, 
Development, and Demonstration Advisory Committee. The Council's 
``Recommended Activities for Implementing the 1991 Power Plan'' 
included geothermal demonstration projects initiated by BPA and 
the region's utilities. The Council acknowledged that energy 
costs of a demonstration plant would likely be higher than the 
marginal cost of other new resources, but the premium would 
decline over time. 



Pilot Project Solicitation 



Request for Proposals 



BPA published a Request for Proposals (RFP) in Commerce Business 
Daily on July 5, 1991. The RFP stated that BPA would be willing 
to purchase up to 10 aMW of electric power from each of three 
projects located in or near the BPA service area. Other 
conditions specified in the RFP were: 

 BPA would not finance projects but only purchase output 
 Part of the output from each project had to be 
purchased by another utility 
 Overall project size could be greater than 10 aMW 
 The proposed site had to be capable of supporting at 
least 100 MW 
 The proposed site had to be suitable for operation as a 
Federal geothermal unit 
 The resource area had to be undeveloped for electric 
power production 
 The power contract had to include an option for BPA to 
purchase subsequent output from the site 
 Projects that would allow BPA to be a cooperating 
agency in a BLM environmental process were strongly 
preferred 

These conditions were intended in part to limit the number of 
proposals likely to be submitted. BPA could devote only a small 
amount of staff time to evaluating proposals, and therefore tried 
to be quite specific about what it wanted. 

Project sponsors were encouraged to submit project outlines or 
summaries ahead of time before developing detailed proposals. 
This was intended to prevent developers from spending money 
developing proposals that would not meet program goals. Several 
developers met with program staff or discussed the RFP on an 
informal basis before submitting proposals. Letters of intent 
were due September 3, 1991, and proposals were due October 1, 
1991.

Further information on BPA's Geothermal Pilot Project Program was 
published prior to the solicitation in an article in a geothermal 
industry trade journal, the Geothermal Resources Council BULLETIN 
(December 1990). The article specified that the projects had to 
be in three different resource areas, preferably involving 
different resource developers. This article was provided to 
developers and others who inquired about the RFP or the 
Geothermal Pilot Project Program. 


Proposals Received 


Seven proposals were received. Two of them clearly did not meet 
program objectives, and a third was withdrawn by the sponsor 
during the evaluation period. 
One of the projects not meeting program objectives was located in 
Canada. Although projects located outside the United States were 
not excluded in the RFP, a foreign project would not have met the 
program goal of testing ability to overcome (U.S.) institutional 
barriers to development. Furthermore, a Canadian project would 
not be subject to a Bureau of Land Management (BLM) environmental 
process. 
A project was proposed at Raft River, Idaho, employing a power 
cycle (the ``Kalina'' cycle) considered to be precommercial. 
Testing new power plant technologies was not a goal of the 
program, and previously developed sites were specifically 
excluded by the RFP. In the early 1980s, Raft River was the site 
of a demonstration plant developed by the U.S. Department of 
Energy. Sponsors of the Canadian and Raft River projects were 
notified on October 30, 1991, that their proposals had been 
eliminated from consideration. 
Four proposals received detailed evaluation. They were: 
 A proposal by the California Energy Company (CEC) and 
the Eugene Water & Electric Board (EWEB) for a 30-MW 
project at Newberry Volcano, Oregon. 
 A proposal by Vulcan Power Company (Vulcan) for a 30-MW 
project at Newberry Volcano, Oregon. 
 A proposal by Trans-Pacific Geothermal Corporation for 
a 30-MW project at Vale, Oregon. 
 A proposal by Unocal Corporation for a 14-MW project at 
Glass Mountain, California. 


Evaluation Process 


Proposals were evaluated by a project team composed of BPA staff. 
Two sets of criteria were used. The first set, considered 
``threshold'' criteria, were the criteria stated in the RFP. 
Proposals were eliminated from further consideration if they 
failed to meet any of these criteria except the utility cost 
sharing requirement. Threshold criteria included: 
 Resource area considered capable of producing at least 
100 MW

. Since BPA required the sites to be 
undeveloped, there was no way to know reservoir size 
with much certainty for the proposed sites. If better 
data were not available, a resource estimate by the 
U.S. Geological Survey or some other authoritative 
source was considered sufficient basis for meeting this 
criterion. 
 

Suitable for operation as a unit

. For the purpose of 
conserving the resource, Federal geothermal leasing 
regulations allow geothermal leaseholders to unite with 
each other in the development or operation of any 
geothermal resource area. The leases affected by such 
a cooperative arrangement are called a unit, and one of 
the leaseholders is designated the unit operator. 43 
CFR 3243. BPA wanted to encourage coordinated 
development and avoid resource depletion problems 
experienced elsewhere, and therefore included 
suitability for unitization as a selection criteria. 
The lease block had to be unitized or suitable for unit 
operation with the developer as operator. If the area 
was not already unitized, the developer had to control 
a large and reasonably contiguous lease block. Bureau 
of Land Management staff were consulted regarding the 
suitability of proposed sites for unitization. It 
should be noted that unitization in itself was not the 
objective of this requirement. The objective was to 
encourage coordinated development and conservation of 
the resource. 
 

Resource area not previously developed for electric 
power production

. A program goal was to develop new 
resources. If a power project had already been 
developed at a site, the site did not meet this 
criterion. 
 

Output contract proposed

. BPA was willing to purchase 
output only, not finance projects. 
 

Amenable to BPA receiving an option on future power 
from the lease block

. Since the cost of power from the 
first project was expected to exceed the cost of other 
resources available to BPA, BPA required a right of 
first refusal on up to 100 MW of additional development 
at each site. Subsequent plants would benefit from 
established infrastructure and lower risks, and the 
cost of power from them would likely be more cost-effective.
 

Cost sharing by another utility

. Initiating 
development of Northwest resources would have regionwide benefit. A cooperative effort that included cost 
sharing seemed appropriate. It was recognized that 
developers might have difficulty enlisting another 
utility before BPA identified candidate projects, so 
failure to meet this criterion did not disqualify a 
proposal during the evaluation period. Developers were 
notified of this. 
 

Project allows BPA to be a cooperating agency in a BLM 
environmental process

. Staffing constraints would not 
allow BPA to be the lead agency in the NEPA review. 
This criterion effectively limited projects to Federal 
or Tribal land. 
The second set of criteria addressed the developer
s ability to 
complete the project successfully. These are standard criteria 
used by BPA in previous and subsequent solicitations, and 
included: 
 

Development team experience

. How qualified was the 
project team? Had they worked together on previous 
successful projects? A salaried staff currently 
involved in project development or in operating 
projects tended to be rated more highly than a listing 
of consultants that would be hired for a proposed 
project. A salaried staff was thought to indicate 
greater stability and commitment by the developer to 
maintaining a long term presence in the geothermal 
industry. There was also no guarantee that the listed 
consultants would ever work on a proposed project. 
 

Ability to finance the project

. Proven ability to 
finance projects was desired. Was the developer 
experienced in obtaining construction and long term 
project financing? Was the financing plan realistic? 
Audited financial reports were requested from each 
developer, and Dun and Bradstreet financial information 
reports were obtained, if available.

<TEXT>
 

 

Project design

. Had all important aspects of project 
design been considered? 
 

Transmission availability

. Were transmission capacity 
or wheeling services available to deliver the energy to 
the BPA grid? 
 

Site control

. Developers were asked to provide copies 
of lease documents or other evidence of site control. 
 

Development schedule

. Was the development schedule 
realistic, well thought out, and logical? Did it 
include all important activities? 
 

Environmental impacts/siting issues/permits and 
licenses

. To what extent had environmental and siting 
issues been identified? What progress had been made in 
obtaining permits and licenses? BPA staff consulted 
with land management agencies in the project areas, and 
requested additional information from developers, when 
necessary. 
 

Cost of energy

. This was used more as a starting point 
for negotiations than as a selection criterion. BPA 
did not expect developers to commit to a price until 
the terms and conditions of the power contract were 
better known. Another reason for not selecting based 
on price was to avoid being forced to select weak 
projects with unrealistic power prices and to 
discourage ``low-ball'' bids. 
The evaluation process included a preliminary evaluation of the 
proposals, followed by requests from the BPA project team for 
additional information and a final evaluation. 
An issue of site control affecting the two proposed projects at 
Newberry Volcano was examined. The ownership or ownership share 
of three leases_OR 11987, OR 11992, and OR 45506_was a matter 
of dispute between CEC and Vulcan. Since both developers 
considered it likely that litigation would be necessary to 
resolve this dispute, and because BPA's decision to purchase only 
output was thought to place all risk of nonperformance on the 
developer, this was not a critical factor in the selection 
process. 
The BPA team selected three projects for further consideration, 
and the Administrator was briefed and a final decision made on 
December 17, 1991. The proposers were notified of BPA's decision 
by registered letter between December 18 and December 20, 1991. 
The December 18 letter to Vulcan Power Company, which was not 
selected, explained the reasons for BPA's decision. The CEC/EWEB 
project was stronger in many respects and met BPA requirements 
for utility cost sharing. Also, Vulcan lacked a history of 
successful project development (the one project it attempted was 
unsuccessful). As noted in the December 1990 Geothermal 
Resources Council BULLETIN article mentioned above, only one 
project would be chosen at each site. 


Contract Negotiations 


The three projects selected for contract discussions were Glass 
Mountain, Vale, and the CEC/EWEB Newberry Project. All three 
projects were considered capable of meeting the goals of the 
program. Total output from the three projects exceeded the 30 aMW 
BPA agreed to purchase in the solicitation. But because the terms 
of the power purchase contracts and the degree of participation 
by other utilities were not known at this time (only one of the 
projects had identified a utility partner), and in the interest 
of meeting program goals, BPA agreed to consider purchasing more 
than 30 aMW. The Glass Mountain and Vale Projects will, if 
appropriate, be the subject of separate Records of Decision, and 
will not be discussed further in this document. 
Negotiations for the Newberry Project began in January 1992, and 
were completed in December 1992. The negotiations resulted in 
three proposed agreements: 
 A Power Purchase Agreement between CEC and BPA;
 A Billing Credits Generation Agreement between EWEB and 
BPA;
 A Power Purchase Agreement between CEC and EWEB. 
Under its Power Purchase Agreement with CEC, BPA would purchase 
approximately 20 average megawatts of output from the project and 
receive an option on an additional 67 megawatts, if available in 
the future. Under its Power Purchase Agreement with CEC, EWEB 
would purchase 10 average megawatts from the project and receive 
an option on 33 megawatts, if available. BPA would give EWEB 
billing credits for 10 average megawatts under a Billing Credits 
Generation Agreement. The term of the agreements is 50 years 
from the commercial operation date of the project. 
The price of energy will not exceed BPA's Alternative Cost, as 
established in BPA's 1990 Billing Credit Solicitation. The 
Alternative Cost is the estimated cost which BPA would incur as a 
result of acquiring new resources, and is the upper limit on the 
amount of a billing credit other than conservation. 



Memorandum of Understanding



A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between CE Newberry, Inc. (a 
subsidiary of the California Energy Company), EWEB, and BPA was 
executed on December 17, 1992. The MOU acknowledged that the 
parties had reached agreement on contract principles, and defined 
the roles of the parties during the environmental review required 
by NEPA. The MOU noted that BPA had not made a final decision to 
sign any power purchase or other agreements, and that such power 
purchase obligation would not arise, if at all, until the 
environmental impacts of the proposed Newberry Project had been 
analyzed in accordance with NEPA. 


Environmental Considerations 


National Environmental Policy Act Background 


The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) is the basic 
national charter for protection of the environment. It 
establishes policy, sets goals, and provides means for carrying 
out its policy. NEPA requires Federal agencies to make 
environmental information available to public officials and 
citizens before decisions are made and before actions are taken. 
Accurate scientific analysis, expert agency comments, and public 
scrutiny are essential to implementing NEPA. The NEPA process is 
intended to help public officials make decisions that are based 
on an understanding of environmental consequences. NEPA mandates 
that Federal agencies use all practical means to protect, 
restore, and enhance the quality of the human environment and 
avoid or minimize any possible adverse effects of their actions 
upon the quality of the human environment. 


Newberry Geothermal Pilot Project Environmental Impact Statement 


On December 2, 1992, a Notice of Intent to Prepare an 
Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) in accordance with NEPA was 
published by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the 


Federal Register

. This EIS would analyze the environmental 
impacts of various alternatives related to the development of the 
proposed Newberry Geothermal Pilot Project (Newberry Project). 
The U.S. Forest Service (USFS) would be the Lead Agency in this 
process; the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and BPA would be 
Cooperating Agencies. 
BPA adopted the Newberry Geothermal Pilot Project Final 
Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) (DOE/EIS-0207, June 
1994). The FEIS was tiered to the Resource Programs 
Environmental Impact Statement (RPEIS-DOE/EIS-0162), which 
considered the environmental tradeoffs among the resource types 
available to meet BPA's need. 
The FEIS evaluated the exploration, development, utilization, 
and decommissioning phases of the Newberry Project as well as 
related transmission, wheeling, and billing credit components. 
Alternative A is the CEC/EWEB proposal, and Alternative B is the 
three Federal agencies' modification of the proposal. In 
addition to identifying and analyzing the environmental impacts 
of these two alternatives for the proposed Newberry Project, the 
FEIS also evaluated the No Action alternative. The Power 
Purchase and Billing Credits Agreements require that the Newberry 
Project meet all Federal, state, and local requirements. The 
FEIS fulfills the requirements of the National Environmental 
Policy Act (NEPA) and meets the needs of the USFS and the BLM, 
who have documented their decisions in a separate, joint Record 
of Decision (ROD). BPA has also determined that this action is 
consistent with the Council's 1991 Power Plan. 
The following alternatives were considered in the EIS: 


Alternative A 


Alternative A is the proposal as submitted by CE Exploration 
(CEE, a subsidiary of the California Energy Company). It 
includes exploration, development, production, utilization, 
and decommissioning of the geothermal resources on CEE's 
Federal geothermal leases on the west flank of Newberry 
Volcano. Highlights of this alternative, which is described 
in more detail in the FEIS, include development of 
exploration/production well pads at 14 specific locations; 
construction and operation of one 33-MW (gross output) power 
plant at a specific site; construction of associated 
pipelines and access roads; construction and utilization of 
an H-frame, 115-kilovolt transmission line along the north 
side of Forest Road 9735 to deliver power from the plant to 
an existing transmission line; and mitigation and monitoring 
measures as proposed by CEE. These would be permanent 
facilities with a contract life of at least 50 years.

<TEXT>
 

Alternative B 


Alternative B is a modification of Alternative A developed 
by the three Federal agencies that allows for greater siting 
flexibility to minimize potential environmental impacts once 
the geothermal resource is defined through exploration. It 
is similar to Alternative A in plant design and size, size 
of the well field and pads, and design of the facilities 
except for the transmission line. It differs most in 
respect to the siting flexibility of well pads, power plant, 
pipelines, and access roads and the mitigation and 
monitoring measures to be included. It is described in 
detail in the FEIS and highlights include development of 
exploration/production well pads at 14 out of 20 possible 
locations; siting the individual well pads within a 40-acre 
or less siting area; construction and operation of one 33-MW 
power plant at one of three possible locations; construction 
of associated pipelines and access roads; construction and 
utilization of a single pole design 115-kilovolt 
transmission line to the south of Forest Road 9735; and 
additional mitigation and monitoring measures proposed by 
the agencies and public. These facilities would also be 
permanent, with a contract life of at least 50 years. 




Alternative C 




Alternative C is the No Action alternative. Under this 
alternative, BPA would not acquire the energy output from 
the proposed Newberry Project, thereby foregoing the 
opportunity to supplement BPA's energy supply and to 
demonstrate the availability of geothermal power to help 
meet the region's power needs. BPA would also not provide 
billing credits to EWEB, with the same results as above, and 
would not provide wheeling services to transmit the energy. 
CEE would not go forth with the project without the power 
purchase agreement, and EWEB would cease further involvement 
without billing credits. This alternative is 
environmentally preferable, as it would result in no impacts 
to the immediate environment. 




Other Actions 




Because the proposed action will not satisfy BPA's total need for 
electrical energy, implementing the proposed action will not 
foreclose consideration of other potential BPA resource actions. 
Resource types potentially available to meet future load growth 
were comparatively evaluated in the RPEIS and include: 


 Conservation (commercial, residential, and industrial 
sectors); 


 Renewables (hydropower, wind, biomass, solar, and other 
geothermal power); 


 Cogeneration; 


 Combustion turbines; 


 Nuclear; and 


 Coal. 




Decision Factors and Issues 




All of the project alternatives were evaluated against the 
purpose and need for the Newberry Project, and only Alternatives 
A and B would satisfy the need for electrical power. These 
alternatives would also help BPA meet its contractual obligations 
and are consistent with BPA's statutory responsibilities. Based 
on the information analyzed and disclosed in the FEIS and 
associated documents, including the USFS/BLM ROD, BPA has 
determined that the preferred alternative is Alternative B with 
the conditions and mitigation and monitoring elements described 
in the USFS/BLM ROD. The rationale for selecting Alternative B 
is summarized in the USFS/BLM ROD by major issues that were of 
most concern or apparent controversy. A Mitigation Action Plan 
(MAP) developed from the FEIS analysis is available. It requires 
implementation of the specific mitigation requirements described 
in the FEIS and USFS/BLM ROD. 




Environmental Consultations, Review, and Permit Requirements 




BPA reviewed the status of all permits and licenses required for 
the Newberry Project, consulted with CEE to satisfy area-wide, 
state, and local environmental plans and programs, and developed 
a Mitigation Action Plan MAP to assure that all environmental 
requirements are addressed and that all practicable means to 
avoid, minimize, or mitigate environmental impacts have been 
adopted. It implements the specific mitigation requirements 
described in the FEIS and USFS/BLM ROD. Development of the 
Newberry Project will be consistent with environmental 
policies established by NEPA and the Oregon Energy Facility 
Siting Council (EFSC), and will be consistent with the 
requirements of the Council's Power Plan. 




Monitoring and Enforcement 




The MAP (Attachment 2) for the Newberry Project requires implementation of 
mitigation measures necessary to reduce the environmental impacts 
identified in the FEIS. The USFS, BLM, and BPA all have 
responsibility for monitoring the progress of the Newberry 
Project and ensuring that these measures are taken as 
appropriate. The USFS and BLM responsibilities are detailed in 
the USFS/BLM ROD. (Attachment 1). BPA will continue to monitor the Newberry 
Project through its environmental oversight program. The Power 
Purchase and Billing Credits Agreements stipulate the penalties 
for noncompliance with these measures. 




Decision 




Upon consideration of the entire record, BPA has decided to 
execute a Power Purchase Agreement with CE Newberry, Inc., 
execute a Billing Credits Generation Agreement with EWEB, and 
provide wheeling services for transmission of energy from the 
Newberry Project to EWEB's system.

Southern Natural Gas Co.; Notice of Intent to Prepare an Environmental Assessment for the Southern Natural Gas Company's
Proposed Cleveland Branch Pipeline Project and Request for Comments on Environmental Issues



October 20, 1994.



The staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or Commission) will prepare an environmental assessment
(EA) that will discuss environmental impacts of the construction and operation of facilities proposed in the Cleveland
Branch Pipeline Project. This EA will be used by the Commission in its decisionmaking process (whether or not to approve
the individual projects).






Summary of the Proposed Facilities



Southern Natural Gas Company (Southern) proposes to construct:

 About 20.2 miles of 12-inch-diameter natural gas pipeline in Catoosa and Whitfield Counties, Georgia and
Hamilton and Bradley Counties, Tennessee. This proposed pipeline, referred to as the ``Cleveland Branch Line''
would extend from milepost (MP) 101.44 on Southern's existing 12-inch Chattanooga Branch Line in Catoosa County,
Georgia, to a proposed interconnection owned by East Tennessee Natural Gas Company (East Tennessee) in Bradley County,
Tennessee; and

 One new meter station in Bradley County. The proposed meter station would consist of two 6-inch meter runs,
pressure regulators, flow control valves, about 125 feet of miscellaneous buried piping, and an 8-foot by 10-foot
instrumentation building. This facility would be located adjacent to East Tennessee's existing mainline system
and would require a site of about 150 feet by 150 feet for construction and operation.

Southern indicates that the proposed pipeline facilities would deliver a total firm transportation service of about
11,350 thousand cubic feet (Mcf) per day to its customer group, which is comprised of various gas distributors and
municipalities served exclusively on a firm basis by East Tennessee.

The general location of the project facilities is shown in appendix 1.






Land Requirements for Construction



Southern proposes to use a 75-foot-wide right-of-way for construction. Following construction, a 50-foot-wide
easement would be permanently maintained; the remaining 25 feet would be restored and revert back to prior use. About
200.4 acres would be affected by construction.

Additional working space would be required adjacent to the planned construction right-of-way at areas of steep side
slopes, bored road crossings, stream crossings and in most areas where topsoil would be segregated (agricultural
and residential areas). No new access roads would be required.



The EA Process



The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires the Commission to take into account the environmental impacts
that could result from an action whenever it considers the issuance of a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity.
NEPA also requires us to discover and address concerns the public may have about proposals. We call this ``scoping''.
The main goal of the scoping process is to focus the analysis in the EA on the important environmental issues. By this
Notice of Intent, the Commission requests public comments on the scope of the issues it will address in the EA. All comments
received are taken into account during the preparation of the EA.

The EA will discuss impacts that could occur as a result of the construction and operation of the proposed project under
these general headings:

 Geology and soils.
 Water resources, fisheries, and wetlands.
 Vegetation and wildlife.
 Endangered and threatened species.
 Land use.
 Cultural resources.
 Hazardous waste.
 Air quality and noise.
 Safety.

We will also evaluate possible alternatives to the proposed project or portions of the project, and make recommendations
on how to lessen or avoid impacts on the various resource areas.

Our independent analysis of the issues will be in the EA. Depending on the comments received during the scoping process,
the EA may be published and mailed to Federal, state, and local agencies, public interest groups, interested individuals,
affected landowners, newspapers, libraries, and the Commission's official service list for this proceeding. A
comment period will be allotted for review if the EA is published. We will consider all comments on the EA before we recommend
that the Commission approve or not approve the project.



Currently Identified Environmental Issues



We have already identified several issues that we think deserve attention based on a preliminary review of the proposed
facilities and the environmental information provided by Southern. Keep in mind that this is a preliminary list.
The list of issues may be added to, subtracted from, or changed based on your comments and our analysis. Issues are:

 The proposed project would cross 37 waterbodies, three of which are perennial. The perennial waterbodies
are Little Tiger Creek, Tiger Creek and Sugar Creek, all located in Catoosa County, Georgia.

 Some of these waterbodies support valuable riparian vegetation, which helps stabilize soil to prevent erosion
and provides pristine habitat for wildlife. Some creeks may also support fishery resources.

 About 79 acres of upland forest would be disturbed.

 About 6 acres of residential land would be affected by construction; one residence is located within 50 feet
of the proposed construction right-of-way.



Public Participation



You can make a difference by sending a letter addressing your specific comments or concerns about the project. You
should focus on the potential environmental effects of the proposal, alternatives to the proposal (including alternative
routes), and measures to avoid or lessen environmental impact. The more specific your comments, the more useful they
will be. Please follow the instructions below to ensure that your comments are received and properly recorded:

 Address your letter to: Lois Cashell, Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol
St., N.E., Washington, D.C. 20416;

 Reference Docket No. CP94-682-000;

 Send a 

copy 

of your letter to: Ms. Alisa Lykens, EA Project Manager, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol
St., N.E. Room 7312, Washington, D.C. 20426; and

 Mail your comments so that they will be received in Washington, D.C. on or before November 23, 1994.

If you wish to receive a copy of the EA, you should request one from Ms. Lykens at the above address.



Becoming an Intervenor



In addition to involvement in the EA scoping process, you may want to become an official party to the proceeding or become
an ``intervenor''. Among other things, intervenors have the right to receive copies of case-related Commission
documents and filings by other intervenors. Likewise, each intervenor must provide copies of its filings to all other
parties. If you want to become an intervenor you must file a Motion to Intervene according to Rule 214 of the Commission's
Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214) attached as appendix 2.

The date for filing timely motions to intervene in this proceeding has passed. Therefore, parties now seeking to file
late interventions must show good cause, as required by Section 385.214(b)(3), why this time limitation should be
waived. Environmental issues have been viewed as good cause for late intervention. You do not need intervenor status
to have your scoping comments considered.

Additional information about the proposed project is available from Ms. Alisa Lykens, EA Project Manager, at (202)
208-0766.

<DOCTITLE>Columbia Gas Transmission Corp.; Notice of Proposed Changes in FERC Gas Tariff </DOCTITLE>

 

October 20, 1994. 

 

Take notice that on October 17, 1994, Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Columbia) tendered for filing as part
of its FERC Gas Tariff, Second Revised Volume No. 1, the following tariff sheets:



 
Eighth Revised Sheet No. 25 

 Eighth Revised Sheet No. 26 

 Eighth Revised Sheet No. 27 

 Eighth Revised Sheet No. 28



 
The proposed tariff sheets bear an issue date of October 17, 1994 and proposed effective dates of November 1, 1994.


 Columbia states that the instant filing revises the base TCRA rates to (a) reflect the impact of paying an exit fee of
$37,556,308, plus a pre-petition administrative claim of $3,498,728, inclusive of interest, to Tennessee Gas Pipeline
Company (Tennessee) on October 7, 1994, (b) remove $34,701,618 of annual demand costs included in the current TCRA
rates that would have been paid under the 858 contracts with Tennessee but for the Exit Fee Settlement, (c) flow through
a refund of $13,708,920 (inclusive of interest) received from Tennessee pursuant to a Commission order issued in
Tennessee's Docket No. RP91-203, and (d) eliminate the portion of the estimated capacity release revenue attributable
to Tennessee. 

 Columbia requests waiver of the 30-day notice requirement and also requests waiver of the Commission's requirement
in a September 30, 1994 order in Tennessee's Docket No. RP91-203 that it make a special compliance filing to adjust
its rates to reflect any future refunds in that docket, and requests permission to return any future refund through
the normal operation of the tariff since the refund would only be demand charges for one month amounting to less than
$500,000. 

 Columbia states that copies of the filing were served upon Columbia's wholesale customers and interested state regulatory
commissions. 

 Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426, in accordance with Rules
211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before
October 27, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken,
but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceedings. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion
to intervene. Copies of Columbia's filings are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.

<DOCTITLE>El Paso Natural Gas Co.; Notice of Compliance Filing </DOCTITLE>



October 20, 1994.



Take notice that on October 14, 1994, El Paso Natural Gas Company (El Paso) tendered for filing and acceptance, pursuant
to Part 154 of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) Regulations Under the Natural Gas Act certain
restated tariff sheets.

El Paso states the tendered tariff sheets restate the take-or-pay Throughput Surcharge and Direct Bill amounts for
the period from March 1, 1990 through July 31, 1994 in order to remove certain ineligible costs required by Commission
orders issued on June 16, 1994 at Docket No. RP90-81-00, et al., and Docket No. RP91-26-000,
et al. The restated Transportation Statement of Rates tariff sheets are included in Original Volume No. 1-A,
First Revised Volume No. 1-A, Second Revised Volume No. 1-A, and Third Revised Volume No. 2 of El Paso's
FERC Gas Tariff. The restated Direct Bill amounts are included in First Revised Volume No. 1 and Second Revised Volume
No. 1.

El Paso states that it is requesting waiver of the notice requirement of Section 154.22 of the Commission Regulations
pursuant to Section 154.51 to permit the tendered tariff sheets to become effective on their indicated dates. El Paso
states that no party will be adversely affected by the waiver since El Paso is merely restating tariff sheets to reflect
revised rates for previously effective periods.

El Paso states that copies of the filing were served upon all of El Paso's affected interstate pipeline system customers
and interested state regulatory commissions. 

Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Sections
385.214 and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before
October 27, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken,
but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion
to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the Public
Reference Room.

<USDEPT>ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY</USDEPT>





Proposed Determination To Prohibit or Restrict the Use of Wetlands and Other Waters as Disposal Sites for the Nashua-Hudson
Circumferential Highway in Nashua, Hudson, Litchfield, and Merrimack, NH

 

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Proposed Section 404(c) Determination and Public Hearing. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Section 404(c) of the Clean Water Act (Act) authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to prohibit or restrict
the discharge of dredged or fill material at defined sites in the waters of the United States (including wetlands)
whenever it determines, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that use of such sites for disposal would have an
unacceptable adverse impact on various resources, including wildlife. EPA-New England proposes under Section
404(c) of the Act to prohibit use of wetlands and other waters by the proposed Nashua-Hudson Circumferential Highway
(NHCH) as disposal sites for dredged or fill material. The highway would directly eliminate 40 acres of valuable wetlands
and indirectly degrade or threaten extensive additional wetland habitat. EPA-New England believes that filling
the wetlands and waters of the site may have an unacceptable adverse effect on wildlife habitat and possibly municipal
water supplies, and that less environmentally damaging practicable alternatives may be available.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION AND BACKGROUND


I. Section 404(c) Procedure 


The Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1251 

et seq., 

prohibits the discharge of pollutants, including dredged or fill material, into the waters of the United States,
including wetlands, except in compliance with, among other requirements, section 404. Section 404 establishes
a federal permit program to regulate the discharge of dredged or fill material subject to environmental regulations,
known as the 404(b)(1) Guidelines, developed by EPA in conjunction with the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps). Except
for section 404(c) actions, the Corps may issue permits authorizing dredged and fill material discharges into waters
and wetlands if they comply with, among other requirements, EPA's 404(b)(1) Guidelines. Section 404(c) authorizes
EPA, after providing notice and opportunity for hearing, to prohibit or restrict filling waters of the United States
where it determines that such use would have an unacceptable adverse effect on wildlife or other specified environmental
interests. EPA can exercise 404(c) to ``veto'' a permit the Corps has decided to issue or to protect valuable aquatic
areas in the absence of any specific permit decision. 
Regulations published in 40 CFR Part 231 establish the procedures to be followed by EPA in exercising its section 404(c)
authority. Whenever the Regional Administrator has reason to believe that use of a site may have an unacceptable adverse
effect on one or more of the pertinent resources, he may begin the process by notifying the Corps of Engineers, the applicant,
and the landowners of the aquatic sites (if different from the applicant), that he intends to issue a proposed determination
under section 404(c). Unless one of these parties persuades the Regional Administrator within 15 days that no unacceptable
adverse effects will occur, the Regional Administrator publishes a notice in the 

Federal Register

 of his proposed determination, soliciting public comment and offering an opportunity for a public hearing. Today's
notice represents this step in the process. 
Following the public hearing and the close of the comment period, the Regional Administrator may either withdraw
the proposed determination or prepare a recommended determination. (A decision to withdraw may be reviewed at the
discretion of the Assistant Administrator for Water at EPA Headquarters.) If the Regional Administrator prepares
a recommended determination, he then forwards it and the complete administrative record compiled in the Region to
the Assistant Administrator for Water at EPA Headquarters. The Assistant Administrator makes the final decision
affirming, modifying, or rescinding the recommended determination. 


II. Project Description and History 


The New Hampshire Department of Transportation (DOT) proposes to construct the Nashua-Hudson Circumferential
Highway, a 13 mile limited access toll road in the City of Nashua and the Towns of Hudson, Litchfield and Merrimack in
New Hampshire. A bypass highway, similar to the NHCH, has been proposed for many years. For the past decade EPA has raised
environmental concerns regarding the highway. In its review of an earlier 1984 EIS, EPA recommended permit denial
due to concerns about drinking water impacts at the Pennichuck Reservoir and wetland losses. In 1990 the Army Corps
of Engineers required a revised EIS to focus on these issues. 
During the past three years, EPA reviewed several draft EIS documents, attended numerous meetings with DOT and the
Corps, and conducted many site visits. EPA consistently advised the Corps and NHDOT that potential impacts to the
Pennichuck Reservoir area, wetlands, and other water resources must be avoided and reduced. In 1992, EPA sent several
letters to the Corps stating concerns regarding severity of the aquatic impacts, the need to examine other alternatives,
and the potential adverse drinking water impacts. EPA alerted the Corps that these impacts could cause the highway
to violate the Guidelines. 
The Corps released the revised draft EIS in October 1992. EPA commented to the Corps in March 1993 that the proposed
project violated the 404(b)(1) Guidelines and should be denied a permit and that the project was a candidate for prohibition
under EPA's section 404(c) authority. The Corps issued the final EIS in October 1993. EPA restated its concerns in
a November 1993 comment letter on the final EIS and identified the highway as a likely candidate for action under section
404(c) of the Clean Water Act. 

At several points in February and March 1994, the Corps indicated its intent to issue a 404 permit for the NHCH, notwithstanding
EPA's objections. On March 31, 1994, EPA began the first step in the 404(c) process by notifying DOT and the Corps that
it believed the filling of the wetlands and other waters may have an unacceptable adverse effect on wildlife habitat
and drinking water resources. 
EPA subsequently sent the notification letter to the numerous landowners in the right-of-way. The Corps, DOT and
some landowners submitted letters in response to the notice that EPA was commencing the 404(c) process. EPA also met
with DOT and the Corps on May 13 and 26, 1994, and with approximately 20 landowners on June 23, 1994 in Hudson, NH. Because
these consultations did not convince the Regional Administrator that the highway would not cause an unacceptable
impact, he is proceeding to this next step in the process.

III. Characteristics and Functions of the Site 


The wetlands within the proposed alignment of the NHCH as well as the 100+ square mile study area, as defined in the EIS,
provide high quality, diverse habitat for fish and wildlife, a travel corridor for upland and wetland wildlife, food
web production for on-site and downstream biological communities, nutrient and pollutant uptake and assimilation,
floodwater storage, and flow moderation. Additionally, they serve as an environment for fishing, hunting, bird
watching and other recreational activities. The EIS states that the vast majority of the wetlands provide a wide spectrum
of functions and values. Wildlife habitat rated the highest at most of the sites. 
Most of the wetlands in the study area are riparian systems which border streams that flow to the Merrimack River, including
Limit, Second, Merrill, Glover, Chase, and Pennichuck Brooks. Wetlands bordering streams provide special values.
The streams transport organic material from upstream areas in the watershed to the floodplain wetlands, supporting
food web production for on-site and downstream biological communities. Riverine wetlands also assimilate nutrients
and pollutants, store floodwater, and moderate flows. These riparian corridors are also valuable because of their
high productivity and travel use by wildlife. 
The study area contains valuable wildlife habitat, and includes over 200 different species of birds, mammals, amphibians
and reptiles. The New Hampshire Heritage Program considers over 20% of these species uncommon, rare, threatened,
or endangered in the state. Over 75% of the species in the study area utilize or depend on wetlands or riparian systems
for survival. 
Some of the more than 100 bird species that utilize the study area include great blue heron and green-backed heron.
Several wetland birds are uncommon or threatened, including species such as American bittern and eastern screech
owl. Many of these aquatic species need large tracts of land to survive, such as northern waterthrush and belted kingfisher;
others, such as red-shouldered hawk, depend greatly on riparian wetland systems. The bald eagle, a federal endangered
species, uses this portion of the Merrimack River during winter for feeding, roosting and as a travel corridor. A peregrine
falcon, also a federal endangered species, was observed at the Second Brook wetland complex during its migratory
patterns. 
More than 40 mammal species live in the study area, including otter and mink. These aquatic species also require large
blocks of habitat in which to forage and breed. Some of the mammal species in the study area are considered uncommon
or rare in the state, such as fisher, hoary bat, and southern bog lemming. 
Over 30 species of reptiles and amphibians also inhabit the project site such as the uncommon blue spotted salamander;
the vast majority of these species need wetlands for various life functions. Several species of amphibians in New
Hampshire are obligate vernal pool species; that is, they require vernal pools to breed and survive. Moreover, some
of these species, which can live 20 to 25 years, return to their natal pools each year to breed. Therefore, destruction
of these pools may eliminate entire breeding populations of these animals. For example, one obligate species, spotted
salamander, was observed at numerous vernal pools directly on the proposed alignment. Another obligate species,
blue spotted salamander, a state listed species, was also observed at several locations on the proposed alignment.
Painted turtles and other species were also observed using these valuable aquatic systems. 
Fish use wetlands as nursery areas and most important recreational fishes spawn in wetlands. Second Brook and Glover
Brook are stocked with trout; the Merrimack River itself likely supports more than 30 fish species. 
Area-sensitive species such as mink and otter as well as forest interior birds, such as red-shouldered hawk, broad-winged
hawk, northern waterthrush, Canada warbler, barred owl, and black and white warbler live in the study area. These
wetland species typically require large tracts for breeding and decline sharply with habitat fragmentation and
reductions in forest patch sizes.

Several large blocks of habitat in the study area support these interior, secretive animals. These habitats, generally
associated with the large wetland complexes, are primarily undeveloped tracts of land and water with several corridors
to allow free range of movement. The Second Brook area and lands to the east form a habitat block of approximately 5,000
to 10,000 acres, uncommonly large for this portion of New Hampshire. Large wildlife habitats also exist to the north
in Londonderry and Litchfield. 


The Merrimack River, which flows north to south, dominates the hydrology of the study area and is fed by numerous tributaries
flowing east to west. Since most of the proposed highway heads north and south, the 13 mile road would inevitably cross
and fill a number of tributaries and sub-tributaries to the Merrimack. 


Wetlands at the site help to maintain and/or improve water quality, as well as regulate water quantity. Wetland plants
and soil trap, assimilate, and transform pollutants entering the watershed. Wetland trees and shrubs retard floodwater,
decreasing downstream flood stages. The basal flow contribution from wetlands to streams during summer stress periods
provides water at the most important time of year. 


The Merrimack River is an existing and future source of water supply for a number of communities in New Hampshire and
Massachusetts. In fact, the Merrimack River is a supplemental and emergency supply source for Nashua, although the
intake is upstream from the proposed project. The Merrimack River is currently the primary drinking water source
for a number of communities in Massachusetts (e.g. Lawrence, Lowell, Methuen, and Tewksbury), all of which are downstream
of the proposed project and take raw water directly from the Merrimack River, just prior to treatment. Another community,
Andover, MA, augments its primary supply by pumping water from the Merrimack. In addition, the Merrimack River has
been considered as a future drinking water supply source for several additional communities, many of which are downstream
(e.g. Haverhill, MA, North Andover, MA) of the proposed project. 


The NHCH would result in approximately 1.25 miles of roadway and two proposed interchanges within the Pennichuck
Brook drainage watershed. Pennichuck Brook and ponds serve as the primary public water supply for the City of Nashua
and for sections of other neighboring communities. There are many small public water supply systems that rely on drilled
wells in Hudson and Litchfield. In addition, the Southern New Hampshire Water Company has a high yield wellfield in
southern Litchfield. 


EPA, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts, having recognized the important environmental resources in the area, have
been working to implement a multi-million dollar initiative to protect the aquatic resources of the Merrimack River
Watershed. Considerable time, money and effort have been expended during the past three years to protect water quality
and wildlife habitat. This project would adversely affect the very resources that EPA has targeted for protection
with this watershed initiative. 




IV. Basis of the Proposed Determination 




A. Section 404(c) Criteria 




The CWA requires that exercise of the final section 404(c) authority be based on a determination of ``unacceptable
adverse effect'' to municipal water supplies, shellfish beds, fisheries, wildlife or recreational areas. EPA's
regulations define ``unacceptable adverse effect'' at 40 CFR 231.2(e) as: 





Impact on an aquatic or wetland ecosystem which is likely to result in significant degradation of municipal water
supplies (including surface or groundwater) or significant loss of or damage to fisheries, shellfishing, or wildlife
habitat or recreation areas. In evaluating the unacceptability of such impacts, consideration should be given to
the relevant portions of the Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines (40 CFR Part 230). 





One of the basic functions of section 404(c) is to police the application of the section 404(b)(1) Guidelines. Those
portions of the Guidelines relating to the analysis of less environmentally damaging practicable alternatives
and significant degradation of waters of the United States are particularly important in the evaluation of unacceptability
of environmental impacts in this case. The Guidelines forbid the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters
of the United States if, among other requirements, there is a less environmentally damaging practicable alternative
or if it would cause or contribute to significant degradation of waters of the United States. 




B. Adverse Impacts of the Proposed Project 




Direct Impacts to Wildlife 




The project as currently proposed by DOT would directly fill approximately 40 acres of wetlands.

1

 Destruction of wetland acreage correlates with loss of functions and values including habitat destruction, reduced
primary and secondary productivity and alteration of hydrological functions. The NHCH would also cross 18 streams,
causing the direct loss of 3,000 feet of stream bed, place 200 acres of roadway on top of fourteen different high yield
aquifers, and eliminate 600 acres of undeveloped upland habitat.

<TEXT>
 

The proposed project would disrupt high quality aquatic ecosystems already experiencing stress from encroaching
development in southern New Hampshire. The large direct loss of wetlands would cause the death and displacement of
wildlife, and reduce water quality functions. Uncommon species would suffer the most, especially area sensitive
animals, species dependent on riparian habitats, and smaller animals that are either less mobile or depend on vernal
pools. 


The project would destroy at least 5 vernal pools. Vernal pools are especially valuable to wildlife, particularly
as breeding areas for amphibians. Given the strong fidelity of numerous aquatic species to their natal ponds, the
direct destruction of the pools results in the loss of a large and important wildlife resource. Several populations
of different species would be lost, including spotted salamander and the rare state listed blue-spotted salamander.



The highway would impact one of the last essentially intact ecosystems remaining in the greater Nashua area and cause
impacts well beyond the footprint of the fill. Numerous streams and wetlands would be bisected, thereby altering
the hydrology, disrupting species movement and increasing predation of uncommon species. 




Indirect Impacts to Wildlife 




In addition to direct losses, the NHCH would degrade wetlands, including vernal pools, that would border the proposed
highway. When a large highway fragments habitat blocks, common species proliferate at the expense of the more unusual
wetland wildlife species. Fragmentation causes increased nest predation and parasitism to songbird populations.
Large highways act as funnels moving some predators, such as red fox and crows, into previously buffered wetland interior
areas. 


Riparian corridors help maintain viable wildlife populations by adding to the natural connectivity of habitats
already fragmented by development. Far ranging aquatic mammals inhabiting the site which often travel along streams,
such as fisher and mink, would be impacted adversely. While such species are capable of crossing highways, they often
avoid areas of human disturbance. Fast moving vehicles would kill some of these individuals which venture onto the
highway especially at night. 


Large highways restrict wildlife movement and interfere with the natural exchange of genetic material. A large highway
with fences, broken canopy, and vehicle activity throughout much of the night presents a significant barrier to the
movement patterns of animals, resulting in increased direct mortality and avoidance behavior. Because of its size
and projected high traffic volume, this highway will likely act as a barrier to restrict the movement of numerous wetland
species across the landscape, especially small mammals, reptiles, and amphibians.

DOT has asserted that: (1) local roads and other disturbances have already fragmented the area to some degree; (2)
the undeveloped block of habitat near Second Brook is actually 10,000 acres, not 3,000 or 5,000 acres and the road would
not pass through the center of it; (3) the bridges and culverts would provide for the movement of animals; (4) DOT's
consultant conducted a site specific analysis of the habitats and wildlife; and (5) the vernal pools, several of which
are impaired, do not contain any special species. EPA agrees in part with some of these statements, but nevertheless
believes the NHCH could have unacceptable effects on wildlife. EPA is, however, especially interested in receiving
comment on the five issues raised above. 


In considering DOT's statements, EPA has been mindful of several factors. First, while there are local roads in the
area, most of them are roughly 25
' wide and have tree canopies which cover most of the road. Fragmentation impacts are generally proportional
to the size of the interruption. A 250
' wide highway such as the NHCH, with activity throughout the day and night would normally cause an order of magnitude
or greater impact than existing conditions. 
Second, EPA agrees that the overall habitat block approximates 10,000 acres, but this fact only underscores the value
of the area for wildlife. That a roadway further east could cross more of the center of the block does not change the severe
impacts of a highway in the present proposed location. Third, we hope that the bridges and culverts would help with
animal movement patterns; however, despite these efforts less than 2% of the roadway will allow passage and, in any
event, there is little known regarding animal use of oversized culverts. These passages would not assist many of the
small species searching for food or breeding sites that cannot find or travel to the nearest potential passageway.
Other long ranging species can and will cross highways without using a culvert and are subject to roadkill. 
While the EIS provided much useful information, it contained relatively few site specific wildlife observations
and the likely impacts of the highway. Thus, EPA contracted with wildlife experts to gain site specific information
lacking in the EIS. Preliminary results for reptiles and amphibians confirm that many of the vernal pools the NHCH
would impact provide high quality breeding habitat for many wetland species, including a rare state listed species.



Secondary and Cumulative Impacts 


Construction of the highway may also spur secondary development along the route which will degrade additional aquatic
resources. The highway would allow quicker access to the region, encouraging greater development especially for
certain types of projects. Location and access are major siting criteria for many types of commercial and industrial
development. In addition, these projects normally require reasonably large tracts of land increasing the prospects
of adverse impacts to wetland habitat. Over time, additional point and non-point contamination sources may degrade
the quality of both surface and groundwater supply resources. 
Based on the number of permit applications that EPA, the Corps, and the State have reviewed the past 10 years, the greater
Nashua area has experienced some of the most severe cumulative loss of aquatic habitat in New England. The direct and
indirect impacts from the proposed highway would aggravate the severe cumulative loss of habitat and depletion of
biodiversity that has occurred. Furthermore, other large highways proposed in this vicinity, such as the Manchester
Airport highway, the Nashua southwest bypass, and the Windham-Salem Route 111 bypass are currently in the planning
stages. If built, these highways would result in additional cumulative impacts to the wetlands and streams that flow
into this portion of the Merrimack River. 


Water Quality Impacts 


The NHCH would also reduce overall water quality as a result of temporary construction related adverse impacts, the
long-term adverse impacts from contamination from highway stormwater runoff, the anticipated secondary and cumulative
impacts associated with newly constructed highways, and the potential for bulk chemical or fuel spills. Greater
amounts of sediment, nutrients, and other pollutants associated with urban runoff, such as heavy metals, oil and
grease, and organic contaminants could enter groundwater and tributary streams and flow into the Merrimack River.
Sedimentation results in turbidity and often transports pesticides, heavy metals and other toxins into the streams,
which adversely affects aquatic life. 

EPA is aware that DOT proposes to make a substantial effort to reduce impacts to drinking water resources. It plans
to install a closed drainage system near the Pennichuck water supply that diverts a majority of the runoff to a detention
pond downstream of the intake. It also proposes to divert drainage from the F.E. Everett Turnpike (not part of the NHCH),
several bridges (including crossing the Merrimack River), several interchanges, including the Turnpike and Route
102, and other locations, and discharge the contaminated water into lined detention basins for water quality renovation,
prior to being discharged to a surface water source (e.g. the Merrimack River or an associated tributary). DOT also
states it will carefully maintain these structures and ponds and designate a Environmental Coordinator to oversee
the implementation of the plans. In addition, there has been discussion about implementing some type of long-term
water quality monitoring plan to evaluate the effectiveness of selected detention basins. 


While these measures will help considerably, and in the case of the F.E. Everett Turnpike, actually improve an existing
situation, the highway would unavoidably increase overall pollution to these water supply sources. The NHCH would
place over 200 acres of land under pavement and impact a number of surface and groundwater public water supplies by
adding contaminants to these aquatic systems. Stormwater runoff from the highway would degrade both surface and
groundwater. While mitigation measures could reduce these impacts, it is difficult to control fully the pollutants
generated by a large highway crossing many streams and wetlands. 


For example, long-term problems such as accidents, spills, maintenance and disposal would remain. Detention ponds
hopefully remove the majority of the pollutants, but some pollution passes through and enters aquatic systems. Over
time, detention ponds may become a sink of pollution unless properly and frequently dredged and maintained. In time,
impermeable lining material may be altered in such a way that it could be functioning less efficiently. Also, numerous
portions of the highway would drain directly to groundwater, wetlands and streams.

<TEXT>
 

Secondary development in the watershed, in part spurred by the highway, would worsen water quality concerns. Historical
studies and a recent planning study (I-190/Wachusett Reservoir Water Supply Protection Study, 1992) support
the fact that the presence of interstate highways encourages development and induces growth. Highways provide the
necessary access to areas where development has not occurred, as well as additional access to existing developed
areas. The Pennichuck Corporation, which owns and operates the Pennichuck Water Supply, controls only 11% (approximately
1800 acres) of the entire Pennichuck Brook watershed. In fact, the Pennichuck Corporation has sold nearly 200 acres
of watershed land in recent years and EPA anticipates continued development within the watershed. 

The NHCH could directly or indirectly adversely impact a number of groundwater resources, particularly in the communities
of Hudson and Litchfield along the project corridor. The increased secondary and cumulative growth will be concentrated
at or in the vicinity of the proposed interchanges, within sensitive water supply resource areas. Groundwater degradation
is a nearly inevitable consequence of increased development, increased land use, and industrial development. Additionally,
there is no assurance that new interchanges would not be constructed in the future along this proposed limited access
highway, which would further increase developmental pressures. 
The FEIS also concludes that any of the full or partial build alternatives will degrade or pose a contamination threat
to surface water and groundwater resources as a result of stormwater runoff, the possibility of accidental spills,
and short-term construction impacts. The FEIS presents these impacts to water supply resources as being essentially
unavoidable and states that these potential adverse impacts should be minimized and mitigated, primarily through
the use of Best Management Practices (BMPs) and other structural means. However, the future responsibility of mitigating
any adverse impacts to water supply resources from accelerated or enhanced associated development would be deferred
to local zoning and planning boards. 


C. Project Need and Alternatives 


There is clearly a need to reduce or minimize traffic congestion in the greater Nashua area and the Central Business
District (CBD) in particular. This is especially true at the Taylor's Falls Bridge, the only crossing of the Merrimack
River in New Hampshire south of Manchester. Several primary routes converge on the bridge_Routes 111, 102, and 3A.
However, no alternative, including the NHCH, will solve all the traffic difficulties; under all options traffic
problems remain. 
EPA requests public comment on the effectiveness of various alternatives to reduce traffic problems in the Nashua
area, including the NHCH. We also request comment on other alternatives or combinations of options which would cause
considerably less environmental damage, including partial build options, mass transit, reducing existing traffic
during rush hours, and improving or expanding existing local roads (see discussion below). 


Background 


EPA concurred with the project purpose as originally defined by the Corps: ``to provide a transportation improvement
to assist east-west traffic movements and to reduce congestion on existing bridges and streets in and near the central
business districts of Nashua and Hudson by adding new crossings of the Merrimack River.'' However, the EIS includes
the additional ``goal'' of reducing traffic volumes for the CBD in the year 2010 to a level less than existing traffic
levels, as specifically measured by the percent change in LOS F miles (explained below) from 1990 to 2010. Alternatives
which did not meet this specific goal were eliminated as being ``impracticable.'' Because this test for practicability
is constrained in space (central business district), time (compares two specific years of analysis) and measure
(percentage of miles of level of service F), it artificially eliminated certain alternatives from further consideration.

EPA believes the basic project purpose, in keeping with the requirements of the Guidelines, would be: to reduce a large
portion of the traffic congestion in the greater Nashua area (as defined in the EIS), with greater importance being
given to the Central Business District. This basic project purpose would provide a sound basis to evaluate and judge
the practicability of various options. 
Traffic engineers analyze traffic conditions and future projections using a number of different techniques, including
the following:



1. Average daily traffic volume (ADT) for roadway segments 
2. Level of Service (LOS)_for roadway segments 
3. Level of Service (LOS)_for intersections 
4. Free-Flow and Congested Vehicle Hours of Travel (VHT) 



Typically highway departments use a peak-hour analysis of existing and projected conditions to determine the need
for highway improvements. Existing and future ``Levels of Service'' are analyzed. LOS is a qualitative measure describing
operational conditions assigned a letter A-F. LOS A and B represent relatively little traffic and LOS E and F
represent heavy traffic conditions and vehicular delay for at least peak hours (prime commuting hours). 
All of these methods were used with Nashua to predict future traffic conditions (2010) in three separate locations:





1. The central business district (CBD) 
2. The F.E. Everett Turnpike (Turnpike) 
3. Roadway segments bordering the CBD 


DOT's Traffic Projections 



The proposed NHCH provides some traffic relief for the central business district. Using DOT data and models, the full
build would remove LOS F
' in the CBD (F
' is worse than F), while, for example, if a partial build highway from Route 102 north to the Turnpike were constructed,
1.2 miles of LOS F
' would remain.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941026-2-00035 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941026-2-00022 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In the CBD in 2010 with the NHCH built, 4.5 miles of traffic congestion (LOS F
', F, & E) would result. Under the no build condition, 8.9 miles of congestion would remain (LOS F
', F, & E). 

However, the proposed NHCH does not provide substantial traffic relief for the entire study area. Using DOT's data
and models, any traffic measurement_ADT, LOS for intersections, LOS for road segments_shows modest traffic improvements
for the NHCH. In the study area in 2010, 27.3 miles of congestion (LOS E, F, and F
') would remain. Under a no build alternative 39.7 miles of congestion would result. 

When one examines the vehicle hours of travel (VHT), it appears that the partial build option supplies a substantial
portion of traffic relief that the NHCH would provide. The percent of free-flow traffic would be 69% for the NHCH verses
66% for the partial build from Route 102 north to the Turnpike. The following table summarizes the congested and free-flow
hours of travel: 






DOT's models may also overestimate traffic benefits from a full build highway. For example, the model assumes the
same future traffic growth in the study area, with or without the highway. EPA's experience with other highways in
New England suggests that they do alter land use and development patterns. We have no reason to believe that this highway
would be any different. If the highway generates more development, the corresponding increase in traffic could increase
levels beyond current projections for the full build (or reduce projections for the no build option). We request comment
from the public on whether the highway will likely spur additional development and traffic growth. 

Increased traffic in the study area resulting from the NHCH could place additional burdens on the two North-South
roads in the region, I-93 and especially the F.E. Everett Turnpike. Both of these roads are proposed for widening
in the near future, and major portions of the Turnpike will be at LOS F conditions even after expansion. Even with the
EIS assuming no increased growth in traffic caused by the highway, the EIS shows that parts of the Turnpike already
experiencing LOS F conditions will receive greater traffic volumes once the NHCH is in place. This condition would
worsen if the NHCH generates additional traffic to the area. 

The current analysis gives little weight to toll avoidance. However, this is a factor that could cause the full build
to reduce congestion less than projected in the CBD because the Taylor's Falls Bridge, the primary focal point of traffic
in the CBD, would be the only non-toll road remaining in New Hampshire to cross the Merrimack River south of Manchester.
(The Sagamore Bridge, currently free, would require a toll once it is part of the NHCH.) Some percentage of vehicles
currently using the Sagamore Bridge would avoid paying the toll by using either the Taylor's Falls Bridge, or the Tyngsborough
Bridge, five miles south in Massachusetts. The EIS did not discuss the issue of tolls and toll avoidance, and EPA requests
comment on these issues. 

In summary, the proposed highway would only provide partial traffic relief for the overall traffic patterns in the
greater Nashua area. Other measures of reducing traffic volumes, which cause much less impact to the environment,
may also provide some portion of the relief that the NHCH would provide. Such measures and combinations of measures
could include partial build options, traffic demand management measures (TDM), traffic systems management (TSM),
and local improvements. 



Partial Build Options 



Partial build alternatives would involve constructing one or more segments of the NHCH but something short of the
full highway proposed by DOT. All the partial build alternatives discussed below have substantially less impact
to wildlife because the partial build options would not fragment the 10,000 acre habitat block, would not destroy
several valuable vernal pools, and it would avoid nine streams and other valuable wetlands. Partial build alternatives
include: 

 Southern Bridge. This option would be an expansion of the Sagamore bridge in the south from the F.E. Everett
Turnpike in Nashua to Route 3A in Hudson, allowing direct access from the Turnpike across the Merrimack River to Hudson.


 Two Bridges. This option would include expansion of the Sagamore bridge in the south from the F.E. Everett Turnpike
in Nashua to Route 3A in Hudson and construction of a new bridge in the north also from the F.E. Everett Turnpike in Merrimack
to Route 3A in Litchfield. Thus, it would provide a new crossing of the Merrimack River between Nashua and Manchester.


 Partial Build to Route 102. Identical to the above alternative, this option would also extend the northern
section two miles east to Route 102 in Litchfield. 

 Partial Build to Route 111. This alternative is the same as above, plus an extension of the northern section
another four miles southeast to Route 111. 

Partial build alternatives, as measured by LOS of segments, appear to do relatively little to improve traffic in the
CBD. However, as measured by average daily traffic, the partial build option from Route 102 north to the F.E. Everett
Turnpike, for example, would provide over 50% of the traffic benefits of the full build in the CBD and over 75% of the
traffic benefits of the full build for the entire traffic network. DOT states in several documents that a bridge to
the north would provide traffic benefits to the study area. 

However, DOT has also stated that the partial build options will not provide traffic relief or could even make the traffic
situation worse, including adding more traffic on local roads, such as Route 3A. We understand that local roads in
the area will be busier with more cars in the future, but that may be true if the NHCH is built as well. EPA seeks comment
on this issue as well. 



TDM/TSM Measures 



Traffic demand measures (TDM) reduce the number of vehicles on roadways especially during peak travel times when
the worst congestion occurs. Traffic system management (TSM) refers to infrastructure improvements to enhance
the efficiency of vehicle movement. 

DOT and the Nashua Regional Planning Commission have already made important strides in acquiring funds in recent
years to pursue some TDM/TSM measures. Some of the projects which have been funded or for which they are pursuing funding
include:



1. improving traffic circulation at Taylor's Falls Bridge 

2. constructing an intermodal transit facility (downtown Nashua) 

3. expanding existing and building new park and ride facilities 

4. completing a statewide plan for TDM, mass transit, and high occupancy vehicle lanes (HOV)

5. buying old railroad corridors for bike and walking trails 
6. building an HOV lane at the Bedford toll_2 year trial 
7. providing free shuttle bus service along Main Street in Nashua for 2 years 
8. improving downtown traffic circulation in Nashua



Additional and expanded TDM and planning techniques for managing and reducing peak congestion, which appear to have
the greatest potential in the greater Nashua area include:
(1) organized operation of mini-vans for car-pooling and ride-sharing; 
(2) better management, operation, and extension of the local bus system; (3) changing future land use development
patterns to encourage cluster developments;
(4) parking disincentives;
(5) removing disincentives to implement and utilize mass transit; 
(6) extending rail service to the greater Nashua and Manchester area from Boston;
(7) telecommunications in lieu of travel; and 
(8) incentives to business for implementing staggered work hours and many of the measures listed above. 
It is important that TDM measures be combined with TSM to prevent the improved mobility from attracting new users and
leading to future congestion problems. Traffic flow improvements could include signal system timing/optimization,
addition of turning lanes, restrictions of single occupant vehicles (to enhance HOV operations and attract users),
fringe park and ride lots, and pedestrian/non-motorized improvements. 


Local road improvements 


Local improvements include anything that expands capacity on the basic existing traffic network, for example, improving
traffic flow across the Taylor's Falls Bridge. While some TDM/TSM measures could also be listed under this category,
other local improvements could involve adding additional lanes, overpasses, mini-bypasses, or other structural
changes. Since the EIS does not focus on this issue very much, EPA would appreciate comments on needed improvements
to the existing traffic network. 


D. Mitigation 


The current mitigation plan consists of avoiding, minimizing and compensating for environmental losses. DOT has
endeavored to minimize impacts by proposing: 1. two bridges and five box culverts at some of the stream locations;
2. closed drainage systems to divert and treat runoff in order to minimize impacts to drinking water resources; 3.
26
' median widths at wetland locations; 4. 2:1 side slopes to minimize impacts; and 5. two retaining walls to reduce
impacts. 
The compensatory mitigation portions of the plan consist of the following: 1. attempted creation or restoration
of 44 acres of wetlands mainly at the former Benson's Wild Animal Farm; 2. bringing Merrill Brook above ground at Benson's;
3. constructing water detention basins adjacent to the roadway; 4. preserving an additional 100 acres at Benson's
and 135 acres along an old alignment that DOT owns in the southern portion of the site; and 5. protecting water supply
by capturing part of the runoff from the existing F.E. Everett Turnpike. 
In general, DOT has proposed a substantial mitigation plan, especially to minimize impacts. However, EPA believes
that the environmental benefits, especially for wildlife, of the proposed compensation plan fall well short of the
impacts the NHCH would cause. While creation and restoration may be beneficial to the aquatic environment, especially
when applied at a low value site in a relatively undisturbed landscape setting, wetland creation suffers from both
theoretical limitations and practical problems. 
First, the poor track record associated with wetland creation suggests that it would be unwise to rely on this mitigation
to provide all of the intended benefits. Some wetland functions, such as flood storage, can normally be replicated
successfully. Attempts to mitigate wildlife habitat losses have met with mixed success, and benefit only a few select
species. There has been little or no demonstrated ability to recreate other wetland values such as groundwater discharge
and recharge or the complex interactions of water, soil and plants involved in the uptake and transformation of nutrients
and pollutants.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941026-2-00037 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941026-2-00022 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

DOT has made an effort to address this uncertainty by offering to construct the mitigation at Benson's before the highway
can proceed. This would allow the success or failure at Benson's to be evaluated with greater certainty. EPA believes
that demonstrating success at the Benson's site or other selected sites prior to highway construction makes sense
and should be part of any mitigation plan should the NHCH be partially or fully constructed. However, even if successful,
it would not alter the insufficiency of the current mitigation plan. The creation site borders 3 roads, including
the busy Route 111. The potential for human alteration and disturbance, from off road vehicles and other human intrusion,
would remain, as well as the impacts to wildlife from fragmentation and being hit by cars and trucks. Thus, restoring
the site would only offset a modest amount of the impacts the highway would cause to uncommon species in the study area.


Second, the proposed mitigation would not replace many lost functions and values. It would not compensate for fragmenting
one of the last large undeveloped tracts remaining in the study area, which provides an oasis for many species of wildlife.
The plan would not replace riparian streams, floodplains or the spectrum of natural resource values these areas provide.
Also, it would do little to offset the large indirect, secondary, and cumulative impacts the highway would inevitably
cause or contribute to. 

While preservation cannot replace the direct and indirect impacts from fragmentation, it can reduce the likely secondary
and cumulative impacts. However, the current preservation proposal appears insufficient to provide substantial
environmental benefits. The 100 acres at Benson's, while useful to buffer the creation area, would be located between
the new highway and the developed portions of Hudson, providing only modest wildlife access and benefits. The 135
acres, which is part of the old right-of-way, protects some useful habitat; however, it is a long linear parcel and
some of it lies inside of or adjacent to the NHCH. 

Three areas appear to be especially valuable and vulnerable to secondary impacts in the future: (1) the 5,000-10,000
acre block in the southeastern portion of the study area; (2) a large wetland and upland complex in the southern part
of Litchfield and Londonderry, containing several rare species and bordering other protected lands; and (3) floodplain
forest and farmland along the Merrimack River in Litchfield. We request comment on the adequacy of the current preservation
package and whether additional preservation options, such as portions of those described above, could offset the
likely secondary and cumulative impacts of the highway. 

After considering the project's impacts and the uneven track record of wetland creation and enhancement projects
to compensate for projects involving much less severe impacts, EPA has concluded that the adverse effects of the highway
will be difficult to mitigate sufficiently to render them environmentally acceptable. The mitigation plan described
in the EIS and other documents would not compensate for the severe impacts to wildlife which the project would cause.




V. Proposed Determination 



Based on the current proposal, the Regional Administrator proposes to recommend that the discharge of dredged or
fill material into wetlands and other waters associated with the Nashua-Hudson Circumferential Highway be prohibited.
This action would not prohibit other uses of the land on the alignment, nor would it preclude possible permitting of
partial build alternatives. 

This proposed determination is based primarily on the adverse impacts to wildlife. EPA has already concluded and
stated in previous letters that the project would cause or contribute to significant degradation of waters of the
United States and violate the  404(b)(1) Guidelines. It would directly destroy 40 acres of wetlands in an area
beset with cumulative impacts, and will degrade additional wetlands through secondary and indirect impacts. Based
on current information, the Regional Administrator has reason to believe that the adverse impacts of the Nashua-Hudson
Circumferential Highway would be unacceptable. Moreover, these impacts may be in part avoidable. 



VI. Solicitation of Comments 



EPA solicits comments on all issues discussed in this notice. In particular, we request information on the likely
adverse impacts to wildlife and other functional values of the streams and wetlands at the site. We also seek information
pertaining to plants, animals and hydrology of the site and adjacent lands. All studies of the natural resource values
of the area or informal observations would be helpful. Information on species or communities of regional and/or statewide
importance would be especially useful. 

While the significant loss of wildlife habitat serves as EPA's main basis for this proposed 404(c) determination,
New England has additional concerns with the proposed project including water quality and drinking water impacts,
alternatives, and mitigation. In particular, EPA solicits comments on particular aspects of the project including:


(1) The presence and likely impacts to fish and wildlife resources using the study area; 

(2) The potential for indirect impacts from the NHCH to fish and wildlife resources, such as fragmentation, noise
and roadkill; 

(3) The extent to which local roads and other disturbances have or have not fragmented the study area; 

(4) The extent to which the bridges and culverts would or would not provide for the movement of animals; 

(5) The potential for secondary wetland losses, through additional development that would benefit from access to
the highway; 

(6) Evidence of past and likely future cumulative impacts to the aquatic environment; 

(7) Information on potential for drinking water and other water quality impacts; 

(8) Information on whether the new highway would generate additional traffic and land use changes compared to a no-build
alternative; 

(9) The extent to which additional traffic would travel across the Taylor's Falls Bridge and the Tyngsborough Bridge
to avoid paying tolls on the Sagamore Bridge or the northern bridge. 

(10) The extent to which partial build options would provide traffic relief or make the traffic situation worse, including
adding more traffic on local roads, such as Route 3A; 

(11) The effectiveness or lack of effectiveness of the NHCH in reducing traffic congestion;

<DOCNO> FR941026-2-00038 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941026-2-00022 </PARENT>

(12) Information on the availability of less environmentally damaging practicable alternatives to satisfy the
basic project purpose_reducing traffic congestion in the greater Nashua area_taking into account cost, technology,
and logistics; 

(13) The extent to which local improvements, such as adding additional lanes, overpasses, and mini-bypasses, could
provide traffic relief; 

(14) The effectiveness of TDM/TSM in reducing traffic under a no build or partial build alternative. If a full build
is permitted, what TDM/TSM solutions should be implemented and why?; 

(15) Information on the current mitigation plan and whether it would replace the functions and values of the aquatic
habitats destroyed or degraded; 

(16) The potential for a different or supplemental mitigation plan which could reduce the direct and indirect impacts
of the NHCH to an environmentally acceptable level. Mitigation could involve avoidance, by bridging for example,
additional wetland creation, habitat preservation, additional water quality mitigation measures, watershed
and aquifer preservation, up-front success requirements or other factors. Recommendations of appropriate sites
are encouraged. 

(17) The current preservation package and additional preservation options, and whether the protection could offset
the likely secondary and cumulative impacts of the highway. 

The record will remain open for comments until December 6, 1994. All comments will be fully considered in reaching
a decision to either withdraw the proposed determination or forward to EPA Headquarters a recommended determination
to prohibit or restrict the use of the wetlands as a disposal site for construction of Nashua-Hudson Circumferential
Highway.

<DOCTITLE>Interim Policy for Particle Size and Limit Concentration Issues in Inhalation Toxicity Studies; Notice of Availability
</DOCTITLE>


Agency:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 




Action:

 Notice of availability. 





Summary:

 EPA is making available to all interested parties, an 

Interim Policy for Particle Size and Limit Concentration Issues in Inhalation Toxicity Studies

 which deals with several of the most controversial issues encountered in inhalation toxicity studies. It offers
recommendations regarding aerosol particle size, limit concentrations in acute studies, revised Toxicity Categories,
inhalation chamber selection, and reporting of analytical concentrations for formulations. 




Dates:

 The Interim Policy is effective October 26, 1994.




Addresses:

Supplementary Information:

 Toxicity Guidelines for inhalation studies were issued in 1982. Since then, numerous inadequacies have been identified,
particularly with regards to aerosol particle size and limit concentration requirements. In 1991, EPA's Health
Effects Division (HED) requested public comments on its Inhalation Guidelines. These critiques, combined with
numerous interviews with inhalation toxicologists, demonstrated these issues to be universal concerns. HED evaluated
the state of the science with particular emphasis on the physical and biological realities of performing inhalation
toxicity studies. The results of this investigation led to an Interim Policy which considers four major areas of controversy:



1. Particle size requirements for aerosol products. 
2. Limit concentration for aerosols, gases, and vapors in acute studies, and revised Toxicity Categories. 
3. Selection of appropriate inhalation chambers. 
4. Reporting of analytical concentration for formulations. 
The Interim Policy was presented to a Science Advisory Panel on December 15, 1993, for comment. The 

Final Report of the Joint FIFRA Scientific Advisory Panel and Science Advisory Board Meeting

 states that, ``The Panel concurs with the Agency's recommendations and further that these guideline revisions reflect
the current state-of-the-art for inhalation toxicity tests which are consistent with aerosol toxicology.'' 
Rather than waiting for a comprehensive revision of the inhalation guidelines, EPA has chosen to disseminate the
Interim Policy at this time because its recommendations have significant impact on the performance of studies and
regulation of pesticide products.

<DOCTITLE>Statement of Policy for Minor Amendments; Notice of Availability and Request for Comments </DOCTITLE>




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is soliciting comments on a proposed policy which streamlines the registration process by identifying minor
registration amendments which may be (1) submitted as notifications, (2) not submitted at all (non-notifications),
or (3) which can be processed faster if they are minor formulation changes. That policy is described in a draft Pesticide
Regulation (PR) Notice entitled, ``Notifications, Non-Notifications and Minor Formulation Amendments.'' Interested
parties may request this document as described in the ADDRESSES unit of this notice. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Agency is proposing to expand the current list of amendment actions which may be accomplished without prior Agency
approval. The policy will streamline the registration process to allow certain minor, low risk amendments to be achieved
by notification, non-notification or by accelerated review. If adopted, this policy would speed the approval of
such amendments and free Agency resources to focus on more important actions while maintaining protection to public
health and the environment. 


This 

Federal Register

 notice announces the availability of the draft PR Notice and solicits comment on the proposed policy. In particular,
the Agency invites comment on the following issues: 
1. A process for accelerating the processing of minor formulation amendments is being proposed to speed up the review
of changes of inert ingredients which are believed not to change the toxicological or chemical properties of products.
What are the strengths and weaknesses of this approach? 
2. A certification statement is being proposed which would be submitted with each notification indicating that the
amendment complies with the PR Notice, that a product may be subject to enforcement action or cancellation by order
without a hearing if it is not consistent with the PR Notice. The intent of this certification is to assure registrants
comply with the notice and that they understand the consequences of not complying. What are the pros and cons of the
certification statement? 
3. EPA proposes allowing several additional kinds of amendments to be accomplished by notification_addition of
pests, addition of non-food, indoor sites, and addition of directions related to packaging. Changes in directions
for use is currently prohibited by 40 CFR 151.46(b)(1). Does EPA have discretion to allow the proposed changes under
40 CFR 152.44(b)(1)? 
After reviewing public comments received, EPA may make changes to the Policy and revise the draft PR Notice prior to
release.

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of meeting.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Effluent Guidelines Task Force, an EPA advisory committee, will hold a meeting to discuss improvements to the
Agency's Effluent Guidelines Program. The meeting is open to the public.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Pursuant to the Federal Advisory Committee Act (Pub. L. 92-463), the Environmental Protection Agency gives
notice of a meeting of the Effluent Guidelines Task Force (EGTF). The EGTF is a subcommittee of the National Advisory
Council for Environmental Policy and Technology (NACEPT), the external policy advisory board to the Administrator
of EPA. 



The EGTF was established in July of 1992 to advise EPA on the Effluent Guidelines Program, which develops regulations
for dischargers of industrial wastewater pursuant to Title III of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 

et seq.

). The Task Force consists of members appointed by EPA from industry, citizen groups, state and local government,
the academic and scientific communities, and EPA regional offices. The Task Force was created to offer advice to the
Administrator on the long-term strategy for the effluent guidelines program, and particularly to provide recommendations
on a process for expediting the promulgation of effluent guidelines. The Task Force generally does not review specific
effluent guideline regulations currently under development. 

The meeting agenda will include continued discussions on draft recommendations concerning subcategorization
of industries in effluent guidelines. There will also be consideration of a draft report on methodology for conducting
preliminary industry studies. 

The meeting is open to the public. Limited seating for the public is available on a first-come, first-served basis.
The public may submit written comments to the Task Force regarding improvements to the Effluent Guidelines program.
Comments should be sent to EPA at the above address. Comments submitted will be transmitted to Task Force members for
consideration.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice announces the availability of a report entitled ``Review of Ecological Assessment Case Studies from
a Risk Assessment Perspective Volume II''. The report includes five peer-reviewed case studies that explore the
relationship between the ecological risk assessment process as described in the EPA report ``Framework for Ecological
Risk Assessment'' (EPA 630/R-92/001) and several types of ecological assessments done by EPA and others. The
report is a companion volume to a previously published set of 12 case studies (``Review of Ecological Assessment Case
Studies from a Risk Assessment Perspective'', EPA/630/R-92/005).




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In 1993, EPA's Risk Assessment Forum published an evaluation of 12 ecological assessment case studies from a risk
perspective (``Review of Ecological Assessment Case Studies from a Risk Assessment Perspective'', EPA/630/R-92/005).
To complement this original set of case studies, five new case studies were developed and peer reviewed to provide
further insight into the ecological risk assessment process. The new case studies expand the range of the first case
study set by including different kinds of stressors (radionuclides, genetically-engineering organisms, and physical
alteration of wetlands) and programmatic approaches (Pre-Manufacture Notice assessments under the Toxic Substances
Control Act and the EPA's Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program). Both case studies reports provide useful
perspectives concerning the application of ecological risk assessment principles to a range of problems.

Simplification of the Depreciation Prescription Process



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Communications Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice; further order inviting comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Communications Commission has adopted a Further Order Inviting Comments on selected accounts and proposed
projection life and future net salvage ranges for use by local exchange carriers (LECs) regulated under its price
cap regulatory scheme. The Further Order Inviting Comments identifies eight accounts for which the Commission proposes
to establish ranges for use beginning in 1995. The Commission has also proposed different simplification methods
for four other accounts. The rule change is intended to lessen the depreciation prescription burden on price cap LECs
in light of regulatory and market changes without sacrificing protection for consumers.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This is a summary of the Commission's Further Order Inviting Comments on Simplification of the Depreciation Prescription
Process, CC Docket No. 92-296, FCC 94-256, adopted October 7, 1994 and released October 11, 1994. The full
text of this Commission decision is available for inspection and copying during normal business hours in the FCC Dockets
Branch (Room 230), 1919 M Street NW., Washington, DC. The full text will be published in the 

FCC Record

 and may also be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcription Services, Room 246,
1919 M Street NW., Washington, DC 20554.




Summary



1. On September 23, 1993, we adopted streamlined depreciation prescription procedures for the local exchange carriers
(``LECs'') regulated under our price cap incentive regulatory plan.
 These procedures require us to establish ranges for the future net salvage and projection life estimates that are
used to compute depreciation rates for plant categories. The new procedures generally permit price cap LECs to make
streamlined filings for changes in depreciation rates for these categories, as long as these estimates fall within
the prescribed ranges. In our 

Second Report and Order, 

59 FR 35632 (July 13, 1994), we adopted underlying factor ranges for 22 depreciation rate categories. By this 

Further Order Inviting Comments, 

we invite comments on our proposals for setting ranges for the remaining 12 plant categories. 





2. Prior to adoption of the 

Depreciation Simplification Order, 

the depreciation prescription process required carriers to submit extensive data to support the underlying depreciation
basic factors that are the future net salvage, projection life, and survivor curve estimates used to compute proposed
depreciation rates. These data requirements often resulted in voluminous submissions, consisting of up to 25 pages
of analysis for each of 34 plant categories. In recognition of the regulatory, technological, and market changes
that price cap LECs face, we decided to simplify the process by establishing ranges that specify maximum and minimum
amounts for two of the basic depreciation factors, the future net salvage and projection life estimates. Under our
new process, if a price cap LEC meeting the requisite criteria selects future net salvage and projection life estimates
that are within the established ranges, it need not submit the detailed supporting data otherwise required. In addition,
under the new procedures, price cap LECs can change these basic factors annually, as opposed to the current triennial
represcription cycle. These streamlined procedures are intended to simplify the depreciation process, achieve
administrative savings, and allow the price cap LECs greater flexibility in the depreciation process, while continuing
an appropriate oversight of their depreciation rates. 

3. We determined that the new, streamlined procedures should be implemented in two phases, beginning with the accounts
most readily adaptable to the range approach. We have completed phase one of the streamlining process and adopted
ranges for 22 plant categories. We now begin phase two by proposing ranges for eight of the remaining categories. If
we implement these proposals, we will have established ranges of projection life and future net salvage factors for
30 of the 34 plant categories. These plant categories represent 85% of the total plant investment. In addition, we
propose in this notice alternate simplified procedures for the other four accounts. We solicit public comment on
the following proposals for phase two. 

4. We propose to establish ranges for eight of the remaining twelve plant categories. (See Appendix). In the 

Depreciation Simplification Order, 

we set forth a number of specific data that should be considered in establishing the projection life and future net
salvage ranges, and we used these data to formulate the ranges listed in the attached Appendix. For each plant category,
we first developed a range of one standard deviation from the mean of each of the projection life and the future net salvage
basic factors underlying the currently prescribed LEC depreciation rates. We then determined whether there are
technological trends or recent changes in carrier investment plans that might not be fully reflected in the LECs'
prescribed factors. Finally, we considered the number of LECs with basic factors that fall within the initial ranges
and altered the ranges where appropriate. We recognized, however, that these specifically enumerated data must
be considered in light of our obligation to prescribe reasonable depreciation rates: 




We wish to make the ranges wide enough to accommodate a significant number, if not all, of the LECs. On the other hand,
we must not make the ranges so wide that they would no longer enable us to exercise effective oversight of depreciation
rates. 




Thus, in developing the proposed ranges, we considered both the specific data enumerated in the 

Depreciation Simplification Order 

and our overriding responsibility to prescribe reasonable depreciation rates. We set forth in the Appendix our proposed
projection life and future net salvage ranges for these light plant categories.

5. We do not propose to establish ranges for Account 2211, Analog Electronic Switching; Account 2215, Electro-mechanical
Switching; and Account 2431, Aerial Wire. These are ``dying accounts'' as LECs are replacing the plant in these accounts
with newer technologies. The LECs are rapidly phasing out this obsolete equipment in accordance with specific retirement
schedules that are based on company plans to modernize their networks. Depreciation rates for this equipment can
be readily calculated from these retirement schedules. We believe that depreciation rates for such equipment that
are based upon a LEC's specific retirement plans are more accurate than rates based upon national averages. Moreover,
the calculations are less complicated than those for other plant accounts, since detailed statistical analyses
are not required to forecast lives.
6. In addition, we do not propose to set ranges for Account 2121, Buildings. For depreciation study purposes, we have
permitted the LECs to subdivide this account and estimate lives for each subcategory. Moreover, we allowed the LECs
flexibility to develop individual methods of categorization. As a result, some LECs subdivided this account based
on the size of the buildings, some by location, and others based on use. Because of the significant differences among
the categorization methods, the LECs' current basic factors for the subaccounts cannot be used to establish nationwide
ranges. If ranges are to be developed for the buildings account, the LECs' data must be recast into new, uniform subcategories.
7. We believe that the cost of establishing such subcategories would outweigh the benefits. The LECs have indicated
that the cost of compiling the information necessary to develop new subcategories would be substantial. Moreover,
the LECs do not have plans to add or retire a significant number of buildings in the next few years. As a result, the underlying
depreciation factors applicable to Account 2121 likely will not change, and an extensive analysis of the building
account probably will not be necessary within the next few years. Accordingly, we propose to maintain the basic factors
underlying the current prescribed depreciation rates for the buildings account, until our three-year range review
when we will reconsider whether ranges would be appropriate for this account. In the interim, we believe that the data
required under the streamlined procedures will be adequate, and we propose to require that the price cap LECs provide
only these data for the buildings account.
8. This is a non-restricted notice and comment rulemaking proceeding. 

Ex Parte 

presentations are permitted, except during the Sunshine Agenda period, provided they are disclosed as provided
in the Commission's rules.
9. We certify that the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 does not apply to this proceeding because if the proposals
in this Order Inviting Comments are adopted, there will not be a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small business entities, as defined by Section 601(3) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Because of the nature
of local exchange and exchange access service, the Commission has concluded that small telephone companies are dominant
in their fields of operation and therefore are not ``small entities'' as defined by that Act. The Secretary shall send
a copy of this Order Inviting Comments, including this certification, to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small
Business Administration in accordance with Section 603(a) of that Act.
10. We invite comment on the proposals set forth above. Pursuant to applicable procedures set forth in Sections 1.415
and 1.419 of the Commission's Rules, interested parties may file comments on or before November 14, 1994, and reply
comments on or before December 14, 1994. To file formally in this proceeding, interested parties must file an original
and four copies of all comments and reply comments. If commenters want each Commissioner to receive a personal copy
of their comments, they must file an original plus nine copies. Interested parties should send comments and reply
comments to Office of the Secretary, Federal Communications Commission, Washington, D.C. 20554. Parties should
also file one copy of any documents filed in this docket with the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcription
Services, Room 246, 1919 M Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20554. We also ask that parties send a courtesy copy of their
comments to the Accounting and Audits Division, 2000 L Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20036. Comments and reply comments
will be available for public inspection during regular business hours in the FCC Reference Center (Room 239) of the
Federal Communications Commission, 1919 M Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20554.
11. Accordingly, 

It is Ordered, 

pursuant to Sections 1, 4(i), 4(j), and 220(b) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C.   151,
154(i), 154(j), and 220(b), that Notice is Hereby Given of proposed plant accounts for which basic factor ranges should
be established and the ranges proposed for those accounts to be used in the depreciation prescription process as described
in the 

Depreciation Simplification Order

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Acting under the Hotel and Motel Fire Safety Act of 1990, 15 U.S.C. 2201 note, the United States Fire Administration
has worked with each State to compile a national master list of all of the places of public accommodation affecting
commerce located in each State that meet the requirements of the guidelines under the Act. FEMA published the national

A list of State contacts was published in 58 FR 17020 on March 31, 1993. If the published list is unavailable to you, the
State Fire Marshal's office can direct you to the appropriate office. Periodically FEMA will update and redistribute
the national master list to incorporate additions and corrections/changes to the list, and deletions from the list,
that are received from the State offices. 

Each update contains or may contain three categories: ``Additions;'' ``Corrections/changes;'' and ``Deletions.''
For the purposes of the updates, the three categories mean and include the following: 

``Additions'' are either names of properties submitted by a State but inadvertently omitted from the initial master
list or names of properties submitted by a State after publication of the initial master list; 

``Corrections/changes'' are corrections to property names, addresses or telephone numbers previously published
or changes to previously published information directed by the State, such as changes of address or telephone numbers,
or spelling corrections; and 

``Deletions'' are entries previously submitted by a State and published in the national master list or an update to
the national master list, but subsequently removed from the list at the direction of the State. 

Copies of the national master list and its updates may be obtained by writing to the Government Printing Office, Superintendent
of Documents, Washington, DC 20402-9325. When requesting copies please refer to stock number 069-001-00049-1.

Respondents violated sections 10(b) (1), (4), (10), (12), (14) and (15) of the Shipping Act of 1984, 46 U.S.C. app.
  1709(b) (1), (4), (10), (12), (14) and (15) by knowingly and willfully accepting cargo for the account
of various shippers of household goods who are NVOCCs without tariffs or bonds on file with the Commission; by entering

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Administration for Native Americans, Administration for Children and Families, Department of Health and Human

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

social and economic welfare. Accordingly, the Congress has taken steps to help those affected begin to mitigate environmental
impacts from Department of Defense activities by assisting them in the planning, development and implementation
of programs for such mitigation. 


 

This environmental mitigation program was begun through a 
program announcement published on December 29, 1993 as a response to the Department of Defense Appropriations Act,
Public Law 103-139, which was enacted on November 11, 1993. This program continues under Public Law 103-335
(the Act), enacted on September 30, 1994. Section 8094 of the Act states, ``Of the funds appropriated to the Department
of Defense (DOD) for Operations and Maintenance Defense_Wide, not less than $8,000,000 shall be made available until
expended to the Administration for Native Americans within 90 days of enactment of this Act: Provided That such funds
shall be made available only for the mitigation of environmental impacts, including training and technical assistance
to tribes, related administrative support, the gathering of information, documenting of environmental damage,
and developing a system for prioritizing of mitigation, on Indian lands resulting from Department of Defense activities:
Provided further, That the Department of Defense shall provide to the Committees on Appropriations of the Senate
and House of Representatives by September 30, 1995, a summary report of all environmental damage that has occurred
on Indian land as a result of DOD activities, to include, to the extent feasible, a list of all documents and records
known to the Department that describe the activity or action causing or relating to such environmental damage.''

The Administration for Native Americans (ANA) and the Department of Defense (DOD) announce the availability of FY95
funds for eligible applicants to begin the process of addressing the environmental problems and damage caused from
defense activities.

B. Proposed Projects To Be Funded With FY 1994 and 1995 Funds



The purpose of this announcement is to invite single year (up to seventeen months in duration) or up to thirty-six month
proposals from eligible applicants to undertake any or all of the Phases. 


Applicants may apply for projects of up to 36 months duration. A multi-year project, requiring more than 12 months
to develop and complete, affords applicants the opportunity to develop more complex and in-depth projects. Funding
after the first 12 month budget period of an approved multi-year project is non-competitive and subject to availability
of funds. (see Part E for further information) 




Phase I: 

The purpose of Phase I is to conduct the research and planning needed to identify environmental impacts to Indian lands
caused by Department of Defense activities on or near Indian lands and to plan for remedial investigations to determine
and carry out a preliminary assessment of these problems. These activities may include, but not be limited to, the
following: 

 conduct site inspections to identify problems and causes related to DOD activities; 

 identify and develop approaches to handle raw data that will assist in performing comprehensive environmental
assessments of problems and causes related to DOD activities; 

 identify approaches and develop methodologies which will be used to develop the activities to be undertaken
in Phases II and III; 

 identify other Federal agency programs, if any, that must be involved in mitigation activities and their requirements;


 identify potential technical assistance and expertise required to address the activities to be undertaken
in Phases II and III; and 

 identify other Federal environmental restoration programs that could be accessed to cooperatively coordinate
and mobilize resources in addressing short and long-term activities developed under Phase III. 



Phase I should result in adequately detailed documentation of the problems and sources of help in solving them to provide
a useful basis for examining alternative mitigation approaches in Phase II. 


Phase II: 

The purpose of Phase II activities is to examine alternative approaches for mitigation of the impacts identified
in Phase I and to lead toward the mitigation design to be developed in Phase III. Phase II activities may include, but
need not be limited to the following: 

 conduct remedial investigation and/or feasibility studies as necessary; 

 plan for the design of a comprehensive mitigation strategy to address problems identified during Phase I which
address areas such as land use restoration, clean-up processes, contracting and liability concerns; regulatory
responsibilities; and resources necessary to implement clean up actions; 

 design strategies that coordinate with or are complementary to existing DOD cleanup programs such as the Defense
Environmental Restoration Program which promotes and coordinates efforts for the evaluation and cleanup of contamination
at DOD installations; 

 review possible interim remedial strategies that address immediate potential hazards to the public health
and environment in order to provide alternative measures i.e., providing alternate water supplies, removing concentrated
sources of contaminants, or constructing structures to prevent the spread of contamination; 

 identify specific types of technical assistance and management expertise required to assist in developing
specific protocols for environmental assessments, remedial investigations, feasibility studies, interim remedial
actions and strategic planning for existing and future mitigation activities; 

 review other types of assessments that need to be considered, reviewed and incorporated into the conduct and/or
design process such as: 




_estimates of clean-up cost; 
_estimate of impacts of short-term approach; 
_estimate of impacts of long-term approach; 
_cultural impacts; 
_economic impacts; 
_human health-risk impacts; and 




 document approaches and procedures which have been developed in order to negotiate with appropriate Federal
agencies for necessary cleanup action and to keep the public informed. 


In establishing the basis for a design process, particularly when there are multiple problems, the applicants may
want to consider a prioritization process as follows: 

 emergency situations that require immediate clean-up; 

 time-critical sites, i.e. sites where the situation will deteriorate if action is not taken soon; 

 projects with minimum funding requirements; 

 projects with intermediate-level funding requirements; 

 projects with maximum funding requirements. 

Achieving compliance with Federal environmental protection legislation is the driving force behind all Federal
clean-up activities. The following is a list of major Federal environmental legislation that should be recognized
in a regulatory review as all Federal, state and local regulatory requirements which could have major impacts in the
design of mitigation strategies: 

 Indian Environmental General Assistance Program Act of 1992; 

 Clean Air Act (CAA); 

 Clean Water Act (CWA); 

 Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA); 

 Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA); 

 Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 (MPRSA); 

 Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA); 

 Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA);

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941026-2-00058 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941026-2-00036 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (NWPA); 
 Comprehensive Environmental Resource Conservation and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund); 
 Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA); 
 Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA); 
 National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA); 

Other Federal legislation that should be included in the regulatory review and that should be of assistance are the
tribal specific legislative acts, such as: 
 American Indian Religious Freedom Act; 
 National Historic Preservation Act of 1991; 
 Indian Environmental Regulatory Enhancement Act of 1990; 

Other regulatory considerations could involve applicable tribal, village, state and local laws, codes, ordinances,
standards, etc. which should also be reviewed to assist in planning, the mitigation design, and development of the
comprehensive mitigation strategy. 



Phase II should result in a carefully documented examination of alternative approaches and the selection of an approach
to be used in the Phase III design process. 

Phase III: 

The purpose of Phase III is the completion of activities initiated under Phase II, the initiation of new activities
required to implement programs, and the design of on-site actions required to mitigate environmental damage from
DOD activities. 

The Phase III activities may include but need not be limited to: 

 development and implementation of a detailed management plan to: guide corrective action; resolve issues
rising from overlapping or conflicting jurisdictions; guide a cooperative and collaborative effort among all parties
to ensure there are no duplicative or conflicting regulatory requirements governing the cleanup actions; and, establish
a tribal or village framework and/or parameter(s) that will guide the negotiations process for one or multiple cleanup
actions; 

 establishment of priorities for mitigation programs when there are multiple clean-up sites; consider at
a minimum the nature of the hazard involved: such as its physical and chemical characteristics, including concentrations
and mobility of contaminants; the pathway indicating potential for contaminant transport via surface water, ground
water and air/soil, and any other indicators that are identified during the environmental assessment, including
the prioritization process identified under Phase II; 

 program design and implementation of information dissemination strategies prior to start up of on-site implementation
of mitigation program activities; 
 development of a legal and jurisdictional strategy that addresses DOD/contractor liability issues to ensure
quality, cost-effective mitigation services, and to evaluate any measures providing equitable risk between the
DOD and the remediation contractor, as well as to incorporate Tribal Employment Rights Office (TERO) and other policies
and procedures, if required; 
 design of an approval process and other processes necessary for the implementation of tribal and village codes
and regulations for current and future compliance enforcement of all mitigation actions; 
 development/design of a documentation strategy to ensure all DOD and contractor cleanup activities are conducted
and completed in a environmentally clean and safe manner for the social and economic welfare, as well as public health
of Indian and Alaska Native people and the surrounding environment; 

 development and conduct of certified training programs that will enable a local work force to become technically
capable to participate in the mitigation activities, if they so choose; and 

 conduct of any other activities deemed necessary to carry out Phase I, II and III activities. 



Phase III should result in a comprehensive plan for conducting all aspects of mitigation action contemplated. 

Phase IV: The Phase IV activities are the implementation of mitigation plans specified in the detailed plan completed
in Phase III. 



C. Eligible Applicants



The following organizations are eligible to apply: 

 Federally recognized Indian tribes; 
 Incorporated Non-Federally and State recognized Indian tribes; 
 Alaska Native villages, tribes or tribal governing bodies (IRA or traditional councils) as recognized by
the Bureau of Indian Affairs in the 

Federal Register

 Notice dated October 21, 1993; 

 nonprofit Alaska Native Regional Associations and/or Corporations with village specific projects; 

 nonprofit Native organizations in Alaska with village specific projects; 
 other tribal or village organizations or consortia of Indian tribes. 

In addition, current ANA grantees who meet the above eligibility criteria, but do not have a mitigation grant under
Program Announcement 93612-943 are also eligible to apply for a grant award under this program announcement.




D. Available Funds



Subject to availability of funds, approximately $8 million of financial assistance is available in FY 1995 under
this program announcement for eligible applicants. Any unobligated FY1994 funds would also be available for this
purpose. It is expected that about 17 awards will be made, ranging from $100 thousand to $1 million.

E. Multi-Year Projects



This announcement is soliciting applications for project periods up to 36 months. Awards, on a competitive basis,
will be for a one-year budget period, although project periods may be as long as 36 months. Funding after the 12 month
budget period of an approved multi-year project is non-competitive. The non-competitive funding for the second
and third years is contingent upon the grantee's satisfactory progress in achieving the objectives of the project
according to the approved work plan, the availability of Federal funds, compliance with the applicable statutory,
regulatory and grant requirements, and determination that continued funding is in the best interest of the Government.




F. Grantee Share of Project



Grantees must provide at least five (5) percent of the total approved cost of the project. The total approved cost of
the project is the sum of the Federal share and the non-Federal share. The non-Federal share may be met by cash or in-kind
contributions, although applicants are encouraged to meet their match requirements through cash contributions.
The funds for the match must be from a private source, or state source where the funds were not obtained from the Federal
government by the state, or a Federal source where legislation or regulation authorizes the use of these funds for
matching purposes. Therefore, a project requesting $300,000 in Federal funds (based on an award of $100,000 per budget
period), must include a match of at least $15,789 (5% total project cost). Applicants may request a waiver of the requirement
for a 5% non-Federal matching share. Since the matching requirement is very low it is not expected that waivers will
be requested. However, the procedure for requesting a waiver can be found in 45 CFR 1336, Subpart E_Financial Assistance
Provisions. 



It is the policy of ANA to apply the waiver of the non-Federal matching share requirement for the purposes of this particular
program announcement. 



G. Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs



This program is not covered by Executive Order 12372.

funds awarded, the purpose of the grant, the terms and conditions of the grant award, the effective date of the award,
the project period, the budget period, and the amount of the non-Federal matching share requirement. 


I. Review Process and Criteria 



Applications submitted by the post-marked date under this program announcement will undergo a pre-review to determine
that: 
 The applicant is eligible in accordance with the Eligible Applicants Section of this announcement. 
 The application materials submitted are sufficient to allow the panel to undertake an in-depth evaluation
(All required materials and forms are listed in the Grant Application Checklist.) 

Applications which pass the pre-review will be evaluated and rated by an independent review panel on the basis of the
evaluation criteria. These criteria are used to evaluate the quality of a proposed project, and to determine the likelihood
of its success. A proposed project should reflect the purposes stated and described in the Introduction and Program
Purpose (Section A) of this announcement. No additional weight or preference is given to applications because of
an increased number of phases proposed. Also, competition is not based on proposals of the same phase or phases but
on the merit of the application independent of phase consideration. The evaluation criteria are:

<TEXT>
 

(1) Goals and Available Resources (15 points): 

(a) The application presents specific mitigation goals related to the proposed project. It explains how the tribe
or village intend to achieve those goals identified in the application and clearly documents the involvement and
support of the community in the planning process and implementation of the proposed project. 

The above requirement can be met by the tribe or tribal organization through submission of a resolution that states
that community involvement has occurred in the project planning and will occur in the implementation of the proposed
project. 

(b) Available resources (other than ANA) which will assist and be coordinated with the project are described. These
resources may be personnel, facilities, vehicles or financial and may include other Federal and non-Federal resources.


(2) Organizational Capabilities and Qualifications (10 points): 

(a) The management and administrative structure of the applicant is explained. Evidence of the applicant's ability
to manage a project of the proposed scope is well defined. The application clearly demonstrates the successful management
of prior or current projects of similar scope by the organization and/or by the individuals designated to manage the
project. 

(b) Position descriptions or resumes of key personnel, including those of consultants, are presented. The position
descriptions and resumes relate specifically to the staff proposed in the Approach Page and in the proposed Budget
of the application. Position descriptions very clearly describe the position and its duties and clearly relate to
the personnel staffing required for implementation of the project activities. Either the position descriptions
or the resumes present the qualifications that the applicant believes are necessary for overall quality management
of the project. 

(3) Project Objectives, Approach and Activities (45 points). The Objective Work Plan in the application includes
project objectives and activities related to the long term goals for each budget period proposed and demonstrates
that these objectives and activities: 
 are measurable and/or quantifiable; 
 are based on a fully described and locally determined balanced strategy for mitigation of impacts to the environment;

 clearly relate to the tribe or village long-range goals which the project addresses; 
 can be accomplished with available or expected resources during the proposed project period; 
 indicate when the objective, and major activities under each objective will be accomplished; 
 specify who will conduct the activities under each objective; and 
 support a project that will be completed, self-sustaining, or financed by other than ANA funds at the end of
the project period. 


(4) Results or Benefits Expected (20 points). The proposed project will result in specific measurable outcomes for
each objective that will clearly contribute to the completion of the project and will help the tribe or village meet
its goals. The specific information provided in the application on expected results or benefits for each objective
is the basis upon which the outcomes can be evaluated at the end of each budget year. 


(5) Budget (10 points). There is a detailed budget provided for each budget period requested. (This is especially
necessary for multi-year applications.) The budget is fully explained. It justifies each line item in the budget
categories in Section B of the Budget Information of the application, including the applicant's non-Federal share
and its source. Sufficient cost and other detail is included and explained to facilitate the determination of cost
allowability and the relevance of these costs to the proposed project. The funds requested are appropriate and necessary
for the scope of the project. 




J. Guidance to Applicants 



The following is provided to assist applicants to develop a competitive application. 

(1) Program Guidance: 
 The Administration for Native Americans will fund projects that present the strongest prospects for meeting
the stated purposes of this program announcement. Projects will not be funded on the basis of need alone. 
 In discussing the problems being addressed in the application, relevant historical data should be included
so that the appropriateness and potential benefits of the proposed project will be better understood by the reviewers
and decision-maker.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941026-2-00062 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941026-2-00036 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 Supporting documentation, if available, should be included to provide the reviewers and decision-maker
with other relevant data to better understand the scope and magnitude of the project. 

 The applicant should provide documentation showing support for the proposed project from authorized officials,
board of directors and/or officers through a letter of support or resolution. It would be helpful, particularly for
organizations, to delineate the membership, make-up of the board of directors, and its elective procedures to assist
reviewers in determining authorized support. 

(2) Technical Guidance.

 Applicants are strongly encouraged to have someone other than the author apply the evaluation criteria in
the program announcement and to score the application prior to its submission, in order to gain a better sense of its
quality and potential competitiveness in the review process. 

 ANA will accept only one application under this program announcement from any one applicant. If an eligible
applicant sends two applications, the one with the earlier postmark will be accepted for review unless the applicant
withdraws the earlier application. 

 An application from an Indian tribe, Alaska Native Village or other eligible organization must be submitted
by the governing body of the applicant. 

 The application's Form 424 must be signed by the applicant's representative (tribal official or designate)
who can act with full authority on behalf of the applicant. 

 The Administration for Native Americans suggests that the pages of the application be numbered sequentially
from the first page and that a table of contents be provided. The page numbering, along with simple tabbing of the sections,
would be helpful and allows easy reference during the review process. 

 Two (2) copies of the application plus the original are required. 

 The Cover Page should be the first page of an application, followed by the one-page abstract. 

 Section B of the Program Narrative should be of sufficient detail as to become a guide in determining and tracking
project goals and objectives. 

 The applicant should specify the entire length of the project period on the first page of the Form 424, Block
13, not the length of the first budget period. ANA will consider the project period specified on the Form 424 as governing.


 Line 15a of the Form 424 should specify the Federal funds requested for the first Budget period, 

not the entire project period. 

 Applicants proposing multi-year projects need to describe and submit project objective workplans and activities
for each budget period. (Separate itemized budgets for the Federal and non-Federal costs should be included) 

 Applicants for multi-year projects must justify the entire time-frame of the project and also project the
expected results to be achieved in each budget period and for the total project period. 

(3) 

Projects or activities that generally will not meet the purposes of this announcement. 


 Proposals from consortia of tribes or villages that are not specific with regard to support from, and roles
of member tribes. 

 The purchase of real estate or construction. 



K. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 



Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, Pub. L. 96-511, the Department is required to submit to the Office
of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval any reporting and record keeping requirements in regulations
including program announcements. This program announcement does not contain information collection requirements
beyond those approved for ANA grant applications under the Program Narrative Statement by OMB.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE SF-424A

General Instructions



This form is designed so that application can be made for funds from one or more grant programs. In preparing the budget,
adhere to any exiting Federal grantor agency guidelines which prescribe how and whether budgeted amounts should
be separately shown for different functions or activities within the program. For some programs, grantor agencies
may require budgets to be separately shown by function or activity. For other programs, grantor agencies may require
a breakdown by function or activity. Sections A,B,C, and D should include budget estimates for the whole project except
when applying for assistance which requires Federal authorization in annual or other funding period increments.
In the latter case, Sections, A,B,C, and D should provide the budget for the first budget period (usually a year) and
Section E should present the need for Federal assistance in the subsequent budget periods. All applications should
contain a breakdown by the object class categories shown in Lines a-k of Section B.



Section A. Budget Summary Lines 1-4, Columns (a) and (b)



For applications pertaining to a 

single

 Federal grant program (Federal Domestic Assistance Catalog number ) and 

not requiring

 a functional activity breakdown, enter on Line 1 under Column (a) the catalog program title and the catalog number
in Column (b).

For applications pertaining to a 

single

 program 

requiring

 budget amounts by multiple functions or activities, enter the name of each activity or function on each line in Column
(a), and enter the catalog number in Column (b). For applications pertaining to multiple programs where none of the
programs require a breakdown by function or activity, enter the catalog program title on each line in 

Column

 (a) and the respective catalog number on each line in Column (b).

For applications pertaining to 

multiple

 programs where one or more programs 

require

 a breakdown by function or activity, prepare a separate sheet for each program requiring the breakdown. Additional
sheets should be used when one form does not provide adequate space for all breakdown of data required. However, when
more than one sheet is used, the first page should provide the summary totals by programs.



Lines 1-4 Columns (c) through (g.)





For new applications,

 leave Columns (c) and (d) blank. For each line entry in Columns (a) and (b), enter in Columns (e), (f), and (g) the appropriate
amounts of funds needed to support the project for the first funding period (usually a year).

Title:

 Voluntary Customer Survey to Implement Executive Order (E.O.) 12862.



OMB approval number: 

1006-****



Abstract: 

On September 11, 1993, President Clinton issued E.O. 12862. Among the directives of the E.O. was the requirement that
agencies ``survey customers to determine the kind and quality of services they want and their level of satisfaction
with existing services.'' As expressed in this E.O., customer satisfaction is seen as the ultimate performance indicator
for the Federal Government because it shows how well our customers are being served and what we must do to close the ``gap''
between what we provide our customers and what they want. Plans are to use a variety of voluntary ``survey instruments''
that will include both quantitative and qualitative written surveys, telephone exchanges, point-of-contact questionnaires,
focus groups, etc. 



Bureau form number: 

None.



Frequency: 

Ongoing.



Description of respondents: 

Individuals from the related water and electrical service utilities, i.e., Federal, State, and local entities,
Native Americans, universities, the press, environmental groups, the legal community, consultants, and the general
public.

they seek an informal opinion stating that the proposal effectively insulates IC Corp (the settlor of the trust) from
any violation of 49 U.S.C. 11343. The Commission here seeks comments on that issue and other related issues. 








</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In this transaction, IC Corp will acquire 100% of the stock of KCSI. The acquisition will occur as a part of a transaction
in which: (1) KCSI will effect a reorganization in which it distributes complete ownership of its financial services
and information processing operations to the holders of KCSI's common stock; and (2) IC Corp will place its stock in
its subsidiary, ICRR, rather than the carrier to be acquired (KCSR) or its parent (KCSI), into an independent voting
trust. 



IC Corp proposes to acquire KCSI, which controls KCSR, without Commission authority. Section 11343 (49 U.S.C. 11343),
the provision governing consolidations, mergers, and acquisition of control, requires that Commission authority
be obtained for the acquisition of control of a carrier by any number of carriers or the acquisition of control of at
least two carriers by a person that is not a carrier. After IC Corp places its shares of ICRR stock into trust, the holding
company will immediately acquire control of KCSR. Applicants state that, while awaiting approval of the transaction
by the Commission, ICRR and KCSR will be operated independently. The parties anticipate that the independent voting
trust will terminate upon approval of common control by the Commission. 


In connection with the placement of ICRR stock into the voting trust, certain major personnel changes will be effected:
(1) IC Corp's and ICRR's current chairman of the board, president/Chief Executive Officer/director, and chief financial
officer will resign their positions with ICRR and assume identical positions at KCSR, but will retain their positions
with IC Corp; (2) their positions at ICRR will be filled, respectively, by ICRR's current senior vice president_marketing,
senior vice president_operations, and controller; (3) all ICRR officers who will remain with ICRR, and who presently
occupy positions with IC Corp, will resign from their positions with the holding company; and (4) several outside
directors will resign their positions on the IC Corp board and will become directors of ICRR. 

Certain shippers and labor interests have identified concerns associated with applicants' proposal. For this reason,
and because of the uniqueness of the proposal, we have decided to review it ourselves rather than delegating the matter
to agency staff. To assist us in that review, we seek public comment on: (1) whether the proposal sufficiently insulates
IC Corp from controlling ICRR prior to Commission approval of IC Corp's common control of KCSR and ICRR; (2) whether
certain conditions should be imposed on the trust arrangements; and (3) whether KCSR employees are entitled to labor
protection. Interested parties are also invited to comment on any other issues or concerns they deem relevant to the
voting trust/management plan. 

We invite interested persons to submit written comments on applicants' proposal. Comments must be filed by November
15, 1994. Applicants may reply by November 25, 1994.





Decided: October 19, 1994.





By the Commission, Chairman McDonald, Vice Chairman Phillips, and Commissioners Simmons, Morgan, and Owen. Vice
Chairman Phillips recused herself in this proceeding.

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Biweekly Notice</DOCTITLE>



Applications and Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses
Involving No Significant Hazards Considerations

I. Background


Pursuant to Public Law 97-415, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission or NRC staff) is publishing
this regular biweekly notice. Public Law 97-415 revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the
Act), to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, or proposed to be issued, under a new provision
of section 189 of the Act. This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediately effective
any amendment to an operating license upon a determination by the Commission that such amendment involves no significant
hazards consideration, notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearing from any person.

This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposed to be issued from September 30, through
October 14, 1994. The last biweekly notice was published on October 12, 1994 (59 FR 51616).



Notice Of Consideration Of Issuance Of Amendments To Facility Operating Licenses, Proposed No Significant Hazards
Consideration Determination, And Opportunity For A Hearing



The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendment requests involve no significant hazards
consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance
with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an
accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination
for each amendment request is shown below. 
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. 
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received before action is taken.
Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the 

Federal Register 

a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently. 
Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register 

notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville,
Maryland from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC
Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555. The filing of requests for a hearing
and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.
By November 25, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition
for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated
by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or
petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or
an appropriate order. 
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party. 
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. 
If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held. 
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment. 
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment. 
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).
The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023 and the following message addressed
to 

(Project Director)

: petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number
of this 

Federal Register

1 and 2, Calvert County, Maryland




Date of amendments request: 

 September 23, 1994


Description of amendments request: 

The proposed amendments would revise the Unit 2 Shutdown AC Sources Technical Specifications (TSs) to allow a one-time
extension from 7 to 14 days of the allowed outage time (AOT) for the dedicated Class 1E emergency power source during
the upcoming Unit 2 1995 Refueling Outage (RFO-10). The proposed amendments would also revise the Unit 1 Control Room
Emergency Ventilation System (CREVS) TSs to provide a one-time extension from 7 to 30 days of the AOT for one train of
the CREVS to be inoperable. As noted, these extensions will be needed during the upcoming 1995 Unit 2 RFO-10 to support
the modifications scheduled for the onsite electrical distribution system in response to the Station Blackout (SBO)
Rule, 10 CFR 50.63, and the upgrade of No. 21 Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG).
The specific changes requested are: 
Unit 2 TSs 3.8.1.2 and 3.8.2.2 will include a footnote indicating that the AOT for aligning an operable emergency diesel
generator (EDG) to provide power to the emergency busses within 14 days during the Unit 2 RFO-10.
Unit 1 TS 3.7.6.1 will be modified to indicate that during the No. 21 EDG upgrade, the time to restore the No. 21 filter
train of the air conditioning unit to operable status may be extended to 30 days (for loss of emergency power only) if:
1) A temporary diesel generator is demonstrated to be available by starting it at least once per 7 days and 2) if action
1 is not met, restore compliance with the action within 7 days or be at least in hot standby within the next 6 hours and
in cold shutdown within the following 30 hours.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of issue of no significant hazards consideration
for each of the proposed changes, which is presented below:



In relation to the requested changes to the Unit 2 TSs: 

1. Would not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

Requiring one Class 1E Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) to be available for a shutdown unit ensures that AC power will
be available for a loss of offsite power event, a boron dilution event, or a fuel handling incident. There is a very low
probability that a loss of offsite power will occur due to severe weather or inadvertent damage to the switchyard during
the 14-day period that the temporary splice box is being installed and No. 12 EDG is out-of-service. The Calvert Cliffs
offsite power supply is highly redundant and has significant capability in withstanding severe weather events,
such as tornadoes. In addition, Calvert Cliffs Emergency Response Plan Implementation Procedures requires that
certain actions be taken, up to and including shutdown of both units, on the approach of a severe storm, such as a hurricane.
The probability of a loss of offsite power is maintained low by prohibiting planned maintenance on two of the three
500 kV transmission lines and associated relaying and devices within the switchyard. Availability of the required
offsite power sources will be verified once per shift. In addition to the offsite power sources, a temporary diesel
generator will also be installed to provide a backup onsite power source with the capacity to support the safety-related
loads of the shutdown unit.

The boron dilution event and the fuel handling incident are the only two accidents that are explicitly analyzed in
the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report for a shutdown unit. The potential accident precursors such as core alterations,
positive reactivity insertions, movement of irradiated fuel and movement of heavy loads over irradiated fuel, will
be prohibited while No. 12 EDG is out-of-service for the temporary splice box installation. Therefore the probability
of a boron dilution event or fuel handling incident is decreased during the operations allowed by this change. The
requirement to maintain containment penetration closure ensures that the consequences of an accident would not
be significantly increased.
 
Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.

2. Would not create the possibility of a new or different type of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

A temporary diesel generator is being installed onto a 4 kV bus of the shutdown unit while the dedicated EDG for this
unit is transferred to the operating unit for up to 14 days. This is an extension of the same configuration allowed by
Action Statements 3.8.1.2.b and 3.8.2.2.b with additional provision taken for the Control Room Emergency Ventilation
System (CREVS). The EDGs will be aligned so that each train of the CREVS will have an emergency power supply available.
The proposed change has been evaluated and it has been determined that it does not impair any existing safety-related
equipment needed to maintain the unit in a safe shutdown condition, and does not create any new accident initiators.
The operation of the temporary diesel generator is familiar to the operators and is not significantly different from
typical operator activities.

Therefore, the proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different type of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.

3. Would not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The safety function provided by the AC electrical power sources and associated distribution systems for a shutdown
unit is to ensure that the unit can be maintained in a safe shutdown condition, and there is sufficient instrumentation
and control capability available for monitoring and maintaining the unit status. The proposed change would allow
the shutdown unit to be without a dedicated Class 1E emergency power source for up to 14 days. This is an extension of
the outage time of seven days allowed by the Technical Specifications for performing maintenance and inspections
on No. 12 EDG. This proposed change will have no impact on the offsite power sources.

Several compensatory measures will be taken during this period to ensure that a power source will be available for
the shutdown unit. These measures include requiring that two offsite power sources are available, and a temporary
diesel generator will be installed capable of supplying the loads necessary to maintain the unit in a safe condition.
In addition, Technical Specifications require several compensatory measures to reduce the potential for a fuel
handling incident and a boron dilution event. These measures include prohibiting positive reactivity changes,
suspending core alterations, movement of irradiated fuel, and the movement of heavy loads over irradiated fuel.
Establishing containment penetration closure further ensures that adequate margin of safety is maintained. In
addition, reduced inventory conditions of the Reactor Coolant System will be prohibited during the 14-day period.
 
Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

In relation to the requested changes in the Unit 1 TSs:

1. Would not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The Control Room Emergency Ventilation System (CREVS) is designed so that the Control Room can be occupied under all
plant conditions. The CREVS is required to maintain the Control Room temperature and to filter the Control Room air
in the event of a radioactive release. When No. 21 Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) is being upgraded, No. 12 CREVS
will be without a Class 1E emergency power source. The CREVS is not an initiator in any previously evaluated accidents.
Therefore, the proposed change does not involve an increase in the probability of an accident previously evaluated.

The CREVS is required to maintain the Control Room habitable following a radioactive release from a loss of coolant
accident, a main steam break, or a steam generator tube rupture. There is a very low probability of an event occurring
requiring Control Room isolation during the 30-day period that it will take to upgrade No. 21 EDG. Requiring that the
CREVS have both a normal power source and an emergency power source available ensures that one train of the system will
be available so that the Control Room can be occupied under these conditions. The probability of a loss of offsite power
is very low due to the highly redundant design of the offsite power supply. Planned maintenance on three of the offsite
power supplies and associated relaying and devices within the switchyard will be prohibited during the upgrade period
to maintain the low probability of a loss of offsite power event. Number 12 CREVS train will continue to have its normal
power source for all but approximately four days when the bus will be de-energized to allow bus work that is necessary
to the tie-in of the Alternate AC diesel generator. Number 11 CREVS will have both its normal and emergency power supply
available and this train is capable of maintaining the Control Room habitable. In addition, a temporary diesel generator
will be installed to provide assurance that an emergency power source will be available to No. 12 CREVS. The compensatory
measures that will be taken during this period will ensure that the proposed change does not involve a significant
increase in the consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.

2. Would not create the possibility of a new or different type of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

The CREVS is not being modified by this proposed change. The system will continue to operate in the same manner. Number
21 EDG will operate in a similar manner after the upgrade and will be able to support unit operation after all the testing
is completed. The installation of the temporary diesel generator during the upgrade period has been evaluated to
ensure that it does not create any new accident initiators. 

Therefore, the proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different type of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.

3. Would not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The operability of the CREVS during Modes 1 through 4 ensures that the Control Room will remain habitable under all
plant conditions. The proposed change does not affect the function of the CREVS. The proposed change will allow one
train of the CREVS to be without a Class 1E emergency power supply for up to 30 days. This train will have the normal power
supply available for all but approximately four days to allow necessary bus work. The other train of the CREVS will
have both its normal and emergency power supplies during this period. Compensatory measures that will be taken include
prohibiting planned maintenance on the required offsite power sources and installing a temporary diesel generator
of sufficient capacity as a backup to the affected train. These measures will maintain the current margin of safety.
The upgrade to the existing EDGs will provide additional margin for the electrical loading of 4 kV safety-related
busses. The completion of the No. 21 EDG upgrade will improve the margin of safety for the onsite electrical distribution
system.

Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendments request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

Boston Edison Company, Docket No. 50-293, Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station, Plymouth County, Massachusetts




Date of amendment request: 

September 6, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment changes the Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station Technical Specifications Sections 3.7.B.1.a,
3.7.B.1.c, 3.7.B.1.e, 3.7.B.2.a, and 3.7.B.2.c. The proposed changes also add new sections 3.7.B.1.f and 3.7.B.2.e.
These sections require both trains of the Standby Gas Treatment (SGTS) and Control Room High Efficiency Air Filtration
(CRHEAF) System to be operable for the initiation of fuel movement and during fuel handling operations involving
irradiated fuel. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. The operation of Pilgrim Station in accordance with the proposed amendment will not involve a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

Technical Specifications 3.7.B.1 and 3.7.B.2.e restrict the movement of irradiated fuel when only one train of SGTS
or one train of CRHEAF are operable. Irradiated fuel movement may not begin and may only continue for seven days when
the Limiting Condition of Operation is entered.

Removing these restrictions during refueling operations does not involve a significant increase in the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated because compensatory measures will be in place.
 
When sections 3.7.B.1.f and 3.7.B.2.e are invoked fuel movement will not commence until 5 days following plant shutdown
and reactor vessel will be flooded-up to elevation 114''. The 5 day period provides decay-time before irradiated
fuel movement begins. Flooding-up elevation 114'' provides an enlarged inventory reducing the possibility of a
loss-of-coolant event exposing fuel such that radioactive gasses are produced, an event SGTS and CRHEAF are designed
to mitigate.

Other compensatory measures include requiring the SBO [station blackout] diesel or the shutdown transformer to
be operable prior to and during the fuel movement. This adds defense-in-depth by making available another power supply
to the in-service safety-related bus. Also, the substitution of a non-safety power supply to the SGTS and CRHEAF ``inoperable''
systems while their safety-grade bus is out-of-service for maintenance will provide offsite power to the ``inoperable''
train. While this electrical supply is not safety-grade, it is reliable and capable of powering the SGTS and CRHEAF
systems. The components of the ``inoperable'' trains will be available with power from an alternate power source.
The compensatory connection to the non-safety grade bus gives added confidence these trains can perform the design
function although they are not ``operable'' as defined by Technical Specifications.

Operating Pilgrim in accordance with this proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability
or consequence of an accident previously analyzed because compensatory measures will be in force to: restrict the
commencement of irradiated fuel handling or new fuel handling over the spent fuel or core until 5 days following reactor
shutdown; provide a reliable source of power to the ``inoperable'' SGTS and CRHEAF systems; provide an enlarged coolant
inventory to protect irradiated fuel from the effects of an inadvertent draindown of the vessel; and provide an additional
source of emergency power to the active SGTS and CRHEAF systems by ensuring the operability of the SBO diesel generator
or the Shutdown Transformer.

2. The operation of Pilgrim Station in accordance with the proposed amendment will not create the possibility of a
new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

Planned maintenance activities require removing a safety-related bus and emergency diesel generator powering
a train of SGTS and CRHEAF from service. The redundant trains are not affected. The affected trains of SGTS and CRHEAF
will be connected to a non-safety bus, allowing them to operate but not allowing them to be considered operable under
the purview of Technical Specifications. The proposed change allows refueling activities to commence with one train
of SGTS and CRHEAF fully operable and the other train available but not powered by its safety grade bus and associated
emergency diesel generator. Compensatory measures will be in effect during refueling activities involving this
configuration. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from the fuel-drop
accident previously analyzed. Therefore, operating Pilgrim in accordance with this change will not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously analyzed.

3. The operation of Pilgrim Station in accordance with the proposed amendment will not involve a significant reduction
in the margin of safety.
 
SGTS and CRHEAF contribute to the margin of safety during fuel handling by mitigating the consequences of a fuel-handling
event. Allowing an exception to the requirement of both trains of SGTS and CRHEAF operable prior to or during fuel movement
activities does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety because the first line of defense, the
other SGTS and CRHEAF trains, will be operable. The redundant trains will also be powered and operable in all ways except
the ``operable'' concept required by Technical Specification.

Hence, the actual condition of the equipment allows it to meet its design function except under the strict Technical
Specification interpretation of operable, and the described compensatory measures that will be in effect when the
exception is employed, constrain the potential impact on the margin of safety caused by using the exception; therefore,
operating Pilgrim in accordance with this proposed Technical Specification request does not involve a significant
reduction in the margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

Boston Edison Company, Docket No. 50-293, Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station, Plymouth County, Massachusetts




Date of amendment request: 

September 6, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would reduce the Reactor Pressure Setpoint at which the shutdown cooling system automatically
isolates. This setpoint also isolates the low pressure coolant injection valves when the shutdown cooling system
is in operation.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. The operation of Pilgrim Station in accordance with the proposed amendment will not involve a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

Technical Specification Table 3.2.A lists the instrumentation that initiates primary containment isolation and
also lists the trip level setting (setpoints) for that instrumentation. The setpoint for reactor high pressure is
presently [less than or equal to] 110 psig which was selected to provide protection for the RHR [residual heat removal]
low pressure suction piping against possible overpressurization. This signal initiates a group 3 containment isolation
by closing the shutdown cooling isolation valves and the Low Pressure Coolant Injection (LPCI) valves. To provide
an optimal solution to address Generic Letter 89-10, the motor-operated valves which effect the isolation of the
RHR suction piping (MO1001-47 and MO1001-50) are being modified based on a lower differential pressure in the design
calculations. The setpoint is being reduced to ensure plant operation is maintained in accordance with the new design
and to continue to provide the protection necessary against overpressurization. This does not involve an increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed because reducing the setpoint to less than
what the technical specifications currently requires is a change in the conservative direction relative to protection
of the piping. The LPCI injection valves are designed for higher pressures and the proposed setpoint change does not
involve an increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

Technical Specification Table 3.2.B lists instrumentation that initiates or controls the core and containment
cooling systems and also lists the trip level settings (setpoints) for that instrumentation. The setpoint for reactor
low pressure [less than or equal to] 110 psig, is a permissive for the group 3 isolation of the RHR inboard injection
valves. Reducing the setpoint to [less than or equal to] 76 psig is consistent with the design of the other group 3 isolation
valves that receive the same signal and accomplishes the isolation of the shutdown cooling system when there is a system
breach. Thus, revising this setpoint does not increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.

2. The operation of Pilgrim Station in accordance with the proposed amendment will not create the possibility of a
new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

The proposed setpoint change supports modifications made to the shutdown cooling isolation valves to provide additional
margin to address Generic Letter 89-10 concerns. Reducing the setpoint for this function continues to provide protection
of the RHR suction piping and ensures closure of the isolation valves. Therefore, revising the reactor high pressure
setpoint to [less than or equal to] 76 psig for instrumentation that initiates primary containment isolation (Table
3.2.A) does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident previously evaluated. Similarly, the
revision of the reactor low pressure setpoint to [less than or equal to] 76 psig for instrumentation that initiates
or controls the core and containment cooling systems does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident
from any accident previously evaluated.

3. The operation of Pilgrim Station in accordance with the proposed amendment will not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety. 
The purpose of the setpoint for reactor pressure in Table 3.2.A and 3.2.B is to provide protection for the RHR suction
piping and ensure proper isolation for unlikely piping breaches. Changing the setpoint to a lower value is consistent
with modifications being made to the shutdown cooling isolation valves. The margin of safety for this setpoint was
established to protect the RHR suction piping from overpressurization and to ensure that primary containment integrity
could be established by the isolation valves on a Group 3 isolation. A margin of safety for protecting the RHR suction
piping exists due to the difference between the design pressure of the piping and the setpoint specified in the technical
specifications. Reducing the setpoint increases the difference between the design pressure of the piping and the
setpoint hence, this margin of safety is increased. The margin of safety established for primary containment isolation
valves is maintained by specifying a setpoint which corresponds to the closing differential pressure of the valves
under postulated accident conditions. The setpoint change does not reduce the design margins established to ensure
the valves perform their design isolation function when required. The low pressure coolant injection valves that
receive this same signal are designed for higher pressures than the current setpoint of [less than or equal to] 110
psig and, therefore, a lower setpoint increases the margin of safety. Thus, the proposed amendment does not involve
a significant reduction in a margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

Boston Edison Company, Docket No. 50-293, Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station, Plymouth County, Massachusetts




Date of amendment request: 

September 6, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would remove Technical Specification section 4.5.H.4, a section which requires the testing
and calibration of pressure switches in certain emergency core cooling system (ECCS) lines.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. The Operation of Pilgrim Station in accordance with the proposed amendment will not involve a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. [***].

The discharge piping for ECC systems is maintained filled to prevent water hammer during automatic pump starts. Monthly
venting is the primary means of ensuring filled discharge piping. The pressure switches are an adjunct to such venting.
Hence, piping in the Core Spray System, the Low Pressure Coolant Injection System (LPCI), the High Pressure Coolant
Injection (HPCI) system, and the Reactor Core Isolation Coolant (RCIC) system are all equipped with pressure switches
that detect pressure decay in the discharge piping of these systems.

This proposed change does not change Pilgrim's configuration or equipment. The switches perform a surveillance
function and do not provide a signal needed to prevent or mitigate an accident. The switches will continue to perform
their surveillance function and their surveillance and calibration will be performed in accordance with Pilgrim
procedures. Removal of section 4.5.H.4 eliminates the possibility of inoperable switches forcing the shutdown
of Pilgrim or the alternative of declaring an operable safety system inoperable because of its association with these
switches.

Technical Specifications will continue to require venting the discharge piping high point when the systems are configured
such that water hammer can occur. (sections 4.5.H.1, 4.5.H.2 and 4.5.H.3). Thus, the application of this proposed
change does not reduce the Technical Specifications intent of reducing the likelihood of discharge piping water
hammer. Therefore, operating Pilgrim Station in accordance with the proposed amendment will not involve a significant
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed.

2. The operation of Pilgrim Station in accordance with the proposed amendment will not create the possibility of a
new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

Section 4.5.H's purpose is to maintain the ECCS discharge piping filled to prevent water hammer. The purpose of the
pressure switches is to detect voids in ECCS discharge piping to prevent the possibility of damage due to water hammer.
These switches are not safety-related, have no automatic functions, and are not relied on to prevent or mitigate an
accident. Instead, they enhance the existing discharge pipe venting surveillance requirements by detecting void
formation in discharge pipe.

The switches will continue to perform their surveillance function through Pilgrim procedures. Venting will continue
to be required by Technical Specifications. Therefore, operating Pilgrim in accordance with this proposed change
does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated because
the proposed change does not impair the detection of conditions necessary to produce a water hammer in the discharge
piping.

3. The operation of Pilgrim Station in accordance with the proposed amendment will not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety.

The discharge piping pressure switches are surveillance instruments and act as a secondary means of protecting the
discharge piping from conditions that can produce water hammer. They are not relied on to prevent or mitigate accidents.
Hence, these switches do not significantly impact safety because they are not the primary means of preventing discharge
piping water hammer. Therefore, removing the pressure switches from Technical Specifications potentially contributes
to plant availability but does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety because the primary method
of detection (venting) remains and the switches will continue to be subject to procedural controls. 

This proposed change has been reviewed and recommended for approval by the Operations Review Committee and reviewed
by the Nuclear Safety Review and Audit Committee.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

September 6, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would relocate the alarms for the drywell to suppression chamber vacuum breakers to a different
annunciator panel. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
 


1. The operation of Pilgrim Station in accordance with the proposed amendment will not involve a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously identified.

The proposed change relocates annunciators in the control room but does not change their designed function or setpoint.
 
The Annunciator System is non-safety related and performs no direct safety function. No accident initiators are
being affected by this proposed change. Accident mitigating systems remain operable, and accident scenarios are
unaffected.

2. The operation of Pilgrim Station in accordance with the proposed amendment will not create the possibility of a
new or different kind of accident from any accident previously analyzed.

Relocating the Drywell to Suppression Chamber annunciator from one control room panel to another does not create
the possibility of a new or different kind of accident. This modification does not modify the setpoints or functions
of the annunciators. Hence, it is administrative and proposed to allow relocation which is currently constrained
by the current Technical Specifications level of detail.

3. The operation of Pilgrim Station in accordance with the proposed amendment will not involve a significant reduction
in the margin of safety. 

The equipment being relocated is non-safety related and its relocation does not impact the margin of safety. This
relocation is proposed to enhance the operator's ability to identify and analyze abnormal events.

revised TS 6.3.1 to include generic descriptions of personnel who fulfill the responsibilities of a radiation protection
manager. This supplements the information that was published in the Federal Register on August 3, 1994 (59 FR 39581).


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 


A. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.
 
The proposed changes to Section 6 of Technical Specifications do not affect any accident initiators or precursors
and do not change or alter the design assumptions for the systems or components used to mitigate the consequences of
an accident.

The proposed changes are administrative in nature and provide clarification. These changes provide consistency
with station procedures, programs, the Code of Federal Regulations, other Technical Specifications, and Standard
Technical Specifications. These changes do not impact any accident previously evaluated in the Updated Final Safety
Analysis Report.

B. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.

The proposed changes do not affect the design or operation of any system, structure, or component in the plant. There
are no changes to parameters governing plant operation; no new or different type of equipment will be installed. The
proposed changes are considered to be administrative changes. All responsibilities described in Technical Specifications
for management activities will continue to be performed by qualified individuals.

C. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The proposed changes do not affect the margin of safety for any Technical Specification. The initial conditions and
methodologies used in the accident analyses remain unchanged, therefore, accident analysis results are not impacted.

The proposed changes are administrative in nature and have no impact on the margin of safety of any Technical Specification.
They do not affect any plant safety parameters or setpoints. The descriptions for the Shift Technical Advisor and
Shift Engineer are clarified, however, include no reduction to their responsibilities. 



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

September 13, 1994
Description of amendment request: The amendments replace Containment Systems technical specification (TS) 3.6.2.2,
``Spray Additive System'' with a new Emergency Core Cooling Systems TS 3.5.5, ``ECCS Recirculation Fluid pH Control
System.''


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. The proposed change involves replacement of concentrated NaOH injected via the containment spray system
with trisodium phosphate (TSP) stored in the containment and dissolved in the sump recirculation solution to maintain
acceptable post accident spray/recirculation solution chemistry. Deletion of the concentrated NaOH will eliminate
a personnel hazard. The pH control system functions in response to an accident and does not involve or have any effect
on any initiating event for any accident previously evaluated. Operation under the proposed amendment will continue
to ensure that iodine potentially released post-LOCA is retained in the sump solution, and resultant offsite and
control room thyroid doses are within the limits of 10 CFR 100 and 10 CFR 50, Appendix A, General Design Criterion 19,
respectively.

2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. The deleted equipment is isolated from the remaining equipment by blind flanges, locked closed valves,
cut and capped piping, determinated and/or spared cables; and interfaces are analyzed to ensure the remaining required
equipment meets applicable original design requirements. The new equipment (TSP and baskets) is a passive pH control
system and is supported and analyzed to ensure there are no adverse interfaces (e.g. pipe break, jet impingement,
seismic) with existing equipment, systems, or structures. 
3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The slight change in recirculation
solution pH maintains adequate protection against chloride induced stress corrosion cracking of austenitic stainless
steel and maintains the capability of the solution to retain iodine. It results in an insignificant increase in the
post-accident rate of hydrogen generation, which remains well within the existing capacity of the hydrogen recombiners.
The increased mass in the containment will have no significant impact on post-accident flood levels, recirculation
solution boron concentration, or peak clad temperatures. No other operating parameters for systems, structures,
or components assumed to operate in the safety analysis are changed. The offsite and control room doses meet the limits
of 10 CFR 100 and GDC 19 respectively. Because the trisodium phosphate is nonvolatile and the baskets are protected
with solid covers and are located slightly above the floor in the containment where access is strictly controlled,
a surveillance interval of once per refueling outage provides assurance that the TSP will be available when required.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

the necessary changes to the license condition wording. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant increase in
the probability of occurrence or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The proposed revision to the
Facility Operating License does not affect the safety analysis and does not involve any physical changes to the plant,
nor any changes in the format or restraints on plant operations, and only contemplates a change to the Plan for the Long

increase the probability of previously analyzed accidents because it involves no direct plant modification or change
in operation, and hence, it is also unrelated to the possibility of increasing the consequences of previously analyzed
accidents.

2. Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not create the possibility of a new or
different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. The proposed revision to the Facility Operating License
does not affect the safety analysis and does not involve any physical changes to the plant, nor any changes in the format

Nebraska Public Power District, Docket No. 50-298, Cooper Nuclear Station, Nemaha County, Nebraska




Date of amendment request: 

September 26, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise the Cooper Nuclear Station (CNS) Technical Specifications, Section 3.5.C ``HPCI
System,'' to increase the minimum pressure at which the High Pressure Coolant Injection (HPCI) System is required
to be OPERABLE from greater than 113 psig to greater than 150 psig.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. Does the proposed license amendment involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated?



Evaluation

The change in the reactor vessel pressure at which the High Pressure Coolant Injection (HPCI) System must be operable
from 
113 psig to 150 psig will not result in a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. The HPCI System is designed to provide adequate reactor vessel coolant injection for small break accidents
where the reactor vessel remains pressurized. Therefore, the HPCI System provides a means of responding to previously
analyzed accidents. Changing the lower bound reactor vessel pressure limit at which the HPCI System must be operable
does not affect any of the accident initiation sequences previously analyzed, and therefore this proposed change
will not result in an increase in the probability of any accident previously analyzed.

The change in the required pressure at which the HPCI System must be operable from 113 psig to 150 psig will not involve
a significant increase in the consequences of any accident previously evaluated. Increasing this minimum pressure
at which the HPCI System must be OPERABLE will not affect the availability of other systems which provide standby core
cooling. The CNS Core Standby Cooling Systems (CSCS), which consist of the HPCI System, the Automatic Depressurization
System (ADS), the Low Pressure Coolant Injection (LPCI) System, and the Core Spray (CS) System, are designed to cover
the spectrum of loss-of-coolant accidents. For large break events, the reactor vessel will depressurize below the
point where the HPCI System is OPERABLE, and single failure proof core cooling is provided by a combination of the LPCI
and CS systems. For small break events wherein the reactor vessel does not rapidly depressurize, the HPCI System is
designed to provide core cooling with a reactor vessel pressure range of 1120 psig to 150 psig. Upon failure of the HPCI
System to provide adequate core cooling, the ADS in conjunction with the LPCI and CS systems provide single failure
proof assurance of adequate core cooling. The Low Pressure Systems (LPCI and CS) are designed and required to provide
core cooling at reactor pressures below 150 psig.

The District performed calculations which have determined that the low pressure Core Standby Cooling systems are
capable of providing adequate core cooling with a reactor pressure of 150 psig under the most degraded pump conditions,
i.e., pump performance at minimum Technical Specifications requirements. Additionally, the District reviewed
applicable engineering calculations to ensure that no calculations were relying on the HPCI System to provide degraded
flow to the reactor vessel during any accident scenario or transient. Based on the diverse means of providing adequate
core cooling for the spectrum of loss-of-coolant accidents, and the capability of the low pressure core cooling systems
to provide adequate core cooling at 150 psig and below, changing the required pressure at which HPCI must be operable
from 113 psig to 150 psig will not change the capability to provide adequate core cooling following postulated events.

The proposed changes do not alter the conditions or assumptions in any of the Updated Safety Analysis Report (USAR)
accident analyses. Since the USAR accident analyses remain bounding, the radiological consequences previously
evaluated are not adversely affected by the proposed changes. Therefore, it can be concluded
that the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.



2.Does the proposed License Amendment create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated?



Evaluation

The proposed changes introduce no new failure modes for any plant system or component important to safety nor has any
new limiting failure been identified as a result of the proposed changes. Increasing the minimum reactor pressure
at which the HPCI System is required to be OPERABLE will not cause an unplanned initiation of the HPCI System or any other
plant system or equipment, nor will the change impede the initiation of any required safety system. The HPCI System
relies on the containment suppression pool, emergency condensate storage tanks, plant D.C. electrical system,
and the reactor low water level and high drywell pressure instrumentation to adequately operate. The proposed increase
in the minimum reactor pressure at which the HPCI System would be required OPERABLE will not affect the equipment of
these systems, nor will the change affect the physical configuration of the HPCI System. There will be no change in
the types or increase in the amount of effluents released offsite. Therefore, the proposed change does not create
the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.



3. Does the proposed change create a significant reduction in the margin of safety?



Evaluation

Changing the reactor vessel pressure at which the HPCI System must be OPERABLE from 113 psig to 150 psig will not constitute
a significant reduction in the margin of safety. As stated in the Technical Specifications Bases Section 3.5.C, the
HPCI System is designed to provide rated cooling water flow for reactor pressures ranging from 1120 psig to 150 psig.
The HPCI is not designed to provide rated cooling water flow at reactor pressures below 150 psig. At reactor operating
pressures below 150 psig, the low pressure core cooling systems are required to be available, are capable of fulfilling
their functions, and provide the required flow in the low pressure regions below 150 psig. Additionally, the combination
of the ADS, LPCI and CS systems provide additional means of providing adequate core cooling at any reactor pressure.
Therefore the proposed change to increase the minimum reactor pressure at which the HPCI System is required to be operable
to greater than 150 psig will not significantly reduce the margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Northeast Nuclear Energy Company (NNECO), Docket No. 50-245, Millstone Nuclear Power Station, Unit 1, New London
County, Connecticut




Date of amendment request: 

September 9, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed revision to the Technical Specifications would delete the requirement for a special test of the alternate
train when one train is inoperable.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



NNECO has reviewed the proposed changes in accordance with 10CFR50.92 and concludes that the changes do not involve
a significant hazards consideration (SHC). The basis for this conclusion is that the three criteria of 10CFR50.92(c)
are not compromised. The proposed changes do not involve an SHC because the changes would not:

1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed.

The proposed changes do not affect the operation of the APR [automatic pressure relief] or FWCI [feedwater coolant
injection] subsystems, nor the SBGT [standby gas treatment] system. The proposed changes do not modify the required
actions described in the LCOs [limiting conditions for operation] when either one or both circuits of SBGT or an APR
valve are determined to be inoperable. The proposed changes will increase the availability of the APR subsystem by
eliminating a surveillance requirement that causes the actuation logic to be taken out of service for testing when
one valve is determined to be inoperable. The proposed changes will not affect the availability of the remaining circuit
of SBGT since testing does not remove the train from service.

Both the SBGT and APR systems function to mitigate the consequences of postulated accidents. As such, modification
to the surveillance requirements does not create a significant increase in the probability of an accident. Eliminating
the alternate train testing requirement will not significantly increase the consequences of a postulated accident.
The added assurance that the APR actuation logic is operable which is provided by Section 4.5.D.2 is not sufficient
to justify the loss of safety function during testing, or the increased risk of inadvertent operation of the APR valves
or the FWCI subsystem. While Technical Specification 4.7.B.3.c does not remove the remaining SBGT circuit from service,
reasonable assurance of operability is provided by Technical Specification 4.7.B.2.d which requires a monthly
demonstration of operability of each train of the SBGT system.

Therefore, no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed would
occur.

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed.

The proposed changes delete the requirement to demonstrate the operability of the remaining APR valves actuation
logic, the FWCI subsystem, and the alternate circuit of SBGT immediately and daily thereafter when one APR valve or
one circuit of SBGT is determined to be inoperable. The proposed changes do not add or change any equipment or logic.
The proposed changes also do not alter any system operability requirements. These changes only affect the number
of surveillance tests which must be performed. They do not affect the test methodology for any of these systems.

Since there are no changes to the function, operation, or surveillance test methodology of any of these systems, the
possibility of a new or different kind of accident is not created.

3. Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
 
The proposed changes delete the requirement to demonstrate the operability of the remaining APR valves actuation
logic, the FWCI subsystem, and the alternate circuit of SBGT immediately and
daily thereafter when one APR valve or one circuit of SBGT is determined to be inoperable. The elimination of the additional
assurance that the actuation logic for the remaining APR valves and the FWCI subsystem is operable is more than offset
by the increase in the margin of safety which is created by eliminating a requirement to remove the safety system from
service for testing. The margin of safety for the SBGT system is not significantly reduced since this system is tested
monthly in accordance with Technical Specification 4.7.B.2.d.

Assurance of operability is provided by the normal, scheduled surveillances which have been established at a sufficient
interval to provide reasonable assurance of operability. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant
reduction in the margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Canyon Nuclear Power Plant, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, San Luis Obispo County, 
California 




Date of amendment requests: 

September 20, 1994 (Reference LAR 94-08)


Description of amendment requests: 

The proposed amendments would revise the combined Technical Specifications (TS) for the Diablo Canyon Power Plant
Unit Nos. 1 and 2 to revise surveillance requirements (SRs) as recommended by NRC Generic Letter (GL) 93-05, ``Line-Item
Technical Specification Improvements to Reduce Surveillance Requirements for Testing During Power Operation.''
The specific TS changes proposed are as follows:
(1) TS SR 4.1.3.1.2 would be revised to change the frequency for testing the movability of the control rods from at least
once per 31 days to at least once per 92 days.
(2) TS 3/4.3.2, Table 4.3-2, ``Engineered Safety Features Actuation System Instrumentation Surveillance Requirements,''
Functional Unit 3.c.4), and TS 3/4.3.3.1, Table 4.3-3, ``Radiation Monitoring Instrumentation for Plant Operations
SRs,'' would be revised to change the monthly channel functional test to a quarterly channel functional test.
(3) The proposed changes to TS 3/4.5.1 are as follows: (a)TS SR 4.5.1.1a.1) would be revised to more clearly state that
the accumulator water volume and pressure must be verified to be within their limits. (b) TS SR 4.5.1.1b. would be revised
to specify that the boron concentration surveillance is not required to be performed if the accumulator makeup source
was the refueling water storage tank (RWST). (c) TS SR 4.5.1.2 would be relocated to plant procedures.
(4) TS SR 4.5.2c.2) would be revised to clarify that a separate containment entry to verify the absence of loose debris
is not required after each containment entry.
(5) TS SR 4.6.2.1d. would be revised to change the frequency for a containment spray header flow test from at least once
per 5 years to at least once per 10 years.
(6) TS SR 4.6.4.2a. would be revised to change the verification of the minimum hydrogen recombiner sheath temperature
from at least once per 6 months to at least once each refueling interval. 
(7) TS SR 4.7.1.2.1 would be revised to change the surveillance frequency for testing each auxiliary feedwater (AFW)
pump from at least once per 31 days to at least once per 92 days on a staggered test basis. 
(8) TS SR 4.10.1.2 would be revised to lengthen the allowed period of time for a rod drop test from 24 hours to 7 days prior
to reducing shutdown margin to less than the limits of TS 3.1.1.1.
(9) TS SR 4.11.2.6 would be revised to change the surveillance frequency from 24 hours to 7 days when radioactive material
is being added to the gas decay tanks and to add a requirement to monitor radioactive material concentrations in the
gas decay tanks at least once per 24 hours when system degassing operations are in progress.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



a. Does the change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?

The changes proposed in this LAR [license amendment request] are consistent with the guidance provided in GL 93-05.
The proposed changes eliminate testing that is likely to cause transients or excessive wear of equipment. An evaluation
of these changes indicates that they result in a net benefit to plant safety. The evaluation considered: 
(i) Unavailability of safety equipment due to testing
(ii) Initiation of significant transients due to testing
(iii) Actuation of engineered safety features that unnecessarily cycle safety equipment
(iv) Importance to safety of that system or component
(v) Failure rate of that system or component
(vi) Effectiveness of the test in discovering the failure

As a result of the decrease in the testing frequencies, the risk of testing causing a transient and equipment degradation
will be decreased, and the reliability of the equipment will not be significantly decreased.

Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.

b. Does the change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?

The proposed changes do not affect the method of operating any equipment at DCPP. Additionally, the proposed changes
do not result in a physical modification to any plant equipment.

Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated. 

c. Does the change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?

The proposed changes affect the surveillance requirements. There is no decrease in equipment reliability by the
elimination of unnecessary testing that increases the risk of transients or equipment degradation. 
Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment requests involve no significant
hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

September 19, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed license amendment would revise Technical Specification (TS) 3/4.7.4, ``Snubbers,'' and its bases,
in accordance with NRC Generic Letter (GL) 90-09, ``Alternative Requirements for Snubber Visual Inspection Intervals
and Corrective Actions.'' One difference from GL 90-09 is that the initial inspection interval using the new criteria
would be 18 months from the conclusion of the visual inspection conducted during the recently completed refueling
outage. Additional changes to the TS would be made to ensure consistency with the revised snubber visual inspection
interval schedule.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



The proposed change has been reviewed for PNPP and has been determined not to involve a significant hazards consideration
based on the following:

1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.

Implementing the guidance recommended in a GL 90-09 will not introduce any new failure mode and will not alter any assumptions
previously made in evaluating the consequences of an accident. As stated in the GL, the proposed alternate schedule
for visual inspections of snubbers will maintain the same operability confidence level as the existing schedule.
Also, the surveillance requirements and schedule for snubbers functional testing remains the same, providing a
95 percent confidence level that 90 percent to 100 percent of the snubbers operate within the specified acceptance
limits. The proposed visual inspection schedule is separate from the functional testing and provides additional
confidence that the installed snubbers will serve their design function and are being maintained operable. The proposed
change does not affect limiting safety system settings or operating parameters, and does not modify or add any accident
initiating events or parameters. No hardware modifications are associated with these changes. Therefore, the proposed
change does not significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.

Implementing the recommendations provided in GL 90-09 does not involve any physical alterations to plant equipment,
changes to setpoints or operating parameters, nor does it involve any accident initiating event. As stated in the
GL, the alternate schedule for snubber visual inspections maintains the same confidence level as the existing schedule.
In addition to the visual inspections, functional testing of snubbers, which provides a 95 percent confidence level
that 90 percent to 100 percent of the snubbers operate within specified acceptance limits, will continue to be performed.
Since this TS change does not physically alter the plant equipment and the snubber confidence level remains the same
there will not be any new or different accident resulting from snubber failure from any accident previously evaluated.

3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The proposed change incorporates surveillance requirements for snubber visual inspection intervals that are consistent
with the guidance provided in GL 90-09. As stated in the GL, the proposed snubber visual inspection interval maintains
the same confidence level as the existing snubber visual inspection interval. This surveillance requirement does
not alter the current Limiting Condition for Operation or the accompanying actions for the snubber(s). The requirement
for functional testing of safety-related snubbers is unchanged and remains the basis for the established margin
of safety and assures a 95 percent confidence level that 90 percent to 100 percent of the snubbers operate within the
specified acceptance limits. The functional testing along with the proposed visual inspection provides adequate
assurance that the snubber will perform its intended function. Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a
significant reduction in a margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Core Cooling System, Auxiliary Cooling Systems, Air Recirculation Fan Coolers, and Containment Spray,'' by incorporating
allowed outage times similar to those contained in NUREG 1431, Revision 0, ``Westinghouse Owner's Group Improved
Standard Technical Specifications,'' and by clarifying the operability requirements for the service water pumps.
The proposed changes would also clarify the completion times for placing a unit in hot or cold shutdown if a limiting
condition for operation cannot be met.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration
which is presented below:



In accordance with the requirements of 10 CFR 50.91(a), Wisconsin Electric Power Company (Licensee) has evaluated
the proposed changes against the standards of 10 CFR 50.92 and has determined that the operation of Point Beach Nuclear
Plant, Units 1 and 2, in accordance with the proposed amendments, does not present a significant hazards consideration.


A proposed facility operating license amendment does not present a significant hazards consideration if operation
of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment will not:

1. Create a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or
 
3. Will not create a significant reduction in a margin of safety.



CRITERION 1 
Operation of this facility under the proposed Technical Specifications change will not create a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The proposed changes to the allowed out of
service times have no impact on the probability of an accident occurring. This equipment being out of service is not
an initiator for any accident previously evaluated. There is no physical change to the facility, its systems or its
operation. 

The clarification of service water pump operability requirements will ensure redundant train capability to mitigate
the consequences of an accident which has been previously evaluated. Extending the allowed out of service times for
the safety injection, residual heat removal, and containment spray pumps and valves and residual heat removal heat
exchangers does not create a significant increase in the consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The proposed
changes are consistent with the Westinghouse Improved Standard Technical Specifications, NUREG 1431, Revision
0. Plant specific analysis demonstrates the proposed changes do not pose an undue risk and thus will not result in a
significant increase in the consequences of an accident.

CRITERION 2

Operation of this facility under the proposed Technical Specifications change will not create the possibility of
a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The safety injection, containment spray,
and residual heat removal pumps and valves and residual heat removal heat exchangers are used to mitigate the consequences
of an accident and are not normally in use during power operation. The availability of these components does not effect
the possibility of a new or different type of accident. The service water pumps are normally in use during power operation.
The proposed change will ensure that redundant train capability exists. Minimum service water pump requirements
remain the same. The failure modes of the service water system remain unchanged. Therefore, extending the allowed
out of service time does not create the possibility of a different type of accident than previously evaluated.

CRITERION 3

Operation of this facility under the proposed Technical Specifications change will not create a significant reduction
in a margin of safety. The proposed Technical Specification changes revise the allowed outage times for the safety
injection, residual heat removal, and containment spray pumps and valves and residual heat removal heat exchangers
to 72 hours. This change will allow more time for corrective maintenance to be performed on these components, if required,
and avoid potential transients and challenges to safety systems associated with a required shutdown of the unit without
the specific safety related equipment operable. The proposed changes are consistent with the Westinghouse Improved
Standard Technical Specifications, NUREG 1431, Revision 0. Plant specific analysis demonstrates the changes do
not pose an undue risk and thus will not result in a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The clarification to
the specification for service water pump operability may increase the margin of safety by ensuring that redundant
train capability exists.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corporation, Docket No. 50-482, Wolf Creek Generating Station, Coffey County, Kansas




Date of amendment request: 

July 15, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

This amendment would revise Technical Specification 3/4.3.3, Table 4.3-3, ``Radiation Monitoring Instrumentation
For Plant Operations Surveillance,'' to change the analog channel operational test (ACOT) interval from monthly
to quarterly for the following radiation monitors: (1) Containment Atmosphere - Gaseous Radioactivity - High (GT-RE-31
and 32); (2) Gaseous Radioactive - RCS Leakage Detection (GT-RE-31 and 32); (3) Particulate Radioactivity - RCS Leakage
Detection (GT-RE-31 and 32); (4) Fuel Building Exhaust - Gaseous Radioactivity - High (GG-RE-27 and 28); (5) Criticality
- High Radiation Level (SD-RE-37 and 38; SD-RE-35 and 36); (6) Control Room Air Intake - Gaseous Radioactivity - High
(GK-RE-04 and 05).
This proposed change is identified as a line-item improvement in Section 5.14 of Generic Letter 93-05, ``Line-Item
Technical Specifications Improvements to Reduce Surveillance Requirements for Testing During Power Operations.''


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. Involve a Significant Increase in the Probability of Consequences of an Accident Previously Evaluated

The probability of occurrence and the consequences of an accident evaluated previously in the Updated Safety Analysis
Report (USAR) are not increased due to the proposed technical specification change. Review of past ACOT history for
the affected monitors revealed that these monitors have experienced no calibration or setpoint-related problems
since the beginning of plant operation. Increasing the ACOT frequency for these monitors will not adversely affect
system operability, and this change would reduce the potential for instrument damage, thus effectively increasing
system reliability and availability. These radiation monitors are not accident-initiating equipment, so increasing
the surveillance interval on these monitors will not affect the probability of any accident previously evaluated.
In addition, for the monitors listed in TS Table 4.3-3, no credit is taken in the plant accident analyses in Chapter
15 of the USAR for any automatic actuation function generated as a result of a radiation monitor signal. On these bases
it is concluded that the probability and consequences of the accidents previously evaluated in the USAR are not increased.

2. Create the Possibility of a New or Different Kind of Accident from any Previously Evaluated

No new type of accident or malfunction will be created since the radiation monitors are not accident-initiating equipment.
The proposed change merely increases the ACOT interval for the affected radiation monitors, and does not change the
method and manner of plant operation. The safety design bases in the USAR have not been altered. Thus, this change does
not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

3. Involve a Significant Reduction in the Margin of Safety

The proposed changes do not change the plant configuration in a way that introduces a new potential hazard to the plant
and do not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The proposed changes do not affect applicable safety
analysis acceptance criteria and will not affect system operating conditions. In addition, plant operating experience
has shown that these monitors have not experienced calibration of setpoint-related failures since the beginning
of plant operation. Therefore, it is concluded that the margin of safety, as described in the bases to any technical
specification, is not reduced.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corporation, Docket No. 50-482, Wolf Creek Generating Station, Coffey County, Kansas




Date of amendment request: 

July 22, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment revises Technical Specification (TS) 6.2.2.g, 6.3.1.b, and 6.12.1.c to reflect title changes
in the Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corporation (WCNOC) organization. The title Supervisor Operations in TS 6.2.2.g
is being changed to Superintendent Operations. The title Radiation Protection Manager in TS 6.3.1.b and the title
Manager Radiation Protection in TS 6.12.1.c are being changed to Superintendent Radiation Protection. The title
changes do not represent any changes in reporting relationships, job responsibilities, or overall organizational
changes. This request supersedes a request for amendment dated April 19, 1994, which was noticed on June 22, 1994 (59
FR 32239)


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. Proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. These changes involve administrative changes to the WCNOC organization and to the position titles and
as such have no effect on plant equipment or the technical qualification of plant personnel.

2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. This change is administrative in nature and does not involve any change to the installed plant systems
or the overall operating philosophy of Wolf Creek Generating Station.

3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. This change does not involve
any changes in overall organizational commitments. A position title change alone does not reduce the margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

June 3, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

In a letter of August 13, 1993, and as supplemented on September 15, 1993, September 16, 1993, December 17, 1993, January
19, 1994, February 11, 1994, and February 24, 1994, Commonwealth Edison Company submitted requests for amendments
for steam generator (SG) tube sleeving in accordance with (1) Westinghouse and (2) Babcock & Wilcox processes.
By letter dated March 4, 1994, the NRC granted the proposed sleeving methods contingent upon four conditions which
the licensee accepted in their letter of February 24, 1994.
Three of the four changes will be reflected in the plants' Technical Specifications (TS). By letter dated June 3, 1994,
the licensee requested changes to TS 3.4.5 and 3.4.6.2 to include the three conditions, which are:

1. Amend the Byron and Braidwood licenses to reflect a primary-to-secondary leakage rate limit of 150 gallons per
day (gpd) through any one SG.
2. Amend the Byron and Braidwood licenses to reflect an inservice inspection of a minimum of 20 percent of a random sample
of the sleeves for axial and circumferential indication at the end-of-cycle. In the event that an imperfection of
40 percent or greater depth is detected, an additional 20 percent (minimum) of the unsampled sleeves should be inspected,
and if an imperfection of 40 percent or greater depth is detected in the second sample, all remaining sleeves should
be inspected. 
3. Add a condition to the Byron and Braidwood licenses to conduct additional corrosion testing to establish the design
life for the kinetically or laser welded sleeved tubes in the presence of a crevice. 
Collectively, these conditions will enable the licensee to have:

1. Further assurance that the integrity of the SGs will be maintained in the event of a main steam line break or under
loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) conditions;
2. Increased monitoring of the SG tube sleeves for any degradation; and
3. Increased confidence that SG sleeve integrity will be maintained for extended operations.

Notice Of Issuance Of Amendments To Facility Operating Licenses And Final Determination Of No Significant Hazards
Consideration And Opportunity For A Hearing (Exigent Public Announcement Or Emergency Circumstances)



During the period since publication of the last biweekly notice, the Commission has issued the following amendments.
The Commission has determined for each of these amendments that the application for the amendment complies with the
standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations.
The Commission has made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the Commission's rules and regulations in
10 CFR Chapter I, which are set forth in the license amendment. 
Because of exigent or emergency circumstances associated with the date the amendment was needed, there was not time
for the Commission to publish, for public comment before issuance, its usual 30-day Notice of Consideration of Issuance
of Amendment, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing. 
For exigent circumstances, the Commission has either issued a 

Federal Register 

notice providing opportunity for public comment or has used local media to provide notice to the public in the area
surrounding a licensee's facility of the licensee's application and of the Commission's proposed determination
of no significant hazards consideration. The Commission has provided a reasonable opportunity for the public to
comment, using its best efforts to make available to the public means of communication for the public to respond quickly,
and in the case of telephone comments, the comments have been recorded or transcribed as appropriate and the licensee
has been informed of the public comments.
In circumstances where failure to act in a timely way would have resulted, for example, in derating or shutdown of a
nuclear power plant or in prevention of either resumption of operation or of increase in power output up to the plant's
licensed power level, the Commission may not have had an opportunity to provide for public comment on its no significant
hazards consideration determination. In such case, the license amendment has been issued without opportunity for
comment. If there has been some time for public comment but less than 30 days, the Commission may provide an opportunity
for public comment. If comments have been requested, it is so stated. In either event, the State has been consulted
by telephone whenever possible.
Under its regulations, the Commission may issue and make an amendment immediately effective, notwithstanding the
pendency before it of a request for a hearing from any person, in advance of the holding and completion of any required
hearing, where it has determined that no significant hazards consideration is involved. 
The Commission has applied the standards of 10 CFR 50.92 and has made a final determination that the amendment involves
no significant hazards consideration. The basis for this determination is contained in the documents related to
this action. Accordingly, the amendments have been issued and made effective as indicated. 
Unless otherwise indicated, the Commission has determined that these amendments satisfy the criteria for categorical
exclusion in accordance with 10 CFR 51.22. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(b), no environmental impact statement
or environmental assessment need be prepared for these amendments. If the Commission has prepared an environmental
assessment under the special circumstances provision in 10 CFR 51.12(b) and has made a determination based on that
assessment, it is so indicated.
For further details with respect to the action see (1) the application for amendment, (2) the amendment to Facility
Operating License, and (3) the Commission's related letter, Safety Evaluation and/or Environmental Assessment,
as indicated. All of these items are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the
Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room for the particular
facility involved. 
The Commission is also offering an opportunity for a hearing with respect to the issuance of the amendment. By November
25, 1995, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility
operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as
a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests for
a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition
for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated
by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or
petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or
an appropriate order. 
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party. 
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. Since the Commission has made a final determination that the amendment
involves no significant hazards consideration, if a hearing is requested, it will not stay the effectiveness of the
amendment. Any hearing held would take place while the amendment is in effect. 
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).
The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023 and the following message addressed
to 

(Project Director)

: petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number
of this 

Federal Register 

notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. 
Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for a hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the factors
specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d).

Maricopa County, Arizona




Date of amendment for amendment: 

October 9, 1994, as supplemented by letter dated October 12, 1994


Brief description of amendment: 

The proposed amendment would modify Technical Specification (TS) 4.8.2.1.e, ``DC Sources - Operating'' to specify
that the provisions of TS 4.0.1 and 4.0.4 are not applicable to the battery capacity requirements until entry into
Mode 4 coming out of the fifth refueling outage or upon any deep discharge cycle of the battery. The amendment was requested
on an emergency basis so that the licensee could declare the Unit 2 batteries operable based upon the current capacities
of the batteries without having to satisfy the surveillance requirement of TS 4.8.2.1.e. The licensee will thus be
able to change modes and start up from the current mid-cycle steam generator inspection outage.

<DOCTITLE>Carolina Power & Light Company et al. Brunswick Steam Electric Plant, Units 1 and 2; Issuance of Director's Decision
Under 10 CFR 2.206</DOCTITLE>



Notice is hereby given that the Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation (NRR), has issued a Director's Decision
concerning a Petition dated October 14, 1993, filed pursuant to 10 CFR 2.206, on behalf of the National Whistleblower
Center (NWC), the Coastal Alliance for a Safe Environment (CASE), and Mr. Charles A. Webb, requesting that actions
be taken regarding the Brunswick Steam Electric Plant (Brunswick), Units 1 and 2, of the Carolina Power & Light
Company (CP&L or the Licensee). The Petition requested that (1) the NRC staff enter into a confidentiality agreement
with NWC to facilitate the release of additional information; (2) the NRC immediately require the Licensee to state
whether it has, in fact, known about cracks in the reactor core shroud since at least 1984; and (3) the Commission's
Office of Investigations determine whether CP&L management engaged in criminal wrongdoing, commencing in
1984, when CP&L is alleged to have failed to report the existence of cracks in the core shroud to the NRC. The Petition
also requested an immediate suspension of the operating license for Brunswick pending the criminal investigation.

The Petitioners based their request on allegations that (1) the Licensee falsely asserted to the NRC and to the public
that cracks in the reactor shroud were but recently discovered, and the Petitioners contend that the Licensee discovered
the cracks nine years earlier and the Licensee's management instructed the engineers who detected the cracks to prepare
paperwork that would ensure that the cracks would not be reported to the NRC; (2) this alleged coverup demonstrates
that CP&L does not have the character or integrity to operate a nuclear facility because of its unwillingness
to report significant safety problems to the NRC; and (3) the Licensee is willing to take unreasonable risks with the
health and safety of the public.

The Director of NRR has granted in part and denied in part the Petitioner's requests. The reasons are explained in the
``Director's Decision Under 10 CFR 2.206'' (DD-94-09), which is available for public inspection and
copying in the Commission's Public Document Room at 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20037, and at the Licensee's
local public document room at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington, William Madison Randall Library, 601
S. College Road, Wilmington, NC 28403-3297. 

A copy of the Decision will be filed with the Secretary of the Commission for the Commission's review in accordance
with 10 CFR 2.206(c). As provided for in 10 CFR 2.206(c), the Decision will become the final action of the Commission
25 days after the date of issuance unless the Commission on its own motion institutes a review of the Decision within
that time.

National Preparedness for Response Exercise Program (PREP)

Coast Guard, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of PREP Area Exercise Schedule for 1995, 1996 and 1997.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA),
and the Minerals Management Service (MMS), in concert with the states, the oil industry and concerned citizens, held
a workshop on May 19, 1994, to discuss the proposed Preparedness for Response Exercise Program (PREP) Area exercise
schedule and the scheduling process. This notice publishes the final revision of the Area exercise schedule for 1995,
1996, and 1997, and solicits industry members to lead Area exercises for 1995.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



Background Information 



The Coast Guard, EPA, RSPA, and MMS developed the National Preparedness for Response Exercise Program (PREP) to provide
guidelines for compliance with the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 pollution response exercise requirements (33 U.S.C.
1321 (j)). One section of the PREP focuses on Area exercises, which are designed to evaluate the entire response mechanism
in a given Area to ensure adequate pollution response preparedness. The goal of the PREP is to conduct 20 Area exercises
per year, with the intent of exercising most Areas of the country over a three year period. In the March 25, 1994, edition
of the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 14254), the Coast Guard announced the May 19, 1994, workshop to discuss the scheduling process, and proposed
an exercise schedule for 1995, 1996, and 1997. This notice sets forth the scheduling process and the finalized exercise
schedule for 1995, 1996, and 1997. 



Scheduling Process



The Area exercise scheduling process is as follows: 

1. The National Scheduling Coordinating Committee (NSCC), comprised of representatives of the Coast Guard, EPA,
RSPA, and MMS, meets in January of each year to develop a proposed Area exercise schedule for the upcoming three year
period. (For example, when the NSCC meets in 1995, the three years considered will be 1996, 1997 and 1998.) The information
in the proposed schedule includes: the exercise Area, the exercise quarter, whether the exercise is industry-led
or government-led, and the type of industry that will lead the exercise (vessel, marine transportation-related
(mtr) facility, non-marine transportation-related facility, offshore facility or pipeline). Once developed,
the proposed schedule is published in the 

Federal Register

 in February of each year. 

2. The NSCC solicits input on the proposed schedule for each three year period. The NSCC also requests industry plan
holders to lead the Area exercise or participate in the government-led Area exercises. 

3. Once comments are received by the NSCC, they are considered and acted upon, as appropriate. Where there is conflict,
every effort is made to resolve it while maintaining the integrity of the scheduling process. 



Selection of Industry Participants for Area Exercises 



The selection process for industry participants for the Area exercises is as follows: 

1. Industry response plan holders interested in leading the Area exercises or supporting the government-led Area
exercises should submit their requests directly to the USCG or EPA On-Scene Coordinator. These requests should be
submitted as soon as possible after the proposed schedule is published, but no later than 6 months prior to the proposed
exercise date. Once the OSC has chosen an industry plan holder for an exercise, the OSC will contact the NSCC in writing
to the address listed under 

ADDRESSES

 above. 

2. In Areas where no plan holders have come forth and expressed an interest in leading or participating in the Area exercises,
OSCs will recommend industry plan holders for exercise participation to the NSCC. Some issues that will be considered
when selecting industry participants include the number of times a specific industry has conducted exercises in
the past, the operating history of industries in the Area and the perceived need for a particular industry plan holder
to be exercised. The OSCs will consult with the selected industry plan holders prior to submitting their names for
exercise participation. 

3. In Areas scheduled for exercises involving pipelines or offshore facilities, the OSCs will coordinate with the
respective regulatory agency (RSPA or MMS) to select plan holders to lead or participate in these exercises. 



Scheduling Workshop 



A PREP scheduling workshop was conducted by the NSCC on May 19, 1994. Similar workshops will continue to be held annually
in May. The workshops will continue to focus primarily on the upcoming year's Area exercise schedule, but also will
address issues relating to the following two years of the triennial schedule. National level industry representation
is strongly encouraged at these workshops, as this is an opportunity for industry plan holders to comment on the schedule
and address issues which may affect them and their operations. Input from the workshops will continue to be used for
finalizing the upcoming year's schedule and proposing the schedule for the following two years. 



Final Schedule 



The following is the final PREP Schedule for Calendar Years 1995, 1996, and 1997. All of the comments received were
incorporated, as appropriate. Where no industry plan holders have come forward to either participate or lead an exercise,
the OSCs will solicit and recommend plan holders. Companies that wish to participate should contact the USCG or EPA
OSC, who will then forward the name to the NSCC at the address listed under 

ADDRESSES

. The Coast Guard will continue to publish a final schedule in the 

Federal Register

 annually in the fall.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Federal Transit Administration 
issued a notice on September 12, 1994 (59 FR 46878) seeking 
proposals and information from transit authorities, planning 
officials, States, the private sector, and the public on the 
FTA's Innovative Financing Initiative. This initiative is based 
on Executive Order 12893, ``Principles for Federal 
Infrastructure Investments,'' signed by President Clinton on 
January 26, 1994, which directs each executive department ``to 
ensure efficient management of infrastructure * * * and to 
``encourage private sector investment which is a key objective of 
our efforts to promote innovative financing.'' Accordingly, 
Department of Transportation Secretary Federico Pe&ntilde;a directed 
FTA to explore innovative ways to finance the transportation 
needs of our nation, taking into account a continuing Federal 
commitment to transit, as well as a growing private sector 
interest in transportation investment. Hence, the FTA is 
interested in identifying ways for States and localities to plan 
and execute integrated public transit investment programs. 





The original comment period would end on October 30, 1994. FTA 
is extending the comment period for an additional 60 days, in 
order to allow interested parties adequate time to formulate 
their comments and/or proposals. The comment period will now 
close on December 30, 1994. Late-filed proposals will be 
considered to the extent practicable. 






Date Issued: October 20, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Petition for Exemption From the Vehicle Theft Prevention Standard; Honda</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), DOT.





</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Grant of petition for exemption.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice grants the petition by American Honda Motor Company, Inc. (Honda) for an exemption from the parts marking
requirements of the vehicle theft prevention standard for a high theft car line whose nameplate is confidential.
This petition is granted because the agency has determined that the antitheft device to be placed on the car line as
standard equipment, is likely to be as effective in reducing and deterring motor vehicle theft as compliance with
parts marking requirements.





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In a letter dated April 29, 1994, American Honda Motor Company, Inc. (Honda) requested an exemption from the theft
prevention standard for a car line beginning from the (confidential) model year. The nameplate of the car line is also
confidential. The letter was submitted pursuant to 49 CFR part 543, 

Exemption from Vehicle Theft Prevention Standard, 

and requested an exemption from parts marking based on the installation of an antitheft device as standard equipment
for the car line. In a June 29, 1994 telephone conversation with NHTSA officials, Honda clarified the scope of its petition.



Together, Honda's April 29 letter and information provided in the June 29 telephone conversation constitute a complete
petition, as required by 49 CFR  543.7, in that it met the general requirements contained in  543.5 and
the specific content requirements of  543.6. In a letter dated May 31, 1994 to Honda, the agency granted the petitioner's
request for confidential treatment of most aspects of its petition, including the nameplate of the car line and the
model year of its introduction.

In its petition, Honda provided a detailed description and diagrams of the identity, design, and location of the components
of the antitheft device for the new car line. The antitheft device includes an engine starter interrupt function and
an alarm function. The antitheft device is activated by removing the key from the ignition and locking the driver or
passenger door with the key.

The alarm monitors the doors, hood, trunk lid, battery terminals, engine starter circuit, and battery circuit.

In order to ensure the reliability and durability of the device, Honda stated that it conducted tests, based on its
own specified standards. Honda provided a detailed list of the tests conducted, including tests for temperature
extremes, vibration, shock, and power voltage. Honda stated its belief that the device is reliable and durable since
the device complied with Honda's specified requirements for each test.

Honda compared the device proposed for its new car line with devices which NHTSA has determined to be as effective in
reducing and deterring motor vehicle theft as would compliance with the parts marking requirements.

Honda concludes that the antitheft device proposed for its new car line is not less effective than those devices in
the above car lines for which NHTSA has granted exemptions from the parts-marking requirements.

Based on this substantial evidence, the agency believes that the antitheft device for the new Honda car line is likely
to be as effective in reducing and deterring motor vehicle theft as compliance with the parts-marking requirements
of the theft prevention standard (49 CFR part 541).

The agency believes that the device will provide the types of performance listed in 49 CFR 543.6(a)(3): Promoting
activation; attracting attention to unauthorized entries; preventing defeat or circumvention of the device by
unauthorized persons; preventing operation of the vehicle by unauthorized entrants; and ensuring the reliability
and durability of the device.

As required by 49 U.S.C. 33106 and 49 CFR 543.6(a)(4), the agency also finds that Honda has provided adequate reasons
for its belief that the antitheft device will reduce and deter theft. This conclusion is based on the information Honda
provided on its device. This information included a description of reliability and functional tests conducted by
Honda for the antitheft device and its components.

For the foregoing reasons, the agency hereby exempts the Honda car line that is the subject of this notice, in whole,
from the requirements of 49 CFR part 541.

If Honda decides not to use the exemption for the car line that is the subject of this notice, it should formally notify
the agency. If such a decision is made, the car line must be fully marked according to the requirements under 49 CFR   541.5
and 541.6 (marking of major component parts and replacement parts).

NHTSA has attempted to compare the effectiveness of compliance with the theft prevention standard (parts marking)
with the effectiveness of antitheft devices. NHTSA has compared the theft rates of 17 parts-marked MY 1986 vehicle
lines, with the theft rates of the same 17 lines in MY 1991, when each line had an exemption from parts marking because
it had an antitheft device as standard equipment. Of the 17 lines reviewed, 10 experienced theft rates for MY 1991 that
were below their respective rates in MY 1986. Although the results of the data are inconclusive, it indicates a likelihood
of lower theft rates for vehicle lines that have been exempted from parts marking because they are equipped with an
antitheft device. With implementation of the requirements of the ``Anti Car Theft Act of 1992,'' NHTSA anticipates
more probative data upon which comparisons may be made.

NHTSA notes that if Honda wishes in the future to modify the device on which this exemption is based, the company may
have to submit a petition to modify the exemption. Section 543.7(d) states that a Part 543 exemption applies only to
vehicles that belong to a line exempted under this part and equipped with the antitheft device on which the line's exemption
is based. Further,  543.9(c)(2) provides for the submission of petitions ``(t)o modify an exemption to permit
the use of an antitheft device similar to but differing from the one specified in that exemption.''

The agency wishes to minimize the administrative burden which  543.9(c)(2) could place on exempted vehicle
manufacturers and itself. The agency did not intend in drafting Part 543 to require the submission of a modification
petition for every change to the components or design of an antitheft device. The significance of many such changes
could be 

de minimis

. Therefore, NHTSA suggests that if the manufacturer contemplates making any changes the effects of which might be
characterized as 

de minimis, 

it should consult the agency before preparing and submitting a petition to 
modify.
