 Rural Electrification Administration, USDA. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Rural Electrification Administration (REA) proposes to amend its interim rule regarding the State Telecommunications
Modernization Plan requirements. The proposed changes are in response to comments received from the public regarding
the interim rule. All Telephone Borrowers will be affected by this proposed rule. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Executive Order 12866 



This proposed rule has been determined to be significant and was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
under Executive Order 12866. 



Executive Order 12778 



This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. If adopted, this proposed
rule will not: (1) Preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable
conflict with this rule; (2) Have any retroactive effect; and (3) Require administrative proceedings before parties
may file suit challenging the provisions of this rule. 



Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification 



REA has determined that this proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities, as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

). The REA program provides loans to REA Borrowers at interest rates and terms that are more favorable than those generally
available from the private sector. REA Borrowers, as a result of obtaining federal financing, receive economic benefits
which ultimately offset any direct economic costs associated with complying with REA regulations and requirements.
Moreover, this action is in response to the Rural Electrification Loan Restructuring Act of 1993. 



Information Collection and Recordkeeping Requirements 



The reporting and recordkeeping requirements contained in the proposed rule have been submitted to OMB for approval
in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

). Send comments regarding this collection of information to: Department of Agriculture, Clearance Office, Office
of Information Resources Management, Room 404-W, Washington, DC 20250, and Regulatory Affairs of OMB, Attention:
Desk Officer for USDA, Room 3201, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503. 



National Environmental Policy Act Certification 



REA has determined that this proposed rule will not significantly affect the quality of the human environment as defined
by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 

et seq.

). Therefore, this action does not require an environmental impact statement or assessment. 



Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance 



The program described by this proposed rule is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Programs under
10.851, Rural Telephone Loans and Loan Guarantees, and 10.852, Rural Telephone Bank Loans. This catalog is available
on a subscription basis from the Superintendent of Documents, the United States Government Printing Office, Washington,
DC 20402-9325. 



Executive Order 12372 



This proposed rule is excluded from the scope of Executive Order 12372, Intergovernmental Consultation. A Notice
of Final Rule entitled Department Programs and Activities Excluded from Executive Order 12372 (50 FR 47034) exempts
REA and RTB loans and loan guarantees to governmental and nongovernmental entities from coverage under this Order.




Background 



On December 20, 1993, REA published an interim rule (58 FR 66250) to incorporate changes to telephone loan policies
required by the Rural Electrification Loan Restructuring Act of 1993 (RELRA) (107 Stat. 1356). RELRA amended several
provisions of the Rural Electrification Act of 1936, as amended (7 U.S.C. 901 

et seq.

) (RE Act), and mandated a restructuring of the telephone loan program. 

On April 13, 1994, REA adopted its interim rule as a final rule (59 FR 17460) with one exception, 7 CFR Part 1751, Telecommunications
System Planning and Design Criteria, and Procedures. Because of the overwhelming response and concerns regarding
the requirements of the State Telecommunications Modernization Plan (Modernization Plan), REA is proposing to
amend 7 CFR part 1751, subpart B. 

As revised, this Rule would require that Modernization Plans, at a minimum, apply to all REA borrowers. If a Modernization
Plan is developed by the PUC or the State Legislature, REA encourages, but does not require, that the Modernization
Plan's requirements apply to the rural service areas of all Telecommunications Providers. A State's decision not
to include non-REA borrowers will not prejudice REA approval of their Plan. The PUC or the State Legislature may also,
at its option, extend coverage of the Modernization Plan to all service areas of all Telecommunications Providers
in the State. In addition, while requirements contained in  1751.106 apply only to wireline services, the State
Legislature or PUC, at its discretion, may extend coverage of Modernization Plans to wireless or other communications
services in a State as it deems appropriate.

It is REA's policy that every State have a Modernization Plan which provides for the improvement of the State's Public
Switched Network. If the Plan Developer is either the State Legislature or the PUC, such entity must submit for REA
approval its Modernization Plan by a date one year from issuance of the Final Rule. After this date, if a State or its
PUC declines or fails to submit for REA approval its Modernization Plan, eligibility to develop the Plan passes to
a numeric majority of the Borrowers within the State. While there is no time limit requiring States to have an approved
plan in place, REA, as required by RELRA, will not approve any direct loans in States without such a plan. 

During the comment period, REA received 81 comments regarding the interim rule, and these comments were taken into
consideration in preparing the proposed amendments. Comments were received from the following:

1. Comment Summary: 

REA should not specify specific technologies. 



Response: 

This was a nearly unanimous comment and one with which REA concurs. REA's intent is to specify information carrying
capability, i.e., bit rate. References to specific technologies, like ISDN, have been removed. 



2. 

Many commenters asserted that REA exceeded its statutory authority in one or more of the following ways: 



a. Comment Summary: 

Congress intended State Telecommunications Modernization Plans to be guidelines. 



Response: 

Many commenters believe that the use of the word ``objectives'' in RELRA implies non-binding guidelines. REA believes
the commenters are taking the word out of context. The entire provision is as follows: 



</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941027-1-00004 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941027-1-00001 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

``REQUIREMENTS._For purposes of subparagraph (A), a telecommunications modernization plan must, at a minimum,
meet the following objectives.'' 

REA believes that an objective that must be met is mandatory. In the interim regulation (7 CFR part 1751, published
December 20, 1993), REA set forth both ``requirements'' and ``objectives'' to be contained in the Modernization
Plan. Requirements were to be binding while objectives were only goals or targets. This may have led to confusion because
both words are used in RELRA. In the proposed rule, REA has included only requirements. 



b. Comment Summary: 

REA went beyond the intent of RELRA by establishing timeframes for modernization. 



Response: 

REA set timeframes because a requirement with no due date is not a requirement. 


REA believes that advanced telecommunications services should be available to the public within a reasonable time
after they are developed. Broad experience in bringing modern telephone service to rural America teaches the value
of caution and reflection before imposing binding requirements on future business activities. Varying construction
schedules, economic conditions and rates of technological innovation affect even the most careful projections.
REA conservatively projected the reasonably expected growth of both the public's need for telecommunications services
and the ability of Telecommunications Providers and equipment manufacturers to provide those services. 

REA consulted both its past experience and its expectations of future technological development before setting
the short-, medium- and long-term deadlines in the regulation. Our experience with new technology such as buried
cable, digital switching, and fiber optic systems where the widespread deployment into the telecommunications
network took two to five years, lead us to adopt the five year phase-in concept. The timetable is achievable, given
the telecommunications services presently available, the resources of the Telecommunications Providers, and
the accelerating engineering achievements likely in the next few years. 

The regulations phase in the requirements in three steps to provide for an orderly deployment of these telecommunications
services. Facilities constructed more than one year after REA approves a Modernization Plan are required to provide
those services that can be produced by equipment now in existence. The one year delay allows for construction-in-progress
to be completed before the Modernization Plan requirements go into effect. The requirements for the medium and long
terms simply expand the coverage of the requirements so that when the long term period (11-16 years) is reached,
all subscribers will have the services deployed during the short term period available to them. 



c. Comment Summary: 

RELRA does not require that telecommunications improvements be deployed ``concurrently'' in rural and nonrural
areas but only that ``the plan must provide for uniform deployment schedules to ensure that advanced services are
deployed at the same time in rural and nonrural areas''. 




Response: 

Several commenters thought that REA intended all improvements to be made simultaneously throughout a service area.
REA understands that there is a logical order to providing improvements and that they will often happen first in nonrural
areas. REA intends that they should be deployed and available at approximately the same time in rural and nonrural
areas. For example, if digital switching technology is being deployed in a nonrural area, replacement switches in
rural areas would also employ digital technology. This does not mean that if a switch was replaced in a nonrural area,
a switch would have to be replaced in the rural area. In the proposed rule, REA has clarified this requirement. See  1751.106(a).




d. Comment Summary: 

REA has no basis for requiring either the elimination of mileage and/or zone charges or that Telecommunications Providers
adopt flexible tariffs. These issues concern rates and are not ``service standards''. 



Response: 

The stated requirement in RELRA is the elimination of party line service. REA's experience has been that imposing
zone and mileage charges on one-party service creates a large disincentive for subscribers to choose this service.
However, REA will not require the Modernization Plan contain a provision to eliminate zone and mileage charges. 



RELRA 

provides that the Modernization Plan ``must provide for the availability of telecommunications services for improved
business, educational, and medical services.'' Rigid rate structures have served as the primary impediment to the
provision of distance learning and medical link services. REA has seen cases where states have set wideband rates
in direct proportion to the voiceband rate resulting in, for example, rates for schools far beyond what they can afford.
REA has clarified its intent on this subject in  1751.106(e). 


e. Comment Summary: 

It is not always practical to build only non-loaded twisted pair plant. 



Response: 

REA concurs and has given the Plan Developer some discretion in this matter. Section 1751.106(g)(2)(ii) has been
revised to allow a Telecommunications Provider to request additional time from the Plan Developer in the case of a
PUC or State Legislature developed plan, or from the REA in the case of a REA Borrower developed plan. The Plan Developer
or REA, as the case may be, must consider each request separately and can grant additional time only if either the best
available telecommunications technology lacks the capability to enable the Telecommunications Provider to comply
with the non-loaded requirement or complying with the requirement would impose prohibitive cost on the Telecommunications
Provider. 



f. Comment Summary: 

Nothing in the law suggests the need for 150 Mb/sec transmission rate for video. Many compression technologies are
available which allow video to be transmitted over ordinary telephone lines.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941027-1-00005 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941027-1-00001 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Response:

 In the interim rule, all references to provision of 150 Mb/sec service were non-binding ``objectives'', see paragraph
2a. REA focused on the requirement in RELRA that telephone lines be capable of carrying at least 1,000,000 bits per
second. REA adjusted this to the standard North American rate of 1.544 Mb/sec. Such a rate allows for both the transmission
of at least 1 million bits per second and for the transmission of modest quality, highly compressed video. A higher
rate is not required by the proposed rule. 



3. Comment Summary: 

Many radio based services such as cellular and BETRS will be unable to meet REA bandwidth requirements. 


Response:

 REA interprets the Modernization Plan requirements of RELRA to apply to service provided by telephone lines, i.e.,
``Wireline Service'', the basic service most Americans receive. This interpretation has been clarified in the proposed
rule. 


4. Comment Summary: 

REA has not defined ``Public Switched Network'' or ``Telecommunications Providers''. 


Response:

 REA has defined these terms in the proposed regulation. 


5. Comment Summary: 

The interim rule violates section 202 of the RE Act which states that nothing in the RE Act shall be construed to deprive
any State commission of jurisdiction to regulate telephone service, including the rates for such service. 


Response:

 REA believes there is no conflict between RELRA and section 202 of the RE Act. The PUC is neither required to develop
a Modernization Plan nor to approve REA loans that are consistent with a Modernization Plan whoever is the Plan Developer.
Therefore the PUC's jurisdiction to regulate telephone service is not impaired. No change has been made to the regulation
based on this comment. 


6. Comment Summary: 

REA has not considered how the proposed services can be offered at affordable rates. The regulation could result in
an REA Borrower-developed Modernization Plan which requires investments that a PUC would not approve. 


Response:

 The requirements included in the proposed regulation apply almost entirely to new construction. New construction
has to be economically justified to receive either REA financing or PUC approval for inclusion in the rate base. REA
believes strongly in universal service and would not issue a regulation which it believed to be an impediment to that
goal. No change has been made to the regulation based on these comments. 


7. Comment Summary: 

REA should include a requirement that other interested parties be notified of intent to develop a Modernization Plan.



Response:

 REA concurs with this comment and has changed the wording on notification to include other interested parties. See
 1751.102 (b) and (c)(2). 


8. Comment Summary: 

A Modernization Plan should cover only REA Borrowers or should cover all Telecommunications Providers only if developed
by the PUC or a State Legislature. 


Response:

 As redrafted, the Modernization Plan must apply only to REA Borrowers unless a PUC or a State Legislature decides,
at its option, to apply the Modernization Plan to non-REA Borrower Telecommunications Providers. The REA does, however,
encourage the PUCs and State Legislatures to apply the Modernization Plans to all Telecommunications Providers
in the State. 


9. Comment Summary: 

REA requires integration of PCS when it doesn't exist. 


Response:

 REA intended that a Modernization Plan should encourage integration of new technologies into the network. REA has
substituted ``emerging technologies'' for PCS and clarified its intent. See  1751.106(d). 


10. Comment Summary: 

Modernization Plans should be based on market principles. 


Response:

 The modern telecommunications system envisioned by RELRA and the Modernization Plan requirements can succeed only
if it is supported by market demand. REA's electric and telecommunications programs have repeatedly demonstrated
how quickly rural America takes advantage of new utility services. RELRA and the Modernization Plans lead the way
for today's nonrural and rural subscribers to receive the modern telecommunications services they want and need.
REA believes that the Modernization Plan requirements of this regulation rest on a sound economic basis. True to its
statutory mandate, REA will finance projects only if it believes there is adequate security and the loan will be repaid
within the time agreed. 


11. Comment Summary: 

It is untimely for REA to develop a rule when other laws concerning telecommunications have been introduced in Congress.
It is inappropriate for REA to develop rules for telecommunications. That should be the responsibility of the FCC.



Response:

 REA, as the agency responsible for promoting rural telecommunications, has long experience in setting the engineering
and technical standards for service in rural areas and is ideally suited for the responsibility it was given by Congress.
REA is working to ensure that Modernization Plan requirements and the Proposed Rule governing their preparation
are flexible enough to accommodate evolving national policies promoting the National Information Infrastructure.

REA will revise, within our statutory constraints, these regulations and approve amendments to Modernization Plans
if the National Information Infrastructure develops along lines not presently envisioned. However, the legislative
imperative of RELRA and rural America's urgent need for modern telecommunications services require that the regulations
not be delayed.

12. 

Comment Summary: 

The rule is not clear on Plan Developer eligibility as related to time. The law says the one year period starts after
publication of the final rule. Can Borrowers submit a Modernization Plan before the end of the year if the PUC or State
Legislature does not intend to? What if a PUC or State Legislature submits a Modernization Plan on the last day? Won't
loans be delayed if a PUC or State Legislature does not develop a plan and an REA Borrower-developed one has not been
approved? 




Response: 

RELRA sets forth the method of determining Plan Developer eligibility. With regard to the specific points mentioned
above: 


a. The one year period starts with publication of the final rule developed in response to comments on this proposed
rule. 


b. Modernization Plans developed by REA Borrowers will not be accepted until a PUC's and State Legislature's eligibility
has expired, unless the PUC and State Legislature officially reject eligibility. 


c. A Modernization Plan submitted on the last day will be approved by REA if it meets the minimum requirements without
alteration. The proposed rule includes language which recommends that to ensure a PUC or a State Legislature has sufficient
time to respond to any REA comments on its proposed Modernization Plan, the PUC or State Legislature should submit
its plan at least 90 days in advance of the expiration of its eligibility. See  1751.104(b)(2). 


d. Loans will not be made between the end of a PUC's and State Legislature's eligibility and the approval of a Borrower-developed
Modernization Plan. 




13. Comment Summary: 

The regulation should allow for waivers to a Modernization Plan. 




Response: 

REA has changed the regulation to allow the Modernization Plan developer the authority to grant time extensions necessitated
by the state of technology as long as the extensions are granted on a case-by-case basis, do not exceed five years, and
the circumstances for which extensions are granted are spelled out in the Modernization Plan. See  1751.106(b).





14. Comment Summary: 

What is a generic design for Broadband service? How can this be done without local power? 




Response: 

REA believes that the lack of consensus on how to bring wider band switched service to the home and small business, particularly
in rural areas, means that Telecommunications Providers continue to build and rebuild their systems essentially
for traditional voiceband service. In many cases this plant can not be adapted to wider band services. 


In the interim rule (dated December 20, 1993) REA had required a ``generic design'' for broadband service. Since REA
is no longer including non-binding goals in the proposed regulation, the requirement for a generic design has been
changed to a requirement for the developer to provide a strategic development proposal which provides the Plan Developer's
vision of a State telecommunications structure for the future. 


With regard to local power, REA retains a concern over system reliability. The proposed rule requires that no matter
what level of service is being offered, sufficient system power must be available to provide voice service during
electric utility outages. See  1751.106(h)(2)(ii) and (i)(2)(iv). 




General Summary: 

It is REA's belief that national telecommunications ``highways'' will not and cannot be fully utilized unless improvements
are made to what might be called the telecommunications ``driveways'', the local loops. Most loops cannot transmit
information over 9600 bits per second (b/s). Consequently, many advanced telecommunications services are not available
on the Public Switched Network or, where available, operate only on short loops. This limits use of these advanced
services to densely populated areas. 


RELRA requires that telephone lines be capable of transmitting: (1) Information at no less than 1,000,000 bits per
second (1Mb/s) and (2) video images. REA believes both requirements can be satisfied by telephone lines which can
transmit and receive 1.544 Mb/s, the North American standard digital transmission rate. This rate is sufficient
to carry both 1 million bits per second and highly compressed, modest quality video. 


To carry 1.544 Mb/sec, the capacity of ordinary telephone loops must be increased by several orders of magnitude.
The other requirements in the law are more easily met. Therefore, improving the loop has been REA's focus in preparing
minimum Modernization Plan requirements. 


REA believes that the requirements and time limits set forth in this section will achieve the service standards of
RELRA. 


However, REA is concerned about coordination between States. REA recommends that Modernization Plan Developers
should work with Plan Developers in other States both before and after their Modernization Plans are approved to coordinate
proposed improvements. 


REA recommends that Modernization Plan Developers give consideration to planning for outside plant which can ultimately
provide future broadband Wireline Service with a bandwidth equivalent to a digital rate on the order of 150 Mb/sec.
Such facilities could carry one or more channels of conventional video with the quality depending on the modulation
technique.

 The transmission or reception of voice, data, sounds, signals, pictures, writings, or signs of all kinds, by wire,
fiber, radio, light, or other visual or electromagnetic means. 


 

Telecommunications Providers.

 Local exchange carriers, competitive access providers, and interexchange carriers which provide telecommunications
service in the State covered by the Modernization Plan and such other entities providing telecommunications services
as the developer of the Modernization Plan (See  1751.102) may determine. 


 

Wireline Service.

 Telecommunications service provided over telephone lines. It is characterized by a wire or wirelike connection
carrying electricity or light between the subscriber and the Public Switched Network. Wireline Service implies
a physical connection. Although radio may form part of the circuit, it is not the major method of transmission as in
radiotelephone. 


 

 1751.101 

 

General. 


 

(a) It is the policy of REA that every State have a Modernization Plan which provides for the improvement of the State's
Public Switched Network. 


 (b) A proposed Modernization Plan must be submitted to REA for approval. REA will approve the proposed Modernization
Plan if it conforms to the provisions of this subpart. Once obtained, REA's approval of a Modernization Plan cannot
be rescinded. 


 (c) The Modernization Plan shall not interfere with REA's authority to issue such other telecommunications standards,
specifications, requirements, and procurement rules as may be promulgated from time to time by REA including, without
limitation, those set forth in 7 CFR part 1755. 


 (d) The Modernization Plan must, at a minimum, apply to all REA borrowers. If a Modernization Plan is developed by the
PUC or the State Legislature, REA encourages, but does not require, that the Modernization Plan's requirements apply
to the rural service areas of all Telecommunications Providers. A State's decision not to include non-REA borrowers
will not prejudice REA approval of their Plan. The PUC or the State Legislature may also, at its option, extend coverage
of the Modernization Plan to all service areas of all Telecommunications Providers in the State. In addition, while
requirements contained in  1751.106 apply only to wireline services, the State Legislature or PUC, at its discretion,
may extend coverage of Modernization Plans to wireless or other communications services in a State as it deems appropriate.



 

 1751.102 

 

Modernization Plan developer_eligibility. 


 

(a) Each State, either by statute or through its Public Utility Commission, is eligible until one year after publication
of the final rule in the 

Federal Register

 to develop a proposed Modernization Plan and deliver it to REA. REA will review and consider for approval all PUC or
State Legislature-developed Modernization Plans received by REA within this one year period. The review and approval,
if any, may occur after the one year period ends even though the PUC or State Legislature is no longer eligible to submit
a proposed Modernization Plan. 


 (b) The PUC must notify all Telecommunications Providers in the State that are part of the Public Switched Network
and other interested parties of its intent to develop a proposed Modernization Plan. The PUC is encouraged to consider
all such Providers' and interested parties' views and incorporate these views in the Modernization Plan. 


 (c) If the State Legislature or PUC is no longer eligible to develop a Modernization Plan, as described in paragraph
(a) of this section, eligibility to develop the Modernization Plan passes to a numeric majority of the Borrowers within
the State. In this case, the following apply:

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941027-1-00009 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941027-1-00001 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(1) All Borrowers shall be given reasonable notice of and shall be encouraged to attend and contribute to all meetings
and other proceedings relating to the development of the Modernization Plan; and 

 (2) Borrowers developing a Modernization Plan are encouraged to solicit the views of other Telecommunications Providers
and interested parties in the State. 

 (3) There is no time limit placed on the REA Borrowers to develop a Modernization Plan, however, REA, as required by
the Rural Electrification Loan Restructuring Act of 1993 (107 Stat. 1356), will not approve any direct loans in States
that do not have an approved Modernization Plan. See  1751.103 of this subpart. 

 

 1751.103 
 

Loan requirements. 

 

For information about loan eligibility requirements in relation to the Modernization Plan, see 7 CFR part 1735. In
particular, one year after publication of the final rule, REA will make hardship loans, REA cost-of-money loans,
and RTB loans for facilities and other RE Act purposes for Telephone Borrowers in a State only if: 

 (a) The State has an REA approved Modernization Plan; and 

 (b) The Borrower is participating in the Modernization Plan for the State. A Borrower is considered to be participating
if, in REA's opinion, the purposes of the loan requested by the Borrower are consistent with the Borrower achieving
the requirements stated in the Modernization Plan within the timeframe stated in the Modernization Plan unless REA
has determined that achieving the requirements is not technically or economically feasible. 

 

 1751.104 
 

Obtaining REA approval of a proposed Modernization Plan. 

 

(a) To obtain REA approval of a proposed Modernization Plan, the Plan Developer must submit the following to REA: 

 (1) A certified copy of the statute or PUC order, if the State is the Plan Developer, or a written request for REA approval
of the proposed Modernization Plan signed by an authorized representative of the Plan Developer, if a majority of
Borrowers is the Plan Developer; and 

 (2) Three copies of the proposed Modernization Plan. 

 (b) Generally, REA will review the proposed Modernization Plan within (30) days and either: 

 (1) Approve the Modernization Plan if it conforms to the provisions of this subpart in which case REA will return a copy
of the Modernization Plan with notice of approval to the Plan Developer; or, 

 (2) Not approve the proposed Modernization Plan if it does not conform to the provisions of this subpart. In this event,
REA will return the proposed Modernization Plan to the Plan Developer with specific written comments and suggestions
for modifying the proposed Modernization Plan so that it will conform to the provisions of this subpart. If the Plan
Developer remains eligible, REA will invite the Plan Developer to submit a modified proposed Modernization Plan
for REA consideration. This process can continue until the Plan Developer gains approval of a proposed Modernization
Plan unless the Plan Developer is a PUC or State Legislature whose eligibility has expired. If the PUC's or State Legislature's
eligibility has expired, REA will return the proposed Modernization Plan unapproved. Because REA does not have authority
to extend a PUC's or State Legislature's eligibility, REA recommends that a PUC or State Legislature submit a proposed
Modernization Plan at least 90 days in advance of one year after publication of the final rule to allow time for this
process. 

 

 1751.105 
 

Amending a Modernization Plan. 

 

(a) REA understands that changes in standards, technology, regulation, and the economy could indicate that an REA-approved
Modernization Plan should be amended. 

 (b) The Plan Developer of the Modernization Plan may amend the Modernization Plan if REA finds the proposed changes
continue to conform to the provisions of this subpart. 

 (c) The procedure for requesting approval of an amended Modernization Plan is identical to the procedure for a proposed
Modernization Plan except that there are no time limits on the eligibility of the Plan Developer. 

 (d) The existing Modernization Plan remains in force until REA has approved the proposed amended Modernization Plan.


 (e) REA may from time to time revise these regulations to incorporate newer technological and economic standards
that REA believes represent more desirable goals for the future course of telecommunications services. Such revisions
will be made in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act. These revisions shall not invalidate Modernization
Plans approved by REA but shall be used by REA to determine whether to approve amendments to Modernization Plans presented
for REA approval after the effective date of the revision. 

 

 1751.106 
 

Modernization Plan_requirements. 

 

(a) A Modernization Plan must set service requirements for improving the Public Switched Network and must at a minimum
meet the following requirements: 

 (1) The Modernization Plan must provide for the elimination of party line service. 

 (2) The Modernization Plan must provide for the availability of telecommunications services for improved business,
educational, and medical services. 

 (3) The Modernization Plan must encourage and improve computer networks and information highways for subscribers
in rural areas. 

 (4) The Modernization Plan must provide for: 

 (i) Subscribers in rural areas to be able to receive through telephone lines: 

 (A) Conference calling; 

 (B) Video images; and 

 (C) Data at a rate of at least 1,000,000 bits of information per second; and

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941027-1-00010 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941027-1-00001 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(ii) The proper routing of information to subscribers. 

(5) The Modernization Plan must provide for uniform deployment schedules to ensure that advanced services are deployed
at the same time in rural and nonrural areas. 

(b) In addition to the requirements set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, minimum requirements are described
in paragraphs (g) through (i) of this section and are grouped by timeframe, i.e., short-term, medium-term, and long-term.
The Modernization Plan shall provide that such requirements be implemented as set forth in this section of the regulation
except that the Modernization Plan may authorize the Plan Developer to approve extensions if the required investment
is not economically reasonable or if the best available telecommunications technology lacks the capability to enable
the Telecommunications Provider receiving the extension to comply with the Modernization Plan. Extensions shall
be granted only on a case-by-case basis and shall not exceed a total of five years from the first extension except under
unusual circumstances. 


(c) Each State's Modernization Plan shall include a strategic development proposal for rebuilding the Public Switched
Network within the State. The strategic development proposal shall provide all Telecommunications Providers in
the State the Plan Developer's vision of a State telecommunications structure for the future. Within the scope of
paragraph (d) of  1751.101 of this subpart, the Modernization Plan shall state whether all Telecommunications
Providers in the State are required to construct their systems in a manner consistent with the strategic development
proposal. 

(d) The Modernization Plan must require that the design of the Public Switched Network allow for the expeditious deployment
and integration of such emerging technologies as may from time to time become commercially feasible. 


(e) The Modernization Plan must provide guidelines to Telecommunications Providers for the development of affordable
tariffs for medical links and distance learning services. 


(f) With regard to the uniform deployment requirement set forth in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, if services cannot
be deployed at the same time, only the minimum feasible interval of time shall separate availability of the services
in rural and nonrural areas. 


(g) 

Short-term requirements. 

(1) The ``short-term requirements start date'' is the date one year after the date REA approves the Modernization
Plan for the State. 


(2) All facilities providing Wireline Service wholly or partially constructed or reconstructed after the short-term
requirements start date, even if the construction began before such date, shall be constructed so that: 


(i) Every subscriber can be provided 1-party service. Existing party line subscribers would be allowed to maintain
party line service only if they requested it and approval is granted by the PUC. 


(ii) Twisted-pair copper plant is non-loaded, unless the PUC, in the case of a PUC or State Legislature-developed
Modernization Plan, or the REA, in the case of a REA Borrower-developed Modernization Plan, determines, on a case-by-case
basis, after written request from a Telecommunications Provider, that the Telecommunications Provider should
be granted additional time because either the best available telecommunications technology lacks the capability
to enable the Telecommunications Provider to comply with this requirement or complying with this requirement would
impose prohibitive cost on the Telecommunications Provider. 

(3) All switching equipment installed by a Telecommunications Provider after the short-term requirements start
date shall contain the hardware, but not necessarily the software, to be capable of: 

(i) Switching 1.544 Mb/sec. traffic. 

(ii) Providing custom calling features. At a minimum, custom calling features must include call waiting, call forwarding,
abbreviated dialing, and three-way calling. 

(iii) Providing E911 service when required by any local government for areas served by the Telecommunications Provider.


(h) 

Medium-term requirements. 

(1) The ``medium-term requirements start date'' is the date six years after the date REA approves the Modernization
Plan for the State, or such earlier date as the Modernization Plan shall provide. 

(2) All facilities providing Wireline Service wholly or partially constructed or reconstructed after the medium-term
requirements start date, even if the construction began before such date, shall be constructed so that: 


(i) Switched 1.544 Mb/sec service is available to any subscriber. Available means the service will be provided on
demand after a reasonable waiting period. 


(ii) The system does not rely exclusively on local power at the subscriber end. There must be sufficient system power
to operate subscriber voice service during electric utility power outages. 

(3) No later than the medium-term start date, all switching equipment must be provisioned with the necessary hardware
to be capable of providing E911 service when required by any local government for areas served by the Telecommunications
Provider. 


(i) 

Long-term requirements. 

(1) The ``long-term requirements start date'' is the date eleven years after the date REA approves the Modernization
Plan for the State, or such earlier date as the Modernization Plan shall provide. 

(2) After the long-term requirements start date, the following requirements shall apply to all Wireline Service
provided by Telecommunications Providers: 

(i) Telecommunications Providers shall eliminate party line service. 


(ii) Telephone service shall be available to any subscriber at 1.544 Mb/sec. Available means the service will be provided
on demand after a reasonable waiting period. 

(iii) No service lower than one digital voice circuit (56-64 kb/sec) shall be offered as a new service. 
(iv) The system must not rely exclusively on local power at the subscriber end. There must be sufficient system power
to operate subscriber voice service during electric utility power outages.

Executive Office for Immigration Review; Citizenship Requirement for Employment



<AGENCY>
agency: 

Department of Justice.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
action: 

Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

This proposed rule requires that employees hired by the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR or Agency)
be citizens of the United States of America. This rule exempts EOIR from the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986's
general prohibition of discrimination based on citizenship status and supplements Executive Order 11935 which
requires United States citizenship for almost all Federal employees in the competitive service.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information: 

This proposed rule authorizes EOIR to require its employees and volunteers to be citizens of the United States of America.
Because the central task of this Agency is adjudicating immigration-related cases, Agency employees and volunteers
often have access to sensitive information and handle complex and sensitive immigration issues. It is imperative
that individuals who work at EOIR, either as employees or volunteers, demonstrate their allegiance to the United
States by being able to document that they are United States citizens. Pursuant to E.O. 11935, 41 FR 37301 (1976), the
Executive Branch requires United States citizenship for employees hired in the competitive service. This proposed
rule extends the citizenship requirement to all EOIR employees and volunteers. The rule exempts EOIR from the prohibition
of discrimination based on citizenship status, pursuant to the procedures established by the Immigration Reform
and Control Act of 1986. 8 U.S.C. 1324b(a)(2)(C).



Additionally, this proposed rule allows the Agency to exercise its discretion to hire non-citizens when necessary
to accomplish the Agency's mission. For example, this rule would permit the Director of the Agency to authorize hiring
an interpreter skilled in the English language and an unusual foreign language when a United States citizen interpreter
is not available.

Insertion of this rule requires a slight reorganization of 8 CFR part 3.

This rule does not have a significant adverse economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 5 U.S.C. 605(b).

This rule has been drafted and reviewed in accordance with E.O. 12866 section 1(b), Principles of Regulation. The
Attorney General has determined that this rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under E.O. 12866, section
3(f), Regulatory Planning and Review, and accordingly this rule has not been reviewed by the Office of Management
and Budget.

This rule will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government
and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore,
in accordance with E.O. 12612, it is determined that this rule does not have sufficient federalism implication to
warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

<USDEPT>FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION</USDEPT>










Privacy Act; Implementation



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Election Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule with request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Election Commission (``Commission'' or ``FEC'') is establishing a new system of records under the Privacy
Act of 1974, ``Inspector General Investigative Files (FEC 12)'', to consist of the investigatory files of the Commission's
Office of the Inspector General (``OIG''). The Commission proposes to exempt this new system of records from certain
provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 (``Act'').



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Elsewhere in today's 

Federal Register,

 the Commission is publishing a notice to establish a proposed system notice to establish a new system of records, FEC
12, ``Office of Inspector General Investigative Files,'' under the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a, as amended. The following
proposed amendment of the Commission's Privacy Act regulations at 11 CFR 1.14 is necessary to exempt the new system
of records from certain provisions of that Act.




The Privacy Act and the implementing regulations require, among other things, that the Commission provide notice
when collecting information, account for certain disclosures, permit individuals access to their records, and
allow them to request that the records be amended. These provisions could interfere with the conduct of OIG investigations
if applied to the OIG's maintenance of the proposed system of records.

Accordingly, the Commission proposes to exempt FEC 12 from these requirements under sections (j)(2) and (k)(2) of
the Act. Section (j)(2), 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), exempts a system of records maintained by ``the agency or component
thereof which performs as its principal function any activity pertaining to enforcement of criminal laws * * *.''
Section (k)(2), 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), exempts a system of records consisting of ``investigatory materials compiled
for law enforcement purposes,'' where such materials are not within the scope of the (j)(2) exemption pertaining
to criminal law enforcement.

The proposed system of records consists of information covered by the (j)(2) and (k)(2) exemptions. the OIG investigatory
files are maintained pursuant to official investigational and law enforcement functions of the Commission's Office
of Inspector General under authority of the 1988 amendments to the Inspector General Act of 1978. 

See

 Public Law 100-504, amending Public Law 95-452, 5 U.S.C. app. The OIG is an office within the Commission
that performs as one of its principal functions activities relating to the enforcement of criminal laws. In addition,
the OIG is responsible for investigating a wide range of non-criminal law enforcement matters, including civil,
administrative, or regulatory violations and similar wrongdoing. Access by subject individuals and others to this
system of records could substantially compromise the effectiveness of OIG investigations, and thus impede the apprehension
and successful prosecution or discipline of persons engaged in fraud or other illegal activity.

For these reasons, the Commission is proposing to exempt proposed FEC 12 under exemptions (j)(2) and (k)(2) of the
Privacy Act, by adding a new paragraph (b) to 11 CFR 1.14, the section in which the Commission specifies its systems
of records that are exempt under the Act. Where applicable, section (j)(2) may be invoked to exempt a system of records
from any Privacy Act provision except: 5 U.S.C. 552a(b) (conditions of disclosure); (c) (1) and (2) (accounting of
disclosures and retention of accounting, respectively); (e)(4) (A) through (F) (system notice requirements);
(e) (6), (7), (8), (10) and (11) (certain agency requirements relating to system maintenance); and (i) (criminal
penalties). Section (k)(2) may be invoked to exempt a system of records from: 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) (making accounting
of disclosures available to the subject individual); (d) (access to records); (e)(1) (maintaining only relevant
and necessary information; (e)(4) (G), (H), and (I) (notice of certain procedures), and (f) (promulgation of certain
Privacy Act rules). The proposed language notes these specific exceptions and exemptions.

The Commission welcomes comments on any aspect of this proposed rule.




Certification of No Effect Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b) (Regulatory Flexibility Act)



The Commission certifies that the proposed rules will not, if adopted, have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. The basis for this certification is that the Privacy Act applies only to ``individuals,''
and individuals are not ``small entities'' within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Proposed rule; extension of comment period.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Small Business Administration (SBA) extends the comment period on its proposed rule that would amend both eligibility
requirements for and contractual assistance provisions within the SBA's section 8(a) program, and that was published
in the 

Federal Register

 on August 30, 1994, 59 FR 44652.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On August 30, 1994, SBA published a proposed rule to, among other things, (1) make several clarifications of the eligibility
requirements for admission to SBA's 8(a) program, the need for which has been identified by SBA through the practical
experience gained in operating the program and in defending the agency's actions in 8(a) eligibility appeals brought
before SBA's Office of Hearings and Appeals, (2) authorize participation by business concerns owned by Community
Development Corporations in the 8(a) program in accord with 42 U.S.C. 9815, and (3) make several changes to the 8(a)
contractual assistance requirements, including eliminating 8(a) support levels and the concepts of local buy and
national buy 8(a) requirements.


The rule required that comments concerning its proposed provisions be submitted to SBA for review on or before November
28, 1994. SBA has received a number of comments stating that the 30-day comment period was insufficient to properly
address all of the proposal, and requesting that the comment period be extended. In light of the fact that the end of
the comment period coincided with the end of the Federal fiscal year, a very busy time for any business concerns contracting
with the Federal Government, SBA concurs that an extension of the comment period for this rule is appropriate. Thus,
SBA is extending the comment period for an additional 30 days from the date this notice is published in the 

Federal Register

.

Administrative Cost Recovery



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proprosed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

TVA proposes to amend its administrative cost recovery regulations by: Adding a provision requiring payment to TVA
of nonrefundable application processing fees to recover the costs of reviewing plans for the construction, operation,
or maintenance of dams, appurtenant works, or other obstructions affecting navigation, flood control, or public
lands or reservations in the Tennessee River system under Section 26a of the TVA Act; eliminating cost recovery exemptions
for agricultural licenses; firewood cutting permits; permits for the nonexclusive short-term use of TVA land; conveyance
or abandonment of TVA land or landrights to States, municipalities, and political subdivisions and agencies thereof;
and use of TVA land for utility line crossings; authorizing the responsible land manager to establish a standard charge
for each category of action rather than determining the actual administrative costs for each individual action;
increasing the range of fees for certain actions.




The implementation of these regulations would allow TVA to recover more of its administrative costs incurred in processing
certain actions from those persons who directly benefit from the actions.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In order to help ensure that TVA land management and permitting activities are self-sustaining to the full extent
possible, the agency has determined that its administrative cost recovery regulations should be expanded to include
a broader range of use, disposal, and permitting activities. This determination is consistent with the objectives
of the current administration to increase government efficiency and to recover the costs of government services
from those who most directly benefit from the services.







Persons who wish to construct dams, appurtenant works, or other obstructions in or along the Tennessee River system
are required by Section 26a of the TVA Act of 1933, as amended, to obtain TVA's approval of plans for the proposed activity
prior to construction. TVA's administrative cost recovery regulations currently provide for recovery of costs
of actions taken by TVA to approve obstructions constructed without prior approval of plans. In order to help ensure
that the agency's entire Section 26a permitting program is self-sustaining to the full extent possible, TVA now proposes
to recover the costs of processing permits for proposed obstructions as well as after-the-fact permit processing.
The proposed amendment would allow the responsible land manager to set a standard permit processing fee, which would
be payable upon submission of a permit application and would be nonrefundable, regardless of whether or not the plans
are approved by TVA. 

It is presently envisioned that the standard application processing fee for private noncommercial Section 26a permit
proposals would be $100, and the standard fee for commercial, industrial, and public Section 26a permit application
processing would be $500. These proposed fees are based in part upon a preliminary review of costs incurred by TVA in
processing these permits. In addition, TVA examined prevailing permit application fees by conducting a comparative
analysis survey of 40 other agencies and utilities. In adjusting application processing fees and in establishing
standard fees for other applicable activities, the responsible land manager will examine average costs incurred
in conducting the various activities.





TVA presently charges a $2 per applicant administrative fee for quota deer hunts and quota turkey hunts at Land Between
The Lakes. The purpose of this fee is to recover the cost of processing applications, conducting a computerized drawing,
and mailing notification of selection status. TVA proposes the application fee increase from $2 to a range of $5 to
$25. This range will allow TVA to recover increasing costs of conducting the drawings and hunts, and allow a range of
pricing for special hunts and drawings.





The proposed effective date of this action is January 31, 1995. Applications received prior to this date will be processed
under the regulations in effect at the time of receipt of the application.

 1310.3 

Assessment of administrative charge.



(a) 

Range of charges.

 Except as otherwise provided in this part, the responsible land manager shall assess a charge which he/she determines
in his/her sole judgment to be approximately equal to the administrative costs incurred by TVA for each action including
both the direct cost to TVA and applicable overheads. In determining the amount of such charge, the responsible land
manager may establish a standard charge for each category of action rather than determining the actual administrative
costs for each individual action. The standard charge shall be an amount approximately equal to TVA's actual average
administrative costs for the category of action. Charges shall be not less than the minimum or greater than the maximum
amount specified herein, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c) of this section.

(1) Land transfers_$500-$10,000.

(2) Use permits or licenses_$50-$5,000.

(3) Actions taken to approve plans for fills, structures, or other obstructions under Section 26a of the TVA Act_$100-$5,000.

(4) Abandonment of transmission line easements and rights-of-way_$100-$1,500.

(5) Quota deer hunt or turkey hunt applications_$5-$25.

(b) 

Basis of charge.

 The administrative charge assessed by the responsible land manager shall, to the extent applicable, include the
following costs:

(1) Appraisal of the land or landrights affected; 

(2) Assessing applicable rental fees;

(3) Compliance inspections and other field investigations;

(4) Title and record searches;

(5) Preparation for and conducting public auction and negotiated sales;

(6) Mapping and surveying;

(7) Preparation of conveyance instrument, permit, or other authorization or approval instrument; 

(8) Coordination of the proposed action within TVA and with other Federal, State, and local agencies;

(9) Legal review; and 

(10) Administrative overheads associated with the transaction.

(c) 

Assessment of charge when actual administrative costs significantly exceed established range.

 When the responsible land manager determines that the actual administrative costs are expected to significantly
exceed the range of costs established in paragraph (a) of this section, such manager shall not proceed with the TVA
action until agreement is reached on payment of a charge calculated to cover TVA's actual administrative costs.

(d) 

Quota deer hunt and turkey hunt application fees.

 A fee for each person in the amount prescribed by the responsible land manager must accompany the completed application
form for a quota deer hunt and turkey hunt permit. Applications will not be processed unless accompanied by the correct
fee amount. No refunds will be made to unsuccessful applicants, except that fees received after the application due
date will be refunded.

(e) 

Additional charges.

 In addition to the charges assessed under this part, TVA may impose a charge in connection with environmental reviews
or other environmental investigations it conducts under its policies or procedures implementing the National Environmental
Policy Act. (42 U.S.C. 4321 

et seq.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed Rule; Reopening and Extension of Public Comment Period on Proposed Amendment.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

OSM is announcing receipt of additional explanatory information and revisions pertaining to a previously proposed
amendment to the Texas regulatory program (hereinafter, the ``Texas program'') under the Surface Mining Control
and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). The additional explanatory information and revisions for Texas' proposed rules
and statute pertain to ownership and control. The amendment is intended to revise the Texas program to be consistent
with the corresponding Federal regulations and SMCRA.




This document sets forth the times and locations that the Texas program and proposed amendment to that program are
available for public inspection and dates and times of the reopened comment period during which interested persons
may submit written comments on the proposed amendment.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



I. Background on the Texas Program




On February 16, 1980, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Texas program. General background
information on the Texas program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and the conditions
of approval of the Texas program can be found in the February 27, 1980, 

Federal Register 

(45 FR 12998). Subsequent actions concerning Texas' program and program amendments can be found at 30 CFR 943.15 and
943.16.

By letter dated May 24, 1994, (Administrative Record No. TX-576), Texas submitted a proposed amendment to its
program pursuant to SMCRA. Texas submitted the proposed amendment in response to required program amendments at
30 CFR 943.16(c) (1) and (2), (d), (f), (j)(1), (2), (3), and (4), (r), and (s) (59 FR 13200, March 21, 1994). The ownership
and control provisions of the Texas Coal Mining Regulations (TCMR) at 16 Texas Administrative Code (TAC)  11.221
and of the Texas Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Act (TSCMRA) at Article 5920-11 of the Texas Revised Civil
Statutes Annotated that Texas proposed to amend were: TCMR  778.116(m), identification of interests and compliance
information; TCMR  786.215(e) and (f), review of permit applications; TCMR 786.216(i) through (n), criteria
for permit approval or denial; TCMR  788.225(f), (g), and (h), commission review of outstanding permits; and
section 21(c) of TSCMRA, reporting notices of violations in permit applications.

OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the June 30, 1994, 

Federal Register 

(59 FR 33705) and invited public comment on its adequacy (Administrative Record No. TX-576.07). The public
comment period ended August 1, 1994.

During its review of the amendment, OSM identified concerns relating to the provisions of the rules and statute at
TCMR  778.116(m), identification of interests and compliance information; TCMR  786.215(e)(1), review
of permit applications; TCMR  788.225(g), commission review of outstanding permits; and section 21(c) of
TSCMRA, reporting notices of violations in permit applications. OSM notified Texas of the concerns by letter dated
August 11, 1994 (Administrative Record No. TX-576.12). In response to OSM's concerns for these provisions,
Texas, in a letter dated October 6, 1994, submitted a revised amendment (Administrative Record No. TX-576.13).

Texas proposes to additionally (1) revise TCMR  778.116(m) and TCMR  786.215(e)(1) so that each requires
an application to list violations incurred by the applicant under all SMCRA-approved State programs, including
the Texas program; (2) recodify the previously proposed second sentence of TCMR  788.225(g) as (g)(1) and subparagraphs
(g) (1) through (4) as (g)(1) (i) through (iv); (3) revise TCMR  788.225(g) to provide that if the Commission
elects to rescind an improvidently issued permit it must serve the permittee with a notice of the proposed rescission
and include the reasons under TCMR  788.225(e) for the Commission's findings; (4) revise TCMR  788.225(g)(g)(1)(iv)
to require the Commission to find that, in addition to severing any ownership or control link with the responsible
person, the permittee does not continue to be responsible for the violation, penalty, or fee; and (5) recodify previously
proposed TCMR  788.225(h) and (i), respectively, as TCMR  788.225(g)(2) and (h).



III. Public Comment Procedures



OSM is reopening the comment period on the proposed Texas program amendment to provide the public an opportunity to
reconsider the adequacy of the proposed amendment in light of the additional materials submitted. In accordance
with the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17(h), OSM is seeking comments on whether the proposed amendment satisfies the applicable
program approval criteria of 30 CFR 732.15. If the amendment is deemed adequate, it will become part of the Texas program.

Written comments should be specific, pertain only to the issues proposed in this rulemaking, and include explanations
in support of the commenter's recommendations. Comments received after the time indicated under 

DATES

 at locations other than the Tulsa Field Office will not necessarily be considered in the final rulemaking or included
in the administrative record.

This rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory
Planning and Review).



2. Executive Order 12778



The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments
since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA
(30 U.S.C. 1253 AND 12550) and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed
State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.



3. National Environmental Policy Act



No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).



4. Paperwork Reduction Act



This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by OMB under the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 

et seq.

).



5. Regulatory Flexibility Act



The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an
economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements
previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule
would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart
Federal regulations.

Ocean Dumping; Proposed Site Designation 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA today proposes to designate an Ocean Dredged Material Disposal Site (ODMDS) in the Atlantic Ocean offshore Miami,
Florida, as an EPA-approved ocean dumping site for the disposal of suitable dredged material. This proposed action
is necessary to provide an acceptable ocean disposal site for consideration as an option for dredged material disposal
projects in the greater Miami, Florida vicinity. This proposed site designation is for an indefinite period of time,
but the site is subject to continuing monitoring to insure that unacceptable adverse environmental impacts do not
occur. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
A. Background 


Section 102(c) of the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA) of 1972, as amended, 33 U.S.C. 1401


et seq., 

gives the Administrator of EPA the authority to designate sites where ocean disposal may be permitted. On October
1, 1986, the Administrator delegated the authority to designate ocean disposal sites to the Regional Administrator
of the Region in which the sites are located. This proposed designation of a site offshore Miami, Florida, which is
within Region IV, is being made pursuant to that authority. 
The EPA Ocean Dumping Regulations promulgated under MPRSA (40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter H, Section 228.4) state that
ocean dumping sites will be designated by promulgation in this Part 228. A list of ``Approved Interim and Final Ocean
Dumping Sites'' was published on January 11, 1977 (42 FR 2461 [January 11, 1977]). The list established the existing
Miami (``Miami Beach'') site as an interim site. The site is now listed in 40 CFR 228.12(a)(3). Interested persons
may participate in this proposed rulemaking by submitting written comments within 45 days of the date of this publication
to the address given above.

B. EIS Development 



Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 4321 

et seq

., requires that federal agencies prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) on proposals for legislation
and other major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. The object of NEPA
is to build into the Agency decision making process careful consideration of all environmental aspects of proposed
actions. While NEPA does not apply to EPA activities of this type, EPA has voluntarily committed to prepare EISs in
connection with ocean disposal site designations such as this (see 39 FR 16186 [May 7, 1974]). 

EPA, in cooperation with the Jacksonville District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE), has prepared a Draft
EIS (DEIS) entitled ``Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Designation of An Ocean Dredged Material Disposal
Site Located Offshore Miami, Florida.'' On September 7, 1990, the Notice of Availability (NOA) of the DEIS for public
review and comment was published in the 

Federal Register

 (55 FR 36891 [September 7, 1990]). Anyone desiring a copy of the EIS may obtain one from the addresses given above. The
public comment period on the draft EIS was to have closed on October 22, 1990. However, the closing date was changed
to December 7, 1990 due to a request by the State of Florida. 

EPA received 12 comment letters on the Draft EIS. There were three main concerns expressed in those letters: (1) Placement
of beach quality sand in the ODMDS; (2) potential for movement of silt and clay sized particles out of the disposal area
and onto environmentally sensitive hardbottoms and coral reefs to the west during the occurrence of Gulf Stream frontal
eddies; and (3) disposal of contaminated sediments from locations such as the Miami River. Concerns raised by the
State of Florida, regarding use of suitable material for beach nourishment, will be addressed in the FEIS. EPA concurs
with the State of Florida regarding the use of suitable material for beach nourishment, in circumstances where this
use is practical. A real-time monitoring system will be instituted by the Army Corps of Engineers to identify the occurrence
of Gulf Stream frontal eddies. During the occurrence of such eddies, disposal at the ODMDS will discontinue. Details
of the monitoring plan and protocol will be included in the Site Management and Monitoring Plan as part of the FEIS.
Before any material can be placed within an ODMDS, it must be evaluated and shown to be acceptable for ocean disposal
in accordance with ocean dumping regulations (40 CFR 227.13). Certain portions of the sediments proposed to be dredged
from the Miami River have been found to be unacceptable for ocean disposal. 

The EIS will serve as a Biological Assessment for purposes of Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act coordination.
By itself, site designation of the Miami ODMDS will not adversely impact any threatened or endangered species under
the purview of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS). Use of the
ODMDS is not expected to adversely impact any threatened or endangered species. Pursuant to Section 7 of the Endangered
Species Act, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) has been asked by EPA to concur with EPA's conclusion that
this site designation will not affect the endangered species under their jurisdictions. 

EPA has evaluated the proposed site designation for consistency with the State of Florida's (the State) approved
coastal management program. EPA has determined that the designation of the proposed site is consistent to the maximum
extent practicable with the State coastal management program, and has submitted this determination to the State
for review in accordance with EPA policy. 

In a letter dated September 13, 1990, the Florida Department of State agreed that the proposed designation will have
no effect on any archaeological or historic sites or properties listed, or eligible for listing, in the 

National Register of Historic Places

 in accordance with the National Preservation Act of 1966 (Public Law 89-6654), as amended. 

The proposed action discussed in the DEIS is the permanent designation for continuing use of the existing interim
ocean disposal site near Miami, Florida. The purpose of the proposed action is to provide an environmentally acceptable
option for the ocean disposal of dredged material. The need for the permanent designation of the Miami ODMDS is based
on a demonstrated COE need for ocean disposal of maintenance dredged material from the Federal navigation projects
in the greater Miami area. However, every disposal activity by the COE is evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine
the need for ocean disposal for that particular case. The need for ocean disposal for other projects, and the suitability
of the material for ocean disposal, will be determined on a case-by-case basis as part of the COE's process of issuing
permits for ocean disposal for private/federal actions and a public review process for their own actions. 

For the Miami ODMDS, the COE and EPA would evaluate all federal dredged material disposal projects pursuant to the
EPA criteria given in the Ocean Dumping Regulations (40 CFR Parts 220-229) and the COE regulations (33 CFR 209.120
and Parts 335-338). The COE also issues Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA) permits to
private applicants for the transport of dredged material intended for disposal after compliance with regulations
is determined. EPA has the right to disapprove any ocean disposal project if, in its judgment, all provisions of MPRSA
and the associated implementing regulations have not been met. 

The DEIS discusses the need for this site designation and examines ocean disposal site alternatives to the proposed
action. Non-ocean disposal options have been examined in the previously published Feasibility Report and EIS for
the Miami Harbor Channel Project. Alternatives to ocean disposal may include upland disposal within the port area,
disposal in Biscayne Bay, and beach disposal. Upland disposal in the intensively developed Port of Miami-Biscayne
Bay area has not been found feasible. The Port of Miami itself is built partially on fill in Biscayne Bay. Undeveloped
areas within cost-effective haul distances are environmentally valuable in their own right. 

Almost all inshore waters of the Biscayne Bay area are part of the Biscayne Bay Aquatic Preserve. The waters of the southern
portion of Biscayne Bay, now included in the Aquatic Preserve, are to be incorporated, along with some offshore waters,
into the Biscayne National Park in the near future. The Florida Department of Environmental Regulation (DER) has
afforded the waters of these areas special protection as Outstanding Florida Waters. This effectively removes virtually
all of the Biscayne Bay area from consideration for disposal of dredged material. 

Dredged sand might be placed on beaches in the Miami Beach area. Suitable rock might be placed in nearshore waters.
These options are feasible only where a substantial quantity of the desired type of material is separable from silt
or other undesirable material. 

The COE has been authorized to deepen Miami Harbor. For that project, environmental and economic analyses were performed
and an EIS was prepared. The COE examined and documented the feasibility of each of the above-described disposal options
and found none to be feasible. 

The following ocean disposal alternatives were evaluated in the Draft EIS:

1. Alternative Sites on the Continental Shelf 


In the Miami nearshore area, hardgrounds supporting coral and algal communities are concentrated on the continental
shelf. Disposal operations on the shelf could adversely impact this reef habitat. Because the shelf is narrow, about
3.3 nmi (6 km) off Government Cut, the transport of dredged materials for disposal beyond the shelf is both practical
and economically feasible. Therefore, alternative sites on the continental shelf are not desirable. 



2. Designated Interim Site (Candidate Site) 



The preferred alternative considered in this document is the final designation of an ODMDS. This site is an area of
approximately one square nautical mile with the following corner coordinates: 25
 45
'30
'
' N, 80
 03
'54
'
' W; 25

'
' W; 25

'54
'
' W. The site is centered at: 25
 45
'00
'
' N and 80
 03
'22
'
' W. This site is considered suitable in terms of practicality and economic feasibility. Sections 228.5 and
228.6 of EPA's Ocean Dumping Regulations and Criteria 40 CFR establish criteria for the evaluation of ocean disposal
sites. 



3. Alternative Sites Beyond the Continental Shelf 



The western edge of the Gulf Stream meanders about one mile east of the candidate site. Dumping in the Gulf Stream was
considered, but the enormous task and expense of monitoring disposal under such conditions caused sufficient concern
to eliminate that option. 



4. No Action 



Under the ``no action'' alternative, the interim site would not receive final designation. The Water Resources Act
of 1992, Title V, Section 506(a) prohibits the continued use of ocean dump sites which have not been designated by EPA
as Section 102 dump sites after January 1, 1997. If EPA fails to designate the Miami ODMDS by that date, the continued
foreseeable need to have an appropriate site for disposal of suitable sediments from dredging projects in the Miami
area would place pressure on the Corps and EPA to approve on a project-by-project basis the use of temporary ocean dumping
locations pursuant to either Clean Water Act Section 404 or MPRSA Section 103. 

The DEIS presents the information needed to evaluate the suitability of ocean disposal areas for final designation
use and is based on one of a series of disposal site environmental studies. The environmental studies and final designation
are being conducted in accordance with the requirements of MPRSA, the Ocean Dumping Regulations, and other applicable
federal environmental legislation. 

Comments received on the DEIS will be addressed in the FEIS. 
This Proposed Rule is being published between the DEIS and the Final EIS (FEIS). EPA will accept comments on the Proposed
Rule during the 45-day NEPA review period. Comments on the Proposed Rule will be addressed in the Final Rule, which
will be published following the completion of the 30-day NEPA review period of the FEIS. Responses in the Final Rule
may refer to earlier published responses, as appropriate. 



C. Proposed Site Designation 



The proposed site is located east of Miami, Florida, the western boundary being 3.6 nautical miles (nmi) offshore.
The proposed ODMDS occupies an area of about 1 square nautical mile (nmi2), in the configuration of an approximate
1 nmi by 1 nmi square. Water depths within the area range from 427 to 785 feet. The coordinates of the Miami site proposed
for final designation are as follows: 







Center coordinates are 25

' W. 



D. Regulatory Requirements 



Pursuant to the Ocean Dumping Regulations, 40 CFR Part 228.5, five general criteria are used in the selection and approval
for continuing use of ocean disposal sites. Sites are selected so as to minimize interference with other marine activities,
to prevent any temporary perturbations associated with the disposal from causing impacts outside the disposal site,
and to permit effective monitoring to detect any adverse impacts at an early stage. Where feasible, locations off
the Continental Shelf and other sites that have been historically used are to be chosen. If, at any time, disposal operations
at a site cause unacceptable adverse impacts, further use of the site can be restricted or terminated by EPA. The proposed
site conforms to the five general criteria. 

In addition to these general criteria in Section 228.5, Section 228.6 lists the 11 specific criteria used in evaluating
a proposed disposal site to assure that the general criteria are met. Application of these 11 criteria constitutes
an environmental assessment of the impact of disposal at the site. The characteristics of the proposed site are reviewed
below in terms of these 11 criteria (the EIS may be consulted for additional information). 



1. Geographical Position, Depth of Water, Bottom Topography, and Distance [from Coast 228.6(a)(1)] 40 CFR




The boundary and center coordinates of the proposed site are given above. The western boundary of the proposed site
is located about 3.6 nmi offshore of Miami, Florida. The site is an approximate 1 nmi by 1 nmi square configuration.
Water depth in the area ranges from 427 to 785 feet.

2. Location in Relation to Breeding, Spawning, Nursery, Feeding, or Passage Areas of Living Resources in Adult or
Juvenile Phases [40 CFR 228.6(a)(2)]



Many of the area's species spend their adult lives in the offshore region, but are estuary-dependent because their
juvenile stages use a low salinity estuarine nursery region. Specific migration routes are not known in the Miami
area. The site is not known to include any major breeding or spawning area, except for sea turtles which use the entire
beach area of eastern Florida as nesting habitat. Due to the motility of finfish, it is unlikely that disposal activities
will have any significant impact on any of the species found in the area. 


3. Location in Relation to Beaches and Other Amenity Areas [40 CFR 228.6(a)(3)]


The candidate site is located at least 3.6 nautical miles from the coast. Shore-related amenities include Virginia
Key, the Biscayne Bay Aquatic Preserve, Biscayne National Park, and the Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Recreational
Area. Currents in the vicinity trend alongshore in a general north-south orientation. It is therefore unlikely that
detectable quantities of dredged material will be transported onto beaches. Considering the distance that the proposed
disposal site is offshore of beach areas, dredged material disposal at the site is not expected to have an effect on
the recreational uses of these beaches. Modelling performed by the COE indicates that disposed material will not
impact these areas. 


4. Types and Quantities of Wastes Proposed To Be Disposed of, and Proposed Methods of Release, Including Methods of
Packing the Waste, If Any [40 CFR 228(a)(4)]


It is anticipated that the candidate site will be used primarily for disposal of maintenance material from the Port
of Miami. Maintenance dredging has only occurred four times since 1957. Another foreseen use of the site would be the
Miami Harbor Deepening Project. Estimated volume for this project is expected to be 6 million cubic yards. For each
future dredging project, each disposal plan must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to ensure that ocean disposal
is the best alternative and that the material meets the Ocean Dumping Criteria in 40 CFR Part 227. 


5. Feasibility of Surveillance and Monitoring [40 CFR 228.6(a)(5)]




Due to the proximity of the site to shore, surveillance will not be difficult. Survey vessels, dredges or aircraft
overflights are feasible surveillance methods. However, the depths at this site make conventional ODMDS monitoring
techniques difficult to utilize. The Site Management and Monitoring Plan (SMMP) for the Miami ODMDS has been developed
and was included as an appendix in the DEIS. This SMMP establishes a sequence of monitoring surveys to be undertaken
to determine any impacts resulting from disposal activities. The SMMP may be modified for cause by the responsible
agency. 


6. Dispersal, Horizontal Transport and Vertical Mixing Characteristics of the Area Including Prevailing Current
Direction and Velocity, If Any [40 CFR 228.6(a)(6)]


Prevailing currents parallel the coast and are generally oriented along a north-south axis. Northerly flow predominates.
Mean surface currents range from 62 to 95 cm/sec with maximum velocities of about 150 cm/sec. Current speeds are lower
and current reversals more common in near-bottom waters. Mean velocities of 3.5 cm/sec and maximum velocities of
27 cm/sec have been reported for near-bottom waters in the area. A pycnocline occurs in site waters throughout the
year at reported depths ranging from about 60 feet in the summer to 325 feet in the winter. A dredged material dispersion
study conducted by the COE for both the short- and long-term fate of material disposed at the proposed site indicates
little possibility of disposed material affecting near-shore reefs. Measures as discussed in the Management and
Monitoring Plan will be instituted during disposal operations to minimize the possibility of material being transported
to the near-shore reefs. 



7. Existence and Effects of Current and Previous Discharges and Dumping in the Area (Including Cumulative Effects)
[40 CFR 228.6(a)(7)]



The proposed ODMDS was used for the first time in April 1990. Only 225,000 cubic yards of maintenance material was disposed
in the proposed ODMDS. In conjunction with this use of the site, the Corps of Engineers in cooperation with the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) monitored the physical processes and the dispersive characteristics
of the dredged material plume. Monitoring results indicated that the material discharged, except for a low concentration
residual remaining within the water column, reached bottom within the designated site boundaries. During the monitoring,
the resulting plumes were observed to be transported in a north to northeast direction. The full monitoring report
will be included as part of the Final EIS. Due to the limited quantity of material disposed at the site, an effects study
has not been initiated. Effects monitoring is discussed in the Site Management and Monitoring Plan as part of the EIS.

No other discharges or dumping occurs in the site. The Miami-Dade Central publicly owned treatment plant outfall
discharges approximately 1.2 miles west of the site. The effects from this discharge are local and predominantly
in a north-south direction due to prevailing currents and should not have any effect within the site.

8. Interference With Shipping, Fishing, Recreation, Mineral Extraction, Desalination, Fish and Shellfish Culture,
Areas of Special Scientific Importance and Other Legitimate Uses of the Ocean [40 CFR 228.6(a)(8)]



While shipping is heavy at the Port of Miami, the infrequent use of this site should not significantly disrupt either
commercial shipping or recreational boating. Commercial and recreational fishing activities are concentrated
in inshore and nearshore waters. No mineral extraction, desalination, or mariculture activities occur in the immediate
area. Scientific resources present throughout this area are not geographically limited to the proposed Miami ODMDS
or nearby waters. 



9. The Existing Water Quality and Ecology of the Site as Determined By Available Data or By Trend Assessment or Baseline
Surveys [40 CFR 228.6(a)(9)]



Water quality at the proposed ODMDS is variable and is influenced by discharges from inshore systems, frequent oceanic
intrusions, and periodic upwelling. The proposed disposal site lies on the continental slope in an area traversed
by the western edge of the Florida Current. The location of the western edge of the current determines to a large extent
whether waters at the site are predominantly coastal or oceanic. Frequent intrusions or eddies of the Florida Current
transport oceanic waters over the continental shelf in the proposed ODMDS vicinity. Periodic upwelling/downwelling
events associated with wind stress also influence waters in the area. 

No critical habitat or unique ecological communities have been identified at the candidate site. Buffer zone protection
has been applied to any existing fish havens, artificial reef communities, turtle nesting areas, and onshore amenities
in the general region of the site. 



10. Potentiality for the Development or Recruitment of Nuisance Species in the Disposal Site [40 CFR 228.6(a)(10)]



The disposal of dredged materials should not attract or promote the development of nuisance species. No nuisance
species have been reported to occur at previously utilized disposal sites in the vicinity. 



11. Existence at or in Close Proximity to the Site of Any Significant Natural or Cultural Features of Historical Importance
[40 CFR 228.6(a)(11)]



No known natural or cultural features of historical importance occur at or in close proximity to the site. No such features
were noted in a video survey of the proposed disposal area. 



E. Site Management 



Site management of the Miami ODMDS is the responsibility of EPA as well as the COE. The COE issues permits to private
applicants for ocean disposal; however, EPA/Region IV assumes overall responsibility for site management. 

The Site Management and Monitoring Plan (SMMP) for the proposed Miami ODMDS was developed as a part of the process of
completing the EIS. This plan provides procedures for both site management and for the monitoring of effects of disposal
activities. This SMMP is intended to be flexible and may be modified by the responsible agency for cause. 



F. Proposed Action 



The EIS concludes that the proposed site may appropriately be designated for use. The proposed site is compatible
with the 11 specific and 5 general criteria used for site evaluation. 

The designation of the Miami site as an EPA-approved ODMDS is being published as Proposed Rulemaking. Overall management
of this site is the responsibility of the Regional Administrator of EPA/Region IV. 

It should be emphasized that, if an ODMDS is designated, such a site designation does not constitute EPA's approval
of actual disposal of material at sea. Before ocean disposal of dredged material at the site may commence, the COE must
evaluate a permit application according to EPA's Ocean Dumping Criteria. EPA has the right to disapprove the actual
disposal if it determines that environmental concerns under MPRSA have not been met. 

The Miami ODMDS is not restricted to disposal use by federal projects; private applicants may also dispose suitable
dredged material at the ODMDS once relevant regulations have been satisfied. This site is restricted, however, to
suitable dredged material from the greater Miami, Florida vicinity. 



G. Regulatory Assessments 



Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, EPA is required to perform a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis for all rules
that may have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. EPA has determined that this proposed
action will not have a significant impact on small entities since the designation will only have the effect of providing
a disposal option for dredged material. Consequently, this Rule does not necessitate preparation of a Regulatory
Flexibility Analysis. 

Under Executive Order 12866, EPA must judge whether a regulation is ``significant'' and therefore subject to the
requirement of a Regulatory Impact Analysis. This action will not result in an annual effect on the economy of $100
million or more or cause any of the other effects which would result in its being classified by the Executive Order as
a ``significant'' rule. Consequently, this Rule does not necessitate preparation of a Regulatory Impact Analysis.


This Proposed Rule does not contain any information collection requirements subject to Office Management and Budget
review under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

Utah; Final Approval of State Underground Storage Tank Program 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Tentative Determination on Application of State of Utah for Final Approval, Public Hearing and Public Comment
Period.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The State of Utah has applied for final approval of its underground storage tank program under Subtitle I of the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reviewed the Utah application
and has made the tentative decision that Utah's underground storage tank (UST) program satisfies all of the requirements
necessary to qualify for final approval. Notably, the State of Utah's statute authorizes the issuance of regulations
that are broader in scope than the Federal regulations. EPA intends to grant final approval to the State to operate
its program in lieu of the Federal program. The State of Utah's application for final approval is available for public
review and comment.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 EPA has tentatively scheduled a public hearing on this determination. If a sufficient number of people express interest
in participating in a hearing by writing to EPA or calling the contact within 30 days of the date of publication of this
notice, EPA will hold a hearing on the date given below in the 

DATES

 section. EPA will notify all persons who submit comments on this notice if it decides to hold the hearing. In addition,
anyone who wishes to learn whether the hearing will be held may call the person listed in the 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT

 section. 



A. Background 




Section 9004 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) enables EPA to approve state underground storage
tank programs to operate in the State in lieu of the Federal underground storage tank (UST) program. Program approval
is granted by EPA if the Agency finds that the State program: (1) is ``no less stringent'' than the Federal program in
all seven elements, and includes notification requirements of section 9004(a)(8), 42 U.S.C. 6991c(a)(8); and (2)
provides for adequate enforcement of compliance with UST standards (Section 9004(a), 42 U.S.C. 6991c(a)). 



B. State of Utah 



In February 1986, the State of Utah established authority through the Utah Solid and Hazardous Waste Act to implement
an underground storage tank program, the State further developed its authority in the UST Act in February 
1989. The State adopted the federal rules and developed some additional rules in February 1989. The State submitted
a draft application for state program approval in September 1992. EPA reviewed and commented on the draft application
and requested additional information to be included in the final application. 

On September 20, 1993, Utah submitted an official application for final approval. Prior to its submission, Utah provided
an opportunity for public notice and comment in the development of its underground storage tank program as required
under  281.50(b). EPA has reviewed Utah's application, and has tentatively determined that the State's program
meets all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final approval. Consequently, EPA intends to grant final approval
to Utah to operate its program in lieu of the Federal program. 

This tentative determination to approve the Utah UST program applies to all activities in Utah outside of Indian Country,
as defined in 18 U.S.C. 1151. The Environmental Protection Agency retains all underground storage tank authority
under RCRA which applies to Indian Country in Utah.

Before EPA would be able to approve the State of Utah UST program for any portion of ``Indian Country,'' the State would
have to provide an appropriate analysis of the State's jurisdiction to enforce in these areas. In order for a state
to satisfy this requirement, it must demonstrate to the EPA's satisfaction that it has authority pursuant to applicable
principles of Federal Indian Law to enforce its laws against existing and potential pollution sources within any
geographical area for which it seeks program approval. EPA is not satisfied that Utah has, at this time, made the requisite
showing of its authority with respect to such lands. 

In withholding program approval for these areas, EPA is not making a determination that the State either has adequate
jurisdiction or lacks such jurisdiction. Should the State of Utah choose to submit analysis with regard to its jurisdiction
over all or part of ``Indian Country'' in the State, it may do so without prejudice. 

EPA's future evaluation of whether to approve the Utah program for ``Indian Country,'' to include Indian reservation
lands, will be governed by EPA's judgment as to whether the State has demonstrated adequate authority to justify such
approval, based upon its understanding of the relevant principles of Federal Indian law and sound administrative
practice. The State may wish to consider EPA's discussion of the related issue of tribal jurisdiction found in the
preamble to the Indian Water Quality Standards Regulation (see 56 FR 64876, December 12, 1991). 

In accordance with section 9004 of RCRA 42 U.S.C. 6991c and 40 CFR 281.50(e), the Agency will accept written comments
on EPA's tentative determination until November 28, 1994. Copies of Utah's application are available for inspection
and copying at the locations indicated in the ``Addresses'' section of this notice. 

EPA will consider all public comments on its tentative determination received during the public comment period.
Issues raised by those comments may be the basis for a decision to deny final approval to Utah. EPA expects to make a final
decision on whether or not to approve Utah's program by January 25, 1995 and will give notice of it in the 

Federal Register

. The notice will include a summary of the reasons for the final determination and a response to all major comments.


The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 6 of Executive Order 12866.


Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this approval will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The approval effectively suspends the applicability of certain
Federal regulations in favor of Utah's program, thereby eliminating duplicative requirements for owners and operators
of underground storage tanks in the State. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This rule, therefore,
does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.

Development of Permit Regulations for Polar Bear Trophy Importation Under the 1994 Amendments to the Marine Mammal
Protection Act 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of intent.


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On April 30, 1994, the Marine Mammal Protection Act (Act) was amended to allow the issuance of permits to import sport-hunted
trophies of polar bears (

Ursus maritimus

) (excluding internal organs) legally taken by the applicant while hunting in Canada, provided certain findings
have been made by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service). These permits may also authorize the importation of
polar bears taken, but not imported, prior to enactment of the Amendments, provided certain conditions are met. The
Service has received a number of inquiries concerning the importation of polar bear trophies. This notice provides
information on the steps the Service is taking to implement this new provision of the Act and the anticipated timeframes.
The Service is working concurrently on developing permit regulations and gathering data to make the legal and scientific
findings required under section 104(c)(5)(A) of the Act. Applications for the import of sport-hunted polar bear
trophies will not be accepted until the completion of the permit rulemaking process early in 1995. The Service will
be able to act on applications once it has resolved several outstanding questions and is able to make the required scientific
findings, in consultation with the Marine Mammal Commission (MMC), and after notice and opportunity for public comment.
In the meantime, a list of interested parties has been established to receive all relevant information as the process
proceeds.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Prior to enactment of amendments to the Act in 1994, those seeking authority to import polar bear trophies from Canada
were required to obtain a waiver of the Act's moratorium on taking and importing marine mammals. The 1994 Amendments
included a streamlined procedure for authorizing such imports by permit. Section 104(c)(5) of the Act sets out a permitting
process, as well as the specific findings that must be made before permits can be issued to import these trophies into
the United States. The Service is developing proposed regulations that will outline the permit application requirements,
procedures, issuance criteria, and fee. The law requires the Service to establish and charge a reasonable fee for
issuing polar bear trophy import permits. As specified in the Amendments, all fees would be used for polar bear conservation
programs being conducted in Alaska and Russia. The Service anticipates publishing a proposed rule promptly so, after
a review of all available data and public comments, a decision can be published as early as possible in calendar year
1995. 



The Service is unable to accept applications for the import of sport-hunted polar bear trophies until the permit rulemaking
process is complete in early 1995. Once the Service has received comments on the application requirements under the
proposed rule, an application form will be developed and submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for approval
under the Paperwork Reduction Act. 

At the same time that the permit rulemaking process is occurring, the Service is working with the Canadian wildlife
authorities to obtain information necessary to make the findings required by section 104(c)(5)(A) of the Act. Prior
to issuing a permit, the Service must find that (1) the applicant has provided the necessary documentation to show
that the polar bear was legally harvested in Canada by the applicant; (2) Canada has a monitored and enforced sport-hunting
program consistent with the purposes of the 1971 International Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears; (3)
Canada's sport-hunting program is based on scientifically sound quotas ensuring the maintenance of the affected
population stock at a sustainable level; (4) the export and subsequent import are consistent with the provisions
of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and other international agreements and conventions;
and (5) the export and subsequent import are not likely to contribute to illegal trade in bear parts. 

The Service is to make these findings after notice and opportunity for public comment and in consultation with the
MMC, an independent Federal agency with statutory authority to make recommendations pursuant to Title II of the Act.
Several questions have come to the attention of the Service. A contract report prepared for the MMC in 1993 has questioned
whether Canada's sport-hunting program is fully consistent with Article III of the Agreement. In addition, the Amendments
require the Service to make the determination of sustainability of hunting quotas at the population level, but Canada
manages polar bears at the subpopulation level. The Service is currently pursuing the resolution of these and related
questions concerning its ability to make the required findings. Once these questions have been resolved and the Service
is able to make the findings outlined above, it will be able to act on applications. The Service seeks information regarding
each of these five findings. 

While conducting these activities, the Service will need to evaluate its actions under the National Environmental
Policy Act (NEPA), as appropriate. 

By April 30, 1996, the Service is to undertake a scientific review of the impact of permits issued on the Canadian polar
bear population stocks. An opportunity for public comment will be part of this review, with the responses included
in the final report. Permit issuance can continue after September 30, 1996, only if the Service determines, based
on scientific review, that the issuance of permits is not having a significant adverse impact on the polar bear populations
stocks in Canada.

ACTION: 

Proposed rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing to amend its current adverse experience reporting regulations
for human drug products and for licensed biological products to provide consistency with the elements of FDA Form
3500A and require the use of this new reporting form; revise certain definitions and reporting periods and formats
as recommended by the International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of
Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) and the World Health Organization's Council for International Organizations
of Medical Sciences (CIOMS); require applicants or manufacturers, packers, and distributors to develop written
procedures for monitoring and reporting adverse experiences; state that reports of adverse experiences that are
forwarded by FDA to the applicant or manufacturer, packer, and distributor should not be resubmitted to the agency;
and make other revisions to the regulations to provide uniformity in adverse experience reporting for human drug
products and licensed biological products. These changes would simplify and facilitate the reporting of adverse
experiences and would enhance agencywide consistency in the collection of postmarketing adverse experience data.
In addition, FDA is proposing to amend the requirements for clinical study design and conduct and the sponsor reporting
requirements in the investigational new drug application (IND) regulations. These amendments are intended to provide
more complete and accurate information that would enable sponsors, investigators, and FDA to determine serious
toxicities of investigational drugs more expeditiously during clinical studies.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


I. Background 


In the 

Federal Register

 of June 3, 1993 (58 FR 31596), FDA announced the availability of a new form for reporting adverse events and product
problems with medications, devices, and other FDA-regulated medical products. This form is available in two versions.
One version of the form (FDA Form 3500) is to be used by health professionals for voluntary reporting; the other version
of the form (FDA Form 3500A) is to be used by applicants or manufacturers (including licensed manufacturers of licensed
biological products), and other persons subject to mandatory reporting requirements under FDA regulations. Under
existing regulations, drug manufacturers, packers, and distributors and applicants for new drug products and generic
drug products must report adverse events under   310.305 and 314.80 (21 CFR 310.305 and 314.80). Elsewhere
in this issue of the 

Federal Register

, FDA is issuing a final rule establishing new  600.80. This section makes licensed manufacturers of biological
products subject to certain reporting requirements. 
The new form is part of FDA's Medical Products Reporting Program (MedWatch) and is designed to encourage and facilitate
the reporting of adverse events and product problems for most FDA-regulated human medical products by the entire
health care community, including manufacturers, distributors, user facilities, and health professionals. FDA
issued the new form to simplify and consolidate the reporting of suspected adverse events and product problems with
human drug products, biologics, and medical devices, as well as the reporting of adverse events with other FDA-regulated
medical products, such as dietary supplements. FDA has found that, under the current system, there is some confusion
about what to report to the agency and that the existing assortment of reporting forms and systems can interfere with
the efficient reporting of suspected problems. FDA has attempted to clarify and simplify adverse event reporting
with the new form by eliminating redundant or nonessential elements and by clarifying those areas that have caused
confusion. 
FDA Form 3500A replaces current Form FDA-1639, as well as most other adverse event and product problem reporting
forms currently required by the agency. Adverse events associated with vaccines will continue to be reported through
the FDA and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). FDA is proposing
to amend the adverse experience reporting requirements for human drug products and for licensed biological products
to be consistent with the elements of FDA Form 3500A.
In developing FDA Forms 3500 and 3500A, the agency considered several recommendations from ICH and CIOMS. These organizations
were formed to facilitate international consideration of issues, particularly safety issues, concerning the use
of both foreign and domestic data in the development and use of drugs and biological products. ICH has worked to promote
the harmonization of technical requirements for the registration of pharmaceutical products among three regions:
The European Union, Japan, and the United States. ICH has prepared a draft guideline specific to parts of this issue
entitled: ``Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting.'' In the 

Federal Register

 of July 9, 1993 (58 FR 37408), FDA published this draft guideline for public comment. Several CIOMS working groups
have worked to coordinate and standardize the international reporting of postmarketing adverse drug reactions
by pharmaceutical manufacturers to regulatory authorities. CIOMS Working Group II has proposed an international
system of standardized time intervals, formats, and inclusion criteria in order to lessen confusion and reduce preparation
time among manufacturers and to enable them to report postmarketing adverse experiences more rapidly, efficiently,
and effectively (Refs. 1 and 2). FDA believes that many changes recommended by CIOMS and ICH would result in more effective
reporting of serious adverse experiences to regulatory authorities worldwide. FDA is proposing to amend the adverse
experience reporting requirements for human drug products and licensed biological products in part to be consistent
with certain standardized definitions, procedures, and formats proposed by these international organizations.

FDA is also proposing to amend the requirements for clinical study design and conduct and the sponsor reporting requirements
in the IND regulations. These amendments are intended to provide more complete and accurate information that would
enable sponsors, investigators, and FDA to determine serious toxicities of investigational drugs more expeditiously
during clinical studies. A clinical study of fialuridine (FIAU) resulted in several instances of severe liver and
pancreatic injury and five deaths, beginning in June 1993. This incident prompted FDA to establish a task force to
see whether the data available before the study gave any suggestion of the serious toxicity that emerged, and whether
some differences in process or behavior by investigators and sponsors might have made it possible or more likely for
them to have anticipated the toxicity in the 1993 study. The proposed IND amendments contained in this document are
largely the result of recommendations by this task force. 


II. Description of the Proposed Rule


A. Replacement of Form FDA-1639 and How to Obtain Copies of FDA Form 3500A


FDA's existing regulations at 21 CFR 20.112, 310.305, and 314.80 refer to Form FDA-1639. The agency is proposing
to amend these regulations to replace references to Form FDA-1639 with new FDA Form 3500A. This change is necessary
because new FDA Form 3500A replaces Form FDA-1639 (58 FR 31596).
The existing regulations at   310.305(d)(4) and 314.80(f)(4)) also provide an address where a person
may obtain copies of Form FDA-1639. FDA is proposing to amend these regulations to state where a person can obtain
copies of FDA Form 3500A. Ten or fewer copies of FDA Form 3500A and a copy of the instructions for completing the form
can be obtained from the Division of Epidemiology and Surveillance (HFD-730), Center for Drug Evaluation and
Research, Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857. Large numbers of copies (greater
than 10 copies) may be obtained by writing to the Consolidated Forms and Publications Distribution Center, Washington
Commerce Center, 3222 Hubbard Rd., Landover, MD 20785.


B. Definitions of ``Data Lock-Point'' and ``International Birth Date'' 

FDA is proposing to amend   314.80(a) and 600.80(a) to define the terms ``data lock-point'' and ``international
birth date.'' The ``data lock-point'' is the end of the reporting period (cutoff date) for data to be incorporated
into a specific postmarketing adverse experience periodic report. On this date, the data available to the reporter
are held for review and evaluation by the applicant or licensed manufacturer prior to being submitted to FDA. The international
birth date is the date that the first regulatory authority in the world approved the human drug or biological product
for marketing. As explained further in section II.E. of this document, each 6-month anniversary of the international
birth date is the data lock-point for data to be incorporated into a specific postmarketing adverse experience periodic
report.
The proposed rule would define these terms because they describe the standardized international reporting period
developed by CIOMS for submitting postmarketing adverse experience reports. CIOMS developed this standardized
reporting period to lessen confusion and to enable applicants and licensed manufacturers to prepare and submit similar
reports of adverse experiences to regulatory authorities. It would also reduce preparation time among applicants
and licensed manufacturers because it eliminates varying due dates presently required for submitting postmarketing
adverse experience reports to regulatory authorities worldwide. FDA believes the CIOMS reporting schedule, which
decreases reporting rates currently required by FDA for drug and licensed biological products for the first 3 years
of marketing from every 3 months to every 6 months and increases it thereafter from every 12 months to every 6 months,
permits adequate time for reporters to make periodic submissions to regulatory authorities. In addition, the agency
believes that the proposed reporting frequency is sufficient to notify FDA of potential postmarketing safety problems
that do not require expedited reporting. 


C. Definition of ``Serious''


FDA's existing adverse experience reporting regulations (21 CFR 310.305(b)(4), 312.32(a), 314.80(a), and 600.80(a))
define a serious adverse experience as one that is ``fatal or life-threatening, is permanently disabling, requires
inpatient hospitalization, or is a congenital anomaly, cancer, or overdose.'' Consistent with new FDA Form 3500A
and with recommendations by the ICH and CIOMS, the proposed rule would amend this definition to read as follows: 




Serious

 means an adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that is fatal or life-threatening, results in persistent or
significant disability/incapacity, requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization, necessitates medical or
surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure,
or is a congenital anomaly.


The agency is proposing to remove ``cancer'' from the definition because cancer would most often be reported under
the other broader elements in the definition. For example, cancer may be reported as life-threatening or requiring
inpatient hospitalization. Other diseases or conditions that may be life-threatening or require hospitalization,
such as heart disease or myocardial infarction, have not been identified as separate elements in previous definitions,
and the agency believes it is not necessary to single out cancer. 
The proposed amendment would also remove ``overdose'' from the definition of serious. Reports of overdoses that
had serious outcomes would still be reported under the other broader elements in the definition. Reports of overdoses
that did not lead to outcomes defined as serious would provide the agency with less critical safety information.
By adding the phrase ``occurring at any dose'' after ``adverse drug experience'' in the definition, the agency will
ensure that a serious adverse experience at any dose, whether it is the labeled dose or a different dose, including
an overdose or an underdose, should be reported. 
FDA is also proposing to clarify the phrase ``is permanently disabling'' by substituting ``results in persistent
or significant disability/incapacity.'' This change is intended to clarify that a disability need not be permanent
to be considered a serious adverse experience. 
The proposed amendments would also modify the phrase ``requires inpatient hospitalization'' to read ``requires
or prolongs inpatient hospitalization.'' This change is intended to cover those situations where a serious adverse
experience occurs while the patient is already hospitalized, and the adverse experience prolongs the patient's
hospital stay. 
FDA is also proposing to add the phrase ``necessitates medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment
of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure.'' The agency believes such events should be considered
serious adverse experiences and should be reported. This change is also consistent with ICH's proposed definition
of a serious adverse event. FDA notes that a serious adverse experience would not include the discontinuation of therapy,
changes in dosage, or routine treatment with a prescription medication.


D. Definitions of ``Disability'' and ``Life-Threatening''


The proposed rule would amend   310.305(b), 314.80(a), and 600.80(a) to define the terms ``disability''
and ``life-threatening.'' These terms further explain what constitutes a serious adverse experience. ``Disability''
means a substantial disruption of one's ability to carry out normal life functions. ``Life-threatening'' means
that the patient was, in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the adverse experience as
it occurred. It does not include an adverse experience that, had it occurred in a more serious form, might have caused
death. For example, product-induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic failure would not be considered
life-threatening even though hepatitis of a more severe nature can be fatal. Similarly, an allergic reaction resulting
in angioedema of the face would not be life-threatening, even though angioedema of the larynx, allergic bronchospasm,
or anaphylaxis can be fatal. FDA believes these definitions will help enable reporters to determine when a serious
adverse experience occurs.


E. Periodic Adverse Experience Reports


Current regulations (  314.80(c)(2)(i) and 600.80(c)(2)(i)) require the submission of periodic postmarketing
reports at quarterly intervals for 3 years from the date of approval of the application, and then annually. Quarterly
reports must be submitted within 30 days of the close of the quarter (the first quarter beginning on the date of U.S.
approval of the application); each annual report must be submitted within 60 days of the date of U.S. approval of the
application.
FDA is proposing to revise this schedule by requiring the submission of periodic postmarketing adverse reaction
reports every 6 months. The first 6-month anniversary of the international birth date after the application is approved
in the United States is the data lock-point for the first periodic reporting term. Each subsequent 6-month anniversary
of the international birth date is the data lock-point for subsequent periodic reporting terms for that particular
product. The proposed rule would require periodic reports to be submitted to FDA within 45 days after the data lock-point.
For example, a product approved by FDA, or licensed, if a biological product, on June 15, with an international birth
date of April 1, would have its first data lock-point on October 1, which is less than 6 months after FDA approval, but
which is the 6-month anniversary of the international birth date. Therefore, the first periodic report would be for
the period of June 15 to October 1 and would be due at FDA by November 14. The second periodic report would cover October
2 to April 1 and would be due to the agency no later than May 15. 
The proposed rule would create the same reporting schedule based on the international birth date and data lock-point
for licensed biological product distribution reports under  600.80(c)(3).
This new reporting schedule is consistent with the standardized international reporting period proposed by the
CIOMS II Working Group. This working group has recommended that all international regulatory authorities accept
the same reporting schedule in order to lessen confusion and reduce preparation time by manufacturers, rather than
the current system of varying due dates. FDA believes the CIOMS reporting schedule, which decreases reporting rates
currently required by FDA for drug and licensed biological products for the first 3 years of marketing from every 3
months to every 6 months and increases reporting rates thereafter from every 12 months to every 6 months, permits adequate
time for reporters to make nonexpedited submissions to regulatory authorities. In addition, FDA believes that the
proposed reporting frequency is sufficient to alert the agency to potential postmarketing safety problems that
are not within the categories requiring 15-day ``Alert reports.'' 
Applicants and licensed manufacturers who wish to submit periodic postmarketing adverse experience reports at
different intervals could, under proposed   314.80(c)(2)(i) and 600.80(c)(2)(i), submit a request
for a waiver under 21 CFR 314.90 or 600.90 to alter the reporting intervals for these periodic reports. 
Proposed   314.80(c)(2)(i) and 600.80(c)(2)(i) would also amend the reporting requirements for periodic
postmarketing adverse experience reports to state that, in cases where the applicant or licensed manufacturer has
received no reports of adverse experiences during a reporting period, the applicant or licensed manufacturer should
submit a copy of the current approved labeling and a letter to the agency in place of a periodic postmarketing adverse
experience report. The letter should identify the product, the application number, and the reporting period, and
state that no adverse experience reports were received during that reporting period.
Sections 314.80(c)(2)(ii) and 600.80(c)(2)(ii) set forth the contents currently required for a periodic report:
(1) A narrative summary and analysis of the information in the report and an analysis of the 15-day postmarketing Alert
reports submitted during the reporting interval; (2) a report describing each adverse experience not previously
reported; and (3) a history of actions taken since the last periodic report. FDA is proposing to amend these regulations
to provide a more extensive list of contents for a periodic postmarketing adverse experience report, as follows:


1. Title Page, Table of Contents, and Introduction


This section would provide a summary of the periodic report with page references to detailed data and information.


2. Applicant's Core Safety Data Sheet


The applicant's core safety data sheet would be a document prepared by the applicant that contains all relevant safety
information, including adverse drug experiences, which the applicant believes should be listed for the drug in all
countries where the drug is marketed. It may be used by the applicant as the reference document by which an adverse drug
experience is judged to be expected or unexpected for purposes of this postmarketing periodic report. For all other
determinations of whether an adverse drug experience is expected or unexpected, the definition in   314.80(a)
or 600.80(a) would apply.
FDA recognizes that the postmarketing periodic report may be submitted by the applicant to multiple countries and
the product may have different approved labels in the different countries. The use of the applicant's core safety
data sheet as the reference document for determining whether an adverse drug experience is expected or not may result
in some overreporting of unexpected adverse events that actually are expected by the U.S. approved product label.
This is because the approved label for the United States may have more safety information included in it than the manufacturer's
core safety data sheet. 
An applicant may also use the approved U.S. label as the reference by which expected and unexpected adverse drug experiences
are determined for the postmarketing periodic report. If an applicant chooses to use the approved U.S. label for this
purpose, it must clearly be stated in this section of the report. In all instances, if an adverse event is not listed
in the U.S. label, but is in the manufacturer's core safety data sheet, this shall be clearly noted in the ``Overall
safety evaluation'' (see section II.E.8. of this document).
This section would also highlight clearly any changes and the reasons for the changes in the applicant's core safety
data sheet since the previous postmarketing periodic report.


3. The Product's Marketing Status


This section would contain, in tabular form, a chronological history of the marketing status of the product worldwide
(all regulatory and marketing decisions affecting the product) from the date it was first approved through its current
status. Approvals or applications voluntarily withdrawn for safety reasons would have to be included. The product
would be listed by chemical (U.S. Adopted Names, international nonproprietary names, or proper name in accordance
with ``Chemical Abstracts Nomenclature Standards'') and brand name(s). 


4. Regulatory Actions for Safety Reasons 


This section would identify in narrative form the reasons for significant regulatory authority or manufacturer-initiated
actions taken anywhere in the world, or to be taken imminently, for safety reasons during the reporting period. This
would include, for example, application withdrawal or license suspension or failure to renew, distribution restrictions,
clinical trial suspension, labeling changes due to significant safety concerns, dosage modifications, or pharmaceutical
changes.


5. Patient Exposure


This section would include the product's domestic and foreign marketing distribution data during the reporting
period. This information would be used to calculate the extent of patient exposure. The method used by the manufacturer
to estimate patient exposure would always be described and would include the total number of dosage units of each dosage
form and strength or potency (e.g., 100,000/5-milligram tablets, 50,000/10-milliliter vials).


6. Individual Case Histories


These reports would be presented in line listing format with the following 10 columns: country, source, age, gender,
dose, duration of treatment (prior to event), time to onset, description of reaction (as reported), outcome (e.g.,
fatal, resolved), other comments (e.g., manufacturer's report number). This format is consistent with that suggested
by CIOMS. In addition, a tabular summary of the number of adverse events by body system may be included. The individual
case reports would consist of adverse drug experiences that are: (a) Serious, unexpected reports from published
or unpublished clinical studies where it has been concluded that there is a reasonable possibility that the drug or
licensed biological product caused the adverse experience; (b) serious, expected or unexpected spontaneous adverse
drug experience reports and nonserious, unexpected spontaneous adverse experience reports received directly
by the applicant or licensed manufacturer from the initial reporter or received by the applicant or licensed manufacturer
from a drug regulatory authority, both U.S. or foreign; and (c) serious, expected or unexpected individual published
case histories and nonserious, unexpected individual published case histories. This section would end with an analysis
by the reporter, in narrative form, of the cases submitted. The applicant or licensed manufacturer would also attach
to the end of the postmarketing periodic report a completed FDA Form 3500A for all U.S. spontaneous reports of adverse
experiences except those not to be included in the periodic report as specified in proposed   314.80(c)(1)(i)
and (c)(1)(ii) and 600.80(c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii), or those sent by FDA to the applicant or licensed manufacturer.


7. Safety Studies 


This section would analyze and discuss fully and critically all toxicological, clinical, and epidemiological studies
containing important safety information. 


8. Overall Safety Evaluation


This section would provide critical analysis of the safety information provided in the periodic report as it pertains
to serious unexpected reactions, increased frequencies of known toxicity, reactions listed in the manufacturer's
core safety data sheet but not included in the U.S. label, drug or licensed biological product interactions, overdose,
drug or licensed biological product abuse, experiences during pregnancy or lactation, chronic treatment, pediatric
or geriatric treatment, and new safety issues. For each of these areas, any absence of significant information would
be reported. The evaluation would indicate whether the safety profile of the product remains consistent with cumulative
experience to date and with the previous manufacturer's core safety data sheet. The evaluation would specify any
action recommended and the reasons for such recommendations.


9. Other Information


This section would consist of important information received after the data lock-point. It may include significant
new cases or followup data that affect the interpretation or evaluation of existing reports.


10. FDA Form 3500A


This section would consist of a completed FDA Form 3500A for each spontaneous U.S. adverse drug experience not reported
under paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii) in   314.80 and 600.80. 


11. Location of Adverse Experience Records


This section would identify the current address(es), including street, city, State, and zip code, where all adverse
experience reports and records are maintained.
This revised list of contents for periodic postmarketing adverse experience reports is generally consistent with
the international system of standardized postmarketing periodic reporting procedures and formats proposed by
the CIOMS II Working Group. This standardization would allow applicants and licensed manufacturers to prepare a
single postmarketing periodic report of adverse experiences for regulatory authorities worldwide. The agency
also believes that the proposed rule would improve reporting and would enhance FDA's ability to monitor potential
postmarketing safety problems. 
As a result of this proposed revised list of contents for periodic postmarketing adverse experience reports, FDA
is proposing to remove   314.80(c)(2)(iii) and 600.80(c)(2)(iii). These sections state that periodic
reporting does not apply to information obtained from postmarketing studies, reports in the scientific literature,
and foreign marketing experience. The proposed revised list of contents would include such information.


F. IND Amendments


FDA regulations governing the use of investigational drugs in clinical investigations are contained in part 312
(21 CFR part 312). In order to conduct a clinical investigation using an investigational drug, a sponsor must first
submit an IND, described in  312.23, which contains, among other things, a description of the drug, the results
of preclinical studies intended to show that the drug can be introduced into humans with reasonable safety, and a proposed
protocol for the investigation. This protocol provides a description of all aspects of the study, including the identity
and qualifications of the investigators conducting the study, procedures and criteria for selecting subjects,
the amount of the drug to be administered, the duration of use, the observations to be made to assess the effects of the
drug, and the clinical procedures, laboratory tests, and other measures carried out to minimize risk to the patient.
After the IND becomes effective and the investigational drug is being administered to human subjects, the sponsor
is required under  312.32 to make both telephone and written safety reports on serious and unexpected adverse
experiences associated with the administration of the drug, as well as written reports only, on other serious adverse
events associated with administration of the drug. Under current  312.33, the sponsor is also required to submit
an annual report containing significant safety and other information. If FDA concludes that a study would place subjects
at unreasonable and significant risk, FDA may place a study on clinical hold. This means that the drug may not be administered
to subjects until the hold is lifted (see  312.42). FDA may also terminate the study under  312.44 based
on such safety concerns.
FDA is concerned that these IND reporting requirements may not be adequate to protect against some unexpected adverse
events. For example, there is a potential for such events to be disguised by patient conditions that might lead the
investigator to conclude that the experimental drug was not implicated in those events. The agency believes that
certain modifications in the way clinical investigations are conducted and reported may help to ensure that drug
toxicity is detected as early as possible. A recent internal task force that examined an incident that involved a fatal
drug toxicity that was not detected in early trials has recommended improvements in IND reporting that the agency
is incorporating into this proposal for public consideration. These improvements, as explained below, are intended
to provide more frequent and more complete evaluations of potentially serious adverse effects so that drug-related
events can be detected earlier by sponsors, investigators, and FDA. 
A clinical study of a nucleoside analog, FIAU, resulted in several instances of severe liver injury and five deaths,
beginning in June 1993. The study involved 15 subjects with chronic hepatitis B virus infection. FIAU had been considered
a highly promising agent without recognized serious toxicity. This incident prompted FDA to establish a task force
to see whether the data available prior to the study gave any suggestion of the serious toxicity that emerged. The task
force examined data from the 1993 FIAU study as well as data from previous studies on FIAU and a closely related drug
conducted by another sponsor. The data from these previous studies was, or should have been, available to the sponsor
of the 1993 FIAU study. The task force was also to determine whether some differences in process or behavior by investigators
and sponsors might have made it possible or more likely to have anticipated the toxicity. The proposed IND amendments
contained in this document are largely the result of recommendations by the task force (Ref. 3).
Focusing on hepatic and pancreatic adverse events, the task force reviewed the data and data analyses that were available
to investigators, sponsors, and FDA at the start of the study to determine whether improvements in the rules governing
design, analysis, and reporting of data from clinical studies were warranted. The task force found a number of observations
and events that suggested an association between FIAU and hepatic and/or pancreatic abnormalities. However, none
of these events was attributed by the sponsors or investigators to FIAU. Rather, each event, even when recognized
as temporally related to a study, was attributed by investigators and sponsors to other factors, such as concomitant
drug administration and/or concurrent illness. The task force found that an overview of the data, in which deaths
and serious adverse experiences were analyzed cumulatively, and, with the hypothesis that the events were drug related,
was not produced and thus was not available for use by the sponsors, the principal investigators, or FDA reviewers.
Rather, the analyses performed focused on each individual event and determined a plausible explanation, other than
drug toxicity, for each occurrence. The task force recommended that, to detect similar patterns of events reflecting
toxicity in future studies, sponsors should conduct cumulative analyses with a systematic consideration of the
possibility that the adverse events are caused by the investigational drug. 
The proposed IND amendments would apply to all investigational studies conducted under part 312. However, FDA invites
comments from the public and industry on whether any or all of the proposed requirements should apply only to certain
IND's, whose selection could be determined by application of criteria that could be included in these regulations,
or only to certain phases of drug testing.


1. Clinical Study Design


FDA is proposing to amend the requirements governing IND format and content in  312.23. Under current  312.23(a)(6),
an IND must contain the protocols for each planned study, including information such as a statement of the study's
objectives and purpose, the criteria for patient selection and exclusion, a description of the study design, the
method for determining the dose(s) to be administered and the duration of individual patient exposure to the drug,
and a description of clinical procedures, laboratory tests, or other measures to be taken to monitor the effects of
the drug in human subjects and to minimize risk.
In several instances, FDA's FIAU task force found that deaths and serious hepatic and pancreatic injuries that appear
in retrospect to have been related to FIAU were attributed by investigators and sponsors to the subjects' underlying
disease or to other drugs the subjects were taking for their conditions. The task force made several recommendations
intended to improve the likelihood that clinical studies will identify, early in drug development, drug toxicity
that mimics the underlying disease or the toxicity of concomitant medications. These recommendations include:
(1) Choosing study designs and safety endpoints that increase a study's ability to distinguish drug toxicity from
underlying disease or other drug toxicity; (2) prospectively identifying observations that will trigger certain
actions by investigators; and (3) summarizing safety data at regular intervals with systematic considerations
of the possibility that adverse events are drug related. The proposed rule would create new  312.23(a)(6)(iii)(h)
to require that the protocols describe any adverse clinical or laboratory outcomes in the study that are to be immediately
reported to the sponsor. These reportable events might include death, any life-threatening event, or any other serious
event that might reflect potential drug toxicity, as suggested by preclinical data, and include abnormal laboratory
results falling outside of a specified range. The identified events and abnormal laboratory values are to include
those that focus attention on toxicity that may target the same organs and body systems as the underlying disease or
concomitant medications. Under the proposal, these events would be reported to the sponsor even if they are potentially
attributable to the patient's underlying disease or concomitant medications. Proposed  312.23(a)(6)(iii)(h)
would also require instructions for investigators, such as reporting requirements, remeasurement or challenge
procedures, or discontinuation of the drug in response to identified events. 
The task force also recommended that sponsors consider the use of a control group (for example, placebo, active control,
or historical control) in studies that focus on safety when the underlying disease process is likely to produce adverse
events that might be confused with drug toxicity. The task force concluded that such controls would help detect some
adverse events. Consequently, proposed  312.23(a)(6)(iii)(

i

) states that sponsors should consider the use of a formal control group when the underlying disease is likely to produce
adverse events that might be confused with drug toxicity.
The task force also recommended that sponsors attempt to estimate the expected incidence of death and serious adverse
events in the study population that arise from the underlying disease or concomitant medications used to treat the
disease. This recommendation is reflected in proposed new  312.23(a)(6)(iii)(

j

) that would require sponsors to provide such estimates. Under the proposal, any deaths or adverse events that exceed
the estimates would create the presumption that the events are associated with use of the investigational drug, and
the sponsor would be required to submit a written safety report to FDA.
The task force found that the followup periods in some of the FIAU and related studies were too short to detect some of
the adverse events that occurred because significant adverse events sometimes occurred weeks to months after dosing
with FIAU ended.
The task force recommended that all protocols contained in the IND include an explicit description of the length and
type of followup to be performed so that the agency may review the followup procedures (task force report at 57). Accordingly,
FDA is proposing to add new  312.23(a)(6)(iii)(k) to require that the protocol section of an IND specify and
justify the length and type of followup for subjects after the conclusion of dosing. The justification may be brief;
for example, a reference to a study of a similar drug with the same followup period. The followup period would ensure
that clinical studies are adequately designed to detect drug toxicity that occurs after the conclusion of drug dosing.
The sponsor would propose an appropriate followup period based on preclinical data, experience with other members
of the drug class, the drug's mechanism of action, and prior human experience. The intensity of the followup may change
with time; e.g., a full evaluation might be scheduled for 2 weeks postdosing, with a telephone followup for possible
serious events at a later time. Ordinarily, in Phase 1 and 2 studies, telephone followup should occur at 3 months after
the dosing is completed, but alternative timeframes and procedures can be proposed by the sponsor. For some drugs,
like FIAU, a review of available data may suggest that the minimum followup period should be longer than 3 months. 
Current regulations in  312.56 require sponsors to review and evaluate the evidence relating to a drug's safety
and effectiveness as it is obtained from investigators. The regulations also require sponsors to report safety information
to FDA. The task force observed that in the FIAU study sponsors may not have had available adequate resources to evaluate
safety data reported by investigators. The proposed rule would amend  312.56(c) to require sponsors, in addition
to reviewing and evaluating safety and effectiveness information, to develop a safety monitoring and evaluation
program before starting clinical trials. This provision is intended to ensure that sponsors have or will develop
adequate resources to evaluate safety data reported by investigators and is consistent with the task force's recommendations
(see task force report at 57). Consistent with this proposed requirement, FDA is also proposing in new  312.23(a)(3)(v)
that an IND contain a description of any safety monitoring and evaluation program. This description would be in addition
to the introductory statement and general investigational plan that are required under current regulations.


2. Safety Reports


FDA is proposing several amendments to the requirements for IND safety reports in  312.32. FDA is proposing
to alter the period for submitting written safety reports, under  312.32(c)(1)(i) and (d)(3), from 10 working
days to 15 calendar days, and for submitting safety reports by telephone, under  312.32(c)(2), from 3 working
days to 7 calendar days. FDA is also proposing to allow telephone safety reports to be made by facsimile transmission
as well as orally by telephone. These changes will give sponsors additional time to gather appropriate data to help
interpret the reports before submitting these reports. FDA believes the extended time period would be sufficient
to alert the agency to potential safety problems, especially because of the new investigational reporting requirements
the agency is proposing. 
Proposed  312.32(c) would also permit sponsors to submit IND safety reports to the agency by using FDA Form 3500A.
If FDA determined that insufficient data were submitted on FDA Form 3500A, the agency could require additional narrative
data to be submitted. As explained elsewhere in this proposal, this amendment is consistent with the proposal to use
this form for postmarketing reporting of human drug and licensed biological product adverse experiences.
FDA is also proposing to amend the disclaimer contained in  312.32(e) to emphasize that safety information
submitted to FDA are not to be considered admissions of causation or liability. The proposal would substitute the
word ``part'' for ``section'' so that the revised disclaimer would clearly apply to all safety information submitted
under part 312. Summaries of such safety information would not constitute a statement or admission that there was
a causal link between the administration of the drug and the subsequent adverse event. 


3. Semiannual Reports 


FDA is proposing to amend the periodic reporting requirements in  312.33 by adding, in addition to the annual
report, a semiannual death and serious adverse experiences report. This change is intended to ensure that reports
of deaths and other serious adverse experiences in all clinical studies are collected and reviewed in a timely and
comprehensive manner, and that the possibility of drug relatedness is always considered.
Under current regulations, sponsors must report deaths and serious and unexpected adverse experiences within 3
or 10 working days only if the events are associated with the use of the drug. ``Associated with the use of the drug''
is defined to mean that there is a reasonable possibility that the experience may have been caused by the drug (see  312.32(a)).
Deaths and a summary of serious adverse experiences that occur in a clinical trial that the sponsor concludes are not
associated with use of the drug must be reported only in an IND annual report. The task force found that many adverse
experiences occurring during the FIAU study that appear, in retrospect, to have been drug related were not reported
in safety reports, although, at times, they were reported in the annual report as attributable to causes other than
FIAU. 
The proposed rule, therefore, would create a new ``semiannual report'' to require, among other things, the submission
of reports of all deaths, serious adverse experiences, and study discontinuations resulting from an adverse experience,
whether expected or unexpected and whether or not there was thought to be a possibility that the death or adverse experience
was caused by the drug. In these twice yearly reports, sponsors would also report all deaths and serious adverse experiences
that occurred during the trial or within the prescribed followup period. The report would include data not only from
studies conducted under the IND, but also data from all premarketing studies of the drug conducted worldwide, with
an analysis of all unexpected deaths, serious adverse experiences, and study discontinuations thought to be related
to the study drug from foreign postmarketing clinical trials and from foreign postmarketing spontaneous or required
reporting systems. Serious adverse events should include laboratory changes that result in discontinuation or
that are identified in the study protocol as reportable events. Sponsors would present these data both for the 6-month
reporting interval and cumulatively, and submit an analysis of the data. The agency would expect the analysis to conform
generally to the evaluation of deaths, serious adverse experiences, and discontinuations in the section entitled
``Integrated Summary of Safety Information'' in FDA's ``Guideline for the Format and Content of the Clinical and
Statistical Sections of New Drug Applications.'' FDA also recommends that the sponsor employ, in preparing the analysis,
at least one individual who had no involvement in conducting the clinical study. The proposal would also require a
sponsor to conduct a ``worst-case'' analysis of the safety data, presuming that observed adverse events were the
result of toxicity from the investigational drug, and then attempt to refute this presumption, with appropriate
data and evaluations (task force report at 59). The analysis should include estimates of the rate of an analyzed event
occurring spontaneously in the population and specific analyses of cases.
The sponsor would submit the semiannual report for the 6-month period following the day the IND goes into effect, and
for each 6-month period thereafter, until the end of the followup period specified in the protocol. The report would
be due within 60 days of the end of the reporting period. The semiannual safety report that is due during the same period
as the annual report would be submitted with the annual report.
The task force recommended (task force report at 59) that FDA require the submission of all available autopsy reports
and medical reports concerning all deaths reported in these semiannual reports, because, in at least one instance
during the FIAU study, the cause of death originally reported was not fully consistent with the autopsy and terminal
medical reports later obtained for that subject. Proposed  312.33(b)(2) would require the submission of these
reports and would require the sponsor to clarify any inconsistencies between these reports and the cause of death
reported to FDA by the sponsor. FDA is proposing this requirement to help ensure that reports covering deaths submitted
to the agency are complete and accurate. 
Under proposed  312.33(b)(3), at the request of the sponsor, or on its own initiative, FDA may modify certain
semiannual reporting requirements where, for example, the clinical study endpoint is mortality or where the study
is blinded and full compliance with the reporting requirement would require breaking the blind. FDA is proposing
this provision because studies vary concerning the nature and seriousness of the disease to be treated, the number
of subjects exposed to the drug, and the general pace at which the drug's development proceeds.


4. Special Safety Summary


In new  312.37(a), FDA also proposes an additional mechanism to allow the agency to obtain safety data on investigational
drugs and summaries of these data not otherwise obtained through other reporting requirements if, and when, these
data are necessary. Most investigational drugs do not present unusual safety concerns, so that the safety data contained
in the 6-month and annual reports, as well as the IND safety reports submitted under  312.32, would provide adequate
information to allow FDA to observe drug safety. Some drugs, however, may raise significant safety concerns either
anticipated or unanticipated, so that more comprehensive data on events that do not meet the definition of a serious
adverse reaction as well as those that do are needed. Events that might trigger this heightened scrutiny include agency
experience with similar drugs, animal toxicity study results, and information derived from IND safety, annual,
or semiannual reports. As recommended by the task force (task force report at 59 and 60), the proposed regulation is
drafted in general language to allow the agency, in consultation with the sponsor, flexibility in determining when
a report should be required and what information it should contain. This flexibility is considered necessary because
the specifics of the safety summary may vary from study to study. FDA anticipates that the safety summary will generally
not only contain the results of the cumulative analysis of deaths and serious adverse experiences contained in the
6-month report, but also an analysis of related events of lesser seriousness. 
Although the task force recommended that FDA require safety summaries unless an exemption had been granted to the
sponsor, FDA is proposing to require safety summaries only for those studies or products where the agency has determined
that a specific need for them exists. FDA would generally expect safety summaries to be submitted within 30 days after
they are requested; however, the agency recognizes that in cases where large amounts of data are required to be summarized
and those data are not readily available or easily summarized, a longer period of time may be necessary to prepare the
summary.


5. Final Clinical Study Report 


Information about FIAU risks and benefits that the sponsor might have derived from the process of collecting and analyzing
study results was delayed or never developed because final reports were not required for the earlier clinical studies
of FIAU and FIAC (a closely related nucleoside analog). Thus, FDA is proposing in  312.37(b) to require sponsors
to submit, when required by FDA, a final report or study summary of a clinical study. FDA anticipates that final reports
usually will not be necessary. Instituting requirements for semiannual reporting of deaths, serious adverse experiences,
and discontinuations, and for summarization of all safety data will largely fulfill the need for more careful monitoring
and analysis of potential drug toxicity during drug testing. In some cases, however, it may still be valuable to have
available an analysis of the results of particular trials; e.g., to provide data on the likely effectiveness of a drug
for purposes of weighing risks against likely benefits to study subjects. The proposal would
require final clinical study reports to be submitted within 90 days of a request from FDA, but provides for exceptions
under extraordinary circumstances. 


6. Clinical Holds


Section 312.42 currently allows FDA to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation
under certain circumstances. Under the proposal, FDA would amend  312.42 to allow the agency to place an investigation
on clinical hold if the sponsor fails to submit a special safety summary or final clinical study report. If the same
or a closely related drug is the subject of a concurrent investigation, conducted by the same sponsor, proposed  312.42(b)(1)(v)
would require safety summaries from all investigations or the agency could place any of the investigations on clinical
hold. FDA believes this is appropriate because data from all studies involving the drug or closely related drugs may
help FDA evaluate the safety of each study.


7. Termination


FDA is also proposing in  312.44(b)(1)(viii) to amend the regulations regarding termination so that failure
to submit a semiannual report would be grounds for terminating an IND. Failure to submit an annual report is already
grounds for terminating an IND, and FDA is aware of no reason why semiannual and annual reports should be treated differently
in this matter.
FDA considers that failure to implement an adequate safety monitoring and evaluation program, as described in proposed
21 CFR 312.56(c), would be grounds for either a clinical hold under  312.42 or a termination of the IND under  312.44,
since failure to have a program in place would mean that ``[h]uman subjects are or would be exposed to an unreasonable
and significant risk of illness or injury,'' which is currently grounds for either a clinical hold or termination.



8. Review of Ongoing Investigations


FDA is also proposing to amend  312.64(b) to require investigators to submit safety data to sponsors necessary
to allow sponsors to comply with the other proposed safety reporting requirements, such as the proposed semiannual
report. The proposed amendment would require the investigator to comply with safety reporting requirements established
in the protocol for the study. Current  312.64(b) requires investigators to report adverse effects if they
may reasonably be regarded as caused by, or probably caused by, the drug. If the adverse effects are alarming, they
are to be reported to the sponsor immediately. These provisions are being retained as minimal requirements which
must be met, even if the protocol does not require the events to be reported. 


G. Written Procedures for Monitoring Adverse Experiences


FDA is also proposing to amend   310.305(a) and 314.80(b) for marketed human drug products and  600.80(b)
for licensed biological products to require applicants or manufacturers, packers, and distributors to develop
written procedures for the surveillance, receipt, evaluation, and reporting of adverse experiences to FDA. This
requirement would improve postmarketing surveillance by applicants or manufacturers and would enhance an applicant's
or manufacturer's ability to evaluate and report 
adverse experiences to the agency. FDA believes that this provision would not impose a new burden on applicants and
manufacturers, because it codifies a practice that is already customary and usual in the pharmaceutical industry
for handling adverse experiences. Based on field inspections, FDA is aware that many manufacturers already have
written procedures for the receipt, evaluation, and reporting of adverse experiences to FDA. The agency also notes
that the current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) regulations for finished pharmaceuticals, which apply to manufacturers
of all marketed human drug and biological products, require written procedures describing the handling of all written
and oral complaints regarding a drug product (21 CFR 211.198). 
Furthermore, the agency's ``Guideline For Postmarketing Reporting of Adverse Drug Experiences'' (Ref. 4), which
provides guidance on adverse drug experiences reported under   310.305 and 314.80, states (at page 17)
that: 

Each applicant should develop standardized, formal procedures for the surveillance, receipt, evaluation, and
reporting of ADE's to FDA. * * * All applicants should develop procedures that allow expedited adverse experience
report handling, and the applicant should keep on file documentation of due diligence.


Elsewhere in this issue of the 

Federal Register

 FDA is announcing the availability of a guideline entitled ``Guideline for Adverse Experience Reporting for Licensed
Biological Products.'' This guideline discusses the reports required by  600.80 and provides guidance concerning
appropriate means of meeting the reporting requirements. 


H. Resubmission of Reports Received From FDA


Under the MedWatch program, FDA will transmit reports of spontaneously reported serious adverse experiences received
by the agency to the applicant, manufacturer, packer, or distributor (as appropriate) on an expedited basis. Consequently,
FDA is proposing to revise   310.305(c), 314.80(b), and 600.80(b) to state that applicants or manufacturers,
packers, and distributors should not resubmit to the agency reports of adverse experiences that the agency has forwarded
to them. In addition, FDA is proposing to revise   314.80(c)(1)(i) and 600.80(c)(1)(i) to remove the
phrase ``regardless of source'' from the description of which adverse experiences are reported to FDA. These revisions
are intended to reduce duplicate reporting of adverse experiences to the agency, consistent with the reporting instructions
in new FDA Form 3500A. FDA notes, however, that applicants or manufacturers, packers, and distributors receiving
reports forwarded to them by FDA are required to handle these reports as they would any others and that followup, if
obtained, is to be sent to the agency as specified in the regulation. These followup reports should be included, where
appropriate, in the postmarketing adverse experience periodic report.
FDA is also proposing that applicants and licensed manufacturers incorporate into any safety analysis (i.e., periodic
reports, increased frequency reports) the expedited reports received from FDA, whether or not additional followup
information was obtained, and any information received through Freedom of Information requests.


I. Other Revisions to the Reporting Requirements


FDA is proposing to remove   314.80(c)(2)(iii) and 600.80(c)(2)(iii). These paragraphs state that
periodic reporting for non-15-day Alert reports does not apply to adverse drug experience information obtained
from postmarketing studies and reports in the scientific literature and from foreign marketing experience. FDA
is proposing to remove these paragraphs because this information would now be required under the proposed revisions
to the contents of a periodic report.
Current regulations, at  314.80(c)(1)(ii), require applicants and, at 
 600,80(c)(1)ii), licensed manufacturers to ``review periodically (at least as often as the periodic reporting
cycle)'' the frequency of reports of adverse experiences and report any significant increase in frequency to FDA.
Similarly, current  310.305(c)(4) requires manufacturers, packers,and distributors to ``review periodically
(at least once each year)'' the frequency of reports of adverse experiences and report any significant increase in
frequency to FDA. In order to provide consistency with the proposed semiannual reporting requirements for periodic
adverse experience reports under   314.80 and 600.80, FDA is proposing to amend  310.305 to require
manufacturers, packers, and distributors to review periodically, at least twice each year, the frequency of adverse
experience reports for the purposes of making increased frequency reports to FDA.
FDA is also proposing to amend   310.305(c) and 314.80(c) by reorganizing, renumbering, and retitling
the paragraphs in these sections to distinguish between postmarketing 15-day Alert reports, followups to
postmarketing 15-day Alert reports, and increased frequency reports. The proposed amendments would also
distinguish between the reporting intervals for postmarketing 15-day Alert reports and the revised intervals
proposed for postmarketing periodic reports.
FDA is also proposing to amend   310.305(c)(1) through (c)(4) and 314.80(c)(1)(i), through (c)(1)(iv)
to alter the period for submitting postmarketing ``15-day'' Alert reports from 15 working days to 15 calendar
days. This change should decrease misunderstandings with the reporting requirements as all timeframes would now
be stated in terms of calendar days. In addition, this change would increase consistency between the premarketing
and postmarketing reporting requirements.
FDA is also proposing to amend   310.305(c)(2), 314.80(c)(1)(ii), and 600.80(c)(1)(ii) to require
applicants or manufacturers, packers, and distributors who have been unable to obtain additional information about
adverse experiences that are the subject of postmarketing 15-day Alert reports to maintain records of their attempts
to seek additional information. These proposed revisions will help ensure that applicants or manufacturers are
making good faith efforts to investigate adverse experiences that are the subject of postmarketing 15-day Alert
reports.
Finally, FDA is proposing to amend   310.305(d)(3)(ii) and 314.80(f)(3)(ii) to instruct applicants
or manufacturers, packers, and distributors that, before using an alternative reporting form instead of FDA Form
3500A, they must obtain approval from MedWatch: The FDA Medical Products Reporting Program, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville,
MD 20852-9787. 
Current regulations require prior approval from the Division of Epidemiology and Surveillance for human drug products.


J. Distribution Reports


As stated earlier, the proposed rule would change the reporting interval for licensed biological product distribution
reports to be consistent with the suggested CIOMS standardized reporting period for postmarketing adverse drug
experience periodic reports. Licensed biological product distribution reports would be based on the international
birth date and data lock-point. The proposal would also remove  600.81 and move the regulatory requirements
for licensed biological product distribution reports to  600.80(c)(3).


K. Multiple Reports


FDA is proposing to amend  600.80(g) concerning multiple reports by adding information pertaining to a licensed
biological product for which a licensed manufacturer holds more than one biological product license. This revision
would be consistent with the requirements in  314.80(g).


L. Guidelines


FDA is proposing to amend   314.80(j) and 600.80(j) to indicate where guidelines for the submission of
adverse experience reports may be obtained. In addition, FDA is adding this information in  310.305(g) for
the submission of adverse experience reports for prescription drugs without an approved application. For human
drug products, the guidelines may be obtained from the CDER Executive Secretariat Staff (HFD-8), Center for
Drug Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855, and for licensed
biological products from the Congressional and Consumer Affairs Branch (HFM-12), Center for Biologics Evaluation
and Research, Food and Drug Administration, 1401 Rockville Pike, suite 200N, Rockville, MD 20852-1448.


M. Proposed Implementation Scheme


FDA proposes that any final rule that may issue based on this proposal become effective 30 days after its date of publication
in the 

Federal Register

. All applications for human drug or licensed biological products approved on or after the effective date of any final
regulation would be subject to the periodic reporting time periods based on the international birth date. All human
drug and licensed biological product applications approved before the effective date of any final regulation would
use the U.S. approval date as the international birth date.






III. Request for Comments







Interested persons may, on or before January 25, 1995, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written
comments regarding this proposal. Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit
one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received
comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. 




IV. Environmental Impact




The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(a)(8) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.




V. Analysis of Impacts




FDA has examined the impacts of the proposed rule under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub.
L. 96-354). Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory
alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including
potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and
equity). The agency believes that this proposed rule is consistent with the regulatory philosophy and principles
identified in the Executive Order. In addition, the proposed rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined
by the Executive Order and so is not subject to review under the Executive Order.
The economic costs imposed on the industry as a result of this proposed rule are the costs associated with reporting
deaths, serious adverse experiences, or clinical study discontinuations. Reporting burdens on the industry resulting
from FDA regulations are analyzed under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. Based on an estimated total of 480,602
annual burden hours, FDA has estimated that the total annual reporting cost to the industry as a result of this proposed
rule would be $ 24,030,100 (the estimated per hour cost to the industry is $ 50). In addition, the rule may increase certain
nonpaperwork activities. For example, added costs may result if the formal control groups suggested in  312.23(a)(6)(iii)(i)
prompts additional clinical trial control arms, or if the implementation of the followup plan required in  312.23(a)(6)(iii)(k)
provokes more elaborate monitoring procedures. At this time, FDA cannot predict the extent of these actions, but
welcomes public comment on issues regarding the scope or cost of these activities. 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to analyze regulatory options that would minimize any significant
impact of a rule on small entities. The agency certifies that the proposed rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, no further analysis
is required.


VI. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980


This proposed rule contains information collection requirements which are subject to review by the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. The title, description, and respondents of the information
collection requirements are shown below.


Title

: Adverse Experience Reporting Requirements For Human Drug and Licensed Biological Products.


Description

: FDA is proposing to amend its current adverse experience reporting requirements to replace current Form FDA-1639
with new FDA Form 3500A; to revise certain definitions and reporting periods and formats; to require applicants or
manufacturers, packers, and distributors to develop written procedures for monitoring and reporting adverse experiences;
and to make other revisions to provide uniformity to the reporting regulations. These changes would simplify and
facilitate the reporting of adverse events and product problems under a single form and help harmonize international
adverse event reporting requirements. In addition, FDA is proposing to amend the sponsor reporting requirements
in part 312. 


Description of Respondents

: Businesses or other for profit and small businesses or organizations. 
The burden hours for   310.305 and 314.80 are approved under OMB information collection number 0910-0230.
The burden hours for  600.80 have been submitted to OMB for approval and can be found elsewhere in this issue of
the 

Federal Register

. FDA estimates no change in the burden hours that have already been approved. OMB has approved use of the new form, under
OMB information collection number 0910-0291, through December 1994. The new recordkeeping requirements
under  310.305(c)(2), 314.80(c)(1)(ii), and 600.80(c)(1)(ii), that applicants or manufacturers, packers,
and distributors maintain records of unsuccessful attempts to obtain additional followup information on 15-day
``Alert reports,'' would be negligible and would result in no change in the burden hours that have already been approved.

The new requirements under   310.305(a), 314.80(b), and 600.80(b), that applicants or manufacturers,
packers, and distributors develop written procedures for the surveillance, receipt, evaluation, and reporting
of adverse experiences, would not impose a new burden because they codify a practice that is already customary and
usual in the pharmaceutical industry for handling adverse experiences.
The more extensive list of contents for the periodic postmarketing adverse experience report, in proposed   314.80(c)(2)(ii)
and 600.80(c)(2)(ii), would result in an increased reporting burden on the industry. As indicated in the accompanying
chart, the proposed periodic reporting requirements would require, on an average, 19 additional hours for respondents
to prepare.
The proposal would also increase the reporting requirements for sponsors under part 312. As indicated in the accompanying
chart, the proposed amendments to part 312 would result in an increase of 167,900 burden hours on the industry.




As required by section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, FDA has submitted a copy of this proposed rule
to OMB for its review of these information collection requirements. Other organizations and individuals desiring
to submit comments regarding the burden estimate or any aspects of these information collection requirements, including
suggestions for reducing the burden, should direct them to FDA's Dockets Management Branch (address above) and to
the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, rm. 3208, New Executive Office Bldg., Washington, DC 20503,
Attn: Desk Officer for FDA.

Records and reports concerning adverse drug experiences on marketed prescription drugs for human use without approved
new drug applications.


(a) * * * Manufacturers, packers, and distributors shall also develop written procedures for the
surveillance, receipt, evaluation, and reporting of adverse drug experiences to FDA.
(b) 

Definitions

. The following definitions of terms apply to this section:
(1) 

FDA

 means the Food and Drug Administration.
(2) 

Adverse drug experience

 means any adverse event associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related, including
the following: An adverse event occurring in the course of the use of a drug product in professional practice; an adverse
event occurring from drug overdose; an adverse event occurring from drug withdrawal; and any failure of expected
pharmacological action.
(3) 

Disability

 means a substantial disruption of a person's ability to carry out normal life functions.
(4) 

Increased frequency

 means an increase in the rate of occurrence of a particular adverse drug experience, e.g., an increased number of reports
of particular adverse drug experience after appropriate adjustment for drug exposure.
(5) 

Life-threatening

 means that the patient was, in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the adverse drug experience
as it occurred. It does not include an adverse drug experience that, had it occurred in a more serious form, might have
caused death. For example, product-induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic failure would not
be considered life-threatening even though hepatitis of a more severe nature can be fatal. Similarly, an allergic
reaction resulting in angioedema of the face would not be life-threatening, although angioedema of the larynx, allergic
bronchospasm, or anaphylaxis can be fatal.
(6) 

Serious

 means an adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that is fatal or life-threatening, results in persistent or
significant disability/incapacity, requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization, necessitates medical or
surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure,
or is a congenital anomaly.
(7) 

Unexpected

 means an adverse drug experience that is not listed in the current labeling for the drug product and includes an event
that may be symptomatically and pathophysiologically related to an event listed in the labeling, but differs from
the event because of greater severity or specificity. For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would
be unexpected (by virtue of greater severity) if the labeling only referred to elevated hepatitic enzymes or hepatitis.
Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater specificity)
if the labeling only listed cerebral vascular accidents.
(c) 

Reporting requirements

. Each person identified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall report to FDA adverse drug experience information
as described in this section and shall submit one copy of each report to the Division of Epidemiology and Surveillance
(HFD-730), Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville,
MD 20857.

Postmarketing 15-Day ``Alert reports''

. (i) Any person whose name appears on the label of a marketed prescription drug product as its manufacturer, packer,
or distributor shall report to FDA each adverse drug experience received or otherwise obtained that is both serious
and unexpected as soon as possible, but in any case, within 15 calendar days of initial receipt of the information.
Each report shall be accompanied by a copy of the current labeling for the drug product.
(ii) A person identified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section is not required to submit a 15-day ``Alert report''
for an adverse drug experience obtained from a postmarketing study (whether or not conducted under an investigational
new drug application) unless the applicant concludes that there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused
the adverse experience.
(2) 

Postmarketing 15-Day ``Alert reports''_followup

. Each person identified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section shall promptly investigate all serious, unexpected
adverse drug experiences that are the subject of these 15-day postmarketing Alert reports and shall submit followup
reports within 15 calendar days of receipt of new information or as requested by FDA. If additional information is
not obtainable, records should be maintained of the unsuccessful steps taken to seek additional information.
(3) 

Increased frequency report

. Each person identified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section shall review periodically (at least twice each year)
the frequency of reports of adverse drug experiences that are both serious and expected and reports of therapeutic
failure (lack of effect), received or otherwise obtained, and report any significant increase in frequency as soon
as possible, but in any case within 15 calendar days of determining that a significant increase in frequency exists.
Reports of a significant increase in frequency are required to be submitted in narrative form (including the time
period on which the increased frequency is based, the method of analysis, and the interpretation of the results) rather
than using FDA Form 3500A.
(4) 

Submission of reports

. In order to avoid unnecessary duplication in the submission of, and followup to, reports required in this section,
including reports required by paragraph (c)(3) of this section, a packer's or distributor's obligations may be met
by submission of all reports of serious adverse drug experiences to the manufacturer of the drug product. If a packer
or distributor elects to submit these adverse drug experience reports to the manufacturer rather than to FDA, it shall
submit each report to the manufacturer within 3 calendar days of its receipt by the packer or distributor, and the manufacturer
shall then comply with the requirements of this section even if its name does not appear on the label of the drug product.
Under this circumstance, the packer or distributor shall maintain a record of this action which shall include:
(i) A copy of each drug experience report.
(ii) Date the report was received by the packer or distributor.
(iii) Date the report was submitted to the manufacturer.
(iv) Name and address of the manufacturer. 
(5) Each report submitted to FDA under this section shall bear prominent identification as to its contents, i.e.,
``15-day Alert report,'' ``15-day Alert report_followup,'' or ``Increased frequency report.''
(6) A person identified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section should not resubmit to FDA reports forwarded to that
person by FDA; however, all followup information must be submitted to FDA.
(d) * * *
(3) * * *
(ii) The format is agreed to in advance by MedWatch: The FDA Medical Products Reporting Program. 
(4) Ten copies or fewer of FDA Form 3500A and/or a copy of the instructions for completing the form may be obtained from
the Division of Epidemiology and Surveillance (HFD-730), Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Food and
Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857. More than 10 copies of the form may be obtained by writing
to the Consolidated Forms and Publications Distribution Center, Washington Commerce Center, 3222 Hubbard Rd.,
Landover, MD 20785.

PART 312_INVESTIGATIONAL NEW DRUG APPLICATION


5. The authority citation for 21 CFR part 312 continues to read as follows:





Authority

: Secs. 201, 301, 501, 502, 503, 505, 506, 507, 701 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321, 331, 351,
352, 353, 355, 356, 357, 371); sec. 351 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262).




6. Section 312.23 is amended by adding new paragraph (a)(3)(v) and paragraphs (a)(6)(iii)(

h

) through (a)(6)(iii)(

k

) to read as follows:



 312.23 

IND content and format.


(a) * * *
(3) * * *
(v) A description of the safety monitoring and evaluation program developed by the sponsor in order to evaluate safety
data reported by investigators.


* * * * *


(6) * * *
(iii) * * *
(

h

) A description of any adverse clinical or laboratory outcomes in the study that are to be reported by the investigators
to the sponsor immediately. This would ordinarily include any death, any life-threatening event, any serious event
that might reflect potential toxicity, as suggested by preclinical data, laboratory values that exceed specified
limits, or any markedly abnormal laboratory value. The identified events and abnormal laboratory values are to include
those that focus attention on toxicity that may target the same organs and body systems as the underlying disease or
concomitant medications for the disease. The events are to be reported to the sponsor even if they are potentially
attributable to the patient's underlying disease or to other medications the patient may have received. This section
of the protocol shall include instructions for the investigator encountering such an event, such as reporting requirements,
a remeasurement or challenge procedure, or discontinuation of the study drug.
(

i

) Sponsors should consider use of a formal control group (for example, placebo, active, documented historical) in
studies that focus on safety when the underlying disease is likely to produce serious adverse events that might be
confused with drug toxicity.
(

j

) The sponsor shall estimate the expected incidence of deaths and serious adverse experiences in the study population
that may arise from the underlying disease or from medications used to treat the underlying disease. Deaths or serious
adverse experiences that exceed these estimates would create a presumption that the events are associated with the
use of the investigational drug.
(

k

) The sponsor shall determine and include in each protocol an appropriate followup period and appropriate followup
procedures based on preclinical data, experience with other members of the drug class, the drug's mechanism of action,
and prior human experience. The sponsor shall include a brief description of the rationale used in selecting the followup
period and procedures. The intensity of the followup may change with time; e.g., a full evaluation might be scheduled
for 2 weeks after the end of drug dosing, with a telephone followup at a later time. Ordinarily, in Phase 1 and 2 studies,
there should be at least telephone followup for 3 months after drug dosing is completed, but alternative timeframes
and procedures can be proposed by the sponsor. In some cases, available information may dictate followup periods
longer than 3 months.


* * * * *


7. Section 312.32 is amended in paragraph (a) by revising the second sentence in the definition for ``Serious adverse
experience,'' paragraph (c)(1)(i), the first sentence in paragraph (c)(2), paragraph (d)(3), and in paragraph
(e) by removing the word ``section'' and replacing it with the word ``part'' to read as follows:



 312.32 

IND safety reports. 


(a) * * *


Serious adverse experience

 * * * A serious adverse drug experience means an experience occurring at any dose that is fatal or life-threatening,
results in permanent or significant disability/incapacity, requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization,
necessitates medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body function or permanent
damage to a body structure, or is a congenital anomaly. 
* * *


* * * * *


(c) 

IND safety reports

_(1) 

Written reports

. (i) The sponsor shall notify FDA and all participating investigators 
in a written IND safety report of any adverse experience associated with use of the drug that is both serious and unexpected.
This includes notification of any death or other serious adverse experience that exceeds the estimate of the expected
incidence of deaths and serious adverse experiences required under  312.23(a)(6)(iii)(

j

). Such notification shall be made as soon as possible and in no event later than 15 calendar days after the sponsor's
initial receipt of the information. Each written notification may be submitted on FDA Form 3500A or in a narrative
form and shall bear prominent identification of its contents, i.e., ``IND Safety Report.'' Each written notification
to FDA shall be transmitted to the FDA division of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research or the Center for Biologics
Evaluation and Research that has responsibility for review of the IND. If FDA determines that insufficient data were
submitted on FDA Form 3500A, the agency may require further narrative data to be submitted.


* * * * *


(2) 

Telephone safety reports

. The sponsor shall also notify FDA by telephone, either orally or by facsimile transmission, of any unexpected fatal
or life-threatening experience associated with the use of the drug no later than 7 calendar days after the sponsor's
initial receipt of the information. * * *


* * * * *


(d) * * *
(3)If the results of a sponsor's investigation show that an adverse experience not initially determined to be reportable
under paragraph (c) of this section is so reportable, the sponsor shall report such experience in a written safety
report as soon as possible after the determination is made, but in no event longer than 15 calendar days. 


* * * * *


8. Section 312.33 is revised to read as follows:



 312.33 

Annual and semiannual reports.


(a) 

Annual reports

. A sponsor shall within 60 days of the anniversary date that the IND went into effect, submit a brief report of the progress
of the investigation that includes:
(1) 

Individual study information

. A brief summary of the status of each study in progress and each study completed during the previous year. The summary
is required to include the following information for each study:
(i) The title of the study (with any appropriate study identifiers such as protocol number), its purpose, a brief statement
identifying the patient population, and a statement as to whether the study is completed.
(ii) The total number of subjects initially planned for inclusion in the study, the number entered into the study to
date, the number whose participation in the study was completed as planned, and the number who dropped out of the study
for any reason.
(iii) If the study has been completed, or if interim results are known, a brief description of any available study results.
(2) 

Summary information

. Information obtained during the previous year's clinical and nonclinical investigations, including: 
(i) A narrative or tabular summary showing the most frequent and most serious adverse experiences by body system.
(ii) A summary of all IND safety reports submitted during the past year.
(iii) A list of subjects who died during participation in the investigation, with the cause of death for each subject.
(iv) A list of subjects who dropped out during the course of the investigation in association with any adverse experience,
whether or not thought to be drug related.
(v) A brief description of what, if anything, was obtained that is pertinent to an understanding of the drug's actions,
including, for example, information from controlled trials, and information about bioavailability.
(vi) A list of the preclinical studies (including animal studies) completed or in progress during the past year and
a summary of the major preclinical findings.
(vii) A summary of any significant manufacturing or microbiological changes made during the past year.
(3) A description of the general investigational plan for the coming year to replace that submitted 1 year earlier.
The general investigational plan shall contain the information required under  312.23(a)(3)(iv).
(4) If the investigator brochure has been revised, a description of the revision and a copy of the new brochure. 
(5) A description of any significant Phase 1 protocol modifications made during the previous year and not previously
reported to the IND in a protocol amendment.
(6) A brief summary of significant foreign marketing developments with the drug during the past year, such as approval
of marketing in any country or withdrawal or suspension from marketing in any country.
(7) If desired by the sponsor, a log of any outstanding business with respect to the IND for which the sponsor requests
or expects a reply, comment, or meeting.
(b) 

Semiannual reports

. A sponsor shall submit a report of the progress of the investigation with respect to safety issues for the 6-month
period following the day the IND goes into effect, and for each 6-month period thereafter, until the end of the followup
period specified in the protocol. The report shall be due within 60 days of the end of the reporting period. The semiannual
safety report that is due during the same period as the annual report required under paragraph (a) of this section shall
be submitted with the annual report. These semiannual reports shall include: 
(1) A summary and analysis of all deaths, all serious adverse experiences, and all study discontinuations resulting
from an adverse experience that occurred during the study or within the prescribed followup period, whether the deaths
or adverse experiences were expected or unexpected and whether or not there is thought to be a possibility that the
death or adverse experience or study discontinuation was caused by the drug. This summary shall include data not only
from studies conducted under the IND, but also data from all premarketing studies of the drug conducted worldwide,
with an analysis of all unexpected deaths, serious adverse experiences, and study discontinuations thought to be
related to the study drug from foreign postmarketing clinical trials and from foreign postmarketing spontaneous
or required reporting systems. For purposes of this section, serious adverse events shall include laboratory changes
identified in the study protocol as reportable events or that result in discontinuation. The sponsor shall present
in the summary both the data that accumulated during the reporting period and cumulatively. The sponsor shall also
submit an analysis of the data that assumes that the investigational drug is responsible for the deaths, serious adverse
experiences, and study discontinuations, and refute, as feasible, this presumption with appropriate data and evaluations.
The expected incidence of deaths and serious adverse experiences in the study population that may arise from the underlying
disease or from medications used to treat the underlying disease that was estimated in the protocol should be considered
in this evaluation. 
(2) All available autopsy reports and terminal medical reports concerning all deaths reported in this summary, with
a discussion of any inconsistencies between autopsy and medical reports and the cause of death reported to FDA by the
sponsor. 
(3) At the request of the sponsor, or on its own initiative, FDA may modify the requirements of paragraph (b) of this
section. A sponsor requesting such a modification should submit to the division responsible for review of the IND
a written request for modification and justification for such modification. FDA shall issue a written response to
the sponsor either granting or denying, in whole or in part, the request for modification. 


(Collection of information requirements approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 0910-0014)


9. Section 312.37 is added to read as follows:



 312.37 

Special safety summary and final clinical study report.


(a) 

Special safety summary

. Upon request of FDA, a sponsor shall prepare and submit special summaries of safety data regarding the investigational
drug. These summaries may include safety data available to the sponsor from previous studies of the drug and of closely
related drugs identified in consultation with FDA. Examples of types of events that may be requested to be summarized
include, among others, deaths, serious adverse experiences, study discontinuations for safety reasons, patients
who reach or exceed safety endpoints as defined in the protocol, and any unusual or extreme changes in study subjects.
The special safety summary shall be submitted within 30 days after a request by the agency unless the sponsor demonstrates
that extraordinary circumstances warrant a later date and the agency has agreed to that later date. 
(b) 

Final clinical study report

. Upon request by FDA, a sponsor shall submit a final report on a clinical study. The final report shall be submitted
within 90 calendar days after a request by the agency unless the sponsor demonstrates that extraordinary circumstances
warrant a later date and the agency has agreed to that later date.
10. Section 312.42 is amended by adding paragraph (b)(1)(v) to read as follows:



 312.42 

Clinical holds and requests for modification.


* * * * *


(b) * * *
(1) * * *
(v) The sponsor has failed to submit a special safety summary or final clinical study report, as required by  312.37,
for the drug that is the subject of the investigation. This provision applies to special safety summaries and final
clinical study reports from other investigations on the same drug and special safety summaries and final clinical
study reports requested by FDA for investigations on closely related drugs conducted by the sponsor.


* * * * *


11. Section 312.44 is amended by revising paragraph (b)(1)(viii) to read as follows:



 312.44 

Termination.


* * * * *


(b) * * *
(1) * * *
(viii) The sponsor fails to submit an accurate and timely annual or semiannual safety report of the investigations
in accordance with  312.33.


* * * * *


12. Section 312.56 is amended by revising paragraph (c) to read as follows:



 312.56 

Review of ongoing investigations.


* * * * *


(c) Before the initiation of clinical studies, the sponsor shall develop a safety monitoring and evaluation program
to evaluate safety data reported by the investigator(s). The sponsor shall review and evaluate the evidence relating
to the safety and effectiveness of the drug as it is obtained from the investigator(s). The sponsor shall make such
reports to FDA regarding information relevant to the safety of the drug as required under   312.32 and
312.37. The sponsor shall make annual and semiannual safety reports in accordance with  312.33.


* * * * *












13. Section 312.64 is amended by adding two sentences at the end of paragraph (b) to read as follows:



 312.64 

Investigator reports.

PART 314_APPLICATIONS FOR FDA APPROVAL TO MARKET A NEW DRUG OR AN ANTIBIOTIC DRUG 


14. The authority citation for 21 CFR part 314 continues to read as follows:





Authority

: Secs. 201, 301, 501, 502, 503, 505, 506, 507, 701, 704, 721 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321,
331, 351, 352, 353, 355, 356, 357, 371, 374, 379e).



15. Section 314.80 is amended in paragraph (a) by alphabetically adding definitions for ``Data lock-point,'' ``Disability,''
``International birth date,'' and ``Life-threatening,'' and by revising the definition of ``Serious;'' by adding
two new sentences at the end of paragraph (b); by revising paragraph (c), the second sentence in paragraph (d)(1),
paragraphs (f)(1), (f)(3)(ii), and (f)(4), and the last sentence in paragraph (l); by removing in paragraphs (f)(2)
and the introductory text of paragraph (f)(3) the words ``Form FDA-1639'' and adding in their place the words
``FDA Form 3500A''; and by adding a new sentence at the end of paragraph (j) to read as follows: 



 314.80 

Postmarketing reporting of adverse drug experiences.


(a) * * *


* * * * *




Data lock-point

 means the date designated as the cutoff date for data to be incorporated into a specific postmarketing adverse drug
experience periodic report. Data available to the applicant after this date will not be incorporated into the report,
unless it represents important information. 


Disability

 means a substantial disruption of a person's ability to carry out normal life functions.


* * * * *




International birth date

 means the date that the first regulatory authority in the world approved the human drug product for marketing.


Life-threatening

 means that the patient was, in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the adverse experience
as it occurred. It does not include an adverse experience that, had it occurred in a more serious form, might have caused
death. For example, product-induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic failure would not be considered
life-threatening even though hepatitis of a more severe nature can be fatal. Similarly, an allergic reaction resulting
in angioedema of the face would not be life-threatening, even though angioedema of the larynx, allergic bronchospasm,
or anaphylaxis can be fatal.


Serious

 means an adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that is fatal or life-threatening, results in persistent or
significant disability/incapacity, requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization, necessitates medical or
surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure,
or is a congenital anomaly.


* * * * *


(b) * * * Applicants should not resubmit to FDA adverse product experience reports forwarded to the
applicant by FDA; however, they should submit all followup information to FDA. Applicants shall also develop written
procedures for the surveillance, receipt, evaluation, and reporting of adverse drug experiences.
(c) 

Reporting requirements

. The applicant shall report to FDA adverse drug experience information, as described in this section. The applicant
shall submit two copies of each report described in this section to the Central Document Room, Park Bldg., rm. 2-14,
12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857. FDA may waive the requirement for the second copy in appropriate instances.
(1)(i) 

Postmarketing 15-day ``Alert reports''

. The applicant shall report each adverse drug experience that is both serious and unexpected as soon as possible but
in any case within 15 calendar days of initial receipt of the information. These reports shall be submitted on FDA Form
3500A.
(ii) 

Postmarketing Fifteen-day ``Alert reports''_followup

. The applicant shall promptly investigate all adverse drug experiences that are the subject of these postmarketing
15-day Alert reports and shall submit followup reports within 15 calendar days of receipt of new information or as
requested by FDA. If additional information is not obtainable, records should be maintained of the unsuccessful
steps taken to seek additional information. These postmarketing 15-day Alert reports and followups to them shall
be submitted under separate cover and may not be included, except for summary or tabular purposes, in a postmarketing
adverse drug experience periodic report.
(iii) 

Increased frequency report

. The applicant shall review periodically (at least as often as the periodic reporting cycle) the frequency of reports
of adverse drug experiences that are both serious and expected and reports of therapeutic failure (lack of effect),
regardless of source, and report any significant increase in frequency as soon as possible but in any case within 15
calendar days of determining that a significant increase in frequency exists. Upon written notice, FDA may require
that applicants review the frequency of reports of serious, expected adverse drug experiences at intervals different
than the periodic reporting cycle. Reports of a significant increase in frequency are required to be submitted in
narrative form (including the time period on which the increased frequency is based, the method of analysis, and the
interpretation of the results), rather than using FDA Form 3500A. 15-day Alert reports based on increased frequency
are required to be submitted under separate cover and may not be included, except for summary purposes, in a periodic
report.
(iv) 

Submission of reports

. The requirements of paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (c)(1)(ii), and (c)(1)(iii) of this section, concerning the submission
of postmarketing 15-day Alert reports, shall also apply to any person (other than the applicant) whose name appears
on the label of an approved drug product as a manufacturer, packer, or distributor. However, in order to avoid unnecessary
duplication in the submission to FDA of reports required by paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (c)(1)(ii), and (c)(1)(iii) of
this section, obligations of a nonapplicant may be met by submission of all reports of serious adverse drug experiences
to the applicant. If a nonapplicant elects to submit adverse drug experience reports to the applicant rather than
to FDA, it shall submit each report to the applicant within 3 calendar days of its receipt by the nonapplicant, and the
applicant shall then comply with the requirements of this section. Under this circumstance, the nonapplicant shall
maintain a record of this action which shall include:
(A) A copy of the drug experience report.
(B) Date the report was received by the nonapplicant.
(C) Date the report was submitted to the applicant.
(D) Name and address of the applicant.
(v) 

Report identification

. Each report submitted under this paragraph shall bear prominent identification as to its contents, i.e., ``15-day
Alert report,'' ``15-day Alert report_followup,'' or ``Increased frequency report.''
(2) 

Periodic adverse drug experience reports

. (i) The applicant shall report every 6 months each adverse drug experience not reported under paragraphs (c)(1)(i)
and (c)(1)(ii) of this section. The periodic reporting term shall be based upon the international birth date of the
human drug product. The first 6-month anniversary of the international birth date after the application is approved
in the United States is the data lock-point for the first periodic reporting term. Each subsequent 6-month anniversary
of the international birth date is the data lock-point for subsequent periodic reporting terms for that particular
product. Periodic reports shall be submitted to FDA within 45 days after the data lock-point. Upon written notice,
FDA may require that the applicant submit reports under this section at times other than those stated. An applicant
who wishes to submit periodic reports at different intervals must submit to FDA a request for a waiver under  314.90.
Followup information to adverse drug experiences submitted initially in a periodic report may be submitted in the
next periodic report. If the applicant does not receive any adverse experience reports during the reporting period,
the applicant shall, in place of a periodic report, send a copy of the current approved U.S. labeling and a letter identifying
the product, the application number, and the reporting period, stating that no adverse drug experience reports were
received.
(ii) 

Reports

. Each periodic report shall contain:
(A) 

Title page, table of contents, and introduction

. The introduction shall be a summary of the periodic report with page references to detailed data and information.

(B) 

Applicant's core safety data sheet

. The applicant's core safety data sheet shall be a document prepared by the applicant that contains all relevant safety
information, including adverse drug experiences, which the applicant believes should be listed for the drug in all
countries where the drug is marketed. It may be used by the applicant as the reference document by which an adverse drug
experience is judged to be expected or unexpected for purposes of this postmarketing periodic report. For all other
determinations of whether an adverse drug experience is expected or unexpected, the definition in paragraph (a)
of this section shall apply.
(

1

) FDA recognizes that the postmarketing periodic report may be submitted by the applicant to multiple countries and
the product may have different approved labels in the different countries. The use of the applicant's core safety
data sheet as the reference document for determining whether an adverse drug experience is unexpected or not may result
in some overreporting of unexpected adverse events that actually are expected by the U.S. approved product label.
This is because the approved label for the United States may have more safety information included in it than the manufacturer's
core safety data sheet. If an adverse event is not listed in the U.S. label, but is in the manufacturer's core safety
data sheet, this shall be clearly noted in the ``Overall safety evaluation'' (see paragraph (c)(2) (ii)(H) of this
section). This section also shall highlight clearly any changes and the reasons for the changes in the applicant's
core safety data sheet since the previous postmarketing periodic report.
(

2

) An applicant may also use the approved U.S. label as the reference by which expected and unexpected adverse drug experiences
are determined for the postmarketing periodic report. If an applicant chooses to use the approved U.S. label for this
purpose, it shall clearly be stated in this section of the report. 
(C) 

The product's marketing status

. This section shall contain a table containing a chronological history of the marketing status of the product worldwide
(all regulatory decisions affecting the product and all market launches) from the date it was first approved through
its current status. Approvals or applications voluntarily withdrawn for safety reasons shall be included at a minimum.
The product shall be listed by chemical (or proper name) and brand name(s).
(D) 

Regulatory actions for safety reasons

. This section shall contain a narrative identifying the reasons for significant regulatory authority or manufacturer-initiated
actions taken anywhere in the world, or to be taken imminently, for safety reasons during the reporting period. This
includes, for example, application withdrawal or license suspension or failure to renew, distribution restrictions,
clinical trial suspension, labeling changes due to significant safety concerns, dosage modifications, or pharmaceutical
changes.
(E) 

Patient exposure

. This section shall include the product's domestic and foreign marketing distribution data during the reporting
period. This shall be used to calculate the extent of patient exposure. The method used by the manufacturer to estimate
patient exposure shall always be described and shall include the total number of dosage units of each dosage form and
strength or potency (e.g., 100,000/5-milligram tablets, 50,000/10-milliliter vials).
(F) 

Individual case histories

. This section shall consist of individual case reports of adverse drug experiences thought possibly associated
with the use of the drug that are: 
(

1

) Serious, unexpected reports from published or unpublished clinical studies where the applicant has concluded
that there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse experience; 
(

2

) Serious, expected or unexpected spontaneous adverse drug experience reports and nonserious, unexpected spontaneous
adverse drug experience reports (causality always assumed in spontaneous reports) received directly by the applicant
from the initial reporter or received by the applicant from a drug regulatory authority, both U.S. or foreign; and

(

3

) Serious, expected or unexpected, individual published case histories and nonserious, unexpected individual
published case histories. 
(

4

) All of these reports in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(F)(

1

) through (c)(2)(ii)(F)(

3

) of this section shall be presented in line listing format with the following 10 columns: country, source, age, gender,
dose, duration of treatment (prior to event), time to onset, description of reaction (as reported), outcome (e.g.,
fatal, resolved), other comments (e.g., manufacturer's report number). This format is consistent with that suggested
by CIOMS. In addition, a tabular summary of the number of adverse events by body system may be included. This section
shall end with an analysis by the reporter, in narrative form, of the cases submitted. The applicant shall also attach
to the end of the postmarketing periodic report a completed FDA Form 3500A for all U.S. spontaneous reports of adverse
drug experiences except those reported under paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii) of this section, or those sent
by FDA to the applicant.
(G) 

Safety studies

. This section shall contain an analysis and full critical discussion of all toxicological, clinical, and epidemiological
studies containing important safety information. 
(H) 

Overall safety evaluation

PART 600_BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTS: GENERAL


16. The authority citation for 21 CFR part 600 continues to read as follows:





Authority

: Secs. 201, 501, 502, 503, 505, 510, 519, 701, 704 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321, 351, 352,
353, 355, 360, 360i, 371, 374); secs. 215, 351, 352, 353, 361 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 216, 262, 263,
263a, 264).



17. Section 600.80 as added in a final rule published elsewhere in this issue of the 

Federal Register

 is amended in paragraph (a) by alphabetically adding definitions for ``Data lock-point,'' ``Disability,'' ``International
birth date,'' and ``Life-threatening;'' by revising the definition of ``Serious;'' by adding two new sentences
at the end of paragraph (b); by revising paragraph (c), the third sentence in paragraph (d)(1), paragraph (g), and
the last sentence in paragraph (m); and by adding a new sentence at the end of paragraph (j) to read as follows:



 600.80 

Postmarketing reporting of adverse experiences.


(a) * * * 


* * * * *




Data lock-point

 means the date designated as the cutoff date for data to be incorporated into a specific postmarketing adverse experience
periodic report. Data available to the licensed manufacturer after this date will not be incorporated into the report,
unless it represents important information. 


Disability

 means a substantial disruption of a person's ability to carry out normal life functions.


* * * * *




International birth date

 means the date that the first regulatory authority in the world approved the biological drug product for marketing.


Life-threatening

 means that the patient was, in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the adverse experience
as it occurred. It does not include an adverse experience that, had it occurred in a more serious form, might have caused
death. For example, product-induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic failure would not be considered
life-threatening even though hepatitis of a more severe nature can be fatal. Similarly, an allergic reaction resulting
in angioedema of the face would not be life-threatening, even though angioedema of the larynx, allergic bronchospasm,
or anaphylaxis can be fatal. 


Serious

 means an adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that is fatal or life-threatening, results in persistent or
significant disability/incapacity, requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization, necessitates medical or
surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure,
or is a congenital anomaly.


* * * * *


(b) * * * Licensed manufacturers should not resubmit to FDA adverse product experience reports forwarded
to the licensed manufacturer by FDA; however, they should submit all followup information to FDA. Licensed manufacturers
shall also develop written procedures for the surveillance, receipt, evaluation, and reporting of adverse experiences.

(c) 

Reporting requirements

. The licensed manufacturer shall report to FDA adverse experience information, as described in this section. The
licensed manufacturer shall submit two copies of each report described in this section for nonvaccine biological
products to the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (HFM-210), Food and Drug Administration, 1401
Rockville Pike, suite 200N, Rockville, MD 20852-1448. Submit all 
vaccine adverse experience reports to: Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), P.O. Box 1100, Rockville,
MD 20849-1100. FDA may waive the requirement for the second copy in appropriate instances.
(1)(i) 

Postmarketing 15-day ``Alert reports''

. The licensed manufacturer shall report each adverse experience that is both serious and unexpected as soon as possible,
but in any case within 15 calendar days of initial receipt of the information. These reports shall be submitted for
nonvaccine biological products on FDA Form 3500A, and, for vaccines, on a VAERS form.
(ii) 

Postmarketing 15-day ``Alert reports''_followup

. The licensed manufacturer shall promptly investigate all adverse experiences that are the subject of these postmarketing
15-day Alert reports and shall submit followup reports within 15 calendar days of receipt of new information or as
requested by FDA. If additional information is not obtainable, records should be maintained of the unsuccessful
steps taken to seek additional information. These postmarketing 15-day Alert reports and followups to them shall
be submitted under separate cover and may not be included, except for summary or tabular purposes, in a postmarketing
adverse experience periodic report.
(iii) 

Increased frequency report

. The licensed manufacturer shall review periodically (at least as often as the periodic reporting cycle) the frequency
of reports of adverse biological product experiences that are both serious and expected and reports of therapeutic
failure (lack of effect), regardless of source, and report any significant increase in frequency as soon as possible
but in any case within 15 calendar days of determining that a significant increase in frequency exists. Upon written
notice, FDA may require that licensed manufacturers review the frequency of reports of serious, expected adverse
biological experiences at intervals different than the periodic reporting cycle. Reports of a significant increase
in frequency are required to be submitted in narrative form (including the time period on which the increased frequency
is based, the method of analysis, and the interpretation of the results), rather than using the form designated by
FDA. 15-day Alert reports based on increased frequency are required to be submitted under separate cover and may not
be included, except for summary purposes, in a periodic report.
(iv) 

Submission of reports

. The requirements of paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (c)(1)(ii), and (c)(i)(iii) of this section, concerning the submission
of postmarketing 15-day Alert reports, shall also apply to any person (other than the licensed manufacturer of the
final product) whose name appears on the label of a licensed biological product as a manufacturer, packer, distributor,
shared manufacturer, joint manufacturer, or any other participant involved in divided manufacturing. However,
in order to avoid unnecessary duplication in the submission to FDA of reports required by paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (c)(1)(ii),
and (c)(1)(iii) of this section, obligations of a manufacturer other than the licensed manufacturer, including
a licensed manufacturer of the product other than in its final form, may be met by submission of all reports of serious
adverse experiences to the licensed manufacturer of the final product. If a manufacturer, other than the licensed
manufacturer, elects to submit reports to the licensed manufacturer rather than to FDA, it shall submit each report
to the licensed manufacturer within 3 calendar days of its receipt, and the licensed manufacturer shall then comply
with the requirements of this section. Under this circumstance, the manufacturer shall maintain a record of this
action which shall include:
(A) A copy of all adverse biological product experience reports submitted to the licensed manufacturer.
(B) Date the report was received by the manufacturer other than the licensed manufacturer.
(C) Date the report was submitted to the licensed manufacturer.
(D) Name and address of the licensed manufacturer.
(v) 

Report identification

. Each report submitted under this paragraph shall bear prominent identification as to its contents, i.e., ``15-day
Alert report,'' ``15-day Alert report_followup,'' or ``Increased frequency report.''
(2)(i) 

Periodic adverse experience reports

. The licensed manufacturer shall report every 6 months each adverse experience not reported under paragraphs (c)(1)(i)
and (c)(1)(ii) of this section. The periodic reporting term shall be based upon the international birth date of the
biological product. The first 6-month anniversary of the international birth date after the application is approved
in the United States is the da
