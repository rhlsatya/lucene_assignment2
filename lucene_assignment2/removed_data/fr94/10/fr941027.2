AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT



Loan Guarantees to Israel; Notice of Investment Opportunity



The Government of Israel (the ``GOI'') wishes to select managing underwriters for the structuring and sale of U.S.
Agency for International Development (``USAID'')-guaranteed loans. The USAID-guaranteed loans have been authorized
by Public Law 102-391, and are being provided in connection with Israel's extraordinary humanitarian effort
to resettle and absorb immigrants into Israel from the republics of the former Soviet Union, Ethiopia and other countries.

The legislation authorizes the guaranty by USAID of up to $10 billion principal amount of loans over the next five years,
with a maximum of $2 billion in loans, offered in one or more tranches, to be guaranteed in each of the five fiscal years.
This Notice is in connection with the GOI's selection of managing underwriters for one or more offerings contemplated
to be made under the authorization for the current fiscal year.

The GOI would like to receive proposals from interested underwriters on an expedited basis. A Request for Proposals
(``RFP'') will be available from the GOI on or about October 26, 1994. Proposals must be submitted, in accordance with
the RFP, by 4:00 p.m. on October 31, 1994. For information regarding the submission of proposals, please contact Mr.
Eliahu Ziv-Zitouk, Chief Fiscal Officer, Ministry of Finance of the Government of Israel, 350 Fifth Avenue, New York,
New York 10118 (fax: 212/736-2759).

To accomplish the GOI's objectives, the GOI's lead manager must at a minimum:

1. Perform and discuss with the GOI and its financial advisor a complete quantitative analysis of the cash flows generated
by the proposed structures and proposed pricing of securities;

2. Complete the underwriting of all securities offered for sale;

3. Establish and maintain a post-sale trading market for the securities; and

4. Coordinate all activities relating to the proposed financing plan with the GOI and its financial advisor.

Selection of underwriters and the terms of the loans are initially subject to the individual discretion of the GOI
and thereafter subject to approval by USAID. In order to be eligible for selection as a managing underwriter, an institution
must be a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, and otherwise meet the legal requirements for
serving in such role.

The full repayment of the loans will be guaranteed by USAID. To be eligible for an USAID guaranty, the loans must be repayable
in full no later than the thirtieth anniversary of the disbursement of the principal amount thereof. The USAID guaranty
will be backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America and will be issued pursuant to authority in
Section 226 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended. Disbursements under the loans will be subject to certain
conditions required of the GOI by USAID as set forth in agreements between USAID and the GOI.

Additional information regarding USAID's responsibilities in this guaranty program can be obtained from the undersigned:
Room 225, 515 22nd Street NW., Washington, DC 20523-0235, telephone: 202/663-2771.

Availability of Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

We are advising the public that an environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact have been prepared
by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service relative to the renewal of a permit to allow the field testing of genetically
engineered organisms. The environmental assessment provides a basis for our conclusion that the field testing of
the genetically engineered organisms will not present a risk of introducing or disseminating a plant pest and will
not have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment. Based on its finding of no significant impact,
the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that an environmental impact statement need not be
prepared.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The regulations in 7 CFR part 340 (referred to below as the regulations) regulate the introduction (importation,
interstate movement, and release into the environment) of genetically engineered organisms and products that are
plant pests or that there is reason to believe are plant pests (regulated articles). A permit must be obtained before
a regulated article may be introduced into the United States. The regulations set forth the procedures for obtaining
a limited permit for the importation or interstate movement of a regulated article and for obtaining a permit for the
release into the environment of a regulated article. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has stated
that it would prepare an environmental assessment and, when necessary, an environmental impact statement before
issuing a permit for the release into the environment of a regulated article (see 52 FR 22906).


In the course of reviewing each permit application, APHIS assessed the impact on the environment that releasing the
organisms under the conditions described in the permit application would have. APHIS has issued a permit for the field
testing of the organisms listed below after concluding that the organisms will not present a risk of plant pest introduction
or dissemination and will not have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment. The environmental
assessment and finding of no significant impact, which are based on data submitted by the applicants and on a review
of other relevant literature, provide the public with documentation of APHIS' 
review and analysis of the environmental impacts associated with conducting the field tests.
The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact have been prepared by APHIS relative to the issuance
of a permit to allow the field testing of the following genetically engineered organisms:




The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact have been prepared in accordance with: (1) The
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 

et seq.

), (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40
CFR parts 1500-1508), (3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA (7 CFR part 1b), and (4) APHIS Guidelines Implementing
NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384, August 28, 1979, and 44 FR 51272-51274, August 31, 1979).

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
action: 

Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

The Technology Administration's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) announces available funding
for various competitions under the Advanced Technology Program (ATP). During 1995, the ATP will hold the following
competitions:



(1) General Competition 95-01 in which proposals in all areas of technology meeting the ATP criteria are solicited,
and, 

(2) Several Program Competitions focused on specific technology or technology application areas.

This notice provides general information for all the competitions planned for 1995. Proposal due dates, program
competition topics, and other competition-specific instructions for the General Competition and each of the Program
Competitions will be published in the Commerce Business Daily (CBD) at a later date.

Those interested in applying for ATP funding must contact the ATP at the address shown later in this notice to obtain
application materials. The Proposal Preparation Kit available upon request from the ATP contains the application
forms, background material, and instructions referenced in this notice. The new ATP Proposal Preparation Kit may
be used either for General Competitions or Program Competitions. The Advanced Technology Program is Program Number
11.612 in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.

Due dates for the general and program competition will be published in the CBD at the time each competition is announced.
Should there ever be an extension of the due date for any ATP competition, that information will be provided via a notice
published in the CBD as well as a recorded message on the ATP toll-free ``Hotline'' number (1-800-ATP-FUND).
For this reason, we recommend that applicants check this recorded message prior to the closing date.

The specific date and location will be announced in the CBD regarding a public meeting for parties considering applying
for funding in the ATP General Competition 95-01. Attendance at this public meeting is not required of potential
proposers. The purpose of the meeting is to provide general information regarding the ATP procedures, selection
process, and proposal preparation to potential applicants unfamiliar with the ATP. No discussion of specific proposals
will occur at this meeting. Dates and times of analogous public meetings for the program competitions will be announced
in the CBD, transmitted to those on the ATP mailing list, and described on the ATP toll-free Hotline.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background



The ATP is managed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, an element of the Technology Administration
(TA) of the Department of Commerce. ATP was established by section 5131 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act
of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-418, 15 U.S.C. 278n), as modified by Public Law 102-245.

The ATP works with U.S. industry to advance the nation's competitiveness_and economy_by helping to fund the development
of high-risk but powerful new technologies that underlie a broad spectrum of potential new applications, commercial
products, and services. Through cooperative agreements with individual companies or groups of companies, large
and small, the ATP invests in industrial projects to develop technologies with high-payoff potential for the nation.
The ATP accelerates technologies that_because they are risky_are unlikely to be developed in time to compete in rapidly
changing world markets without such a partnership of industry and government. By sharing the cost of such projects,
the ATP catalyzes industry to pursue promising technologies. The Proposal Preparation Kit expands on the goals of
the ATP and describes in detail what constitutes a good ATP proposal.

The ATP operates under program procedures published at part 295, title 15, of the Code of Federal Regulations. These
procedures were updated (59 FR, page 663, January 6, 1994). A copy of the updated version of these procedures is provided
in the ATP Proposal Preparation Kit.

Cooperative research agreements rather than grants are the funding instruments used for ATP awards. A cooperative
research agreement differs from a grant with respect to the amount of interaction between the Federal Government
and the recipient, and is used to provide financial assistance when substantial involvement is anticipated between
the government and the recipient.



Invitation for Proposals



The ATP CBD notices to be published later will invite applications for funding from:

(1) Individual United States businesses in amounts not to exceed $2 million (federal share) over three years. Single
applicants must fund all indirect costs associated with the project.

(2) Industry-led joint research and development ventures, where ATP support will serve as a catalyst for the proposed
joint venture project, and provided, however, that the ATP share is a minority share of the cost of the venture for up
to five years.

Applicant eligibility is discussed in detail in the ATP Proposal Preparation Kit.

All awards are subject to the availability of appropriations. Future or continued funding for multi-year projects
will be at the discretion of NIST and will be contingent on such factors as satisfactory performance and the availability
of funds.



Abbreviated Proposals



ATP reserves the right to use abbreviated proposal for any general or program competition. Information regarding
the use of abbreviated proposals will be included in the CBD announcement of that specific competition. The purpose
of abbreviated proposals is to provide applicants with limited resources early feedback regarding whether the proposed
project falls within the scope of the ATP and whether the project proposed appears sufficiently promising relative
to the selection criteria to warrant preparation of a full proposal. In competitions where abbreviated proposals
are accepted, applicants who submit such proposals will be notified in writing whether or not ATP recommends submission
of a full proposal.

ATP may provide feedback to proposers in one of the following three ways:

(1) (Used for abbreviated proposals only); A written transmittal giving a yes/no recommendation regarding preparation
of a full proposal;

(2) A checklist noting concerns regarding the proposal or abbreviated proposal. This transmittal may be accompanied
by a statement summarizing common shortcomings noted in the proposals submitted to that competition;

(3) An oral debriefing by telephone summarizing the strengths and weaknesses of the proposal.

Which of these feedback mechanisms is used will depend on the competition and may depend on the number of proposals
received.

Proprietary information is abbreviated and full proposals will be protected. If your proposal contains proprietary
information, mark it accordingly; however, the title page must not include proprietary information. We recommend
including the following legend on the title page: ``Proposal contains proprietary information. Title page nonproprietary.''

Full proposals must be prepared in accordance with the instructions in the ATP Proposal Preparation Kit. In competitions
involving abbreviated proposals, heed the general advice provided in the ATP Proposal Preparation Kit, but follow
the specific instructions announced in the specific CBD announcements.



Funds Available for Cooperative Research Agreements



An estimated $20 to $25 million in first-year funding will be available for General Competition 95-01. The number
of awards will depend on the quality of the proposals received and the amount of funding requested by the proposals
under consideration for awards. Based on ATP's experience the number of awards is unlikely to exceed 30. An estimated
$100 to $125 million in first-year funding will be available for the several program competition to be announced.
For every ATP competition, NIST reserves the right to fund proposals totalling more or less than the amount of funding
tentatively allocated to that competition if the number of high quality proposals received is judged to be greater
or fewer respectively than anticipated.



Preparation of Full Proposal and Reporting Requirements



The ATP Proposal Preparation Kit, available from the ATP, contains background material on the ATP, detailed contents
and formatting guidelines for the preparation of full proposals, and the required forms. Also included is information
of reporting and audit requirements for recipients. To be accepted for review, full proposals must meet all of the
requirements outlined in the Kit. Full proposals that fail to meet one or more of those requirements will be considered
non-responsive to the solicitation.

Award Criteria and Proposal Review Process



The criteria used to evaluate proposals submitted to the ATP and the proposal review process are documented in the
Proposal Preparation Kit.



Negotiation of Cooperative Agreements



NIST reserves the right to negotiate project scope and funding levels with ATP cooperative research agreement recipients.



Submission of Revised Proposals



An applicant may submit a full proposal that is a revised version of a full proposal submitted to a previous ATP competition.
NIST will examine such proposals to determine whether substantial revisions have been made. Where the revisions
are determined not to be substantial, NIST reserves the right to score and rank, or where appropriate, to reject, such
proposals based on reviews of the previously-submitted proposal.



Transfer of Proposals



NIST reserves the right to transfer a full proposal received in response to a General Competition invitation to a Program
Competition underway in the same general timeframe if the subject matter of the proposal clearly falls within the
scope of the Program Competition. NIST will not transfer proposals from Program Competitions to General Competitions.
Applicants will be notified if and when a proposal is transferred from a General Competition to a Program Competition.



Other Requirements, Requests, and Provisions



No award of Federal funds shall be made to an applicant or recipient who has an outstanding delinquent Federal debt
until either the delinquent account is paid in full, a negotiated repayment schedule is established and at least one
payment is received, or other arrangements satisfactory to the Department are made.

All for-profit and nonprofit applicants are subject to a name check review process. Name checks are intended to reveal
if any key individuals associated with the applicant have been convicted of or are presently facing criminal charges
such as fraud, theft, perjury, or other matters which significantly reflect on the applicant's management honesty
or financial integrity.

Unsatisfactory performance under prior Federal awards may result in an application not being considered for funding.

If applicants incur any costs prior to an award being made, they do so solely at their own risk of not being reimbursed
by the Government. Notwithstanding any verbal or written assurance that may have been received, there is no obligation
on the part of the Department of Commerce to cover pre-award costs.



Primary Applicant Certification



All primary applicants must submit a completed form CD-511, ``Certifications Regarding Debarment, Suspension,
and Other Responsibility Matters; Drug-Free Workplace Requirements and Lobbying,'' and the following explanation
is hereby provided:

a. Nonprocurement Debarment and Suspension_Prospective participants, as defined at 15 CFR part 26, section 105
are subject to 15 CFR part 26, ``Nonprocurement Debarment and Suspension'' and the related section of the certification
form prescribed above applies;

b. Drug-Free Workplace_Grantees (as defined at 15 CFR part 605) are subject to 15 CFR 26, subpart F, ``Governmentwide
Requirements for Drug-Free Workplace (Grants)'' and the related section of the certification form prescribed above
applies;

c. Anti-Lobbying_Persons (as defined at 15 CFR part 28, section 105) are subject to the lobbying provisions of 31 USC
1352, ``Limitations on use of appropriated funds to influence certain Federal contracting and financial transactions,''
and the lobbying section of the certification form prescribed above applies to applications/bids for grants, cooperative
agreements, and contracts for more than $100,000, and loans and loan guarantees for more than $150,000, or the single
family maximum mortgage limit for affected programs, whichever is greater; and,

d. Anti-Lobbying Disclosures_Any applicant that has paid or will pay for lobbying using any funds must submit an SF-LLL,
``Disclosure of Lobbying Activities,'' as required under 15 CFR part 28, Appendix B.

Lower Tier Certification_Recipients shall require applicants/bidders for subgrants, contracts, subcontracts,
or other lower tier covered transactions at any tier under the award to submit, if applicable, a completed Form CD-512,
``Certifications Regarding Debarment, Suspension, Ineligibility and Voluntary Exclusion_Lower Tier Covered
Transactions and Lobbying'' and Form SF-LLL, ``Disclosure of Lobbying Activities.'' Although the CD-512
is intended for the use of primary recipients and should not be transmitted to NIST, the SF-LLL submitted by any
tier recipient or subrecipient should be forwarded in accordance with the instructions contained in the award document.

A false statement on any application for funding under ATP may be grounds for denial or termination of funds and grounds
for possible punishment by a fine or imprisonment as provided in 18 U.S.C. 1001. The ATP does not involve the mandatory
payment of any matching funds from state or local government and does not affect directly any state or local government.
Accordingly, the Department of Commerce has determined that Executive Order 12372, ``Intergovernmental Review
of Federal Programs'' is not applicable to this program. Recipients and subrecipients are subject to all Federal
laws and Federal and Department of Commerce policies, regulations and procedures applicable to financial assistance
awards.

Applicants are hereby notified that any equipment or products authorized to be purchased with funding provided under
this program must be American-made to the maximum extent feasible in accordance with Public Law 103-317, section
607 (a) and (b). Adequate justification will be required for any proposed purchase of equipment or products that are
not American-made.

AmeriCorps State and National Direct Federal Grant Programs



I. Policies and Guidelines for Renewals of Existing Grantees 



A. Renewals



The Corporation in general anticipates renewing grants for existing programs that meet quality standards. However,
renewals are not automatic, and will be evaluated on the following renewal criteria:



1. Year One Progress to Date (80%)




The degree to which grantees have made reasonable progress towards objectives and can articulate problems or issues
that occurred in the first year. These include objectives related to members, the community and the program itself,
including:




a. Development of well-organized service activities which have direct and demonstrable results.


b. Degree of community support and involvement and evidence of impact on the community




c. Quality of financial management and extent to which the match has been raised or exceeded.




d. Quality of program management and the extent to which high-quality program staff have been selected, trained and
placed.




e. The degree to which recruitment goals have been met and the AmeriCorps members have been retained in the program.




f. National Identity_The extent to which the program is recognizable as AmeriCorps in the community and by the members.




g. State commissions, national non-profits and federal agencies serving as grantors will also be evaluated on:




i. Their success in following the timeline and workplan for getting grant awards to programs, monitoring their progress
and providing technical assistance.




ii. The extent to which issues and problems have been promptly and effectively addressed.


iii. The extent to which they have implemented plans to evaluate programs.




2. Year Two Plans (20%).




a. Clear articulation of problems encountered in Year One and how they will be addressed in Year Two.




b. A sound plan for sensible growth and improvement.



c. If expansion is planned, clear and compelling programmatic reasons for doing so and the organization's capacity
to expand.



d. If expansion is planned, the extent to which the organization's Year One activities warrant expansion.




e. Clear and well-thought-out program objectives for Year Two that are consistent with Year One.




f. State commissions, national non-profits and federal agencies serving as grantors will also be evaluated on:




i. the quality of their plans for expansion;


ii. the quality of the plan for technical assistance and program monitoring;


iii. the degree to which they understand problems they encountered in Year One and how they will address them in Year
Two;




4. If, for State Commission grantors only, the state plan has been revised, the degree to which it reflects the state's
experience with AmeriCorps and Learn and Serve programs; and




5. The quality of the state's framework, for State Commission grantors only, within which comprehensive program
monitoring and evaluations can be made.



B. Conversion of Planning Grants to Operating Grants for Formula-Funding






The Corporation is recommending that State Commissions give priority to converting Formula-funded planning grants
to operational programs over new applications, if the proposals meet quality standards.



C. Members, Site, Program, Budget Expansion Criteria



The Corporation will give priority to expanding the number of members in existing program sites, and to expanding
the number of sites themselves, if the program has a solid track record and sound needs and plans for expansion and meets
the other criteria for renewal. If the expansion request exceeds 25% of the Year One budget or the planned expansion
is to base the program in two different cities, then the program expansion will be considered a new application and
will not receive priority.



D. Issue Area Priorities






The Corporation has not changed the priority area emphases for renewals. This decision reflects the Corporation's
belief that the extension of these priorities during the renewal process will contribute to building successful
programs and stronger relationships with the field. The priority areas for renewals are:



1. Public Safety






a. Crime Control and Response_Improving criminal justice services, law enforcement, and victim services.


b. Crime Prevention_Reducing the incidence of violence.



2. Education






a. School Readiness_Further early childhood development.


b. School Success_Improve the educational achievement of school-age youth and adults who lack basic academic skills
by utilizing comprehensive strategies with potential for long-term impact.



3. Human Needs






a. Health_Provide comprehensive health prevention, wellness, and community-based health care.


b. Home_Reduce the number of homeless Americans, open housing markets to minorities, empower and revitalize rural,
suburban and urban communities.




4. Environment






a. Neighborhood Environment_Promote sustainable communities by reducing environmental risks, especially in
low income neighborhoods, and by incorporating environmental design and technologies to conserve natural and cultural
resources.



b. Natural Environment_Conserve, restore and sustain natural habitats.



II. Policies and Preferences for New State Competitive and National Direct Applicants



In addition to those preferences and objectives described by the Corporation's statute and regulations, the Corporation's
recommendations reflect our objectives of encouraging new applicants to focus on our new priorities. The Corporation's
recommendations reflect our objective to encourage the tailoring of our FY 1994 priorities for new applicants. The
Corporation will solicit proposals for new programs which supplement the existing range of AmeriCorps programs,
including new models in priority areas not covered by existing programs.

<PARENT> FR941027-2-00010 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

A. Issue Areas To Be Targeted



Outlined below are staff recommendations on the issue areas to be targeted for new state competitive and national
direct program applications:

1. Community Policing_Supporting community policing efforts through building partnerships with neighborhood
residents, identifying community problems, and working with police officers to solve these problems.

2. Victim Assistance_Working on programs in public agencies or community-based organizations to provide a wide
range of support services to victims of crime and to help link victims to other providers of information and services
within the justice system and community.

3. Neighborhood Environment_Initiate innovative grass-roots programs in low income neighborhoods that promote
sustainable communities by reducing environmental risks, and conserving natural resources.

4. Early childhood development_Improve the health and school readiness of young children through child care, Head
Start, and other pre-school programs; programs to improve parenting skills and community-based efforts to provide
comprehensive services to families with young children (including pregnant women).

5. School Success_Broaden or coordinate the range of services available through schools such as tutoring, after-school
enrichment programs, service-learning, health and child care service and efforts to involve parents in their children's
education as part of a comprehensive strategy to improve school achievement and student retention.



B. Programmatic Preferences



The Corporation will give preferences to new applicants who integrate the following into their proposals:



1. Concentration



The Corporation is encouraging programs to concentrate the efforts of AmeriCorps Members. In general, preference
will be given to programs that propose service activities at fewer sites rather than more sites, that focus activities
in the priority areas, and that involve groups of Corps Members in contrast to individually-placed Corps Members.
Similarly, programs that regularly bring Corps Members together for training, identity, and service will be preferred
over those that propose more diffused organizations.



2. Specialization



Programs that propose to develop priority area specializations are accorded preference over programs with a more
generalist focus. Specifically not encouraged are programs that propose to engage Corps Members in many activities
addressing many priorities.



3. Diversity



Programs that show a specific strategy for attracting members with diverse backgrounds will be given a preference.
The Corporation encourages programs to treat diversity broadly, searching beyond their ordinary participant base
to include, for example, individuals from other ethnic groups and people with disabilities. Programs are encouraged,
if appropriate, to include intergenerational components.



4. Education Awards Only



Because the Corporation has more funds available for education awards than for program costs, we continue to urge
applicants that have adequate resources to cover program costs to request education awards only.



C. Localities for Concentration



Empowerment Zones, Enterprise Communities and areas affected by military downsizing. The Corporation will accord
special consideration to applicants who propose to sponsor AmeriCorps service activities in officially-designated
empowerment zones or enterprise communities, and areas impacted by military downsizing.



D. Selection Criteria



Selection criteria for new applicants remain those established in 1994, based on the quality of the proposal and the
proposed program's ability to:

1. Get things done in communities.

2. Strengthen communities.

3. Expand opportunities for members.

4. Encourage responsibility.

5. Be innovative.

6. Be replicated in other areas.

7. Be sustained beyond Corporation support.



Learn and Serve America K-12 Grant Program



All Learn and Serve America: School- and Community-Based Programs address needs within at least one of the four priority
areas of the Corporation: Environment, Education, Human Needs and Public Safety. Because the objectives of Learn
and Serve America focus more on education reform and participant development, however, it is critical for us to focus
primarily on program improvement and quality priorities, rather than issue areas. Therefore the policies and priorities
for renewals of existing grantees and new applicants are the same.



I. Renewals



In general, the Corporation anticipates renewing grants for existing programs that meet quality standards. However,
renewals are not automatic. Renewal applications for Learn and Serve America K-12 grants to State Educational
Agencies will be evaluated based on the following criteria.



A. Quality of the Year Two Plan (60%)

1. Goals and Objectives



The goals and objectives of the plan are:

a. Clearly stated.

b. Measurable.

c. Achievable.

d. Time-phased.

e. Appropriate & effective vehicles for promoting service-learning.



2. Design and Activities



The design and activities set forth in the plan:

a. Are clearly related to achieving stated goals and objectives.

b. Meet community needs and involves individuals from diverse backgrounds (including economically disadvantaged
youth and individuals with physical or cognitive disabilities) who will serve together to explore the underlying
causes of community problems.

c. Involve youth in the planning, implementation, and evaluation of the plan.

d. Provide for productive and meaningful educational experiences which incorporate service-learning methods.



3. Learn and Serve America Priorities



The quality and extent to which the goals and objectives and program design address the following programmatic priorities:

a. Infrastructure and capacity-building.

b. Partnerships with other education reform efforts.

c. Qualitative/quantitative research and evaluation.

d. Coordinated streams of service.



4. Organizational Capacity



The plan describes sound processes for:

a. Training.

b. Technical assistance.

c. Supervision.

d. Quality control.

e. Evaluation.

f. Administration.

g. Equitable distribution of funds to local grantees.

h. Ensuring quality and evaluating the efforts of the grantee and local subgrantees.

i. The principal leaders who will implement the plan are well qualified for their responsibilities.



5. Evaluation



The plan includes an adequate process for evaluating:

a. Overall performance (of the grantee and subgrantees).

b. Program activities.

c. Youth development/educational outcomes.

d. Community impact.



6. Sustainability



The extent to which the applicant:

a. Demonstrates the ability and willingness to collaborate with the State Commission, Alternative Administrative
Entity, or Transitional Entity.

b. Fosters collaborative efforts among local educational agencies, local government agencies, community-based
agencies, businesses, and State agencies.

c. Has strong, broad-based partnerships and community support.

d. Presents evidence that financial resources will be available to continue the Learn and Serve America effort after
the expiration of the grant.



7. Innovation and Replicability



The extent to which the plan:

a. Advances knowledge about how to do effective and innovative community service and service-learning.

b. Enhances the effort within the broader K-12 field.

c. Will assist others in learning from experience and replicating the program concept.



8. Cost-Effectiveness



The extent to which the budget:

a. Correlates with the program narrative.

b. Details costs by providing justification and appropriate calculations for each line item.

c. Sufficiently supports project activities.

d. Represents reasonable costs, given current rates.



B. Performance to Date (40%)



The Corporation recommends that consideration of past performance be based on whether the grantee has:

1. Made reasonable progress toward accomplishing project goals and objectives.

2. Adequately addressed issues or problems that occurred or has developed sufficient plans to address them in year
two.

3. Met reporting requirements in a timely manner.

4. Conducted adequate planning, capacity-building and training activities.

5. Implemented, operated, and expanded service-learning programs through grants to local partnerships, as stated
in the original proposal.

6. Implemented, operated, and expanded school-based programs involving adult volunteers, if applicable.



II. Priority Areas for New Grants and Renewals



In addition to those objectives and priorities described by the Corporation statute and regulations, the Corporation
is recommending that new and existing grantees be requested to address the following priorities in their Learn and
Serve America plans.



A. State Infrastructure/Capacity Building



An effective service-learning state infrastructure includes a statewide network of service-learning practitioners,
policy makers and members who advocate the advancement of service-learning methodology. This infrastructure also
includes state financial and human resources committed to service-learning efforts, as well as state level support
for service-learning. Infrastructure is key to realizing the full potential of service-learning to reform education
and rebuild communities. There is a need to build both legislative and financial support at the state level, especially
as future federal funding may not be available. Priority will be given to state plans that institutionalize service-learning,
as well as those that leverage dollars at the state and local levels.



B. Partnerships With Other Education Reform Efforts



To help build the infrastructure needed to support service-learning as a methodology for education reform, the Corporation
will encourage linkages with other education reform efforts, such as Goals 2000, School-to-Work transition and
middle grades restructuring. States will be encouraged to promote such linkages through advocating for the inclusion
of service-learning language in state education reform legislation and school board policies.

Connections to state and federal education reform efforts help promote institutionalization and sustainability.
As states consider school restructuring or the new methodology of education reformers, the Corporation should encourage
them to include service-learning in their plans. Priority will be given to programs that utilize dollars from other
federal education legislation or promote linkage with state level reform efforts.



C. Qualitative/Quantitative Research and Evaluation



Up to this point, the service-learning research focus has been mainly on personal development with data collection
being mostly anecdotal. To further expand and sustain service-learning as a legitimate pedagogy, the field needs
a solid base of research to support it. Once academic improvement is solidly documented, more members of the education
community will support service-learning as a legitimate tool for education reform. Priority will be granted to proposals
which plan to document service-learning outcomes, especially those focusing on measurement of improved academic
achievement and attendance, and reductions in disciplinary actions. This type of solid research will be useful during
the reauthorization process.



D. Coordinated Streams of Service



When all CNCS grantees in a given state work together, it is possible to ``get things done'' more effectively and efficiently.
AmeriCorps Members can strengthen Learn and Service programs by serving as service-learning coordinators at the
school district or individual school level. Senior Corps members can offer valuable skills and experience to Learn
and Serve members through pre-service training and post-service reflection activities. Priority will be granted
to proposing linking the various streams of service in the state.



III. Renewal Period



The Corporation recommends renewing grants for one year only. This will allow Learn and Serve America staff to ensure
greater quality in plans and to promote program improvement.



IV. Program Components To Be Addressed



The Corporation recommends that the following program components be addressed in FY 1995. These components were
identified by staff and outside peer reviewers as overall weaknesses in the proposals submitted under Learn and Serve
America in 1994.



A. Academic Components



Connections to the curriculum/education reform Proposals submitted this year demonstrate the need for the Corporation
to work with grantees at three levels of the service-learning integration continuum: awareness/basic introduction
to service-learning methodology; making clear connections to the academic curriculum; and articulating clear
academic outcomes and ways to measure those outcomes. If the Corporation is to fund service-

learning 

programs, then we need to work with grantees to enhance the academic components of their plans.



B. Evaluation



The Corporation recommends that grantees be encouraged to consider evaluation at three levels: information to be
collected for the national evaluation; evaluation of the work at the primary grantee level, such as State Education
Agency, State Commission, or national non-profit; and the evaluation of local program (subgrantee) activities.
Grantees will be encouraged to define clear, measurable goals and objectives, as well as to develop or select adequate
measurement tools.



C. Innovation/Replicability



The Corporation recommends grantees to seek viable approaches in achieving program replicability and innovation.
The Corporation encourages programs to work closely with the Learn and Serve America K-12 staff to establish
a framework to assist in the development of new ideas and the expansion of or building upon proven model programs.



D. Sustainability



The Corporation encourages grantees to design a clearly defined and detailed plan for program sustainability. Grantees
should articulate a comprehensive long-term plan that not only cites specific monetary and in-kind resources, but
incorporates state infrastructure and capacity building.



E. Coordination With Other Service Streams in the State



Programs are encouraged to coordinate their service efforts with the state's service network, including youth,
educators, State Commission members, policy makers, parents, representatives from community organizations and
national nonprofits. Improving collaboration strengthens state service-learning efforts, presents a stronger,
more unified voice for service-learning at the state policy level, promotes sustainability and helps states achieve
goals with fewer dollars through resource sharing.



F. Indian Tribes and U.S. Territories



The Corporation anticipates that its technical assistance and outreach efforts to Indian Tribes and Territories
will improve in Year Two. The Corporation encourages Indian Tribes and Territories to identify specific areas of
need so the Corporation may better assess less developed program areas and strengthen the overall quality of Indian
Tribe proposals for Year Two.



V. Guidelines for 1994 Renewals



A. Amount of Funding Requested by Applicants for Renewal



The Corporation recommends the following guidelines concerning the amount of funding that may be requested by year
two grantees.



1. State Educational Agencies



The FY 1995 appropriation for SEA allotment grants will increase approximately 25%. The SEAs will be informed of exactly
what their formula allotments will be in FY 1995 when renewal materials are sent to them.



2. State Commissions, Grantmaking Entities (School- and Community-Based), and Fund for the Advancement of Service-Learning
Grantees



Approximate second year funding levels were determined during the year one application process. All applicants
in these categories were asked to submit three year plans.



3. Indian Tribes/Territories



Most grants are expected to upgrade from planning to operational programs. We plan to limit these requests to an additional
60-75% increase over the amount of the FY 1994 planning grant.

B. Information Required in Addition to the Quarterly Report


The Corporation is requesting that renewal applicants submit the following for consideration:
1. Updated statement of goals and objectives.
2. Workplan for the second program year.
a. Program activities as they relate to goals and objectives:
i. description of subgranting (number of continuation subgrants v. number of new subgrants);

4. Second year budget narrative and form (Cost effectiveness).


Learn and Serve America: Higher Education FY 1995 Policies and Priorities


I. Policies and Guidelines for Renewals of Existing Grantees


In general, the Corporation anticipates renewing grants for existing programs that meet quality standards. Renewal
funding will not be automatic. Decisions will be based on two factors: progress to date (80%) and future plans (20%).
A. Information on progress to date will be collected primarily through the semi-annual progress report (quarterly
report for demonstration programs) and secondarily through other methods, that include informal monitoring, contact
with program personnel and site visits. Progress reports will include the following information, which translate
into criteria for renewal decisions:
1. Number of participants:
a. The degree to which recruitment goals have been met. The amount of attrition observed.
2. Service and learning activities:
a. The quality of service placements. The degree to which activities are well-supervised, well-suited to participants'
skill and training, and designed to achieve demonstrable impacts on community needs. The quality of reflection activities.
The clarity of learning objectives associated with these activities.
3. Implementation:
a. The extent to which high-quality program staff have been recruited, selected, trained, and placed. The degree
to which the program is following its timeline and implementation plan. The reasonableness of explanations for deviations
from or adjustments to the timeline.
4. Progress toward objectives:
a. The degree to which there is quantitative or other evidence of progress toward approved objectives related to community,
participants, and institutional impacts. The degree to which the program has developed a system to collect data and
demonstrate outcomes.
5. Progress toward sustainability:
a. The degree to which the program has explored alternative sources of funding and built stronger institutional and
community support.
6. Important findings from internal evaluation and monitoring:
a. The reliability of mechanisms for feedback and continuous improvement. The degree to which participants, service
beneficiaries, and partners are satisfied with the program. The extent to which the program has identified problems,
areas for improvement, or lessons learned, and taken appropriate action.
7. Financial management and match:
a. The extent to which the match has been raised. The extent to which a fundraising plan has been developed. The extent
to which quarterly financial reports and up-to-date records of line-item expenditures show balanced and appropriate
spending across program areas. The reasonableness of explanations for unusually low or high expenditures in particular
budget lines.
b. In addition, in making renewal decisions, the Corporation will take into account grantees' responsiveness to
inquiries and requests from program staff and their timeliness in notifying program staff of major problems in implementation.
B. Information on 

future plans

 will be collected through a brief application for renewal funding. Proposals should build on progress in the previous
year, reflecting lessons learned and actions that correct weakenesses. The information will include:
1. Clear outcome objectives for the next year, consistent with objectives for the current year.
2. Next year's activities.
3. Implementation plan and timeline, reflecting lessons learned from the current year.
4. An update on expenditures and obligations under the current grant.
5. Next year's budget with detailed narrative.
In general, first-year programs (non-demonstration) may apply for 90 percent of their current grant amounts. Second-year
programs may apply for 80 percent of their current grant amounts.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941027-2-00019 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941027-2-00010 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Current demonstration programs with AmeriCorps Members may maintain or expand the number of Members (up to 25 percent,
in general). In the second year application, programs proposing expansion will be required to justify the expansion
in terms of need, organizational capacity, success in first-year implementation, and adequacy of plans for managing
expansion. Part-time programs with AmeriCorps Members whose terms of service are longer than one year may propose
a new class of AmeriCorps Members in the second year. Such a proposal constitutes an expansion.


II. Policies and Guidelines for New Applicants


A. The Corporation intends to streamline FY 1995 applicants into one of three categories that reflect major distinctions
in program design and activities:
(1) Individual institution of higher education or partnership,
(2) Consortium, or
(3) Demonstration program with AmeriCorps Members. Some proposal narrative guidelines and selection criteria
will apply to all three categories. Other guidelines and criteria will apply specifically to one but not the others.
Instead of listing specific criteria for public comment, the Corporation has decided to invite direct input on what
criteria should apply to each category. In particular, the Corporation welcomes input on the development of criteria
appropriate for consortium applicants.
B. Overall, the selection criteria will build on those established in the FY 1994 application. The FY 1995 guidelines
will reflect the following key points:
1. The Corporation will reaffirm the Learn and Serve America program's emphasis on building capacity and strengthening
infrastructure, in particular by setting clear narrative guidelines and selection criteria specifically for consortium
applicants.
2. The Corporation will place added emphasis on the applicant's ability to articulate clear objectives with demonstrable
outcomes and means of assessment.
3. The Corporation will encourage programs to focus on a single issue area or community need, instead of scattering
activities among several areas.
C. The Corporation will give priority to applicants according to the following guidelines:
1. The issue areas to be targeted under AmeriCorps*USA also will apply to Learn and Serve America: Higher Education.
These are community policing, victim assistance, neighborhood environment, early childhood development, and
school success.
2. In order to fund an array of institutions that reflects the diversity of American higher education, the Corporation
will give priority to programs involving community colleges, HBCUs, Hispanic-serving institutions, and tribally
controlled colleges.
3. The Corporation may give priority to certain applicants in order to achieve geographic diversity among funded
programs.
D. The Corporation will continue to fund demonstration programs that involve AmeriCorps Members.
1. New demonstration programs must have both a strong focus on a national priority and an emphasis on building service-learning
capacity.
2. The Corporation will give preference to programs that involve at least 20 AmeriCorps Members overall, that place
Members in teams of two or more at each project site, that propose service activities at fewer rather than more sites,
and that focus activities in a single issue area.
3. The Corporation will structure grants to new demonstration programs so that the length of the grant parallels the
Members' terms of service. For example, if a program engages part-time Members in a two-year term, then the FY 1995
grant will include funds for two years, with release of funds in the second year contingent upon performance in the
first year and availability of appropriations. Part-time terms spanning three years will be discouraged.

<DOCTITLE>Preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) To Clean Out and Deactivate the Hanford, Washington Plutonium
Finishing Plant (PFP) Complex (Except for Storage Areas), To Stabilize PFP Plutonium-Bearing Materials and To Store
the Stabilized Material</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Intent (NOI).



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

DOE announces its intent to prepare an EIS pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C.
4321 

et seq.

) in accordance with the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations for Implementing the Procedural Provisions
of NEPA (40 CFR parts 1500-1508) and the DOE implementing procedures (10 CFR part 1021). DOE invites public comment
and will conduct a series of public scoping meetings to provide an opportunity for the public and interested agencies
to comment on the alternatives and the scope of issues to be addressed in the EIS. 


The proposed action would clean out inactive PFP complex facilities (except for storage areas), stabilize reactive
residual plutonium-bearing materials to a form suitable for long term storage, and store the stabilized material
until DOE makes final storage and disposition decisions. The proposed action would minimize safety concerns, reduce
the exposure of site workers to radiation, and reduce the risk to the public. Upon completion of the action, the PFP-complex
would be deactivated to a state ready for potential decontamination and dismantlement (D&D) and/or potential
future uses. Additional NEPA documentation will be prepared by DOE before any decision is made to D&D the PFP and/or
to use it for other purposes. At this time, no future missions beyond continued vault storage have been identified
for the PFP-complex. Future production of plutonium for defense purposes is not being proposed and is not part of Hanford's
current mission. Existing vault storage of nuclear materials would continue pending future NEPA documentation
and a DOE decision on the ultimate storage or disposition of the materials; on June 21, 1994, DOE issued a NOI to prepare
a programmatic EIS on the storage and disposition of weapons-usable fissile materials.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


The Federal government began operating the Hanford Site, near Richland, Washington, in 1943 as part of the Manhattan
Project to produce plutonium for national defense purposes. Metallic uranium fuel was irradiated in nuclear reactors
at the Hanford Site to create plutonium, which was converted to plutonium nitrate and purified through chemical processing
for use in nuclear weapons. 
Initial production of plutonium metal at the PFP complex began in July, 1949. The complex is located on Hanford's 200
West Area Plateau approximately 32 miles northwest of Richland, Washington. The complex includes production areas,
reclamation processes, laboratories and plutonium storage vaults. Several defense missions were carried out within
the PFP complex. As the need arose, processes were installed in the PFP to recover as much plutonium as possible and
metal production capabilities were updated. Some of the process areas have been deactivated over the last 20 years;
however, plutonium recovery activities continued until the production mission ended in 1989. Secure materials
storage vaults have been in operation since the early 1960s. 
Today, operable areas of the complex include the Plutonium Reclamation Facility (PRF), the Remote Mechanical ``C''
(RMC) line plus process support and research laboratories, the secure storage vaults and support areas. About 240
employees work at the PFP. 
The DOE believes the continued presence of relatively large quantities of chemically reactive materials in their
present form and location within the PFP poses an unacceptable long-term risk to the workers and the environment.
Consequently, in 1993, DOE announced its proposal to operate certain processes in the PFP to stabilize those materials
and to prepare an Environmental 
Assessment (EA) pursuant to NEPA. 
As part of the NEPA process for the proposed EA, DOE conducted public meetings in the summer and fall of 1993 in Richland,
WA; Seattle, WA; Portland, OR; Hood River, OR; and Spokane, WA to discuss the proposal to stabilize the chemically
reactive materials. As a result of the public comments received, DOE decided that an EIS would be the appropriate level
of NEPA review. DOE also decided to expand the scope of review to include cleanout of the PFP (except for storage vaults)
to a state where the facility would be ready for D&D and/or 
future uses. 
To alleviate immediate safety concerns, interim actions have been taken or are underway to minimize the amount of
reactive residual materials left in process areas when the plutonium production mission ended in 1989. The range
of interim actions includes transferring solutions into vented metal containers for safe storage, repackaging
of certain solutions from plastic bottles to safer containers, cleanup of surface radioactive contamination to
reduce worker exposure, and removal of portions of ventilation ductwork and piping which contain residual plutonium.
The thermal stabilization of sludges is a proposed interim action being addressed by an EA currently in progress.
Other interim actions could be proposed during the EIS preparation period to address other specific safety concerns.
All interim actions are or will be covered by appropriate NEPA documentation. 
The proposed action would place the PFP complex in a state ready for potential D&D and/or a future mission while
maintaining its current material storage capability. 


Purpose and Need for Agency Action 


The DOE needs to take action to minimize safety concerns, reduce the exposure of Hanford Site workers to radiation,
and reduce the risk to the public. The proposed action would clean out inactive PFP complex facilities (except storage
areas), stabilize reactive residual material for long-term storage, and store the stabilized material pending
a DOE decision on ultimate storage or disposition of fissile materials. Upon completion of the proposed action, the
PFP complex would be in a state ready for D&D and/or future uses. 


Preliminary Description of Cleanout Alternatives


The following cleanout alternatives are currently being considered for detailed analysis in the EIS: 



1. Wet Cleaning 


Contaminated equipment or facility surfaces would be sprayed with or soaked or immersed in nitric acid and rinsed
with dilute acid. The rinse solutions would be collected in tankage and stabilized in a manner similar to other acid
solutions. Acid washing could be enhanced for greater cleaning by using additives such as cerium or silver persulfate.



2. Mechanical Cleaning 


Methods for mechanical cleaning include abrasive blasting, wiping, scraping and brushing. Blasting would produce
a fine powder containing plutonium which would be collected and stabilized in a manner similar to other solids, then
stored in PFP vaults. Wiping or scraping would produce a similar powder, plus waste in the form of wiping materials
(rags, paper, etc.) These methods require workers to 
be close to contaminated surfaces. 


Preliminary Description of Stabilization Alternatives 


The PFP contains a variety of reactive plutonium-bearing materials that need to be stabilized for long-term storage
pending DOE decisions on ultimate storage or disposition. Stabilized material has minimal chemical reactivity
and generally would be in solid form with a low water or organic content to minimize radiolysis. Most of the reactive
materials are in process areas and equipment. (A portion of the materials stored in PFP vaults must also continue to
be repackaged and stabilized as necessary for long-term storage).
For purposes of analysis, the reactive materials have been divided into groups. The materials in each group are expected
to be amenable to the same stabilization process. The groups are as follows:

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941027-2-00024 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941027-2-00013 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Nitrate solutions 
Chloride solutions 
Other solutions including organic solutions 
Inorganic solids 
Oxides 
Metals and alloys 
Combustibles (used rags, used filters, plastic forms) 
Miscellaneous compounds

 


Each of these groups contains materials which are chemically dissimilar to materials in other groups and may require
separate stabilization processing. Therefore, the preferred stabilization alternative is likely to consist of
more 
than a single process. 

The following stabilization alternatives are currently being considered for detailed analysis in the EIS. 



1. Stabilization via Plutonium Reclamation Facility 



This alternative would involve the restart and operation of the Plutonium Reclamation Facility (PRF), portions
of the Remote Mechanical C (RMC) line and two small glovebox processes that would convert and stabilize chemically
reactive plutonium-bearing scrap for long-term storage. 

The PRF processes would be operated to convert certain plutonium-bearing materials to an aqueous solution. These
materials include the plutonium oxide powder, incinerator ash, and scrap solutions. These materials would be dissolved
with various acids and other chemicals to produce an impure plutonium nitrate solution. The process would use a heavy
organic solution to extract plutonium from other impurities. 

The plutonium nitrate solutions would be converted to solid plutonium oxide, which is suitable for long-term storage.
The equipment for this conversion process would be remotely operated from a shielded control room. The process would
involve mixing the nitrate feed with oxalic acid to form a plutonium oxalate precipitate. The precipitate would be
filtered out of the liquid and thermally oxidized to plutonium oxide. 



2. Direct Denitration 


This alternative would involve the operation of small scale equipment which could be installed within two to four
existing gloveboxes in the RMC processing area. 

The denitration process would be operated to stabilize materials which can be dissolved in nitric acid to form a nitrate
solution. Materials would first be dissolved to form the impure nitrate solution, then small amounts of solution
would be heated slowly to evaporate the water. The temperature would be increased to form a calcined plutonium oxide
powder 
with other impurities. 


3. Alkaline Precipitation 


As in the case of the direct denitration alternative, this alternative would involve the operation of small scale
equipment which could be installed in two to four existing gloveboxes in the RMC processing area. 

The alkaline precipitation process would use alkaline hydroxides or oxalate compounds to precipitate plutonium
from solution. The precipitate would then be filtered and thermally oxidized to plutonium oxide. 


4. Molten Salt Calcination 


This alternative would involve the operation of small- to medium-scale equipment which could be installed in two
existing gloveboxes plus a new glovebox in the RMC process area or in another suitable area of the PFP. 

The molten salt calcination process would use a gas-agitated pool of molten sodium carbonate to convert plutonium-bearing
materials to plutonium oxide. The process could stabilize many types of materials including solutions (nitrates,
chlorides, organics) and solids such as inorganic solids and combustibles. Some feeds would have to be pretreated
prior to processing via size reduction or dissolution in various solutions. 


No Action Alternative 


Under this alternative, residues would remain in certain process equipment, gloveboxes, process canyon areas and
ductwork. Cleanout of the facility would not take place and the residual material would not be stabilized or stored.
Vault storage would continue as an ongoing action under this alternative; the materials in the vaults would continue
to be inventoried, repackaged, and stabilized as necessary. Interim actions would be completed, along with basic
safety upgrades. Surveillance and maintenance would continue at present required levels. 
DOE does not intend to analyze in detail the potential alternative of cleaning out the PFP but not stabilizing the residual
material (i.e., storing the material without stabilization). Such an alternative would present safety concerns,
would not meet the purpose and need for the proposed action, and is therefore unreasonable. 


Preliminary Identification of Environmental Issues 


The issues listed below have been tentatively identified for analysis in the PFP EIS. This list is presented to facilitate
public comment on the scope of the EIS. It is not intended to be all-inclusive or to predetermine the potential impacts
of any of the alternatives. 
(1) Potential effects on the public and on-site workers from releases of radioactive and other hazardous materials
during operations and from reasonably postulated accidents; 
(2) Potential waste from the proposal, including pollution prevention and waste minimization; 
(3) Potential effects on air and water quality and other environmental consequences of operations and potential
accidents; 
(4) Potential cumulative effects of operations at the Hanford Site, including relevant impacts from other past,
present, and reasonably foreseeable activities at the site; 
(5) Potential effects on endangered species, floodplain/wetlands, and archaeological/historical sites; 
(6) Radiation exposure to workers; 
(7) Potential socioeconomic impacts, including environmental justice issues on surrounding communities; 
(8) Unavoidable adverse environmental effects; 
(9) Short-term uses of the environment versus long-term productivity; and 
(10) Potential irretrievable and irreversible commitments of resources. 


Regulatory Framework 


Federal and State laws that are of major importance to environmental management activities at Hanford include the
Atomic Energy Act of 1954 as amended; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA); the Washington State Hazardous
Waste Management Act, Chapter 70.105 RCW; the Federal Facility Compliance Act of 1992; and the Clean Air Act. The Atomic
Energy Act requires the management, processing and use of radioactive materials in a manner that protects workers,
public health, and the environment. RCRA and the Washington State Hazardous Waste Management Act establish requirements
for management of hazardous and mixed waste, including generation, treatment, storage, and disposal. 
DOE has submitted an air operating permit application to EPA and the permit is expected to be issued in the November
1995 timeframe; the requirements of the existing air quality permits for PFP are expected to encompass all the anticipated
requirements of any new permit.

Great Lakes Gas Transmission Limited Partnership; Proposed Changes in FERC Gas Tariff



October 21, 1994.



Take notice that on September 29, 1994, Great Lakes Gas Transmission Limited Partnership (Great Lakes) tendered
for filing First Revised Sheet No. 4, Original Sheet No. 4A, and Second Revised Sheet No. 6 to its FERC Gas Tariff, Second
Revised Volume No. 1. Great Lakes states these proposed tariff sheets were filed to reflect Great Lakes' compliance
with the Commission's January 26, 1994, orders in Docket Nos. CP92-595-000 and CP92-606-000.

Great Lakes states that the Commission's orders authorized Great Lakes to construct facilities to provide Part 284
blanket transportation service to Rochester Gas and Electronic Company and Sithe/Independence Power Partners,
L.P. Great Lakes explains that the Commission recognized that there would be an additional 12,000 Mcf of capacity
available per day. Great Lakes relates that it conducted an open season which resulted in Mercury Exploration Company
becoming the shipper for that capacity. Great Lakes asserts that the sheets reflect the separately stated incremental
rates set forth in the Commission orders for such services.

Great Lakes requests that the tariff sheets become effective November 1, 1994. Great Lakes relates that construction
was completed earlier than expected, and the facilities authorized in Docket No. CP92-606-000 will be
able to be placed into service on November 1, 1994, rather than the originally estimated date of January 1, 1995. Great
Lakes states that this filing has been served on all of its customers and the Public Service Commissions of the states
of Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan.

Any party desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825
North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Section 385.211 of the Commission's regulations.
All such protests should be filed on or before October 28, 1 994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining
the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Copies of this
filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, PL 92463, EPA gives notice of a two-day meeting of the Ecosystems Information
and Assessments Committee of the National Advisory Council for Environmental Policy and Technology (NACEPT). NACEPT
provides advice and recommendations to the Administrator of EPA on a broad range of environmental policy issues,
and this meeting is being held to discuss the Ecosystems Information and Assessments Committee agenda for the coming
year. The Administrator has asked NACEPT to concentrate on ecosystem management and how long-term ecological, economic,
and social needs can be integrated to achieve a place-driven approach to environmental management.



The Ecosystems Information and Assessments Committee will concentrate on specific information and assessment
issues required to support a successful place-based approach to ecosystem management. These issues will include
discussion of the role of EPA in information access and dissemination to support place-based ecosystems management;
discussion of information technologies available to support place-based ecosystems management; and discussion
of assessments in support of place-based ecosystems management.

The Ecosystems Information and Assessments Committee, as does NACEPT, comprises a representative cross-section
of EPA's partners and constituents. However, in order to gain additional insights and perspectives from all interested
parties as this committee begins its work, time has been allotted during the meeting for oral comments from the public.
Any member of the public wishing to present oral comments on any of these issues can schedule an appointment by contacting
Joe Sierra at the address and telephone numbers below. Due to time constraints, oral presentations will be strictly
held to five minutes, and slots are limited.

Available time slots will be allocated on a first-come, first-served basis to those scheduling a presentation in
advance. Written comments will be accepted at any time prior to, or at, the meeting.

Privacy Act; Proposed Notice of New and/or Revised Systems of Records



Pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, Public Law 93-579, 5 U.S.C. 552(e)(11), the Federal Election
Commission is publishing for comment new and revised systems of records that are maintained by the Commission.

A new systems report was filed with the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, the Chairman of the
House Committee on Government Operations and the Office of Management and Budget on October 21, 1994.

These systems have been revised or proposed as a result of a re-evaluation of the manner in which records are maintained
by the Commission.

The new system of records which has been added is the Inspector General Investigative Files (FEC 12). The authority
under which this system is maintained is 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) and 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2). See 11 CFR part 1.14. All other
systems have been revised to incorporate administrative changes which have taken place since the last publication
of FEC systems of records in 1984 and 1988.

These new and revised systems should provide improved protection for the privacy and property rights of Commission
employees, applicants for employment and those who deal with the Commission.

The Commission is proposing to exempt new records system FEC 12 from certain provisions of the Privacy Act. A Notice
of Proposed Rulemaking for this purpose is found elsewhere in today's 

Federal Register

.

Comments must be received on or before November 28, 1994. Comments must be in writing and addressed to: Tina VanBrakle,
Privacy Act Officer, 999 E Street, NW., Washington, DC 20463.

<USDEPT>FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft, Frankfurt am Main, Federal Republic of Germany; Application to Engage in Nonbanking
Activities</DOCTITLE>


Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft, Frankfurt am Main, Federal Republic of Germany (Applicant), has applied pursuant
to section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8)) (BHC Act) and  225.23(a)(3) of the Board's
Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.23(a)(3)) to engage de novo

 through CB Clearing, Inc., Chicago, Illinois (Company), a futures commission merchant (FCM) registered under the
Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C.  1 

et seq.

), in executing and clearing, clearing without executing, and purchasing and selling through the use of omnibus trading
accounts futures and options on futures on nonfinancial commodities that previously have been approved by the Board.
Applicant also has applied to engage through Company in executing transactions with respect to the following contracts:
Major Market Index options traded on the American Stock Exchange; Standard & Poor's 100 Stock Index options,
Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index options, Long-Term Interest Rate options, Short-Term Interest Rate options,
Long-Term U.S. Treasury Index options, and Short-Term U.S. Treasury Index options traded on the Chicago Board Options
Exchange; and Deutsche Mark options, Swiss Franc options, Australian Dollar options, British Pound options, Canadian
Dollar options, European Currency Unit (ECU) options, French Franc options and Japanese Yen options traded on the
Philadelphia Stock Exchange. Applicant proposes to conduct these activities throughout the world.
Section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act provides that a bank holding company may, with Board approval, engage in any activity
which the Board, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, has determined (by order or regulation) to be so closely
related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. This statutory test requires
that two separate tests be met for an activity to be permissible for a bank holding company. First, the Board must determine
that the activity is, as a general matter, closely related to banking. Second, the Board must find in a particular case
that the performance of the activity by the applicant bank holding company may reasonably be expected to produce public
benefits that outweigh possible adverse effects.
A particular activity may be found to meet the ``closely related to banking'' test if it is demonstrated that banks
generally have provided the proposed activity, that banks generally provide services that are operationally or
functionally similar to the proposed activity so as to equip them particularly well to provide the proposed activity,
or that banks generally provide services that are so integrally related to the proposed activity as to require their
provision in a specialized form. 

National Courier Ass'n v. Board of Governors

, 516 F.2d 1229, 1237 (D.C. Cir. 1975). In addition, the Board may consider any other basis that may demonstrate that
the activity has a reasonable or close relationship to banking or managing or controlling banks. Board Statement
Regarding Regulation Y, 49 FR 806 (1984).
Applicant maintains that the Board previously has determined that the proposed FCM activities are closely related
to banking. 

See

 Bank of Montreal, 79 Federal Reserve Bulletin 1049 (1993); 

J.P. Morgan & Co. Incorporated

, 80 Federal Reserve Bulletin 151 (1994)(

J.P. Morgan

). Applicant states that it would perform the proposed FCM activities in a manner consistent with these previous orders.
Applicant also maintains that the Board previously has determined by regulation and order that the proposed options
execution activities are closely related to banking. 

See Manufacturers Hanover Corporation

, 76 Federal Reserve Bulletin 774 (1990); 12 C.F.R.  225.25 (b)(15). Applicant states that it would perform the proposed
options execution activities in accordance with this order and regulation.
In order to approve this proposal, the Board must determine that the proposed activities ``can reasonably be expected
to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency, that
outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition,
conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices.'' 12 U.S.C.  1843(c)(8). Applicant believes that the proposal
would produce public benefits that outweigh any potential adverse effects. In particular, Applicant maintains
that the proposal will enhance competition and enable Applicant to offer its customers a broader range of services.
In addition, Applicant states that the proposed activities will not result in adverse effects such as an undue concentration
of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, or unsound banking practices. 
In publishing the proposal for comment, the Board does not take a position on issues raised by the proposal. Notice
of the proposal is published solely to seek the views of interested persons on the issues presented by the application
and does not represent a determination by the Board that the proposal meets, or is likely to meet, the standards of the
BHC Act.
Any comments or requests for hearing should be submitted in writing and received by William W. Wiles, Secretary, Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, D.C. 20551, not later than November 21, 1994. Any request
for a hearing on this application must, as required by  262.3(e) of the Board's Rules of Procedure (12 CFR 262.3(e)),
be accompanied by a statement of the reasons why a written presentation would not suffice in lieu of a hearing, identifying
specifically any questions of fact that are in dispute, summarizing the evidence that would be presented at a hearing,
and indicating how the party commenting would be aggrieved by approval of the proposal.
This application may be inspected at the offices of the Board of Governors or the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

<USDEPT>GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Public Buildings Service; Record of Decision; New United States Courthouse-Federal Building in Sacramento, CA</DOCTITLE>



The United States General Services Administration (GSA) announces its decision, in accordance with the National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the Regulations issued by the Council on Environmental Quality, November 29,
1978, to construct a new United States Courthouse-Federal Building (USCT-FB) in Sacramento, California. The site
is bordered by H Street to the North, I Street to the South, 5th Street to the West, and 6th Street to the east. The purpose
of the new USCT-FB is to relieve overcrowded conditions at the existing court facilities in the City of Sacramento
and to provide space for anticipated future growth. The proposed project is anticipated to be ready for occupancy
in 1997-98. The existing courthouse facilities are too small to meet the year 2000 and 2020 space requirements.
Additionally, the existing facilities do not meet guidelines for court facilities set forth in the ``U.S. Courts
Design Guide'' (February 1993). Structural restrictions such as obstructing columns and inadequate ceiling heights
prevent the use of full-size courtrooms in the existing facilities. There is not sufficient space in the current courthouse
to accommodate an increase in the number of courtrooms and the configuration of courtrooms to meet the court design
guidelines. In addition, security in and around the building is inadequate. 



I. Criteria for Evaluating EIS Alternatives



Selection of an alternative site involves the weighing and balancing of many complex, interrelated and often competing
policy factors. An alternative superior to others in one environmental respect may be otherwise inferior in another.
Several factors were of key importance in evaluating each of the alternatives. These are identified below. 

A. The first project criterion is to provide for the expansion of the federal courts in the Sacramento vicinity. Current
facilities housed in the John E. Moss Federal Building-US Courthouse are insufficient. Leasing additional space
to make up for the shortfall at the Moss Building would not be an efficient means of providing court space. Alternative
project sites were therefore examined for their ability to meet existing court needs as well as their suitability
for future expansion. 

B. The second project criterion is to promote local government redevelopment goals, which can often be greatly assisted
by the implementation of large projects such as the high-profile federal building. 

C. The third project criterion is the minimization of adverse environmental effects. 

D. The fourth project criterion is attractive location. Some sites are more attractive due to their proximity to public
amenities, the City's Central Business District, and retail areas. 



II. Alternatives Considered



In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), GSA has considered a range of alternatives to the
preferred alternative that could feasibly attain the basic objectives of the proposed project. In addition to the
preferred alternative, four other alternatives (a reduced intensity alternative, the Lot B alternative, the expansion
alternative and the no action alternative) have been analyzed within the EIS and are representative of a reasonable
range of alternatives. 



A. Preferred Alternative



The preferred alternative site, which is owned by both the Southern Pacific Railroad and the City of Sacramento, encompasses
approximately 2.50 acres. The site is bounded by H Street to the North, I Street to the South, 5th Street to the West and
6th Street to the East, within the City of Sacramento. The block is currently irregular in shape and must be reconfigured
as a standard city block by realigning and extending 5th and H Streets. The site is a full City block, which provides
the space required to meet both current court facility needs and the projected court needs through the year 2020. 

The preferred site is located within the boundaries of the Merged Downtown Redevelopment Project Area, and is also
within the boundaries of the proposed Railyards Specific Plan. This alternative is consistent with redevelopment
plans for the Railyards area and will provide a catalyst for development in the Railyards. The project site promotes
local land use and redevelopment goals. It is located in proximity to existing and light rail transits system and is
near the path of its planned extension. This location will promote use of a transportation means that is environmentally
superior to single occupancy vehicle. By virtue of its proximity of the County Jail and the Hall of Justice, the location
presents the potential for operational efficiencies that are not present at the other alternatives. The proximity
of these buildings to each other would make the transportation of incarcerated individuals both easier and safer.
Additionally, the preferred alternative is located in proximity to the City's new Central Library, located at 8th
and I Streets, Downtown Plaza, a regional shopping center located between 4th and 7th Streets along K Street and Plaza
Park, located at 8th and I Streets. These locational amenities add to the attraction of the preferred alternative
site. 

There are no wetlands on the project site nor is the site within the 100-year floodplain. Sacramento is located within
Seismic Zone 3 on a scale of 1 to 4, with 4 as having the highest risk of seismic events and potential severity. No known
active faults or Alquist-Priolo Special Study Zones occur in or adjacent to the City of Sacramento. An Alquist-Priolo
Zone is a designation given by the State Geologist who assures that homes, offices, public buildings, and other structures
for human occupancy are not built on active faults. The designation requires that a geological investigation be conducted
before a local government can approve a development project located within the special study zone. 



B. The Reduced Intensity Alternative



The reduced intensity alternative is identical to the preferred alternative except that a wing or annex would not
be constructed. The building constructed under this alternative would remain at approximately 380,100 square through
the year 2020. As new courtrooms are needed by the Eastern District, approximately the top seven floors would be converted
from office space to courtroom space as under the preferred alternative. Under the reduced intensity alternative,
however, the federal workers displaced by this conversion would move into lease quarters in the Sacramento area instead
of being accommodated on site. The reduced intensity alternative is found to be infeasible because it does not provide
for long-term growth of the federal courts. The building proposed under the reduced intensity alternative would
not provide adequate space through the year 2020. In addition, as conversion from office to courtroom space takes
place, federal workers would have to move into leased space or additional space would have to be constructed off-site.




C. Lot B Alternative



Under this alternative, a building similar to that described in the ``Preferred Alternative'' section would be constructed
on the City of Sacramento's Lot B, which is bounded by H Street on the north, I Street on the south, 10th Street on the west
and 11th Street on the east. This site, which is owned by the City of Sacramento is currently used for City employee parking.
Land uses surrounding the two story parking structure include residential and motel uses to the north, City Hall office
buildings to the west, a high rise parking structure with ground level commercial structures to the south, restaurant,
commercial and residential structures to the east, and Plaza Park and the Sacramento Central Library to the southwest.
Like the preferred alternative site, the Lot B site is owned by the City and is of adequate size to meet current and future
court needs. It is also located within the City's Central Business District and is in proximity to light rail, the City's
new library and Plaza Park. The site is not, however, located as conveniently close to the County jail as the preferred
alternative site. The Lot B Alternative is, however, infeasible as the State of California has recently selected
this site for the location of a new State office building and the City has agreed to sell the property to the State. The
Lot B site is, therefore, not available for the Courthouse.

D. Expansion Alternative



The John E. Moss Federal Building is a nine-story federal office building located at 650 Capitol Mall in downtown Sacramento.
Under this project alternative, an annex would be constructed against the south wall of the Moss Building. A parking
lot for federal employees now occupies the proposed annex site. The land uses surrounding the site consist of the City's
Lot A parking garage to the north, high density residential uses (apartments and townhouses) to the south, and State
of California offices to the east and the IBM and Wells Fargo towers to the west. Under this alternative, an approximately
250,000 square foot annex to the existing John E. Moss Federal Building-US Courthouse would be constructed against
the south wall of the Moss Building. The proposed annex would occupy the approximately 20,000 square foot parking
area to the south of the Building. It would house a new district courtroom, a new and a relocated magistrate courtroom,
a jury assembly area, lobbies and corridors, elevators and ancillary facilities. The proposed annex would be 13 floors
in height. Parking for 250 cars would be provided in a subterran two-level parking garage beneath the annex. Approximately
28,000 cubic yards of material would have to be excavated in order to accommodate a parking area of this size. Because
this site could not meet the courts projected space needs over the current planning period, other space would eventually
have to be leased or constructed. The expansion alternative is infeasible because it does not provide adequate space
to meet the court's current or projected needs.



E. No Action Alternative



Under the no action alternative, the City of Sacramento would retain possession of the proposed site, and no Federal
building would be constructed there, or any other location. The U.S. Court for the Eastern District of California
would either reduce its space needs in the Sacramento area, or accommodate its future growth by some other means. The
projected increase in the federal presence in the Sacramento area is not contingent upon the construction of a Courthouse/Federal
Building. The rate of growth in all categories of federal employees (including judicial and executive branch agencies)
is projected to be the same, regardless of whether the proposed building is constructed.



III. Mitigation Measures



All practicable means to avoid or minimize impacts to the area are being considered in the development of the project.
GSA received a number of comments and mitigation suggestions from concerned citizens, and interested and responsible
local, state, and Federal agencies.

Significant impacts were identified and mitigation measures were set forth in the EIS. The mitigation measures proposed
in the EIS that can be implemented were adopted by GSA.



A. Air Quality



There are several potential areas of impact to air quality. Construction activities will exceed the SMAQMD NO

x

 and SMAQMD PM10 emission thresholds. This will be significant and unavoidable. The construction management plan
developed for the project will reduce vehicle emission by reducing vehicle idling time and vehicle miles traveled.
Specifically it will:

1. Route construction trips to avoid congested streets. Construction traffic ingress and egress will be controlled
so as to avoid long queues of construction vehicles entering and leaving the site. Vehicles will enter and leave via
the staging area. Appropriate traffic controls will be established on public roadways where project traffic enters
and leaves the site.

2. Electrical power for construction activities will be obtained from power poles instead of electrical generators
(when feasible).

3. Methanol or natural gas will be used for mobile construction equipment instead of diesel (when feasible).

4. Trucks will not idle for more than two minutes.

5. Active portions of the project site will be watered twice daily.

6. Non-toxic soil stabilizers will be applied to graded areas to be inactive for 10 days or more.

7. Excavation and grading will be suspended when the wind speed (as instantaneous gusts) exceeds 25 miles per hour.

8. Trucks carrying earth material off-site will be covered.

9. Paved streets adjacent to the construction site will be swept as needed to remove dust and silt that may have accumulated
as a result of construction activities, and all construction requiring heavy equipment will be curtailed during
second stage smog alerts. 

Mitigation Measures are feasible and required, but the impact is unavoidable. The primary source of construction-related
NO

x

 emissions are gasoline and diesel-powered heavy duty mobile construction equipment. The above mitigation measures
will reduce the short-term significant impact of construction activities by restricting use of mobile construction
equipment such that NO

x

, ROC and CO concentrations from Project construction are minimized. These measures, however, will only partially
reduce the impact. The impact remains significant and unavoidable.

The project's direct and indirect emissions are less than the de minimis thresholds, as defined in Section 176 of the
1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act. Therefore, the subject project is exempt from the final conformity rule and a
conformity determination need to be prepared. The information has been provided to the regional office of the Environmental
Protection Agency.



B. Noise



Implementation of this alternative would expose surrounding land uses to short-term noise levels in excess of City
threshold levels. This impact is considered significant and unavoidable. Site preparation and construction activities
shall comply with the City of Sacramento Noise Ordinance limiting construction activities to the hours between 7
a.m. and 6 p.m., Monday through Friday, and 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. on Saturday as a maximum. All construction equipment fixed
or mobile shall be in proper operating condition and fitted with standard silencing features. Prior to construction
activities, a solid wood construction barrier will be erected around the exterior perimeter of the project sites
to minimize noise intrusion into surrounding residential land uses. An outside construction manager will ensure
that all noise mitigation measures are implemented. In addition, the construction manager will handle any complaints
regarding noise that may arise as a result of construction. The mitigation measure will reduce, but not entirely eliminate,
construction noise impacts resulting from the project. The impact remains significant and unavoidable.



C. Archaeological and Historical



The implementation of the preferred alternative will have an impact on archaeological and historic resources. The
American Railway Express Building is a building which has been determined eligible, by consensus, for inclusion
on the National Register of Historic Places. A portion of the structure which is the loading dock has been removed by
the City after the concurrence of the State Historic Preservation Officer and Advisory Council. This is considered
a significant unavoidable impact. The loading dock structure was recorded through mapping, photography, textual
description, and drawings along with a narrative description and history of the structure.

Mitigation has GSA consulting with the State Historic Preservation Officer to seek ways to avoid or reduce the effect
on historic properties. In addition, GSA will cooperate to the extent feasible, in plans to preserve the historic
structure which would be affected by the proposed project. The mitigation measure is feasible and will reduce impacts
to historical resources through recordation. However, impacts to the physical structure through demolition cannot
be reduced to a less-than-significant level.

Another potential impact is the scale and style of the proposed courthouse may not be compatible with the surrounding
historically significant structures. This is considered a significant unavoidable impact. By using the 

Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitation of Historic Buildings

 as a resource document, the project will employ project design standards which make thorough use of existing historic
context. The project design standards for new construction will consider the existing historic context in determining:
mass, size, scale, materials, texture, setback, and architectural features. The mitigation measure is feasible
and will partially reduce compatibility impacts, but not to a less-than-significant level.

The General Services Administration believes that there are no outstanding issues to be resolved with respect to
the proposed project. For additional information associated with the new U.S. Courthouse-Federal Building may
be directed to Mr. Lou Lopez, Planning Staff (9PL), U.S. General Services Administration, 525 Market Street, San
Francisco, CA 94105, (415) 744-5256.

<DOCTITLE>New Electronic Initiative for Disseminating and Sharing Grant Information</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department is piloting a free, on-line grant information service called GrantsNet, for finding and exchanging
information about HHS and other Federal grant programs.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Department of Health and Human Services has been rapidly improving its information resources and grant activities
to incorporate total quality management and electronic technologies. As part of this process, HHS is piloting an
on-line grant information service that will serve the general public, grantee organizations, and government grant-making
agencies. This new service, GrantsNet, is a free public-access computer network for finding and exchanging information
about HHS and other Federal grant programs. Anyone having a personal computer with internet capability will be able
to access GrantsNet. Conceptually, GrantsNet has two components: (1) An on-line informational reference service
using gopher server technology; and (2) an interactive mailing list service which groups subscribers with common
interests into computer-managed mailing lists for sharing of information and dialogue on certain subjects.



This mission of GrantsNet is to serve as a vehicle and catalyst for continuous improvement and innovation in Federal
grants management practices, policies, and information dissemination. It will provide a medium for the sharing
of ideas, successes, news, lessons learned, and an archival reference library of grant-related legislation, regulations,
and policies. GrantsNet will also provide a yellow-page style directory of granting offices, grants management
staff and grant program personnel.

The major thrust of GrantsNet is to allow members of the public to cut through government red tape_to find the information
they want, when they want it, and whom to directly contact for additional information. As such, it is one of the 11 NETworks
created under the auspices of Vice President Gore's National Performance Review (NPR). The aims of the NETworks are
to provide government-wide information and resources in an on-line, easily accessible, and meaningful manner.



When Will It Be Implemented?



HHS has established a gopher and world wide web (WWW) server to facilitate the GrantsNet mission and vision, assisted
by the Parklawn Computer Center which provides selected communication services. The Department is taking a phased
approach to the implementation of GrantsNet. It is anticipated that GrantsNet will be up and running by the end of October
1994, with fiscal year 1995 serving as the pilot-testing period for populating the gopher information service with
grant resource data pertinent to HHS and further developing the interactive mailing list service. Once success of
the system has been established and tested, HHS intends to expand the scope of GrantsNet to governmentwide.

Development and implementation of GrantsNet are carried out by the GrantsNet Core Team which is managed and directed
by the Office of Grants and Acquisition Management in the Office of the Secretary. The Chair of the GrantsNet Core Team
is Suzanne Neill. Also, as a complement to the Core Team, HHS intends to establish an Advisory Team comprised of individuals
from other Federal agencies. By doing so, interagency collaboration and insights to shaping the development of GrantsNet
will be gained.



For Further Information



To be placed on a mailing list for receiving news and updates on GrantsNet, send your name, organization, mailing address,
internet address, and phone number to: Suzanne M. Neill, Internet: sneill@os.dhhs.gov, OR, Charles Bish, Internet:
cbish@os.dhhs.gov. 

Moreover, HHS recognizes that for GrantsNet to become a practical and user-friendly information service to the Federal
grantee community and to the general public, coordination with interested parties and feedback from users will be
important. To that end, the GrantsNet Core Team is interested in any questions or suggestions you may have. This includes
recommendations for improving GrantsNet services, as well as the identification of additional grants information,
resources, and/or activities that you would like HHS to post. Please address your comments to the GrantsNet Core Team
Chair.

<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

 Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has established an Advisory Committee Information Hotline (the hotline)
using a voice-mail telephone system. The hotline provides the public with access to the most current information
available on FDA advisory committee meetings. The advisory committee hotline, which will disseminate current information
and information updates, can be accessed by dialing a toll free number.

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Advisory Committee Information Hotline can be accessed by dialing 1-800-741-8138 or 301-443-0572.
Each advisory committee is assigned a 5-digit number. This 5-digit number will appear in each individual notice of
meeting. The hotline will enable the public to obtain information about a particular advisory committee by using
the committee's 5-digit number. Information in the hotline is preliminary and may change before a meeting is actually
held. The hotline will be updated when such changes are made. The following is a list of each advisory committee's 5-digit
number to be used when accessing the hotline: 




The hotline will provide the most recent information available on upcoming advisory committee meetings, guidance
for making an oral presentation during the open public hearing portion, and procedures on obtaining copies of transcripts
of advisory committee meetings. Because the hotline will communicate the most current information available about
any particular advisory committee meeting, the establishment of this system will provide interested parties with
timely and equal access to such information. The hotline should also conserve agency resources by reducing the current
volume of inquires individual FDA offices and employees must handle concerning advisory committee schedules and
procedures.

<DOCTITLE>Guideline for Adverse Experience Reporting for Licensed Biological Products; Availability</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing the availability of a guideline entitled ``Guideline for Adverse
Experience Reporting for Licensed Biological Products.'' The purpose of this guideline is to assist manufacturers
of biological products in developing and implementing procedures to report to FDA adverse experiences associated
with biological products. Elsewhere in this issue of the 

Federal Register

, FDA is issuing a final rule amending the biologics regulations to which this guideline applies.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In the 

Federal Register

 of March 29, 1990 (55 FR 11611), FDA issued a proposed rule that would require manufacturers of licensed biological
products to report to FDA certain adverse experiences associated with their products. In the same issue of the 

Federal Register

 (55 FR 11655), FDA published a notice announcing the availability of a draft guideline for reporting adverse experiences
associated with licensed biological products, FDA offered the public 60 days for comment on the proposed rule and
draft guideline.


Elsewhere in this issue of the 

Federal Register

, FDA is issuing a final rule which, upon the effective date, with require manufacturers of licensed biological products
to report to FDA: (1) Within 15 working days all adverse experiences associated with the use of a biological product
that are both serious and unexpected; (2) within 15 working days any significant increase in the frequency of a serious,
but expected, adverse experience and any significant increase in frequency of therapeutic failures; and (3) periodically
all other adverse experiences and product distribution and disposition data. This notice is to announce the availability
of a guideline based on the draft guideline made available in 1990. The guideline offers guidance for meeting the reporting
requirements of 21 CFR 600.80 and 600.81 and for meeting the vaccines adverse experience reporting requirements
in accordance with section 2125 of the Public Health Service Act as amended by the National Childhood Vaccine Injury
Act of 1986.
The guidelines was prepared by the Division of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Office of Establishment Licensing
and Product Surveillance, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, FDA. In developing the guideline, consideration
was given to the comments received on the proposed rule and on the draft guideline.
Changes from the draft guideline are generally editorial in nature or made to conform to amendments made in the final
rule discussed elsewhere in this issue of the 

Federal Register.

 The guideline has also been formatted to be more consistent with the similar guideline, ``Guideline for Postmarketing
Reporting of Adverse Drug Experiences,'' applicable to reporting adverse experiences associated with human drugs.
Elsewhere in this issue of the 

Federal Register,

 FDA is also issuing a proposed rule that would revise and update the reporting requirements for adverse experiences
related to both biological products and human drugs. When FDA issues the final rule based on that proposed rule, FDA
will also issue a notice of availability of revised guidelines relating to biological products and human drugs to
be consistent with the final rule. Comments received in response to the proposed rule will be considered for the next
revision of the guidelines applicable to biological products and human drugs.
Guidelines provide general information to persons dealing with FDA and do not include decisions or advice on particular
situations. A person may follow a guideline or may follow different procedures or practices. When different procedures
or practices are chosen, a person may, but is not required to, discuss the matter in advance with FDA to prevent the expenditure
of money and effort on an activity that may later be determined to be unacceptable.
A guideline represents the position of FDA on a procedure or practice at the time of its issuance. However, a guideline
does not bind the agency, and it does not create or confer any rights, privileges, or benefits for or on any person. FDA
may, at its discretion, recommend or initiate legal or administrative action against a person or product with respect
to an action taken in conformity with a guideline provided that the legal or administrative action is consistent with
applicable statutes and regulations.
Interested persons may submit written comments on the guideline to the Dockets Management Branch (address above).
These comments will be considered in determining whether additional revision of the guideline is appropriate. Two
copies of any comments are to be submitted, except individuals may submit one copy. Comments are to be identified with
the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. The guideline and received comments may be seen
in the Dockets Management Branch, between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing an amendment to the notice of the joint meeting of the Nonprescription
Drugs and the Pulmonary-Allergy Drugs Advisory Committees, which was announced in the 

Federal Register

 of July 7, 1994 (59 FR 34847). The amendment is being made to add an additional topic to the agenda of the open session
and to add a closed session for the Nonprescription Drugs Advisory Committee. There are no other changes. This amendment
will be announced at the beginning of the open portion of the meeting.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In the 

Federal Register

 of July 7, 1994, FDA announced that a joint meeting of the Nonprescription Drugs and the Pulmonary-Allergy Drugs Advisory
Committees would be held on November 14, 1994, to be extended to November 15, 1994, if sufficient interest in participation
was expressed. On page 34847, in column 1, the ``

Type of meeting and contact person

'' portion of the meeting is amended as follows:




Type of meeting and contact person

. Open committee discussion, November 14, 1994, 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.; open public hearing, 4 p.m. to 5 p.m., unless public
participation does not last that long; closed committee deliberations for Nonprescription Drugs Advisory Committee
only, 5 p.m. to 5:30 p.m.; open committee discussion, November 15, 1994, 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.; Lee L. Zwanziger or Leander
B. Madoo, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (HFD-9), Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane,
Rockville, MD 20857, 301-443-4695.
On page 34847, in column 2, the ``

Open committee discussion

'' portion of this meeting is amended as follows:


Open committee discussion

. On November 14, 1994, possibly extended to November 15, 1994, the committees will jointly discuss over-the-counter
(OTC) drug products for the treatment of asthma and will address topics such as: (1) OTC bronchodilator drug products
currently available and possible pending changes in their marketing status; (2) whether there is a population for
which OTC antiasthma drug products are appropriate; (3) the general question of whether antiasthma drug products
should be available OTC; (4) antiasthma drug products currently available by prescription only that could be considered
for OTC status; and (5) data requirements necessary to support conversion of prescription antiasthma drug products
to OTC status. Public comments are available for inspection in docket no. 94N-0232 at the Dockets Management
Branch (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1-23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857. If
the meeting is extended to November 15, 1994, the committees will hear a report by FDA personnel of a meta-analysis
of data on the use of antihistamines in the common cold. 
After the ``

open committee discussion

'' portion, a ``

closed committee deliberations

'' portion is added as follows:


Closed committee deliberations

. The Nonprescription Drugs Advisory Committee will discuss trade secret and/or confidential commercial information
relevant to pending investigational new drug applications. This portion of the meeting will be closed to permit discussion
of this information (5 U.S.C. 552b(c)(4)).
Each public advisory committee meeting listed above may have as many as four separable portions: (1) An open public
hearing, (2) an open committee discussion, (3) a closed presentation of data, and (4) a closed committee deliberation.
Every advisory committee meeting shall have an open public hearing portion. Whether or not it also includes any of
the other three portions will depend upon the specific meeting involved. The dates and times reserved for the separate
portions of each committee meeting are listed above. 
The open public hearing portion of each meeting shall be at least 1 hour long unless public participation does not last
that long. It is emphasized, however, that the 1 hour time limit for an open public hearing represents a minimum rather
than a maximum time for public participation, and an open public hearing may last for whatever longer period the committee
chairperson determines will facilitate the committee's work.
Public hearings are subject to FDA's guideline (subpart C of 21 CFR part 10) concerning the policy and procedures for
electronic media coverage of FDA's public administrative proceedings, including hearings before public advisory
committees under 21 CFR part 14. Under 21 CFR 10.205, representatives of the electronic media may be permitted, subject
to certain limitations, to videotape, film, or otherwise record FDA's public administrative proceedings, including
presentations by participants.
Meetings of advisory committees shall be conducted, insofar as is practical, in accordance with the agenda published
in this 

Federal Register

 notice. Changes in the agenda will be announced at the beginning of the open portion of a meeting.
Any interested person who wishes to be assured of the right to make an oral presentation at the open public hearing portion
of a meeting shall inform the contact person listed above, either orally or in writing, prior to the meeting. Any person
attending the hearing who does not in advance of the meeting request an opportunity to speak will be allowed to make
an oral presentation at the hearing's conclusion, if time permits, at the chairperson's discretion.
The agenda, the questions to be addressed by the committee, and a current list of committee members will be available
at the meeting location on the day of the meeting.
Transcripts of the open portion of the meeting may be requested in writing from the Freedom of Information Office (HFI-35),
Food and Drug Administration, rm. 12A-16, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, approximately 15 working
days after the meeting, at a cost of 10 cents per page. The transcript may be viewed at the Dockets Management Branch
(HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1-23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, approximately
15 working days after the meeting, between the hours of 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Summary minutes of
the open portion of the meeting may be requested in writing from the Freedom of Information Office (address above)
beginning approximately 90 days after the meeting. 
The Commissioner has determined for the reasons stated that those portions of the advisory committee meetings so
designated in this notice shall be closed. The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) (5 U.S.C. app. 2, 10(d)), permits
such closed advisory committee meetings in certain circumstances. Those portions of a meeting designated as closed,
however, shall be closed for the shortest possible time, consistent with the intent of the cited statutes.
The FACA, as amended, provides that a portion of a meeting may be closed where the matter for discussion involves a trade
secret; commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential; information of a personal nature,
disclosure of which would be a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; investigatory files compiled for
law enforcement purposes; information the premature disclosure of which would be likely to significantly frustrate
implementation of a proposed agency action; and information in certain other instances not generally relevant to
FDA matters.
Examples of portions of FDA advisory committee meetings that ordinarily may be closed, where necessary and in accordance
with FACA criteria, include the review, discussion, and evaluation of drafts of regulations or guidelines or similar
preexisting internal agency documents, but only if their premature disclosure is likely to significantly frustrate
implementation of proposed agency action; review of trade secrets and confidential commercial or financial information
submitted to the agency; consideration of matters involving investigatory files compiled for law enforcement purposes;
and review of matters, such as personnel records or individual patient records, where disclosure would constitute
a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.
Examples of portions of FDA advisory committee meetings that ordinarily shall not be closed include the review, discussion,
and evaluation of general preclinical and clinical test protocols and procedures for a class of drugs or devices;
consideration of labeling requirements for a class of marketed drugs or devices; review of data and information on
specific investigational or marketed drugs and devices that have previously been made public; presentation of any
other data or information that is not exempt from public disclosure pursuant to the FACA, as amended; and, deliberation
to formulate advice and recommendations to the agency on matters that do not independently justify closing.
This notice is issued under section 10(a)(1) and (2) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. app. 2), and FDA's
regulations (21 CFR part 14) on advisory committees.

<DOCTITLE>Program Announcement, Proposed Project Requirements and Review Criteria for Cooperative Agreements for the National
AIDS Education and Training Centers Program for FY 1995 </DOCTITLE>


The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) announces that applications will be accepted for fiscal
year 1995 for Cooperative Agreements for the National AIDS Education and Training Centers (AETCs) Program (formerly
the AIDS Regional Education and Training Centers (AETCs)) Program, authorized under section 776(a), title VII of
the Public Service (PHS) Act, as amended by the Health Professions Education Extension Amendments of 1992, Pub. L.
102-408, dated October 13, 1992. These centers will constitute a national network which will conduct targeted,
multidisciplinary education and training programs for health care providers within designated geographic areas,
with the principal focus on areas heavily impacted by the HIV epidemic. Comments are invited on the proposed project
requirements and review criteria stated below. 


Eligibility and Purpose 


The Secretary may make awards and enter into contracts to assist public and nonprofit private entities and schools
and academic health science centers in meeting the costs of projects (1) To train the faculty of schools of, and graduate
departments or programs of, medicine, nursing, osteopathic medicine, dentistry, public health, allied health,
and mental health practice to teach health professions students to provide for the health care needs of individuals
with HIV disease; 
 (2) To train practitioners to provide for the health care needs of such individuals; 
 (3) With respect to improving clinical skills in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of such disease, to educate
and train the health professionals and clinical staff of schools of medicine, osteopathic medicine, and dentistry;
and 
 (4) To develop and disseminate curricula and resource materials relating to the care and treatment of individuals
with such disease and the prevention of the disease among individuals who are at risk of contracting the disease. 

Specifically for the National AETC Program, these awards will be made as above and will include community based organizations
(CBOs) and community health clinics affiliated with accredited public and nonprofit private entities_
 1. To train health personnel, focusing on practitioners in Title XXVI programs (Ryan White CARE Act), in the diagnosis,
treatment, and prevention of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection and disease; and to provide supplementary
and/or complementary training to the faculty of schools of, and graduate departments or programs of medicine, nursing,
dentistry, public health, mental health practice and allied health personnel; 
2. To train and motivate the above practitioners and other community providers to care for the health needs of individuals
with HIV disease; 

3. To teach health professions students and residents to provide for the health care needs of individuals with HIV
disease; and 

4. To develop and disseminate to health providers curricula and resource materials relating to the care and treatment
of individuals with HIV disease and the prevention of HIV among individuals who are at risk of contracting the disease;
and to organize plans for information dissemination of HIV-related information. 


Strategic Directions for the National AETC Program for FY 1995 


In 1987, the National AETC Program was initially designed to provide information on the prevalence of AIDS and identification
of groups at increased risk of HIV infection. In the second project period which began in 1991, emphasis was placed
on providing training of health care professionals in the prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment of HIV infection.
Currently, HRSA funds 17 AETCs. As of June 1994, over 400,000 health professionals had received training. 

In FY 1995, the National AETC Program will focus the majority of resources on those Eligible Metropolitan Areas (EMAs)
with the highest prevalence of HIV/AIDS; however, consideration will be given to AETCs in rural areas. The AETCs will
be required to spend the majority of their funds on information dissemination and the training (especially clinical
training) of primary care health professionals, including physicians, registered nurses, dentists, physician
assistants, nurses with advanced training (e.g., nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists and nurse midwives)
and dental hygienists. Additionally, the AETCs will focus on mental health providers and allied health personnel.
Emphasis will be placed on training in Ryan White CARE ACT programs and health professional schools and academic health
centers. 


Funding 


Approximately $16,287,000 will be available in FY 1995 for this program. It is anticipated that approximately 10
to 15 new awards will be made ranging from $500,000 to $2,500,000.

Period of Support 


 

The period of support should not exceed 3 years from June 1, 1995 through May 31, 1998, and is subject to annual approval
by the Secretary and the availability of appropriations for the fiscal year involved. Funding of the awards may be
available in the future for no more than 2 additional years, for a total funding period of 5 years. 


 Interested applicants are strongly encouraged, but are not required, to send a letter of intent postmarked no later
than November 28, 1994 to: 
 Juanita Koziol, RN, MS, CS, 
 Health Professions HIV Education Branch, 
 National AIDS Education and Training Centers Program, 
 Bureau of Health Professions, 
 Health Resources and Services Administration, 
 Parklawn Building, Room 9A-39, 
 5600 Fishers Lane, 
 Rockville, Maryland 20857. 
 Telephone: (301) 443-6364, 
 FAX: (301) 443-8890. 



Statutory Funding Preferences 


 

In making awards, preference will be given to qualified projects which will_
 

 (1) Train, or result in the training of, health professionals who will provide treatment for minority individuals
with HIV disease and other individuals who are at high risk of contracting such disease; and 
 

 (2) Train, or result in the training of, minority health professionals and minority allied health professionals
to provide treatment for individuals with such disease. 



Proposed Project Requirements 


 

The focus in FY 1995 will be on primary care providers in high HIV/AIDS prevalence areas, with an emphasis on living
persons infected with HIV. However, consideration will be given to rural areas. The project requirements are designed
to direct Federal resources where the greatest needs exist. To accomplish this, each project must define a geographic
region and identify the types of providers to be targeted for training within that region. 



A. Definition of AETCs 


 

All applicants are encouraged to form AETCs composed of as many states/territories/commonwealths as can be managed
completely and efficiently. There are four options for defining an AETC region. An applicant may propose, with appropriate
documentation: 


 1. An AETC composed only of a single state/territory/ commonwealth as a region if that region contains two or more Ryan
White CARE Act Title I Eligible Metropolitan Areas (EMAs) or if the AETC currently is established as a single state
AETC; 


 2. An AETC composed of multiple, contiguous states (Hawaii and Alaska may be included) if it justifies its boundaries
with the inclusion of one EMA and specific local epidemiological data equivalent to at least 10,000 living HIV-infected
persons (with a prevalence of at least 2,500 living AIDS cases and 7,500 other HIV infected persons). Supporting documentation
may include rates of HIV/AIDS infection, or proxy indicators such as STD, TB, and substance abuse, CDC heel stick study
data, teenage pregnancy etc.; 


 3. An AETC for rural regions if it encompasses at least three states with contiguous boundaries (Hawaii and Alaska
may be included) and contains at least one EMA, although the prevalence of living HIV infected persons totals less
than 10,000; or

<TEXT>
 

4. An AETC specifically in the District of Columbia that either stands alone or is incorporated in a consortium arrangement
with another AETC. 

At least 50 percent of project funds must be expended for training activities in high AIDS prevalence areas, i.e.:
as defined as EMAs in the Ryan White CARE ACT, Title I. If this is not done, appropriate justification from regional
epidemiological data and the needs assessment must be provided. 



B. Performance Expectations 



Each AETC must provide or perform the following. These items are essential for consideration for this cooperative
agreement. 

1. Submission of a coordinated plan, including a clear statement of resources available from the region's EMA(s),
for the network that has been created for dissemination of state-of-the-art information to health professions schools
and organizations, HIV care providers and CBOs, including organizations of people living with AIDS (PLWA) in the
AETC's proposed region; the methodology (e.g., electronic bulletin boards, print material and teleconferencing,
etc.) should be described as well as the types of education materials to be distributed in concert with other PHS agencies
and health professions' schools and organizations. 

2. A comprehensive clinical training plan, of which a minimum of 50 percent of the Federal funds devoted to training
is directed toward primary care providers, i.e., physicians, registered nurses, dentists, physician assistants,
nurses with advanced training (e.g., nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists and nurse midwives) and dental
hygienists. 

3. A training plan for other health professionals including, but not limited to, mental health care providers, case
managers, substance abuse counselors and other allied health personnel; 

4. Linkages to other organizations in the following priority order: (a) Ryan White CARE ACT, Titles I, II, including
Special Programs of National Significance (SPNS), IIIb and IVd funded health services programs, and the Hemophilia
Programs; (b) health professions schools, academic centers, and national health professions organizations, including
minority professional groups; (c) Federally supported substance abuse programs (e.g.: NIDA & SAMHSA) and community
substance abuse programs; (d) PHS funded Area Health Education Centers (AHECs), migrant centers (e.g., sec. 329(a)(1),
community health centers (e.g., sec. 330(a), and homeless centers (e.g., sec. 340), mental health providers (e.g.:
SAMHSA grantees), Federally supported STD and prevention activities (e.g.: CDC, etc.), providers in prisons, family
planning programs and HRSA supported maternal and child health programs, State and local health agencies and health
care facilities involved in providing care for HIV infected individuals in order to fill any gaps in training; (e)
other community based HIV-related organizations (including those formed by PLWA); AETC projects also are encouraged
to collaborate with (f) national networks of AIDS clinical trials such as the adult and pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials
Group (ACTG), the Community Programs for Clinical Research on AIDS (CPCRA), AMFAR and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.


5. An updated needs-assessment of the education and training needs of the primary care providers within the proposed
service area and which is based upon epidemiological data for that service area. 

6. A plan for outreach to minorities, including involvement of minority providers, providers who serve minority
populations, minority professional organizations, and minority health care delivery systems; 

7. A plan for program assessment and data collection on program and trainees which can be used for regional and national
evaluative purposes; and 

8. Plan for non-Federal funding during the 3-year project period. 



Proposed Review Criteria 



The following review criteria are proposed for FY 1995: 

Applications will be reviewed and rated according to the applicant's ability to meet the following: 

1. The completeness and pertinence of the needs assessment to the proposed region and the degree of linkage between

III described in the program guidelines; 

2. The degree of emphasis on linkages with Ryan White CARE ACT programs I, II (including Special Programs of National
Significance (SPNS)), IIIb and IVd, health professions schools and academic health centers, and other collaborations
as described under Proposed Project Requirements above; 

3. The extent to which the training plans meet the national priorities (prevention, substance abuse, cultural competence,
tuberculosis, providers in prisons, implementation of the PHS recommendations of protocol, AIDS Clinical Trials
Group (ACTG 076), and psychosocial issues) of the National AETC Program; 

4. The completeness and appropriateness of the plan for information dissemination among key HIV contacts as defined
under Proposed Project Requirements above; 

5. The completeness and appropriateness of the training plans for National AETC Program Levels I, II and III; 

6. The organization of the AETC; the administration and management of the AETC and its relationship to its component
parts, i.e.: Consortia members and/or subcontractors; 

7. The appropriateness of the size and configuration of the AETC; the appropriateness and cost-effectiveness of

<DOCTITLE>National Institutes of Health; Privacy Act of 1974; New System of Records</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Public Health Service, DHHS.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notification of a new system of records.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In accordance with the requirements of the Privacy Act, the Public Health Service (PHS) is publishing a notice of a
new system of records, 09-25-0169, ``Medical Staff Credentials Files, HHS/NIH/CC.'' We are also proposing
routine uses for this new system.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) proposes to establish a new system of records: 09-25-0169, ``Medical
Staff Credentials Files, HHS/NIH/CC.'' This system of records will be used by NIH staff to: (1) Maintain information
used in the credentialing and privileging of active medical staff members at the Warren G. Magnuson Clinical Center;
(2) document patient care privileges for active members of the medical staff; (3) provide information about active
and non-active members of the medical staff to authorized individuals; and (4) report to the National Practitioner
Data Bank as required by the provisions of Title IV of Public Law 99-660, as amended.




The system will comprise records that contain medical staff names, date of birth, home address and telephone number,
office address and telephone number, citizenship, visa information, appointment date, hospital-wide computer
access privileges, Institute/Center/Division designation, branch/lab, type of medical staff membership, privilege
delineation, professional degree(s) including school of attendance and graduation dates, foreign medical examinations,
specialty board certifications, licensing information (including state of licensure and license number), record
or disciplinary actions, documentation of training, and admitting privileges.

The amount of information recorded on each individual will be only that which is necessary to accomplish the purposes
of the system. Records are established from forms and documentation submitted by individual medical staff members
to the Medical Record Department.

The records in this system will be maintained in a secure manner compatible with their content and use. NIH and Contractor
staff will be required to adhere to the provisions of the Privacy Act and the HHS Privacy Act regulations. The System
Manager will control access to the data. Only authorized users whose official duties require the use of such information
will have regular access to the records in this system. Authorized users are HHS employees and Contractor staff responsible
for implementing the medical staff credentials data system.

Records will be stored on paper forms in file folders and on computer disk. Manual and computerized records will be
maintained in accordance with the standards of Chapter 45-13 of the HHS General Administration Manual, ``Safeguarding
Records Contained in Systems of Records,'' supplementary Chapter PHS hf: 45-13, the Department's Automated
Information System Security Program Handbook, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology Federal Information
Processing Standards (FIPS Pub. 41 and FIPS Pub. 31).

Data stored in computers is accessed through a network system by use of a password known only to authorized users. Rooms
where records are stored are locked when not in use. During regular business hours, rooms are unlocked by entry is controlled
by on-site personnel.

The routine uses proposed for this system are compatible with the stated purposes of the system. The first routine
use permitting disclosure to a congressional office is proposed to allow subject individuals to obtain assistance
from their representatives in Congress, should they so desire. Such disclosure would be made only pursuant to a request
of the individual. The second routine use of this system allows disclosure to the Department of Justice to defend the
Federal Government, the Department, or employees of the Department in the event of litigation. The third routine
use allows referral to the appropriate agency in the event that a system of records maintained by this agency to carry
out its functions indicates a violation or potential violation of law. The fourth routine use allows disclosure of
records to contractors for the purpose of processing or refining records in the system. The fifth routine use permits
disclosure to representatives of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations for the purpose
of conducting quality assurance reviews and inspections of the Warren G. Magnuson Clinical Center credentialing
policies and procedures. The sixth routine use permits disclosure to State medical boards for purposes of professional
quality assurance activities. The seventh routine use allows disclosure to health care facilities for the purpose
of verifying that an individual to whom they intend to grant medical staff or patient care privileges has or previously
held such privileges at the Warren G. Magnuson Clincial Center.

Safeguards:



1. 

Authorized users:

 Data on the computer network system is accessed by a password known only to authorized users who are NIH employees and
Contractor staff responsible for implementing the medical staff credentials data system. Access to information
is thus limited to those with a need to know.

2. 

Physical safeguards:

 Rooms where records are stored are locked when not in use. During regular business hours rooms are unlocked but entry
is controlled by on-site personnel.

3. 

Procedural and technical safeguards:

 Access to files is strictly controlled by the system manager. Names and other identifying particulars are deleted
when data from original records are encoded for analysis. Data stored in computers is accessed through a network system
by use of a password known only to authorized users. All authorized users of personal information in connection with
the performance of their jobs (see Authorized Users, above) protect information from public view and from unauthorized
personnel entering an unsupervised office. These practices are in compliance with the standards of Chapter 45-13
of the HHS General Administration Manual, ``Safeguarding Records Contained in Systems of Records,'' supplementary
Chapter PHS hf: 45-13, and the Department's Automated Information System Security Program Handbook, and the

Pub. 31).



Retention and disposal:



Records are retained and disposed of under the authority of the NIH Records Control Schedule contained in NIH Manual
Chapter 1743, Appendix 1_``Keeping and Destroying Records'' (HHS Records Management Manual, Appendix B-361),
item 2300-293-4, ``Medical Staffs' Credential Files,'' which allows inactive records to be transferred
to the Federal Records Center at five year intervals and to be destroyed after thirty years. Refer to the NIH Manual
Chapter for specific disposition instructions.



System manager and address:



Chief, Medical Record Department, Warren G. Magnuson Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Building
10, Room 1N208, 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.



Notification procedures:



To determine if a record exists, write to the System Manager at the above address. The requester must provide tangible
proof of identity (e.g., driver's license). If no identification papers are available, the requester must verify
his or her identity by providing either a notarization of the request or a written certification that the requester
is who he or she claims to be and understands that the knowing and willful request for acquisition of a record pertaining
to an individual under false pretenses is a criminal offense under the Act, subject to a five thousand dollar fine.



Record access procedures:



Write to the System Manager specified above to attain access to records and provide the same information as that required
under the Notification Procedures. Requesters should also reasonably specify the record contents being requested.
Individuals may also request an accounting of disclosure of their records, if any.



Contesting record procedures:



Contact the System Manager specified above and reasonably identify the record, specify the information to be contested,
the corrective action sought, and your reasons for requesting the correction, along with supporting information

<DOCTITLE>Privacy Act of 1974; Report of New Systems of Records</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Social Security Administration (SSA), HHS.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notification of new systems of records and new routine uses. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4)), we are notifying the public of our intent to establish
two new systems of records. The proposed systems are entitled ``SSA-Initiated Personal Earnings and Benefit Estimate
Statement (SIPEBES) History File, HHS/SSA/OSR, 09-60-0224'' and ``SSA-Initiated Personal Earnings
and Benefit Estimate Statement Address System for Certain Territories, HHS/SSA/OSR, 09-60-0225.''
For convenience we will refer to these systems as the ``History File'' and the ``Territory Address System,'' respectively.




We are also proposing to establish routine uses of the information to be maintained in the two systems. The proposed
routine uses are discussed below.

We invite public comment on this publication.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Description of the Proposed Systems of Records



Section 1143(c) of the Social Security Act requires SSA to phase in a program, beginning not later than October 1, 1999,
for mailing a PEBES annually to everyone:

(a) Who has reached at least age 25,

(b) Who has had some earnings reported to his/her Social Security number (SSN),

(c) Who is not receiving benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act, and

(d) For whom SSA can determine a mailing address.

The phasing in requires SSA to furnish PEBES by not later than September 30, 1995, to everyone who has reached age 60
by October 1, 1994, who is currently not receiving title II benefits, for whom some earnings have been reported, and
for whom a current mailing address can be established; and from October 1, 1994, to September 30, 1999, to everyone
who attains age 60 during that period and who meets the other criteria for receiving the PEBES. The PEBES will be sent
in the fiscal year (October 1 through September 30) in which the individual attains age 60.

The two systems together will enable SSA to mail Personal Earnings and Benefit Estimate Statements (PEBES) to certain
individuals, pursuant to section 1143 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1320b-13).

SSA has previously maintained current address information only for those persons currently entitled to monthly
Social Security benefits. Therefore, SSA must obtain address information for everyone to whom SSA will be required
to mail a PEBES.

As discussed below, SSA will use different sources for obtaining the address information that will be maintained
in the systems.

A. 

History File. 

For persons living within a State of the United States or the District of Columbia, SSA will use address information
obtained from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), reflecting addresses taken from Federal income tax returns. SSA
will maintain this address information obtained from IRS in the History File.

After the PEBES have been released in a given mailing cycle, SSA will inevitably receive inquiries from some individuals
about their PEBES, or alleging that they did not receive a PEBES. The History File will enable SSA to verify whether
a PEBES was released to that person, when, to what address, and what address source was used. The History File will also
permit statistical studies involving the PEBES system.

B. 

Territory Address System. 

For persons living in Puerto Rico or in a territory of the United States who are not required to file Federal income tax
returns, SSA must obtain their addresses from sources other than the IRS. SSA will obtain this information from the
Commonwealth and Territorial governments. SSA must maintain these data until needed for a PEBES mailing. We therefore
are establishing the Territory Address System of records for that purpose. After an address is identified from the
Territory Address System and a PEBES is mailed, the address information will be maintained in the History File.



II. Collection and Maintenance of Data in the Systems



Information for the History File (each individual's address information, other personal information, and information
about the PEBES mailing) will be obtained from IRS and from sources within SSA, respectively.

Information for the Territory Address System will be obtained primarily from the Commonwealth and Territorial governments,
possibly supplemented from other sources.



III. Proposed Routine Use Disclosures of Data in the Systems



We are proposing to establish the following routine use disclosures of the information that will be maintained in
the two systems. The routine use disclosures are identical for both systems except as noted. Information may be disclosed
as follows:

1. 

Information may be disclosed to contractors and other Federal agencies, as necessary, to assist SSA in the efficient
administration of its programs. We contemplate disclosing information under this routine use only in situations
in which SSA may enter a contractual or similar agreement with a third party to assist in accomplishing an agency function
relating to this system of records.

Wage and other information which is subject to the disclosure provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC, 26 U.S.C.
6103) will not be disclosed under this routine use unless disclosure is expressly permitted by the IRC.

Contractors will safeguard information disclosed to them consistent with the requirements of the Privacy Act.

<PARENT> FR941027-2-00044 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

We contemplate disclosing information under this routine use only when SSA enters into a contractual or similar agreement
with a third party to help SSA maintain the proposed systems or to carry out the PEBES mailing program.
In administering our program, we often find that it is more efficient to use an outside contractor to carry out some
of our functions. This proposed routine use would allow us to disclose information from the system under these circumstances.
2. Information may be disclosed to a congressional office in response to an inquiry from the congressional office
made at the request of the subject of the record.
Wage and other information which is subject to the disclosure provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC, 26 6103)
will not be disclosed under this routine use unless disclosure is expressly permitted by the IRC.
We contemplate disclosing information under this routine use only in situations in which the individual asks his/her
Member of Congress to intercede in an SSA matter on his/her behalf. Information will be disclosed from the proposed
systems only when the Member of Congress inquires and presents evidence that he/she is acting on behalf of the individual
whose record is requested.
3. Information may be disclosed to the Department of Justice (DOJ), a court, or other tribunal, or another party before
such tribunal, when:
(1) SSA, or any component thereof; or
(2) any SSA employee in his/her official capacity; or
(3) any SSA employee in his/her individual capacity when DOJ (or SSA, when it is authorized to do so) has agreed to represent
the employee; or
(4) the United States or any agency thereof when SSA determines that the litigation is likely to affect the operations
of SSA or any of its components, Is a party to litigation or has an interest in such litigation, and SSA determines that
the use of such records by DOJ, the court or other tribunal, or other party before the tribunal is relevant and necessary
to the litigation, provided, however, that in each case SSA determines that such disclosure is compatible with the
purposes for which the records were collected.
Wage and other information which is subject to the disclosure provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC, 26 U.S.C.
6103) will not be disclosed under this routine use unless disclosure is expressly permitted by the IRC.
This proposed routine use would permit us to disclose information from the proposed systems when an SSA component
and/or employee is involved in litigation involving information in the proposed system. The routine use would also
permit disclosure when SSA brings suit or when another party bring suit and SSA has an interest in the litigation.
4. Information may be disclosed to the Office of the President for responding to an individual pursuant to an inquiry
received from that individual or from a third party on his or her behalf.
Wage and other information which is subject to the disclosure provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC, 26 U.S.C.
6103) will not be disclosed under this routine use unless disclosure is expressly permitted by the IRC.
We contemplate disclosing information under this routine use in situations in which that individual or someone else
on the individual's behalf asks the President to intercede in an SSA matter pertaining to the individual. Information
may be disclosed from the proposed systems when the Office of the President inquires and presents evidence that it
is acting on behalf of the individual whose record is requested.
5. Nontax return information, the disclosure of which is not expressly restricted by Federal law, may be disclosed
to the General Services Administration and the National Archives and Records Administration under 44 U.S.C. 2904
and 2906, as amended by the National Archives and Records Administration Act of 1984, for the use of those agencies
in conducting records management studies.
Wage and other information which is subject to the disclosure provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC, 26 U.S.C.
6103) will not be disclosed under this routine use unless disclosure is expressly permitted by the IRC.
The Administrator of the General Services Administration (GSA) and the Archivist of the National Archives and Records
Administration (NARA) are charged by 44 U.S.C. 2904 with promulgating safeguards, procedures, and guidelines regarding
records management and conducting records management studies. Section 2906 of that law, also amended by the NARA
Act of 1984, provides that GSA and NARA are to have access to Federal agencies' records and that agencies are to cooperate
with GSA and NARA. In carrying out these responsibilities, it may be necessary for GSA and NARA to have access to these
two proposed systems of records. In such instances, the routine use will facilitate disclosure.
6. Information may be disclosed to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for auditing SSA's compliance with the safeguard
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
This routine use applied only to the History File which maintains some information obtained from the IRS. As necessary,
the routine use will allow disclosure to IRS to ensure that SSA is in compliance with safeguard standards.


IV. Compatibility of the Proposed Routine Uses


Both the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a(a)(7) and (b)(3)) and our disclosure regulations (20 CFR part 401) permit
us to disclose information under a routine use for a purpose which is compatible with the purposes for which we collected
the information. Paragraph 401.310(c) of the regulations permits us to disclose information under a routine use
to administer our programs. Section 401.205 of the regulations requires us to disclose information when a law specifically
requires the disclosure.
The proposed routine uses numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, described above, will facilitate SSA's administration of its
programs. Routine use number 5 will allow GSA or NARA to inspect our records, as required by 44 U.S.C. 2904 and 2906,
when those agencies conduct records management studies. Thus, all the routine uses are appropriate and meet the criteria
in the Privacy Act and SSA's regulations.


V. Safeguards


We will employ a number of security measures to minimize the risk of unauthorized access to or disclosure of personal
data in the two proposed systems. These measures include the use of passwords and access codes to enter the computer
system which will maintain the data, and storage of the computerized records in secured areas which are accessible
only to employees who require the information in performing their official duties. SSA employees who have access
to the data will be informed of the criminal penalties of the Privacy Act for unauthorized access to or disclosure of
information maintained in the system.
In addition, any contract which SSA may sign with a third party in order to carry out the required mailings will stipulate
that (a) the contractor must establish safeguards to protect the personal information temporarily in its custody,
in accordance with Privacy Act requirements; (b) the contractor may use the information only as necessary in fulfilling
the contract; and (c) the contractor is subject to criminal penalties for violations of the Privacy Act.

VI. Effect of the Proposed Systems of Records on Individual Rights 



As discussed above, the proposed systems of records will enable SSA to mail PEBES. Recipients will benefit from the
PEBES because these statements will help them plan their finances and check the accuracy of SSA's records. The routine
uses will benefit individuals by helping SSA run its programs smoothly. 

SSA will adhere to all provisions of the Privacy Act, Social Security Act, and other applicable laws in our maintenance
and use of the information. Thus, we do not anticipate that the system will have any adverse effect on individuals'
rights.

ACTION:

 Supplemental Notice for GNMA Multiclass Securities Program; Announcement of OMB control number.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On September 30, 1994 (59 FR 50148), the Department published in the 

Federal Register

, a Supplemental Notice for GNMA Multiclass Securities Program, in which it referred to a Notice published in the 

Federal Register

 on May 26, 1994 (59 FR 27290), which implemented a new program under which GNMA would guarantee multiclass mortgage-backed
securities. The May 26, 1994 Notice provided for implementation in two stages, the initial stage and the full participation
stage. The program is intended to benefit borrowers using federally insured or guaranteed mortgages by increasing
investment demand for GNMA guaranteed mortgage-backed securities (``MBS'') that are backed by these mortgages,
thus reducing financing costs for these mortgages; and raise revenues through the receipt of guarantee and other
fees by GNMA. 


The September 30, 1994 Notice and a Notice of Proposed Information Collection Requirements to OMB, published on September
28, 1994 (59 FR 49410), identified that this program under which GNMA would guarantee multiclass mortgage-backed
securities, contained information collection requirements, but that no person would be subjected to a penalty for
failure to comply with these information collection requirements until they had been approved and assigned an OMB
control number. 
The purpose of this document is to announce the OMB control number for the GNMA Multiclass Securities Program.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Accordingly, the OMB control number for the Government National Mortgage Association; Multiclass Securities Program;
Notice of Proposed Information Collection Requirements to OMB Notice published September 28, 1994 (59 FR 49410),
and for the Supplemental Notice for the Government National Mortgage Association Guaranteed Multiclass Securities,
published September 30, 1994 (59 FR 50148), is 2503-0030.

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>






Baltimore Gas and Electric Company; Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an exemption from certain requirements
of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix A, General Criterion 2, ``Design Bases For Protection Against Natural Phenomena,'' to
Baltimore Gas and Electric Company (the licensee), for the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, located
at the licensee's site in Calvert County, Maryland.



Environmental Assessment



Identification of Proposed Action



The proposed exemption would allow relief from General Design Criterion 2 (GDC-2) during the upgrading of the
Unit 2 emergency diesel generator (EDG) No. 21. The proposed exemption will permit the temporary removal of a steel
missile door which provides missile protection for the No. 21 EDG, which will be out-of-service to allow for modifications
which will increase its load capacity, and also provides missile protection to portions of the support systems for
EDGs Nos. 11 and 12. EDGs Nos. 11 and 12 are required to be operable to support the operation of Unit 1 (Modes 1, 2, or 3).
In addition, EDG No. 12 is a swing EDG and is required to be operable for Unit 2 when the unit is shutdown or in refueling
(Mode 5 or 6).

The upgrading of the Unit 2 EDG will be performed during the upcoming Unit 2 refueling outage (RFO-10). RFO-10
is scheduled to commence on March 17, 1995, and be completed in late May 1995. The steel missile door will be required
to be removed about four times during the outage. The licensee estimates that each of the removals will last for about
24 hours, which will result in a total removal time of about 100 hours during the scheduled 65 day RFO-10.



Need for the Proposed Action



The proposed temporary exemption is needed to permit the completion of highly desirable upgrade to the Unit 2 EDG No.
21 without requiring a dual unit shutdown.



Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action



The proposed exemption does not involve any measurable environmental impact during normal operation of Unit 1 or
the shutdown/refueling of Unit 2 since the plant configuration is changed only minimally for short periods of time
when the missile door will be removed and overall plant operation is not changed. The likelihood of tornado-generated
or other high wind-generated missile damage during the time the exemption would be in effect and which could affect
equipment required to be operable to avoid radiological impact is low. Also, the licensee indicates that the missile
door will be reinstalled whenever severe weather conditions arise. Thus, the proposed temporary exemption would
not significantly affect the probability or consequences of potential reactor accidents and would not otherwise
affect radiological plant effluents. Consequently, the Commission concludes that there are no significant radiological
impacts associated with the proposed exemption.

With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed exemption involves features located entirely within
the owner-controlled area defined in 10 CFR Part 20. The EDG upgrade project activities do not affect nonradiological
plant effluents and has no other environmental impact. Therefore, the staff concludes that there are no significant
nonradiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed exemption.



Alternatives to the Proposed Action



The principal alternative to requesting the temporary exemption for implementation of the EDG upgrade would be to
comply with the restrictive requirements of GDC-2. However, this alternative would not significantly enhance
the protection of the environment, and would result in a significant loss of power generation since a dual outage would
be required.



Alternate Use of Resources



This action does not involve the use of any resources not previously considered in the April 1973 Final Environmental
Statements for the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant, Unit Nos. 1 and 2.



Agencies and Persons Consulted



The NRC staff consulted the State of Maryland, Department of Natural Resources, regarding the environmental impact
of this proposed action. The State of Maryland had no comments.



Finding of No Significant Impact



Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the staff concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant
effect on the quality of the human environment and has determined, therefore, not to prepare and environmental impact
statement for the proposed exemption.

For further details with respect to this action, see the application dated August 4, 1994, which is available for public
inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, The Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555,
and at the local public document room located at Calvert County Library, Prince Frederick, Maryland 20678.

Order Approving Proposed Amendment to the Options Price Reporting Authority's National Market System Plan for the
Purpose of Establishing a Fee To Be Paid by Persons Other Than Vendors Who Provide a Data Control Service to OPRA Subscribers


 

October 19, 1994. 

 

On June 27, 1994, the Options Price Reporting Authority (``OPRA'')
 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') pursuant to Section 11Aa3-2
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 a proposed amendment to its National Market System Plan for the purpose of establishing a Data Control Service Agreement
and a Control Service Fee for persons other than vendors who provide a data control service to OPRA subscribers and
exempting subscribers who receive the feed from OPRA's Subscriber Indirect Access Fee. On August 30, 1994, OPRA filed
with the Commission a letter amendment revising the amendment to clarify that OPRA vendors who provide data control
services to their data feed customers are not considered to be Control Service Providers required to enter into a Data
Control Service Agreement or pay a Control Service Fee.
 The proposed amendment was published for comment in the 

Federal Register

.
 One comment letter was received. For the reasons discussed below, the Commission is approving the proposed amendment.


 






I. Background 

 

Recent developments in computer and communications technology have led an increasing number of OPRA subscribers
to receive options information by means of high speed, data feed transmissions from vendors. Historically, OPRA
vendors have provided a controlled and formatted transmission of options information to most subscribers, but have
also provided an uncontrolled, bulk, data feed transmission to an increasing number of subscribers. As a result of
the trend toward data feed transmission, a new type of service provider_the data control service provider_has appeared.
Such a provider controls the access and entitlement of subscribers' devices in respect of market information received
in the form of a data feed transmission. Unlike vendors, data control service providers are not currently subject
to a contract with OPRA nor are they required to contribute toward OPRA's overall administrative costs, despite the
fact that, like vendors, they are in the business of redistributing options information. 

 

II. Description 

 

The proposed amendment establishes a Control Service Fee to be paid by persons other than vendors who provide a data
control service to OPRA subscribers. The monthly fee of $2,800 is the same as that currently paid by vendors under their
agreement with OPRA. The control service fee is intended to cover OPRA's additional administrative costs and to allocate
a portion of OPRA's overall costs to those persons who utilize options market information for commercial purposes.


 The proposed amendment also establishes a Data Control Service Agreement that will serve as a contract between a Control
Service Provider and OPRA. This agreement imposes requirements on Control Service Providers intended to assure
the reliability and integrity of the services they provide. It will require Control Service Providers to provide
OPRA with a complete description of the systems and procedures to be utilized by them in controlling subscribers'
access to options information, as well as a current list of subscribers and their entitlements. 

 The amendment also provides that OPRA's Subscriber Indirect Access Fee, which is payable by subscribers who receive
uncontrolled data feed transmissions of options information from vendors, will not apply to subscribers whose receipt
of a data feed transmission is under the control of a Control Service Provider. 

 Finally, the Indirect (Vendor Pass-Through) Circuit Connection Rider to OPRA's Subscriber Agreement would be amended
to relieve controlled data feed subscribers of the obligation to report device counts to OPRA. Since vendors and Control
Service Providers are or will be required to provide this information to OPRA, there is no need to obtain it from the
subscribers. 

 

III. Summary of Comments 

 

As noted above, the Commission received one comment letter.
 Reuters, a vendor that distributes OPRA information, assumed that the purpose of the amendment was to replace the
indirect access fee (paid by subscribers who receive an uncontrolled data feed of information from vendors) with
a charge to vendors who control the data delivered to a subscriber. As the letter amendment (cited on page 2 of this order)
makes clear, only data control service providers 

who are not vendors

 will be required to enter into a Data Control Service Agreement and pay the Control Service Fee. No new or additional
fees are to be imposed on vendors under this amendment.

IV. Discussion


The Commission believes the proposed amendment is consistent with the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder
applicable to OPRA and, in particular, with Sections 11A(a)(1)(C)(ii) and (D) of the Act. Section 11A(a)(1)(C)(ii)
provides for the availability to brokers, dealers, and investors of information with respect to quotations for and
transactions in securities. Section 11A(a)(1)(D) provides for the linking of all markets for qualified securities
through communications and data processing facilities to foster efficiency, enhance competition, increase the
information available to brokers, dealers, and investors, facilitate the offsetting of investor's orders, and
contribute to the best execution of such orders. Further, the Commission believes that the amendment is consistent
with Rule 11Aa3-2(c)(2) in that it is appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors and
the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanisms of, a national market
system.
The new Data Control Service Provider Agreement and accompanying fee will help OPRA to assure the reliability and
integrity of the service that these providers offer OPRA customers. The Agreement will permit OPRA to know the exact
number of entitlements a subscriber has arranged for with the Control Service Provider. This will eliminate the need
for the Indirect Access Fee, currently paid by those subscribers who receive an uncontrolled data feed whether they
have one entitlement or 100. The Control Service Fee, payable by the Provider, will be the same as the fee charged to
vendors, thus promoting uniformity and equality in pricing options information.
It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 11A(a)(3)(B) of the Act, that the amendments to the OPRA Plan be, and hereby
are, approved.



For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority, 17 CFR 200.30-3(a)(29).

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change by the American
Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating to the Designation of Additional Equity Derivative Securities Pursuant to Exchange
Rule 154, Commentary .04(c)</DOCTITLE>



October 21, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on October 7, 1994, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which
Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit
comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The Exchange is designating Standard & Poor's Depositary Receipts as eligible, pursuant to Exchange Rule 154,
Commentary .04(c), for stop and stop limit orders to be elected by quotation.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



1. Purpose



Exchange Rules 131 and 154 allow stop and stop limit orders
 in selected derivative securities to be elected by a quotation,
 provided the prior approval of a Floor Official is obtained. Absent this provision, such orders could only be elected
when a transaction in the security occurred at or through the stop price, notwithstanding the fact that the quoted
market had moved through the stop price as a result of trading in the underlying security.






Under Exchange Rule 154, Commentary .04(c)(v), provisions regarding the election of stop and stop limit orders are
only applicable to such derivative securities as are designated by the Exchange as eligible for this treatment. Currently,
only index warrants have been so designated.
 The Exchange had previously designated Americus Trust Units, PRIMEs, and SCOREs as eligible as well, but all such
securities have since expired and are no longer traded.





Accordingly, the Exchange now designates, pursuant to Exchange Rule 154, Commentary .04(c), Standard & Poor's
Depositary Receipts
 as eligible for stop and stop limit orders to be elected by quotation. These derivative equity securities can be expected
to fluctuate in price based on changes in an underlying stock index, and are therefore appropriately designated as
eligible for election of stop and stop limit orders by quotation.




2. Statutory Basis



The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the objectives of Section
6(b)(5) in particular in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments
to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The proposed rule change will impose no burden on competition.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others



No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change. 



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



The foregoing rule change constitutes a stated policy, practice, or interpretation with respect to the meaning,
administration, or enforcement of an existing rule of the Exchange and therefore has become effective pursuant to
Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act and subparagraph (e) of Rule 19b-4 thereunder. At any time within 60 days of the
filing of such proposed rule change, the Commission may summarily abrogate such rule change if it appears to the Commission
that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. 



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C.  552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of the Amex. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-Amex-94-41
and should be submitted by November 17, 1994. 




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; American Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Granting Approval to Proposed Rule Change
Relating to Increasing the Share Parameters for Orders Entered Through PER</DOCTITLE>


October 20, 1994.


On June 23, 1994, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange
Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change to increase the share parameters, from 5,099 to 30,099 shares, for orders entered through the
Exchange's Post Execution Reporting (PER) system.





The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34347 (July 11, 1994), 59
FR 36238 (July 15, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal.
The PER system provides member firms with the means to electronically transmit equity orders up to volume limits specified
by the Exchange directly to the specialist's post on the Exchange Floor. Market and marketable limit orders and preopening
market orders are placed on the specialist's electronic book. Once the PER order is executed, the system transmits
the execution report directly back to the member firm.
Currently, the PER system accepts (1) up to 5,099 shares for all eligible market and limit orders; (2) up to 25,000 shares
for eligible market and limit orders for Unit Investment Trust securities (such as Standard & Poor's Depositary
Receipts);
 and (3) up to 30,099 shares for market and limit round lot orders for those securities included in the S&P 500 Index.






In the Amex Approval Order, the Commission granted partial accelerated approval for that portion of the instant filing
which pertains to those Exchange-listed equity securities included in the S&P 500 Index. The Commission also
stated in the Amex Approval Order that if, after three months, the Exchange wishes to extend the PER parameters to all
other Exchange-listed equity securities, then it has the option to do so. During the three-month pilot the Exchange
has had an opportunity to observe the level of increased utilization of PER and factor that into its assessment of how
best to implement the parameter increase for the remainder of the Exchange-listed equity securities. The Exchange
represents that it has not experienced any systems problems in processing the additional order flow through PER.
The Exchange now requests an extension of the PER parameters to all other Exchange-listed equity securities.







The Commission finds that the Amex's proposal to increase the PER share parameters, from 5,099 to 30,099, for orders
of the remaining Exchange-listed equity securities (

i.e.,

 equity securities in addition to those included in the S&P 500 Index), is consistent with the requirements of
the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange. Specifically, the
Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act
 because it will facilitate transactions in securities by allowing for the timely transmission of a larger number
of orders to the Amex floor. The proposal will also result in more efficient and effective market operations, consistent
with Section 11A(a)(1)(B) and will further the maintenance of fair and orderly markets and the efficient execution
of securities transactions consistent with Section 11A(a)(1)(C) of the Act.






Finally, based upon representations from the Amex, the Commission is satisfied that the Exchange's PER system will
have adequate computer processing capacity to accommodate the increased order size eligibility.
 The Commission notes, however, that if the Exchange does not implement the expansion to all Exchange-listed equity
securities within six months of the approval date of this order, then it cannot so implement without demonstrating
to the Commission that the systems capacity remains adequate to facilitate the additional order flow.






It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (SR-Amex-94-25) is approved.




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change by the Boston
Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating to its Fee Schedules</DOCTITLE>

Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on September 30, 1994, the Boston Stock Exchange, Inc. (``BSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which
Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. On October 14, 1994, the Exchange agreed to submit
the instant filing for immediate effectiveness for a period of one hundred and twenty days commencing with the date
of filing.
 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.




I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


The Boston Stock Exchange seeks to amend its fee schedules pertaining to transaction fees.


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.


A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


1. Purpose


The purpose of the proposed rule filing is to amend the Exchange's fee schedule in order to capitalize on the competitive
niches that the Exchange currently enjoys and to improve the Exchange's competitive position. The proposal would
provide a $.25 per trade credit on all non-self-directed, electronically routed, Exchange executed, trades of any
size. For purposes of the per trade credit, ``non-self-directed'' shall mean entered by a BEACON subscriber in stocks
in which the routing firm has no affiliation with or financial interest in the specialist operation registered in
those stocks. The aggregate credit per firm shall be limited to the total monthly layoff transaction fees charged
to that firm.





The specific new language is as follows: New language.


Transaction Fees




2. Statutory Basis

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; National Securities Clearing Corporation; Order Granting Accelerated Approval
of a Proposed Rule Change Modifying Comparison Procedures for Corporate Bond and Unit Investment Trust Transactions
and Modifying the Fee Structure for Correction Fees</DOCTITLE>



October 20, 1994.



On August 9, 1994, the National Securities Clearing Corporation (``NSCC'') filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (``Commission'') a proposed rule change (File No. SR-NSCC-94-16) pursuant to Section
19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'').
 Notice of the proposal was published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 4, 1994.
 No comment letters were received. For the reasons discussed below, the Commission is approving the proposed rule
change on an accelerated basis.






I. Description



Since 1993, NSCC has been redesigning its bond comparison system to accelerate the processing (

i.e., 

submission and comparison) of bond transactions to achieve higher rates of trade comparison at earlier points in
the comparison process.3 NSCC believes accelerated processing will help to increase certainty and reduce risk in
the clearance and settlement of debt transactions. The first phase of the redesign process enhanced the processing
of transactions in municipal securities and was implemented by NSCC on August 13, 1993.4









The primary purpose of the current proposed rule change is to expand the accelerated comparison system to include
the processing of transactions in corporate bonds and unit investment trusts (``UITs''). The proposed rule change
also permits NSCC to provide comparison services for baby bonds (

i.e.

, corporate bonds having a par value of less than $1,000) and new issue trading. The proposed rule change also modifies
the fee structure for correction fees. 

Under the proposed rule change, the cutoff time for submission of original trade input for all corporate bond and UIT
transactions is moved from 1:00 p.m. on the day following trade date (``T+1'') to 2:00 a.m. on T+1. These trades will
be reported back to members by 8:00 a.m. on T+1. Adjustments to original trade input will have to be made prior to the
time specified by NSCC on T+1, which will be 6:00 p.m. 

In addition, NSCC will accept trade input for trade-for-trade processing of corporate baby bonds. If transactions
are submitted as a mixed lot (

i.e., 

submissions including baby bonds and round lots), the baby bond and the round lot portions of the transaction will
be separated by NSCC upon input. 

At the option of members, corporate bond and UIT transactions will be compared when the net buy side and sell side aggregate
principal amounts can be matched for a particular security, even if the relevant principal amounts are specified
in more than one buy side and/or more than one sell side submission, if the transactions would have been compared had
such buy side and sell side principal amounts each been specified on a single submission. 

Because correction processing occurs at the New York and American Stock Exchanges and at the National Association
of Securities Dealers before the trade input is transmitted to NSCC, Add-by-Seller, Delete-by-Seller, Delete Add-by-Seller,
and Delete-by-Buyer instructions will no longer be accepted under the proposed rule.
 This change is being made in order to standardize correction processing.





NSCC will provide comparison services for corporate bond new issue transactions on the same basic terms and conditions
as it currently provided for municipal securities transactions with the exception of syndicate takedown processing.
 Original trade input for new issue corporate bond transactions will be accepted until the third day prior to the initial
settlement date for the issue. Original input may set forth either (1) a final settlement price and a settlement date
that is either the initial settlement date or a specified number of days after the initial settlement date or (2) a dollar
price. Original trade input that is submitted between three and five days prior to the initial settlement date but
does not set forth a final settlement price and settlement date or does not set forth a dollar price will be treated as
regular way input. Any corporate bond new issue transactions that remain uncompared at the opening of business on
the day prior to the initial settlement date will be deleted from NSCC's system.

<PARENT> FR941027-2-00065 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In addition, NSCC's fee structure relating to correction fees is being amended to reflect that correction capabilities
are being accelerated in conformity with comparison capabilities. These fee changes conform all bond correction
fees to the fees implemented in connection with municipal securities transaction processing in that participants
will be charged for supplemental input on or after T+1.
 Currently, NSCC charges participants for supplemental input relating to corporate bond and UIT transactions on
or after T+2. In addition, the bond system correction fees for ``don't know'' and ``questioned trade'' input is being
deleted because NSCC no longer processes such transactions. The proposed rule change also makes certain conforming
changes and deletions to NSCC's Procedures in order to reflect greater uniformity in NSCC's bond comparison system
and to eliminate certain language which has become obsolete.




II. Discussion


The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder and particularly with the requirements of Section 17A(b)(3)(F).
 Section 17A(b)(3)(A) requires that the rules of a clearing agency be designed to promote the prompt and accurate clearance
and settlement of securities transactions. The Commission believes that the proposed changes to NSCC's comparison
procedures should help achieve higher rates of trade comparison at earlier points in the comparison process and thus
help increase certainty and reduce risk in the clearance and settlement of corporate bond and UIT transactions. Use
of NSCC's bond comparison system should significantly improve the comparison rate for corporate bonds, baby bonds,
and unit investment trusts and should facilitate moving from a five business day settlement cycle to a three business
day settlement cycle.
 Moreover, the Commission believes that by expanding the bond comparison system to include corporate bond, baby bond,
and new issue transaction processing, NSCC is aiding in the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities
transactions.





NSCC's fee structure will be amended with regard to correction fees to reflect that correction capabilities will
be accelerated in conformity with comparison capabilities. The Commission believes that these changes to NSCC's
fee structure are appropriate and in conformity with Section 17A(b)(3)(D) of the Act which requires the rules of a
clearing agency to provide for equitable allocation of reasonable fees among its participants.





NSCC has requested that the Commission find good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth
day after the date of publication of notice of the filing so that NSCC can begin utilizing the new comparison procedures
for trades executed on October 21, 1994. The Commission finds good cause for so approving the proposed rule change
because accelerated approval will allow NSCC to implement the new procedures as scheduled. Additionally, the Commission
does not anticipate that it will receive any significant negative comment on the proposed rule change in view of the
fact that no comments have been received to date by the Commission or NSCC.


III. Conclusion


On the basis of the foregoing, the Commission finds that the proposal is consistent with the requirements of the Act,
particularly with Sections 17A(b)(3)(F) and 17A(b)(3)(D) of the Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder.
It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-NSCC-94-16)
be, and hereby is, approved.





For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>The Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A.; Notice of Application </DOCTITLE>


October 21, 1994.


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'').


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Application for Exemption under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (``Act'').




APPLICANT: 

The Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A. (``Chase'').



RELEVANT ACT SECTIONS: 

Exemption requested under section 6(c) from the provisions section 17(f) of the Act. 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION. 

Chase seeks an order to enable it to maintain foreign securities and other assets of United States registered investment
companies for which Chase serves as custodian or subcustodian in the custody of The Chase Manhattan Bank (M) Berhad
(``Chase-Malaysia''). 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee from the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.



Applicant's Representations and Legal Analysis


1. Chase requests exemptive relief for itself, any management investment company registered under the Act, other
than an investment company registered under section 7(d) of the Act (a ``U.S. Investment Company''), and any custodian
for a U.S. Investment Company from section 17(f) of the Act. The requested exemption would let Chase, such U.S. Investment
Company and such custodian to maintain foreign securities, cash, and cash equivalents (collectively, ``Assets'')
in the custody of Chase-Malaysia, an indirect subsidiary of Chase located in Malaysia. For purposes of the application,
the term ``foreign securities'' includes (a) securities issued and sold primarily outside the United States by a
foreign government, a national of any foreign country, or a corporation or other organization incorporated or organized
under the laws of any foreign country, and (b) securities issued or guaranteed by the Government of the United States
or by any state or any political subdivision thereof or by any agency thereof by any entity organized under the laws
of the United States or of any state thereof which have been issued and sold primarily outside the United States. 
2. Section 17(f) of the Act requires every registered management investment company to place and maintain its securities
and similar investments in the custody of certain enumerated entities. Rules 17f-5 under the Act expands the
group of entities located outside the United States that are permitted to serve as custodians for the Assets of registered
management investment companies. Rule 17f-5 defines the term ``Eligible Foreign Custodian'' to include a
majority-owned direct or indirect subsidiary of a qualified U.S. bank or bank-holding company that is incorporated
or organized under the laws of a country other than the United States and that has shareholders' equity in excess of
$100,000,000 (U.S. $ equivalent or U.S. $) as of the close of its most recently completed fiscal year. The rule defines
the term ``Qualified U.S. Bank'' to include a banking institution organized under the laws of the United States that
has an aggregate capital, surplus and undivided profit of not less than $500,000.
3. Chase is a national banking association and is regulated as such by the Comptroller of the Currency under the National
Bank Act. At December 31, 1993, Chase had shareholders' equity in excess of $6.4 billion. Thus, Chase is a ``Qualified
U.S. Bank'' under the requirements of Rule 17f-5, since it is a banking institution organized under the laws
of the United States, and it has aggregate capital, surplus and undivided profit substantially in excess of the $500,000
minimum required by the rule. 
4. Chase is a subsidiary of The Chase Manhattan Corporation, a Delaware company that provides financial services
throughout the world. Through its Global Securities Services division (``GSS''), Chase provides custody and related
services to global institutional investors, including U.S. mutual funds. GSS currently has over $1,300 trillion
in assets under custody at various locations throughout the world, including its branches and subsidiaries in approximately
50 countries. 
5. Chase established a branch in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in 1964, and currently offers custody services in Malaysia
through that branch. However, under the Malaysian Banking and Financial Institutions Act 1989, Chase must now convert
its branch to a locally incorporated entity. To comply with Malaysian law, Chase proposes to transfer all the activities
of the branch, as well as its personnel, to Chase-Malaysia. 
6. Chase-Malaysia will be wholly-owned by Chase Manhattan Overseas Banking Corporation, a wholly-owned direct
subsidiary of Chase. Chase-Malaysia will assume the assets, liabilities, and business of the Chase Kuala Lumpur
branch and will be subject to the supervision of Bank Negara Malayasia (the central bank of Malaysia). Chase-Malaysia
will offer the same services as the former Chase Kuala Lumpur branch, and will become subject to the same capital and
reporting requirements as other domestic banks in Malaysia.
7. Chase-Malaysia will satisfy the requirements of rule 17f-5 insofar as it will be a majority-owned indirect
subsidiary of Chase and will be incorporated and organized under the laws of Malaysia. Chase-Malaysia will not, however,
meet the $100 million minimum shareholder's equity requirement of rule 17f-5. Accordingly, Chase-Malaysia
will not qualify as an ``Eligible Foreign Custodian'' under the rule and, absent exemptive relief, could not serve
as custodian for the Assets of U.S. Investment Companies. 
8. Where custody services are required in Malaysia, Chase will hold the Assets of U.S. Investment Companies as custodian
or subcustodian, and will deposit (or cause or permit the deposit of) the Assets with Chase-Malaysia in accordance
with the arrangement described in the conditions below. Chase-Malaysia will be well-qualified to provide custody
and subcustody services to Chase, U.S. Investment Companies, and custodians for U.S. Investment Companies, since
Chase-Malaysia will be the successor to the business of Chase's Kuala Lumpur branch, which is experienced in providing
custody services. Under the proposed foreign custody arrangements, the protection affforded the Assets of U.S.
Investment Companies held by Chase-Malaysia would not be diminished from the protection afforded by rule 17f-5.

Applicant's Conditions





Chase agrees that any order of the SEC granting the requested relief may be conditioned upon the following:



1. The foreign custody arrangements proposed regarding Chase-Malaysia will satisfy the requirements of rule 17f-5
in all respects other than Chase-Malaysia's level of shareholders' equity.

2. Chase will deposit Assets with Chase-Malaysia only in accordance with the Custody Agreement and the Subcustody
Agreement described in (a) and (b) below. The Custody and Subcustody Agreements will remain in effect at all times
during which Chase-Malaysia fails to satisfy all the requirements of the rule.



(a) The Custody Agreement will be between Chase and the U.S. Investment Company (or its custodian). In that agreement,
Chase will undertake to provide custody or subcustody services, and the U.S. Investment Company (or its custodian)
will authorize Chase to delegate to Chase-Malaysia such of Chase's duties and obligations as will be necessary to
permit Chase-Malaysia to hold the Assets of U.S. Investment Companies in custody in Malaysia. The Custody Agreement
will further provide that the delegation by Chase to Chase-Malaysia will not relieve Chase of any responsibility
to the U.S. Investment Company or its custodian for any loss due to such delegation, and that Chase will be liable for
any loss or claim arising out of or in connection with the performance by Chase-Malaysia of the custody services to
the same extent as if Chase had itself provided the custody services under the Custody Agreement.



(b) A Subcustody Agreement will be executed by Chase and Chase-Malaysia. Pursuant to this agreement, Chase will delegate
to Chase-Malaysia such of Chase's duties and obligations as would be necessary to permit Chase-Malaysia to hold Assets
in custody in Malaysia. The Subcustody Agreement will explicitly provide that (i) Chase-Malaysia is acting as a foreign
custodian for Assets that belong to a U.S. Investment Company pursuant to the terms of an exemptive order issued by
the SEC and (ii) the U.S. Investment Company or its custodian (as the case may be) that has entered into a Custody Agreement
will be entitled to enforce the terms of the Subcustody Agreement and can seek relief directly against Chase-Malaysia.
The Subcustody Agreement will provide that it will be governed by New York law.



3. Chase currently satisfies and will continue to satisfy the Qualified U.S. Bank requirement set forth in rule 17f-5(c)(3).

<DOCTITLE>Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs; U.S. Climate Action Report (USCAR), September
1994; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change</DOCTITLE>


<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of availability of USCAR and public comment period.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In June 1992, the United States signed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Pursuant
to the reporting requirements under Articles 4.2 and 12 of the Convention, the United States has prepared and submitted
the U.S. Climate Action Report (USCAR) in fulfillment of these requirements to the UNFCCC Secretariat. The USCAR
provides a description of the current U.S. program designed to reduce emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000. The
information presented in the USCAR, together with information provided by other Annex I Parties (developed country
Parties and Parties with economies in transition to market economies), will be reviewed and discussed by the Parties
to the UNFCCC beginning at the first session of the Conference of the Parties in early 1995.


In keeping with international guidelines, the USCAR provides an inventory of current U.S. greenhouse gas emissions
and sinks, estimates effects of current mitigation measures and policies on future emissions levels, and describes
U.S. involvement in international programs including associated financial transfers and contributions. In addition,
the USCAR includes a discussion of U.S. national circumstances which affect its vulnerability and responses to climate
change. Information on adaptation programs and the U.S. Global Change Research Program, the largest climate change
research program in the world, is also presented. While it briefly discusses the future direction of the U.S. effort,
the USCAR does not seek to identify policies or measures additional to those described in the Climate Action Plan,
announced by President Clinton and Vice President Gore on October 19, 1993, that might ultimately be taken as the United
States continues to move forward in addressing climate change.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In June 1992, at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (the ``Earth Summit''), the United
States signed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The ultimate objective of this
Convention is to: ``Achieve * * * stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere
at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. Such a level should be
achieved within a time-frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that
food productions is not threatened and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner.''


It has been predicted that human produced greenhouse gases (primarily carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide)
will cause change in global average climate at a rate that could far exceed any natural change that has occurred in the
last 10,000 years. Although there are uncertainties regarding the magnitude, timing and regional patterns of global
climate change, any human-induced change that does occur is not likely to be reversed for decades_or even centuries_because
of the long lifetimes of the greenhouse gases and the inertia of the climatic system.
In accordance with the UNFCCC's reporting requirements as specified in Articles 4.2 and 12, the United States has
prepared the U.S. Climate Action Report (USCAR) and submitted it to the UNFCCC Secretariat. The USCAR represents
the United States' first formal communication to the Secretariat under these Articles.

Content of the USCAR 



The USCAR provides a background to the issue of global climate change and describes current U.S. efforts to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000. Following the Introduction and Overview (chapter 1), the
report begins (in chapter 2) with an analysis of United States national circumstances which affect its vulnerability
and responses to climate change. These circumstances include natural resources, the economy, energy production
and consumption, governing institutions, and U.S. policies related to climate change. 

The next chapter (chapter 3) consists of an inventory of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide,
methane, nitrous oxide, and HFC and PFC emissions. Because the full U.S. submission includes a copy of the EPA Report
``Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks for 1990-1993'', the USCAR itself provides a summary
of this complete inventory. 

Chapter 4 deals with the specific actions being taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This section is drawn from
the material contained in the 1993 U.S. Climate Change Action Plan. As with the emissions inventory, a detailed supplement
was also submitted to the INC Secretariat on this material. That document, ``The Climate Change Action Plan: Technical
Supplement,'' has been published separately by the Department of Energy. The 1993 Action Plan aims to limit greenhouse
gas emissions while continuing to guide the U.S. economy toward environmentally sound economic growth into the next
century. The Plan is comprehensive, as it targets all greenhouse gases and all sectors of the economy through a portfolio
of nearly fifty different actions. It is designed for rapid implementation by building on existing technologies,
programs, and voluntary efforts to deliver cost-effective results. It is a coordinated federal response, involving
several government agencies working together, and was developed through an interagency process. The Plan is being
actively monitored to ensure that it meets the President's goals, and will be modified to adapt to changing circumstances.
Finally, the Plan lays the foundation for an international response to climate change through the United States Initiative
on Joint Implementation. 

The combined effect of the U.S. actions, assuming 1993 economic predictions and full funding of all mitigation measures,
would reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1,459 million metric tons of carbon equivalent (MMTCE) by the year 2000,
slightly below the 1990 level of 1,462 MMTCE. Without these mitigation policies, projected net greenhouse gas emissions
would rise to 1,674 MMTCE. Since these policies were first developed and their effects projected, economic growth
has been more robust, and oil prices lower than predicted in the Action Plan. These differences and other effects on
meeting the projected emission reductions of the Plan are now being evaluated. 

Chapter 5 of the USCAR examines the potential impacts of global climate change as well as strategies to adapt to any
such change. Both adverse and beneficial consequences of climate change are plausible, with the overall effect depending
on the rate and magnitude of change and the vulnerability or sensitivity of human and natural systems to such changes.
Possible consequences include rising sea levels, coastal zone erosion, shifts in precipitation patterns (causing
either more floods or droughts), shifts in agricultural production, and increased stress on forest ecosystems.


Chapter 6 highlights current U.S. research and public education efforts regarding climate change. The U.S. Global
Change Research Program, the largest climate change research program in the world, seeks both to expand knowledge
about the processes that affect climate change and to develop integrated models to predict these effects. In addition
to basic science research, the U.S. is promoting research in all economic sectors_including industry, transportation,
housing, and agriculture_to develop strategies to reduce emissions. The United States is coordinating its research
efforts with both international organizations and on a bilateral basis with individual countries. 

To ensure that the public has a solid understanding of the science of climate change and the consequences of policy
options, the U.S. is also continuing to develop its efforts to coordinate general education, communication, and
information programs for the public. Educational outreach programs include GLOBE (Global Learning and Observations
to Benefit the Environment) for K-12 students, and Project Earthlink, a long-term effort targeting community
leaders, informal educators, teachers, students, journalists, and the general public.

International activities and cooperation regarding global climate change are discussed in Chapter 7. The Climate
Convention requires all Parties to communicate a national inventory of greenhouse gas emissions and sinks and describe
measures taken to implement the convention. To help developing countries meet this commitment, the U.S. initiated
its Country Studies program in 1992. This program is providing technical and financial support to developing countries
and countries with economies in transition to help them prepare studies to address climate change. Chapter 7 also
highlights other ways in which the United States is implementing its financial commitments under the Convention,
including numerous U.S. bilateral mitigation projects as well as multilateral cooperation through such organizations
as the Global Environment Facility, multilateral development banks, the Organization of Economic Cooperation
and Development, the International Energy Agency, and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation organization.

The final chapter of the Climate Action Report addresses future actions to address climate change. In this chapter,
two important issues are raised: (1) the uncertainties in projecting the effectiveness of current actions to meet
the U.S. domestic commitment to return greenhouse gas emissions to their 1990 levels by the year 2000, and (2) the long-term
actions that must be taken to address global warming_as greenhouse gas emissions will continue to rise beyond the
turn of the millenium.



Preparation of the Report



The U.S. Climate Action Report was prepared in a broad interagency process, incorporating_to the greatest extent
possible_data from all relevant sectors and programs. Preliminary versions of the Report were circulated to nongovernmental
organizations, including environmental and business groups, for their review and comment. Where possible, suggestions
received were incorporated into this text.



Availability of the Report



Copies of the U.S. Climate Action Report may be purchased from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing
Office (GPO), Post Office Box 37082, Washington, DC 20013-7082; tel: (202) 512-1800. The publication
number for the Report is 0-16-045214-7. In addition, GPO will provide copies to federal depository
libraries.

The text of the U.S. Climate Action Report will also be available electronically through:


 The Federal Bulletin Board Service (BBS) of the U.S. Government Printing Office which can be reached at (202)
512-1387. The Report can be found in the Department of State (DOS) environment library under ``global issues''.

 The Internet via gopher to summit.fiu.edu under Department of State (DOS) Reports.



Public Comment



The Framework Convention on Climate Change requires that Parties periodically prepare additional communications
on their actions to address climate change. It is the U.S. intention to collect comments received on this first submission
and on the basis of those comments_and additional actions being taken within the government_to prepare additional
documents for submission.

For this reason, while the timing for subsequent submissions has not been determined, written comments on the U.S.
Climate Action Report are invited. Comments should be submitted to the Department of State no later than December
30, 1994. Comments or questions should be directed to: Mr. Daniel A. Reifsnyder, Director, Office of Global Change,
Room 4329-A, Department of State, 2201 C Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20520-7818; telephone: (202)

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The FHWA is issuing this notice to advise the public that an environmental impact statement (EIS) will be prepared
for a proposed new location highway project in Smith County, Texas.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The FHWA, in cooperation with the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT), will prepare an environmental impact
statement (EIS) on a proposal to construct the southern section of Loop 49, an approximately 40 mile circumferential
controlled access highway around the urbanized area of Tyler in Smith County, Texas. The southern section of the proposed
Loop 49 extends from State Highway 155 to State Highway 110 in southern Smith County. The length of the project varies,
depending on the selected alternative, from approximately 15.3 kilometers (9.5 miles) to 18.5 kilometers (11.5
miles). The proposed action is intended to provide access and increased mobility to the southern Tyler/Smith County
area; to alleviate traffic congestion on existing roadways in urbanized Smith County; and to provide a safer, more
convenient route for traffic travelling through the Tyler area.



Alternatives to the proposed action to be discussed in the EIS consist of (1) taking no action; and (2) improving existing
roadways in the urbanized areas of Smith County. The build alternatives include three alternative alignments along
new location rights-of-way connecting State Highway 155 to State Highway 110.

Impacts caused by the construction and operation of Loop 49 will vary according to the alternative alignments utilized.
Generally, impacts would include the following: transportation impacts (construction detours, construction
traffic, and mobility improvement), air and noise impacts from construction equipment and operation of the roadway,
water impacts from construction area and roadway stormwater runoff, impacts to waters of the United States including
wetlands from right-of-way encroachment, and impacts to residents and businesses based on potential relocations.

Letters describing the proposed action and soliciting comments will be sent to appropriate Federal, State, and local
agencies, and to private organizations and citizens who have previously expressed interest in the proposal. A Major
Investment Study has been completed in compliance with the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act. In
addition, several meetings have been held by the Loop 49 Steering Committee, composed of representatives of local
governments, agencies, and interested organizations and citizens. A public meeting was held on October 13, 1994,
at Robert E. Lee High School in Tyler, Texas, at which public comments on the proposed action and alternatives were
requested. In addition, a public hearing will be held after publication of the Draft EIS. Public notice will be given
of the time and place of the hearing. The Draft EIS will be available for public and agency review and comment prior to
the public hearing.

To ensure that the full range of issues related to this proposed action are addressed and all significant issues identified,
comments and suggestions are invited from all interested parties. Comments or questions concerning this proposed
action and the EIS should be directed to the FHWA or TxDOT at the addresses provided above.

NHTSA will hold a public meeting beginning at 10:00 a.m. on December 6, 1994 regarding the initial decision by the Secretary
of Transportation that certain pickup trucks and other vehicles manufactured by General Motors Corporation (GM)
contain a defect that relates to motor vehicle safety.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 30118(a) (formerly section 152(a) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966,
as amended, 15 U.S.C. 1412(a)), Secretary of Transportation Federico Pe&ntilde;a has made an initial decision that
model year 1973-1991 full-sized GM pickup trucks and cab-chassis equipped with fuel tanks mounted outboard
of the frame rails contain a defect that relates to motor vehicle safety. 



The rationale for this initial decision is set forth in the Engineering Analysis (EA) Report for EA92-041. The
entire report, as well as the complete record on which the initial decision is based, are available for inspection
during working hours (9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.) in NHTSA's Technical Reference Library, Room 5108, 400 Seventh Street,
SW, Washington, DC 20590. That record consists of the public files for EA92-041 and Defect Petition (DP) 92-016.
The Executive Summary of the EA Report is set out below. 



Engineering Analysis Report_Executive Summary



This Engineering Analysis was opened on December 8, 1992, as a result of granting a petition from the Center for Auto
Safety (CAS) and Public Citizen to ``initiate a defect investigation into and recall all Chevrolet/GMC full-sized
pickups (C/K-series) with fuel tank(s) * * * mounted outboard of frame rails.'' The objective of the
investigation was to determine whether certain model year 1970-1991 Chevrolet and GMC full-sized pickup trucks
contain a defect that poses an unreasonable risk to safety, related to the danger of fires following crashes, with
primary focus on side-impact crashes. In the investigation, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's
(NHTSA) Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) conducted analyses of real-world accident data and performed laboratory
crash tests of the subject and peer vehicles. ODI also addressed questions related to the compliance of these trucks
with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 301, ``Fuel System Integrity.'' Additionally, ODI examined
whether the fuel tanks and related components on the trucks were unduly affected by corrosion that could make them
more likely to be involved in a fire. 

On April 9, 1993, ODI sent a recall request letter to General Motors Corporation (GM), recommending that GM conduct
a safety recall on GM trucks with fuel tanks mounted outside the frame rails (subject vehicles). That letter was based
on two principal factors: 

1. Real-world accident data in the Fatal Accident Reporting System (FARS) indicate that there is an increased risk
of fatality caused by fire in side-impact crashes involving the subject vehicles compared to 1973-1987 Ford
full-sized pickup trucks. That increased risk led to an estimate that, in 1993, an additional 5-6 fatalities
would occur in side-impact crashes involving the subject vehicles compared to what would occur if those trucks had
the same side-impact fire performance as full-sized Ford pickups. 

2. Laboratory crash tests corroborated the findings from the real-world accident data analysis. That is, in certain
comparable side-impact crash tests, GM fuel tanks leaked and Ford tanks did not. Further, these tests used instrumented
test dummies. Dummy measurements indicate that humans could have survived the crash forces at the impact speeds at
which the subject vehicles leaked. While these speeds are well in excess of the impact speed specified in FMVSS No.
301, the results indicate the increased fire risk in the GM trucks in crashes that are otherwise survivable. 

GM provided an extensive amount of data and arguments in response to the recall request letter. ODI has completed an
exhaustive review and analysis of the GM submissions and has conducted a variety of additional analyses associated
with issues involved in this investigation. These include: 

 An assessment of the effect of corrosion on fuel tank leakage and fire performance in the subject vehicles;

 An analysis of non-fatal burn injuries in side-impact crashes involving the subject vehicles; 

 An in-depth review of all available police accident reports and other records of side-impact, fire-involved
fatal crashes involving the subject vehicles to assess the crash conditions and severity of each; 

 An update of the FARS analysis that led to the April 9, 1993 recall request letter; 

 An analysis of the reasonableness of GM's decision to design the subject vehicle with side-mounted fuel-tanks,
given what GM knew about the safety risks associated with that design and the availability of feasible alternative
designs; and 

 An analysis of the information about the risk of post-crash fuel leaks that became available to GM during the
time the subject vehicles were being manufactured.

Principal Findings


 A review of GM submissions, as well as ODI testing, indicates that there are no data on which to conclude that
the GM trucks to which FMVSS No. 301 applied, when new, did not comply with the standard.
 There are no data to indicate a relationship between fuel tank corrosion and increased fire risk in the subject
vehicles, either in side impacts or in non-crash incidents.
 Apart from the basic decision to locate the fuel tanks of the subject vehicles outside of the frame rails, many
of the specific features of the design of the fuel storage system and the surrounding area have increased the likelihood
of post-crash fuel fires in the subject vehicles.
 Based on a review of 1979-1993 accident data reflecting the performance of full-sized pickups in side-impact
fatal crashes involving fire, occupants of the subject vehicles experienced 2.8 times as many fire-related fatalities
(i.e., fatalities in crashes in which a fire occurred) per million registered vehicle-years as occupants of Ford
pickups and 2.5 times as many as occupants of Dodge pickups. Where the FARS code indicated that the most harmful event
(MHE) of the crash was fire, the GM-to-Ford occupant fatality per million registered vehicle-years ratio is 3.4 to
1, and the GM-to-Dodge ratio is 6.1 to 1.

 Real-world accidents data do not support GM's contention that GM and Ford pickup trucks have comparable side-impact
fire performance and that differences in driver demographics and driver behavior explain the difference in the rates
of fire-related and MHE-fire fatalities in side-impact crashes for the GM and Ford pickups. This is demonstrated
by the tremendous reduction in the rate of MHE-fire side-impact fatalities that occurred after GM moved the fuel tanks
for these pickups inside the frame rails in model year 1988.
 Contrary to GM's contentions, the MHE coding in FARS is a reliable indicator of the number of fatalities actually
caused by fire.
 FARS data indicate that, if past trends continue, there would be approximately five additional fatalities
due to fire in side-impact crashes in 1994 compared to what would occur if the subject vehicles had the same side-impact
fire performance as Ford full-sized pickups.
 Reports of non-fatal burn injuries indicate that, if past trends continue, there would be three to four additional
non-fatal burn injuries in 1994 in side-impact crashes involving the subject vehicles compared to the Ford pickups.
 Laboratory crash data indicate that, at certain impact speeds and configurations, the subject vehicles will
leak fuel in side impacts, while comparable Ford pickups will not.
 While the crash severities in fatal side-impact, fire-involved crashes involving the subject vehicles are
far in excess of the severity specified in FMVSS No. 301, they are generally less than the severities that result in
fires in fatal side-impact crashes involving the Ford pickups.
 GM was aware at the time it designed the subject vehicles in the early 1970s that side-mounted fuel tank design
presented an increased risk of post-crash fuel fed fires in side impacts, compared to the risk associated with other
feasible alternative designs. Moreover, GM obtained additional information demonstrating the increased risk
associated with the side-mounted tanks during the 15-year period the subject vehicles were in production.


Principal Conclusions


 The increased risk of death and injury from fire in side-impact crashes involving the subject vehicles is a
result of the design of their fuel storage system, primarily the location of the fuel tanks outside of the frame rails,
supplemented by other features of the design.
 Given the state of the art at the time and GM's awareness of the likely consequences, it was unreasonable for
GM to design the subject vehicles with fuel tanks outside the frame rails.

 The increased safety risk due to post-crash fires in the subject vehicles is unreasonable.

Therefore, on the basis of the entire investigative record, I have initially decided, pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 30118(a)
(formerly section 152(a) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act), that the subject vehicles contain
a defect that relates to motor vehicle safety.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice_Request for proposals. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Office of Citizen Exchanges, Division of the NIS Secondary School Initiative, of the United States Information
Agency's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs announces an open competition for an assistance award to conduct
exchanges through the multiple secondary school linkage program with select countries of the NIS. The countries
are Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan. Public or private non-profit organizations meeting
the provisions described in IRS regulation 501(c)(3) may apply either to enhance/expand existing linkages or to
develop new school linkage programs. Both models are described in the guidelines section of this solicitation. 

Applicants may submit a proposal for only one of the two models

. All submissions must contain an Educator (teacher and/or administrator) exchange component AND a Student exchange
component. Approximately one third of the grants awarded will be to promote the development of new linkages. Organizations
asking for USIA funding for previously established linkages must demonstrate the value of the linkages to the NIS
Secondary School Initiative program as well as show evidence that the linkage is designed to outlast USIA funding.



Overall funding and grant making authority for this program is contained in the Freedom Support Act (Pub. L. 102-391).
These exchanges represent part of the activities for the NIS Secondary School Initiative and are subject to the availability
of funding for the Fiscal Year 1995 program. Proposals for programs and projects must conform with Agency requirements
and guidelines outlined in the Solicitation Package.



ANNOUNCEMENT NAME AND NUMBER: 

All communications with USIA concerning this announcement should refer to the above title and reference number E/P-95-25.


This is a request for proposals for reciprocal exchanges based on multiple school linkages

. Requests for proposals in support of other programs under the aegis of the NIS Secondary School Initiative are published
separately.

<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information: 

Pursuant to the Bureau's authorizing legislation, programs must maintain a non-political character and should
be balanced and representative of the diversity of American political, social, and cultural life. ``Diversity''should
be interpreted in the broadest sense and encompass differences including but not limited to race, gender, ethnicity,
religion, geographic location, socio-economic status, and physical challenges. Applicants are stongly encouraged
to adhere to the advancement of this principle.





Overview:

 The purpose of this program is to link a network of U.S. secondary schools with a network of schools in one or more NIS
countries to serve as the basis for exchanges of Educators and Students during the academic year. The USIA's main objective
is to foster interaction between American and foreign participants. Proposals should demonstrate how participants
will interact in a way which encourages the exchange of ideas and promotes mutual understanding in both the short-
and long-term. The linkages between networks of secondary schools in the U.S. with networks of schools in the NIS must
occur through at least three main program components: (1) the Exchange of secondary school educators between the
U.S. and participating NIS countries; (2) the exchange of secondary school students, and 14 to 17 years of age, between
the U.S. and participating NIS countries; and, (3) the establishment of institution-building ties between the schools
in the networks.



Guidelines

: This solicitation is for two separate models of multiple secondary school linkages between networks of schools.
Applicants must submit a proposal for only one of the two models. The proposal should state clearly which model is being
used. In both models, each network, one in the U.S. and one in the NIS, should consist of a minimum of three schools.



Model A 

is designed to enhance and expand existing linkages between a network of U.S. secondary schools and a network of secondary
schools in one or more of the countries listed above. USIA funding may not be used to supplant existing private sector
funding. Applicants must indicate how activities have been funded in the past and how the activities will be expanded
with assistance from USIA. The U.S. recipient of the grant is responsible for recruiting/selecting/organizing
a minimum of three U.S. secondary schools to form the U.S. network, strengthening an existing working relationship
with an organization or agency of government in the NIS responsible for a network of schools there, and linking the
two networks through three main components of the program: Educator exchange, Student exchange, and Institution-building
links.



Model B 

is designed to encourage the development of new links whereby the U.S. network that does not have existing links to
secondary schools in the NIS will be matched with an NIS network chosen by USIA. Proposals must rank-order participating
NIS countries where the applicant would like to establish linkages. The U.S. recipient of the grant is responsible
for recruiting/selecting/organizing a network composed of a minimum of three U.S. secondary schools, agreeing
to form partnership with a NIS network selected by USIA, and linking the two networks through three main components
of the program: Educator exchange, Student exchange, and Institution-building links.

In some special cases, applicants who are involved in existing linkage activity may request that USIA select new schools
and networks in the NIS for a proposed expanded linkage. In this case, the applicant should rank-order the preferred
countries to be considered for linkage. Depending on availability of suitable matches, USIA will select the NIS network
or school and inform applicant of the match.

For both Model A and Model B, the U.S. recipient of the grant will: Design the overall plan which integrates the three
components of the linkage, manage all travel arrangements, logistics, passports, visas, etc., provide competent
and informed escorts for student groups, and distribute and account for grant funds.

Proposals must address other essential operations of the program including the incorporation of a feasible plan
to establish communication (through computer linkages and other forms of correspondence) and the formation of a
solid working relationship between the partner schools before the student groups arrive in the host country.

Recipients of the assistance award are responsible for ensuring the selection of exchange participants who are suitable
for the program. Participants (both Educators and Students) from the U.S. and the NIS countries should represent
a broad array of backgrounds to give greater understanding to the culture and society as a whole. Selection of individual
participants from the U.S. and the NIS in the exchange components of the program must be merit based; the proposal should
describe the mechanisms used for participant selection.

Partnerships should have an existence beyond the scope of this initiative; that is, there should be an inherent reason
for their linkage apart from the availability of grant funds. Competitive proposals demonstrate this linkage and
the types of activities (follow-on) that will continue after the grant has expired.

Applicants should be familiar with the ``General Provisions'' of J-1 visa regulations. The Agency will process
the IAP-66 forms for travel to the U.S. Applicant must arrange for basic health and accident insurance coverage
of exchange participants while they are on exchange. 

Please refer to the Program Objectives, Goals, and Implementation section of the Solicitation Package for greater
detail regarding the design of the component parts as well as other program information. 



Proposed budget: 

Applicants must submit a comprehensive budget for the entire program. There must be a summary budget as well as a break-down
reflecting both the administrative budget and the program budget. All program costs should clearly indicate whether
they cover U.S. or NIS participants. 

Grants awarded to eligible organizations with less than four years of experience in conducting international exchange
programs will be limited to $60,000. 

Please refer to the POGI and Proposal Submission Instructions sections of the Solicitation Package for complete
budget guidelines and format instructions. 



Review Process 



USIA will acknowledge receipt of all proposals and will review them for technical eligibility. Proposals will be
deemed ineligible if they do not fully adhere to the guidelines stated herein and in the Solicitation Package. Eligible
proposals will be forwarded to panels of USIA officers for advisory review. All eligible proposals also will be reviewed
by the Agency contracts office, as well as the pertinent USIA area office and the USIA post overseas, where appropriate.
Proposals may be reviewed by the Office of the General Counsel or by other Agency elements. Funding decisions are at
the discretion of the USIA Associate Director for Educational and Cultural Affairs. Final technical authority for
grant awards resides with the USIA grants officer. 



Review Criteria 



Technically eligible applications will be competitively reviewed according to the criteria stated below. These
criteria are not rank ordered and all carry equal weight in the proposal evaluation: 



1. Quality of the program idea: 

Proposals should exhibit originality, substance (particularly in academic/educational aspects), precision,
and relevance to Agency mission. 



2. Program planning: 

Detailed agenda and relevant work plan should demonstrate substantive undertakings and logistical capacity. Agenda
and plan should adhere to the program overview and guidelines described above. 



3. Ability to achieve program objectives: 

Objectives should be reasonable, feasible, and flexible. Proposals should clearly demonstrate how the institution
will meet the program's objectives and plan. 



4. Multiplier effect/impact: 

Proposed programs should strengthen long-term mutual understanding, including maximum sharing of information
and establishment of long-term individual and institutional linkages. 



5. Support of diversity: 

Proposals should demonstrate the recipient's commitment to promoting the awareness and understanding of diversity.




6. Institutional capacity: 

Proposed personnel and institutional resources should be adequate and appropriate to achieve the program or project's
goals. 



7. Institution's record/ability: 

Proposals should demonstrate an institutional record of successful exchange programs, including responsible
fiscal management and full compliance with all reporting requirements for past Agency grants as determined by USIA's
Office of Contracts. The Agency will consider the past performance of prior recipients and the demonstrated potential
of new applicants. 



8. Follow-on activities: 

Proposals should provide a plan for continued follow-on activity (without USIA support) which ensures that USIA
supported programs are not isolated events. Proposal should demonstrate how activity will contribute to institution-building
in the NIS. 



9. Project evaluation: 

Proposals should include a plan to evaluate the program, both as the activities unfold and at the end. USIA recommends
that the proposal include a draft survey questionnaire or other technique plus description of a methodology for use
in linking outcomes to original project objectives. Award-receiving organizations/institutions will be expected
to submit intermediate reports after each project component is concluded or quarterly, whichever is less frequent.




10. Cost-effectiveness: 

The overhead and administrative components of the proposal, including salaries and honoraria, should be kept as
low as possible. All other items should be necessary and appropriate. 



11. Cost-sharing: 

Proposals should maximize cost-sharing through other private sector support as well as institutional direct funding
contributions. 



12. Value to U.S.-partner country relations: 

Proposed projects will be reviewed by USIA's geographic area desk officer and overseas officers to assess the relevance
to program need, potential impact, and significance in the partner country(ies). 



13. Selection process: 

Proposals should provide a specific plan to ensure a selection based on merit and should include detailed criteria
for selection of U.S. and NIS teacher and administrator as well as U.S. and NIS student participants. 



Notice 



The terms and conditions published in this RFP are binding and may not be modified by any USIA representative. Explanatory
information provided by the Agency that contradicts published language will not be binding. Issuance of the RFP does
not constitute an award commitment on the part of the Government. The needs of the program may require the award to be
reduced, revised, or increased. Final awards cannot be made until funds have been appropriated by Congress, allocated
and committed through internal USIA procedures. 



Notification 



All applicants will be notified of the results of the review process on or about February 15, 1995. Awards made will
be subject to periodic reporting and evaluation requirements.

Although you will not have a form to fill out for your narrative, there is a format. This format is the selection criteria.
Because your application will be reviewed and rated by a review panel on the basis of the selection criteria, your narrative
should follow the order and format of the criteria. 
Before preparing your application, you should carefully read the legislation and regulations of the program, eligibility
requirements, information on any priority set by the Secretary, and the selection criteria for this competition.

Your program narrative should be clear, concise, and to the point. Begin the narrative with a one page abstract or summary
of your proposed project. Then describe the project in detail, addressing each selection criterion in order. 
The Secretary strongly suggests that the applicant limit the program narrative to no more than 40 double-spaced,
typed pages (on one side only), although the Secretary will consider applications of greater length. Be sure to number
consecutively ALL pages in your application. 
You may include supporting documentation as appendices. Be sure that this material is concise and pertinent to this
program competition and is numbered consecutively. 
Applicants are advised that: (a) The Department considers only information contained in the application in ranking
applications for funding consideration. Letters of support sent separately from the formal application package
are not considered in the review by the technical review panels. (34 CFR 75.217) 
(b) The technical review panel evaluates each application solely on the basis of the established technical review
criteria. Letters of support contained in the application will strengthen the application only insofar as they contain
commitments that pertain to the established technical review criteria, such as commitment and resources.

Appendix B


Potential applicants frequently direct questions to officials of the Department regarding application notices
and programmatic and administrative regulations governing various direct grant programs. To assist potential
applicants the Department has assembled the following most commonly asked questions. 
Q. Can we get an extension of the deadline? 
A. No. A closing date may be changed only under extraordinary circumstances. Any change must be announced in the 

Federal Register

 and apply to all applications. Waivers for individual applications cannot be granted regardless of the circumstances.

Q. How many copies of the application should I submit and must they be bound? 
A. Our new policy calls for an original and six copies to be submitted. The binding of applications is optional. 
Q. May we use this same application to compete for funds under a different grant program? 
A. Yes, however, the likelihood of success is not good. A properly prepared application must meet the specifications
of the grant program to which it is submitted. 
Q. I'm not sure which grant program is most appropriate for my project. What should I do? 
A. We are happy to provide general program information. Clearly, it would not be appropriate for staff to participate
in the actual writing of an application, but we can respond to specific questions about application requirements,
evaluation criteria, and the priorities. Applicants should understand that this previous contact is not required,
nor will it in any way influence the success of an application. 
Q. When will I find out if I'm going to be funded? 
A. You can expect to receive notification within 3 to 4 months of the application closing date, depending on the number
of applications received and the number of grant programs with closing dates at about the same time. 
Q. Once my application has been reviewed by the review panel, can you tell me the outcome? 
A. No. Every year we are called by a number of applicants who have legitimate reasons for needing to know the outcome
of the review prior to official notification. Some applicants need to make job decisions, some need to notify a local
school district, etc. Regardless of the reason, because final funding decisions have not been made at that point,
we cannot share information about the review with anyone. 
Q. Will my application be returned if I am not funded? 
A. We no longer return unsuccessful applications. Thus applicants should retain at least one copy of the application.

Q. Can I obtain copies of reviewers' comments? 
A. Upon written request, reviewers' comments will be mailed to unsuccessful applicants. 
Q. Is travel allowed under these projects? 
A. Travel associated with carrying out the project is allowed. Because we may request the project director of funded
projects to attend an annual project directors meeting, you may also wish to include a trip or two to Washington, D.C.
in the travel budget. Travel to conferences is sometimes allowed when it is for purposes of dissemination. 
Q. If my application receives high scores from the reviewers, does that mean that I will receive funding? 
A. Not necessarily. It is often the case that the number of applications scored highly by the reviewers exceeds the
dollars available for funding projects under a particular competition. The order of selection, which is based on
the scores of all the applications and other relevant factors, determines the applications that can be funded. 
Q. What happens during negotiations? 
A. During negotiations technical and budget issues may be raised. These are issues that have been identified during
the panel and staff reviews that require clarification. Sometimes issues are stated as ``conditions.'' These are
issues that have been identified as so critical that the award cannot be made unless those conditions are met. Questions
may also be raised about the proposed budget. Generally, these issues are raised because there is inadequate justification
or explanation of a particular budget item, or because the budget item seems unimportant to the successful completion
of the project. If you are asked to make changes that you feel could seriously affect the project's success, you may
provide reasons for not making the changes or provide alternative suggestions. Similarly, if proposed budget reductions
will, in your opinion, seriously affect the project activities, you may explain why and provide additional justification
for the proposed expenses. An award cannot be made until all negotiation issues have been resolved.
Q. How do I provide an assurance?
A. Except for SF-424B, ``Assurances_Non-Construction Programs,'' which must be completed, simply state
in writing that you are meeting a prescribed requirement.

Q. Where can copies of the 

Federal Register

, a program's regulations, and Federal statutes be obtained? 
Copies of these materials can usually be found at your local library. If not, most can be obtained from the Government
Printing Office by writing to: Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402,
Telephone: (202) 783-3238. When requesting copies of regulations or statutes, it is helpful to use the specific
name, public law number, or part number. The material referenced in this notice would be referred to as follows:
(1) Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act (Public Law 101-392) 104 Stat. 753 (1990).
(2) State Vocational and Applied Technology Education Programs and National Discretionary Programs of Vocational
Education Final Regulations, 34 CFR parts 400 and 427.
(3) Education Department General Administrative Regulations, 34 CFR parts 74, 75, 77, 79, 80, 81, 82, 85 and 86.
