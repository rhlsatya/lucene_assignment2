The Emergency Food Assistance Program and Soup Kitchens Availability of Commodities for Fiscal Year 1995 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Nutrition Service, USDA. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice announces: (1) the surplus and purchased commodities that will be available for donation to households
under the Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP); and (2) the purchased commodities that will be available to
soup kitchens and food banks. The commodities made available under this notice shall be directed to needy persons,
including unemployed and homeless persons. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



Background and Need for Action



Surplus Commodities



Donations of commodities to needy households were initiated in 1981 as part of efforts to reduce stockpiles of government-owned
commodities. These donations responded to concern over the costs to taxpayers of storing vast quantities of foods,
while at the same time there were persons in need of food assistance. The Emergency Food Assistance Program was codified
in Title II of Public Law 98-8, the Emergency Food Assistance Act (EFAA) of 1983 (7 U.S.C. 612c note). Surplus
foods made available for distribution under the EFAA are limited to amounts determined by the Secretary to be in excess
of the quantities needed to carry out other programs, including Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) sales obligations
and domestic food assistance programs. The Secretary of Agriculture anticipates that 72 million pounds of surplus
butter will be acquired by the CCC under its price-support activities and made available for distribution through
TEFAP during Fiscal Year 1995. Although butter is the only surplus commodity expected to be available for TEFAP, the
Department may offer additional commodities, or a different amount of butter, depending on agricultural production,
market conditions and the distribution of donated foods to other domestic outlets. 



Purchased Commodities 



In recent years, the supply of available surplus commodities has been drastically reduced. These reductions are
the result of changes in the agricultural price-support programs which have brought supply and demand into better
balance, and accelerated donations and sales. Congress responded to the reduced availability of surplus commodities
with section 104 of the Hunger Prevention Act of 1988, Public Law 100-435, which added sections 213 and 214 to
the EFAA. Those sections require the Secretary to annually purchase, process, and distribute commodities for household
consumption in addition to those surplus commodities otherwise provided under TEFAP. In section 110 of the Hunger
Prevention Act, Congress also requires the Secretary to purchase, process and distribute commodities for soup kitchens
and food banks. USDA purchases commodities for these programs based in part on annual reports completed by distributing
agencies. 

For Fiscal Year 1995, $25 million has been appropriated for purchasing, processing and distributing additional
commodities for household use. The Department anticipates purchasing for distribution to households through TEFAP
during Fiscal Year 1995 peanut butter, rice, dehydrated potatoes, and the following canned foods: green beans, peaches,
pears and tomatoes. The amounts of each item purchased will depend on the prices USDA must pay, as well as the quantity
of each item requested by the States. 

For Fiscal Year 1995, $40 million has been appropriated to purchase, process, and distribute commodities for further
distribution to soup kitchens and food banks. For such outlets, the Department anticipates the purchase of dehydrated
potatoes, frozen ground beef, frozen cut-up chicken, turkey roasts, and the following canned foods: green beans,
peaches, pears, tomatoes, and beef. The amounts of each item purchased will depend on the prices USDA must pay.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of intent to form a federal advisory committee.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The interagency group of governments responsible for implementing the President's Forest Plan in Deschutes Province
is forming an official advisory committee to obtain advice from involved agencies and interested publics. The committee
will provide advice regarding implementation of a comprehensive ecosystem management strategy for federal land
within the Deschutes Province. The Deschutes Province is bordered on the north by the Columbia River between Bonneville
and just north of Wasco. From Wasco, it follows the divide between the John Day and the Deschutes Rivers south to the
Mill Creek Wilderness on the Ochoco National Forest. It follows the northern edge of the Mill Creek Wilderness east
through the Ochoco Mountains along the southern boundary of the Bridge Creek Wilderness. From there it continues
east for approximately two miles then heads southeast to Wolf Mountain continuing along the ridge west of the John
Day River to the northernmost part of the Snow Mountain Ranger District (Ochoco National Forest). From there it switches
to a southwestern direction along the divide between areas draining into the Deschutes and those draining into Malheur
Lake down to Glass Butte. From Glass Butte it follows east through China Hat and almost to Newberry Crater where it turns
to the southwest to Spring Butte and Walker Mountain. From Walker Mountain it swings south to Chemult then heads west
up to Mt. Thielsen and the Cascades Crest. From there it follows along the Cascades Crest to the Columbia River. The
Deschutes Province includes the following hydrologic units: Middle Columbia-Hood, Lower Deschutes, Trout, Upper
Deschutes, Lower Crooked, Upper Crooked, Beaver-South Fork and the Little Deschutes. The 7.6 million acre Deschutes
Province has approximately 1,631,200 acres falling within the range of the northern spotted owl including 1,144,500
acres of National Forest System land and 40 acres of DOD ownership.



The advisory committee will consist of 27 members from the following entities:



From State, Local and Tribal Governments:

 One State of Oregon representative; three county government representatives, total, selected from Crook, Deschutes,
Jefferson, and Wasco Counties; and three Tribal Government representatives selected from the Confederated Tribes
of Warm Springs, Burns Paiute, and Klamath Tribes.



From Public Interest Groups:

 Two representatives of environmental interests, two representatives of different sectors of the forest products
industry, and two representatives of the recreation and tourism sectors. In addition, the Deschutes Province Advisory
Committee will include a total of five representatives of the following interests: fish, wildlife, or forestry conservation
organizations; special forest products interests; mining interests; grazing interests; and commercial fishing
or charter fishing boat industry interests.



From Involved Federal Agencies:

 One representative each from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Forest
Service, U.S. Bureau of Land Management, U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service, and the U.S Bureau of Indian Affairs.
The Deschutes Province Advisory Committee will also include three representatives, total, from the following federal
agencies: Bureau of Reclamation, National Biological Survey, Forest Service Research, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
United States Geological Survey, Bonneville Power Administration, Department of Defense, and Soil Conservation
Service.

Applicants for advisory committee positions must be United States citizens, at least 18 years old, and will be recommended
for appointment based on their personal knowledge of local and regional resource issues; understanding of public
land uses and activities; knowledge and understanding of other cultures; ability to communicate well; willingness
to work toward mutually beneficial solutions to complex issues; respect and credibility in local communities; and
commitment to attending advisory committee meeting held throughout the province.

Bureau of Land Management, Phoenix District, United States Department of the Interior, and Forest Service, Tonto
National Forest, United States Department of Agriculture.




<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Intent to Prepare an EIS; Cyprus Miami Mining Corporation, Claypool, AZ; Proposed Leach Facilities Expansion
Project.







</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Phoenix District Office, and the U.S. Forest Service (USFS), Tonto National
Forest, are preparing a joint Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for proposed expansion of mine facilities of
Cyprus Miami Mining Corporation (CMMC). The mine is located near the Towns of Globe and Miami, in Gila County, Arizona.
CMMC has submitted a proposed Operating Plan (to be processed by BLM as a Mining Plan of Operations (MPO) and by USFS
as a Plan of Operations (POO). The plan proposes to expand the facilities at the existing mine and has been filed with
the BLM and the USFS, as required under the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) and Title V of the Federal Land Policy and
Management Act (FLPMA) of 1976. The BLM and USFS have responsibility for analysis, review, and approval of the mining
plan. Preparation of the EIS will follow the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and Code of Federal Regulations,
title 40, subpart 1500.


The new MPO/POO proposes construction of three new leach facility areas referred to as: (1) The Oxhide leach facility,
(2) the BL leach facility, and (3) the GMC leach facility, together with the required ancillary facilities. The leach
facility areas will be used for the purpose of placement and subsequent leaching of copper-bearing ore mined from
reserves located entirely on lands owned by CMMC. The leach facilities will be constructed partially on federal lands
managed by the USFS and the BLM, and partially on lands solely owned by CMMC (see acreages in ``Supplementary Information
Section'' below). Ore placed on the leach pads will be treated with sulfuric acid leach solution. Copper bearing leach
solutions captured from leach pads will be processed into high quality cathode copper in existing solvent extraction
and electrowinning plants. In addition, an overburden deposition area (called Barney Overburden Site, or Barney
OB) is planned. The overburden deposition area will be constructed to accommodate uneconomic material removed from
the active mining operation. With the proposed expansion it is anticipated that the Oxhide, BL and GMC leach facilities
and Barney OB will operate for the life of the mining operations, which is estimated to be 16 to 20 years.

Written comments relating to the identification of issues should be received by December 17, 1994. 

 


<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

CMMC owns and operates a large open-pit mine and leach operation in the Globe-Miami mining district. The CMMC complex
in Miami also includes a smelter and a rod plant. Approximately 950 people are employed at the Cyprus Miami facility.
Additional surface area is needed for leach pads and associated facilities to ensure the continued and uninterrupted
production of high quality copper cathodes. The mine is located near the Towns of Globe and Miami, Arizona about 65
miles east of Phoenix on State Highway 60. 



Planned activities would take place on a combination of public and private surface and mineral lands. The public lands
include lands managed both by the Tonto National Forest and BLM Phoenix District. Total new disturbance for the Oxhide
pad would be 386 acres (with 329 acres managed by USFS and 5 acres managed by BLM). Total new disturbance for the BL pad
would be 470 acres (with 184 acres managed by BLM and 203 acres managed by USFS). Total new disturbance for the GMC pad
would be 236 acres (114 acres managed by BLM). Total new disturbance for the Barney OB site would be 216 acres (52 acres
managed by BLM and 32 acres managed by USFS). Two stormwater impoundments would be created upstream of the BL pad site
in Little Pinto Canyon and Webster Gulch. Total acres of private and public disturbance for all facilities would be
1,308 acres. Total acres of public land disturbed by all sites would be 919 acres (564 acres managed by USFS and 355 acres
managed by BLM). 

Potential issues may include but may not be limited to surface and groundwater quality, socioeconomics, air quality,
cultural resources, biological resources, visual resources, riparian areas, and mine reclamation. The following
permits or licenses may be required to implement the proposed action: 

Arizona Aquifer Protection Permit (APP) from Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ). 

Section 404 of the Clean Water Act permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE) and Section 401 certification
from ADEQ. 

Modifications to the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit under Section 402 of the Clean
Water Act from ADEQ and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 

Dam Safety Permit from Arizona Department of Water Resources. 

Well installation permits from Arizona Department of Water Resources. 

Approval of modifications to the Air Quality Permit to Operate from ADEQ. 

Approved modifications to the Stormwater Discharge Permit from EPA.

The Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) will be developed by a third party contractor who has been approved by the
BLM and USFS. The contractor will use an interdisciplinary team to develop the document. The BLM and USFS will have
the joint responsibility for the content of the EIS. The comment period for the draft EIS is anticipated to be in the
summer of 1995. The comment period for the final EIS is anticipated to be the winter of 1995.

At this early stage, it is important to give reviewers notice of several court rulings related to public participation
in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft EIS must structure their participation in their review
of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions. 

Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. 

v. 

NRDS

, 435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978). Also, environmental objections that could be raised at the draft EIS stage but that are not
raised until after completion of the final EIS may be waived or dismissed by the courts. 

City of Angoon 

v. 

Hodel

, 803 F.2d 1016, 1022 (9th Cir. 1986) and 

Wisconsin Heritages, Inc. 

v. 

Harris

, 490 F. Supp. 1334 (E.D. Wis. 1980). Because of these court rulings, it is very important that those interested in this
proposed action participate by the close of the comment period so that substantive comments and objections are made
available to the agencies at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the EIS.

To assist the USFS and BLM in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments on the
proposed project should be as specific as possible. Comments may address issues and concerns or the potential alternatives
to be considered in the statement. Reviewers may wish to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality regulations
for implementing the procedural provisions of NEPA at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these points.

Complete records of all phases of the environmental documentation process will be available for public review at
the BLM, Phoenix District Office, and at the Tonto National Forest Supervisor's Office (same as addresses noted above).

Cancellation of an environmental impact statement.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On June 13, 1991, a notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) for the Granite Mountain Timber
Sales, which included the Little Granite, Pebble and Baldy Timber Sales, was published in the 

Federal Register

 (56 FR 27227). The notice of intent was revised on April 15, 1993 in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 19646), in which the Baldy Timber Sale was dropped, and timelines for completion were extended. A Notice of Availability
for the draft EIS was published in the 

Federal Register

 on September 24, 1993 (58 FR 49996). Because of the current emphasis on fire recovery, watershed analysis and the Eastside
Ecosystem Management Project, the notice of intent is being cancelled, and no final EIS will be issued for the project.
The Forest expects to issue a new notice of intent to prepare an EIS for the project area in Spring of 1995.

<DOCTITLE>Changes in the Index Construction and Data Series </DOCTITLE>
of Farm Prices Received and Paid 



<AGENCY>

 National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Notice is hereby given that NASS, USDA, plans to change the construction of the indexes and data series of farm prices
received and paid. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 NASS is updating the weights and changing the construction of its indexes of prices received and paid by farmers. In
conjunction with the new index procedures, additional changes to the prices received and paid data series will be
made as itemized below. All changes will take effect beginning in January 1995 with data published in 

Agricultural Prices

. 



The prices received and paid indexes are used in computing the parity prices that NASS is required by statute to publish
monthly (7 U.S.C. 1301(a)(1)(c)). The base or fixed weights used in constructing the indexes have become outdated
as the mix of commodities farmers produce and input items they purchase have changed and are expected to continue to
change over time. 

Major changes to the weights and construction of the price indexes and to the prices received and paid data series are:


(1) A 1990-92 reference and base period will replace the current 1977 reference and 1971-73 base period.


(2) Five-year moving average weights will replace the current fixed 1971-73 base period weights. 

(3) Monthly marketing weights that reflect seasonal marketing patterns will be added for prices received commodities.


(4) The 36-month (1990-92) average prices used as base period prices for the prices received indexes will be
weighted by monthly volumes of farmers' sales. The current base period (1971-73) prices are simple averages.


(5) The new indexes will be constructed by multiplying the ratios of the current prices to the base period prices by
the moving average weights (adjusted for seasonal marketing patterns for the prices received indexes). 

(6) Crop coverage will be expanded in the prices received indexes, largely for fruits, vegetables, greenhouse/nursery
products, and specialty crops. 

(7) Prices Paid Surveys for feed, fuels, fertilizer, agricultural chemicals, retail seeds, and farm machinery will
be conducted annually in April. The prices paid indexes will still be updated quarterly based on changes in appropriate
Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) component indexes. Prices Paid Surveys for autos and trucks, building materials,
farm supplies, motor supplies, and marketing containers will be discontinued. BLS component indexes will be used
to measure price changes for these and other input items. Feeder livestock price surveys will continue quarterly.


(8) Separate prices paid indexes for crop and livestock farms will be computed and published. 

(9) The 1910-14=100 price indexes required by statute (7 U.S.C. 1301(a)(1)(c)) for computing parity prices
will be determined based on the changes in the new 1990-92=100 indexes. 

Beginning in January 1995, the new 1990-92 indexes will be published monthly in 

Agricultural Prices 

for prices received and quarterly for prices paid. The new 1990-92 based indexes will be constructed back to
1975. The revised 1910-14 indexes and the new 1990-92 indexes covering the 1975-93 period will be
published in a separate release by the end of January 1995. The old 1977 indexes, except for the fresh market fruit and
vegetable and seasonally adjusted prices received indexes, will be available upon request during 1995 but discontinued
thereafter. The fresh market fruit and vegetable indexes and the seasonally adjusted indexes now published for fresh
market fruits, fresh market vegetables, potatoes and dry beans, dairy products, and poultry and eggs will be discontinued
in January 1995. Prices paid estimates for building materials, farm and motor supplies, and new autos and trucks will
no longer be published. 

The changes in the construction of the indexes will simplify updating the component items and reference periods while
maintaining appropriate weights. The new index procedures will provide long-term comparability in computing future
index numbers, reduce respondent burden, and better utilize existing Government data. The overall changes will
not have a significant effect on the levels of the prices received and prices paid indexes, and, therefore, will have
very little effect on the levels of parity prices.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Through Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowships, ``SURFing the Physics Lab: A Partnership for AMO Physics''
will provide an opportunity for the Physics Laboratory of the National Institute of Standards and Technology and
the National Science Foundation to join in partnership with American colleges and universities, stimulating outstanding
physics students to pursue scientific careers by exposing them to the world class atomic, molecular, optical and
radiation physicists and facilities in the NIST Physics Laboratory, and strengthening undergraduate AMO physics
curricula by forming the basis for ongoing collaborations. The NIST program director will work with physics department
chairs and directors of multi-disciplinary centers of excellence to identify outstanding undergraduates (including
graduating seniors) who would benefit from off-campus summer research in an honors academy environment. We recommend
a group of two candidates plus one alternate to be nominated by each institution, although larger or smaller groups
will be given equal consideration. The selected group of about twenty (20) students will spend approximately twelve
(12) weeks at the Physics Laboratory's Gaithersburg, MD campus, working one-on-one with NIST staff physicists;
actively engaged in projects that combine the quest for fundamental knowledge and direct applications to problems
of national importance; learning about non-academic alternatives for research careers; living science and seeing
how they can make a difference. The 12-week stipend for the summer of 1995 will be $3600. Students and NIST research
advisors will be paired based on the student's background and interests in the spring, to allow for adequate dialogue
between the students, the student's physics professors and NIST advisor about the intended project, to ensure that
the student arrives at NIST ready to contribute, and to prepare the student's physics professor for follow-up in the
fall. Good overlap of research interest will facilitate collaborations between NIST and the participating academic
partners. The students will collectively live in a nearby furnished apartment complex and participate in the many
NIST seminars and in a weekly SURFing the Physics Lab Summer Seminar Series. The students will all present a research
seminar at NIST and be encouraged to participate in a local or national scientific conference during the following
academic year. Given the significant lack of diversity in the present physics work force, we will aggressively seek
out competitive students from underrepresented groups or persons with disabilities. Costs for this program (stipend,
travel and housing) will be shared by NIST, NSF and the participating schools.

Catalog of Federal domestic assistance name and number: 11.609_Measurement and Engineering Research and Standards.




Authority 



The Act of March 3, 1901, as amended (15 U.S.C. 278g-l) authorizes the National Institute of Standards and Technology
to expend up to 1 per centum of the funds appropriated for activities of NIST in any fiscal year, as the Director deems
appropriate, for financial assistance awards in the form of cooperative agreements to students at institutions
of higher learning within the United States. These students must show promise as present or future contributors to
the missions of NIST. Cooperative Agreements are awarded to assure continued growth and progress of science and engineering
in the United States, including the encouragement of women and minority students to continue their professional
development. 



Program Description 



The objective of this partnership will build upon a 1993 summer pilot program funded by NIST as a proof of concept and
the 1994 SURFing program partially funded by the NSF Physics Division as a Research Experience for Undergraduates
Site. Of the 40 students involved during the past two years about 40% were Hispanic Americans and 40% were African Americans,
half were women and 1 was legally blind. Between 20 to 50% of the associated student stipends, travel and housing was
provided in cost sharing by the individual participating institutions. 

NIST is the nation's premiere institute for the physical sciences and, as the lead agency for technology transfer,
is providing a strong interface between government, industry, and academia; on-site researchers at NIST come from
a broad range of colleges and industries. Owing to its unique mission to support the U.S. economy by working with industry,
NIST embodies a special science culture, developed from a large and well equipped research staff that enthusiastically
blends programs that address the immediate needs of industry with longer-term research that anticipates future
needs. This occurs in few other places and enables the Physics Laboratory to offer unique research and training opportunities
for undergraduates, providing them a research-rich environment and exposure to state of the art equipment, to scientists
at work and to professional contacts that represent future employment possibilities. 

Attending to the long term needs of many U.S. high-technology industries, NIST's Physics Lab conducts basic research
in the areas of quantum, electron, optical, atomic, molecular, and radiation physics. This is complemented by applied
research devoted to overcoming barriers to the next technological revolution, in which individual atoms and molecules
will serve as the fundamental building blocks of electronic and optical devices. To achieve these goals, staff develop
and utilize highly specialized equipment, such as polarized electron microscopes, scanning tunneling microscopes,
lasers, and x-ray and synchrotrons radiation sources. Research projects can be theoretical or experimental, and
will range in focus from quantum electrodynamics, through trapping atoms and choreographing molecular collisions,
to ionizing radiation. SURFers will work one-on-one with our nation's top physical scientists both from NIST and
from some of our nation's leading, high tech industries. It is anticipated that successful SURFers will move from
a position of reliance on guidance from their research advisors to one of research independence during the twelve
week period. One goal of this partnership is to provide opportunities for our nation's next generation of scientists
and engineers to engage in world class scientific research at NIST, especially in ground breaking areas of emerging
technologies. This carries with it the hope of motivating these individuals to pursue a Ph.D. in physics, and to consider
alternative research careers. SURFing the Physics Lab will attempt to forge partnerships with NSF and with post-secondary
institutions that demonstrate strong, hands-on undergraduate science curricula, especially those with a demonstrated
commitment to the education of women, minorities and students with disabilities. This program will be open to all
U.S. citizens interested in AMO physics. 



Eligibility 



Colleges and universities with degree granting programs in areas of AMO physics. 



Funding Availability 



The NIST Physics Laboratory will commit approximately $50,000 to support cooperative agreements under this program.
The NIST Physics Laboratory's REU Program is supported by NSF at the level of $55,000 per year. The anticipated direct
and indirect cost for stipends, travel and housing and conference attendance for twenty students is about $140,000.
The actual number of awards made under this announcement will depend on the level of cost sharing by our academic partners.




Proposal Review Process 



All proposals will be reviewed by a panel of three NIST scientists appointed by the Program Director. Proposals should
include the following: 

(A) Student Information: (1) Official transcript for each student nominated with a recommended G.P.A. of 3.0 or better;
(2) a personal statement from each student and statement of commitment to participate in the 1995 SURF, including
a description of the student's prioritized research interests; (3) a r&eacute;sum&eacute; for each student; and
(4) two letters of recommendation for each student. All references to student include the proposed alternate. 

(B) Information About the Applicant Institution: (1) Description of the applicant's education and research philosophy,
faculty interests, on-campus research program(s) and opportunities, and overlapping research interests of NIST
and the institution; and (2) a statement addressing issues of academic credit and commitment to cost sharing.

Evaluation Criteria


Evaluation of Student's Academic Ability and Commitment to Program Goals (35%): Includes, but is not limited to,
evaluation of the following: Completed course work; expressed research interest; prior research experience; grade
point average in courses relevant to program; career plans; honors and activities.
Evaluation of Applicant Institution's Commitment to Program Goals (35%): Includes, but is not limited to, evaluation
of the following: Institution's focus on AMO physics; overlap between research interests of the institution and
NIST; emphasis on undergraduate hands-on research; undergraduate participation in research conferences/programs;
on-campus research facilities; involvement in systemic reform at the undergraduate level; past participation
by students/institution in such programs; and commitment to educate women/minorities, and persons with disabilities.
Evaluation of Applicant Institution's Cost Sharing (30%): In the spirit of a true partnership, successful applicants
will be encouraged to contribute matching funds. A suggested level of participation would be to directly cover student
travel (one round trip by common carrier) and housing costs (approximately $1200); a higher level of participation,
such as partial payment of the student's stipend, stated intent to support the participating students at a research
conference, and/or awarding of academic credit, will be given extra merit in the evaluation process.
Award decisions shall be based upon total evaluation score.


Award Period


The 1995 Physics Laboratory SURFing Partnership is anticipated to run between May 29 through August 18, 1995; adjustments
may be made to accommodate specific academic schedules (e.g., running from May 15 through August 4, of awarding a limited
number of 10-week cooperative agreements).


Paperwork Reduction Act


The Standard Form 424 and other Standard Forms in the application kit are subject to the requirements of the Paperwork
Reduction Act and have been approved by OMB under Control Nos. 0348-0043, 0348-0044, 0348-0040,
and 0348-0046.

current or most recent contractors, the Committee has determined 
that the services listed below are suitable for procurement by the 
Federal Government under 41 U.S.C. 46-48c and 41 CFR 51-2.4. 
I certify that the following action will not have a significant 
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The major 
factors considered for this certification were: 
1. The action will not result in any additional reporting, 
recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small entities 
other than the small organizations that will furnish the services 
to the Government.

current contractors for the services. 
3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish 
the services to the Government.

accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41

Committee has determined that the commodities listed below are 
no longer suitable for procurement by the Federal Government under

<DOCTITLE>Record of Decision for Realignment of Naval Training Center Great Lakes, Illinois</DOCTITLE>



Pursuant to section 102(2) of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 and the Council on Environmental
Quality regulations for implementing NEPA procedures (40 CFR 1500-1508), the Department of the Navy announces
its decision to implement realignment of Naval Training Center (NTC) Great Lakes, Illinois. 

In accordance with the legislative requirements of the Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 (Public Law [P.L.]
101-510), the 1993 Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission (BRAC-93) recommended the closure
of NTC Orlando, Florida and NTC San Diego, California. The majority of naval training at these bases will be relocated
to NTC Great Lakes, Illinois. In addition, Naval Technical Training Center (NTTC) Treasure Island, and Combat Systems
Technical Schools Command (CSTC) Mare Island, California, will be closed pursuant to the recommendations of BRAC-93,
with some of the training at these commands relocated to NTC Great Lakes. Also associated with this section is relocation
of the Navy Recruiting Command (COMNAVCRUITCOM) from Washington, DC.

A Draft Environmental Impact Statement was prepared for the action and distributed to Federal, State, and local agencies
and to interested individuals and groups. Public comments and Navy responses to those comments were incorporated
into the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) which was distributed to the public for a review period that
ended on October 15, 1994. This review resulted in a single letter from the Office of the Governor, Illinois State Clearinghouse,
stating that the action is not in conflict with State plans, policies, and priorities.

The realignment will increase the number of average on-board service school students by approximately 2,088 between
1993 and 1998. The number of permanent-party naval personnel necessary to support service and apprentice school
training will increase by approximately 243 over the same period. Twenty-four construction projects are required
to accommodate the realignment at NTC Great Lakes. The projects include upgrades of existing facilities and new construction
to support new functions and increased number of students and permanent-party personnel. All associated construction
and renovation projects addressed in the FEIS will occur at NTC Great Lakes, with the exception of a family housing
project. This project will construct 240 family housing units at the Navy-owned Glenview Annex. Another BRAC-93
decision directed closure of Naval Air Station (NAS) Glenview and allowed for portions of NAS Glenview to be retained
by Navy for the family housing requirements of NTC Great Lakes. 

The Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act waived certain aspects of NEPA such that the environmental analysis
need not consider the no-action alternative (no realignment). Alternative means of accommodating the mandated
BRAC-93 realignment at NTC Great Lakes that were considered and included the use of existing structures and
alternative sites for construction of new facilities. Sites considered at NTC Great Lakes for the new facilities/renovations
avoided environmentally sensitive areas, then were selected based on the following functional considerations:
adequacy of existing structures for the proposed uses, availability of utilities, and proximity of the barracks
to existing and related facilities, such as classrooms and the galley. Glenview Annex is selected as the most environmentally
preferred and functionally desirable alternative considered for the family housing project. 

Construction of the new facilities will convert less than four acres of lawn area to impervious buildings and pavement
surfaces. There will be no significant impacts to surface water or wetlands. With erosion mitigation and through
sedimentation control described in the FEIS in place, any potential for localized decreases in the quality of stormwater
runoff during construction will be minimal and temporary. There will be no significant impacts to groundwater or
potable water resources as a result of the realignment.

The action will cause no significant impact to ambient noise levels or air quality. Localized, temporary impacts
will occur during construction and demolition activities. Compliance with State (Title 35, Section 228) and Federal
regulations, including National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPS), will be achieved during
removal of asbestos-containing materials. NTC Great Lakes is located in a non-attainment area for ozone. An applicability
analysis was performed for air pollutant emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO

X

) and volatile organic material (VOM) in compliance with the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and 1993 final rule for
determining conformity of federal actions to State or Federal Implementation Plans (40 CFR Parts 6, 51, and 93). The
analysis included construction-related emissions, mobile-source emissions, and stationary-source emissions
associated with the realignment. Neither NO

X

 nor VOM emissions estimates for any year of the action exceeded the de minimis levels of 25 tons per year. Therefore,
the action is presumed to conform to the State Implementation Plan (SIP) and is exempted from any further requirements
of the General Conformity Rule.
The action at NTC Great Lakes will not impact any Department of Defense Installation Restoration Program (IRP) sites.
The action will not violate any conditions of the NTC Great Lakes Waste Management Plan or the Spill Prevention Control
and Countermeasures Plan.
A Remedial Investigation is currently underway at Glenview Annex to determine the extent of contamination at an IRP
site (former fire fighting training area) where it intersects the eastern portion of the family housing site. Also,
based on a review of historic aerial photographs as part of the BRAC cleanup plan for the closure of NAS Glenview, the
previous existence of three ordnance magazines and a trap/skeet range may exist on a portion of the new family housing
area. Contaminated soils that exceed regulatory levels will be remediated prior to construction in accordance with
applicable federal and state requirements.
The increase in population from the action will be small in comparison with the existing populations in Lake County
and the Chicago metropolitan area, and will not result in significant impacts to facilities or services on-base or
in the region. The additional economic activity from the action will result in a net positive effect on the local economy.
The action will not significantly impact existing land uses at NTC Great Lakes, in the City of North Chicago, or the
Village of Lake Bluff. The action will provide a net increase of 206 new family housing units at the Glenview Annex family
housing area because 34 units of existing family housing will be replaced. The additional vehicular traffic generated
by the action will not be significant and the cumulative impact is anticipated to be less than 1990 levels.
The action will increase the number of school-aged children by an estimated 312 students, with an estimated 122 students
being dispersed throughout the local communities as a result of naval personnel living off-base. The remaining 190
students are expected to reside in the NAS Glenview family housing. Based on current distribution of naval personnel
living off-base, the 122 additional students will attend schools in the communities surrounding NTC Great Lakes
and the impacts to individual schools will be minimal. Of the 190 students expected to reside at NAS Glenview, it is
estimated that 38 students will attend District 225 schools and the remaining 152 students will attend District 34
schools. District 225 officials consider school capacity to be sufficient and financial impacts to be negligible.
District 34 has indicated that an additional 152 students would have a negative impact on district facilities and
finances, and could require six to seven new classrooms. The school district should receive Federal Impact Aid reimbursement
for lost property taxes for each family residing at Glenview Annex. This will serve to equalize the contribution from
Glenview Annex residents with those of the local community for education support. Additionally, it is expected that
the conversion of much of the currently non-taxable NAS Glenview property to commercial, industrial, office, and
other taxable property will have a positive impact on District 34 revenues.
Utilities at NTC Great Lakes and at the NAS Glenview family housing site have adequate capacity to serve the additional
personnel at both sites. NTC is allowed to discharge up to 10.5 million gallons per day (mgd) to the local wastewater
treatment authority, and the realignment will bring the total NTC discharge to 2.8 mgd. The wastewater treatment
facility serving Glenview Annex has 180 mgd excess capacity, and will be able to accommodate the additional 0.2 mgd
discharge from the Navy family housing units. Police and fire protection services are also adequate to serve the needs
of the new facilities. An expansion of the medical and dental facilities at NTC Great Lakes is programmed to meet the
needs of the additional incoming students and staff population. On-base community and recreational services and
facilities are adequate to serve the needs of the larger population at both NTC Great Lakes and the NAS Glenview family
housing area.
The action will result in no significant impacts to plant or animal species listed as threatened or endangered by either
federal or state agencies. Potential impacts to cultural resources at NTC Great Lakes have been evaluated in compliance
with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). Renovations will be undertaken for four buildings
(Building 4, 177, 178, and 179) in the National Historic District at NTC Great Lakes. However, only building 4 is a contributing
property of major significance within the historic district. All modifications to this building will be approved
by the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency (IHPA) during the early phases of project design. The IHPA has determined
that no significant historic, architectural, or archeological resources are located in the Glenview Annex project
area.
Questions regarding the Draft and Final Environmental Impact Statement prepared for this action may be directed

(Attn: Mr. Robert Teague, Code 203RT), telephone (804) 743-0785, fax (803) 743-0993.

The framework for the Reconfiguration PEIS was described in the January 1991 

Nuclear Weapons Complex Reconfiguration Study

 (Reconfiguration Study), a detailed examination of alternatives for the future Complex. Because of the significant
changes in the world since January 1991, especially with regard to projected future requirements for the United States'
nuclear weapons stockpile, the Department has concluded that the framework described in the Reconfiguration Study
does not exist today. Contributing factors to this conclusion include public comments at the September-October
1993 PEIS scoping meetings, the fact that no new nuclear weapons production is required for the foreseeable future,
budget constraints, and the Department's decision to prepare a separate PEIS on Storage and Disposition of Weapons-Usable
Fissile Nuclear Materials. As a result of these changed circumstances, the Department is proposing to separate the
Reconfiguration PEIS into two PEISs: (1) a Tritium Supply and Recycling PEIS to be completed in November 1995; and
(2) a Stockpile Stewardship and Management PEIS. 


Stockpile stewardship includes activities required to maintain a high level of confidence in the safety, reliability,
and performance of nuclear weapons in the absence of underground testing, and to be prepared to test weapons if directed
by the President. Stockpile management activities include maintenance, evaluation, repair or replacement of weapons
in the existing stockpile. To define a new stockpile stewardship and management proposal, the Department is reviewing
its nuclear weapons complex stockpile stewardship and management activities. This review will take into account
the latest information concerning current and projected future stockpile requirements. To assist the Department
in defining a new proposal, the Department intends to hold a public meeting in early 1995 to receive comments on how
to conduct the scoping process for the Stockpile Stewardship and Management PEIS, and to have preliminary discussions
on potential alternatives. This will be followed by public scoping meetings later in 1995. 
In the meantime, the Department will continue to evaluate alternatives for tritium supply and recycling in a Tritium
Supply and Recycling PEIS. While the focus of this PEIS will be on alternatives for a long-term, assured supply of tritium,
the PEIS also will include an assessment of the environmental and institutional impacts associated with using one
or more commercial light water reactors for tritium production as a contingency in the event of a national emergency.
Specific commercial reactors will not be identified in this PEIS. 
The purpose of this notice is to provide the public with an update regarding DOE's intentions for National Environmental
Policy Act (NEPA) review of elements of the future Complex, and to request comments on the Tritium Supply and Recycling
PEIS proposal. An Implementation Plan (IP) for the Tritium Supply and Recycling PEIS will be issued after comments
on this notice have been received and considered. The IP will explain more fully the scope of the Tritium Supply and
Recycling PEIS.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background


In January 1991, the goal of the Reconfiguration program was, as it is now, to make the Complex smaller, less diverse,
and less costly to operate. At the time, the projected production levels were much smaller than historic levels, but
much larger than they are today. The document that provided the framework for the original proposal was the January
1991 Reconfiguration Study. That document was the result of many months of effort by a task force which thoroughly
reviewed the status and capabilities of the weapons complex against projected future requirements. As a result of
that effort, the Department envisioned that the future Complex would consist of fewer sites, and that missions might
be relocated to achieve consolidation, greater efficiency, and significant long-term cost savings. Indeed, as
a result of the Secretary's decision last year approving the nonnuclear consolidation proposal (which had been separated
from the original Reconfiguration PEIS effort), weapons complex functions will be terminated at three sites and
significant cost savings will be achieved within a short period of time. 
The purpose of the Reconfiguration PEIS was to establish the locations for the future weapons complex missions. It
was envisioned that, once future mission locations were established through the PEIS process, project-specific
environmental analyses would follow the PEIS and cover in detail the projects necessary to implement the PEIS decisions
at each site. 
Within the Reconfiguration PEIS scope, potential relocation and consolidation of the ``nuclear'' missions of the
complex (i.e., plutonium and uranium component fabrication and processing, weapons assembly and disassembly,
tritium supply and recycling, and fissile materials storage) were being analyzed. In order to relocate any of these
missions at the assumed levels of production, major new construction would have been required, entailing significant
(billions of dollars) ``up-front'' cost with a ``pay-back'' period significantly longer than for nonnuclear consolidation.

With the end of the Cold War, the projected long hiatus in the need for new nuclear weapons production, and the budget
constraints that are anticipated to continue for the foreseeable future, the framework presented in the January
1991 Reconfiguration Study no longer fits current circumstances or supports any realistic proposal for reconfiguration
of the nuclear weapons complex. Therefore, the Department intends to separate the Reconfiguration proposal into
two parts, and will prepare a PEIS on each part. The first PEIS is the Tritium Supply and Recycling PEIS, which will address
the need for tritium. The second is the Stockpile Stewardship and Management PEIS, which will address the rest of the
complex. 
To assist in the development of a Stockpile Stewardship and Management proposal, the Department intends to involve
stakeholders in early 1995 through a meeting in advance of formal scoping. The goal of this approach is to enable stakeholders
to have an active role in developing the Stockpile Stewardship and Management proposal, rather than reacting to a
proposal developed solely by the Department. The Department expects to develop a proposal after this initial meeting,
and to issue a Notice of Intent before public scoping meetings later in 1995. 
The Department currently has no capability for the production of tritium, which decays at a rate of approximately
five percent per year, and which is required for every active weapon in the stockpile. Current projections indicate
that new tritium is required to be available in the 2011-2015 time frame. Depending upon the alternative selected,
it could take up to fifteen years or more for a tritium source, once selected, to begin producing tritium. Not only is
planning for a new, assured tritium supply required to begin now to meet projected stockpile requirements, but the
Department must meet a statutory deadline of March 1, 1995, to issue a PEIS addressing tritium supply alternatives.
Therefore, the Department intends to separate the tritium supply and recycling alternatives from the future Stockpile
Stewardship and Management proposal. The following discussion outlines the history of the Reconfiguration program,
and the current proposal for tritium supply and recycling. 


Original Reconfiguration Plan (February 1991 to July 1993) 


An NOI to prepare a PEIS for Reconfiguration of the Nuclear Weapons Complex was published in the 

Federal Register

 on February 11, 1991 (56 FR 5590). That NOI proposed to study the options presented in the Nuclear Weapons Complex Reconfiguration
Study (DOE/DP-0083) of January 1991. A series of 15 public scoping meetings were held around the country to solicit
comments regarding the Reconfiguration proposal. At that time, alternatives for a new tritium supply facility were
being evaluated in a separate New Production Reactor (NPR) Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). In November 1991,
however, in response to nuclear weapons stockpile reductions which delayed the need for a new tritium supply facility,
the then Secretary of Energy announced that the analysis of NPR alternatives would be incorporated into the Reconfiguration
PEIS. 
An IP for the Reconfiguration PEIS was published in February 1992. The IP summarized the comments received during
scoping, including incorporation of the NPR analysis into Reconfiguration, described the scope of the Reconfiguration
program, the alternatives that were to be evaluated, and the methodology for preparing the PEIS.

Program Changes (July 1993 to April 1994) 


After the publication of the original IP in February 1992, additional major reductions in the nuclear weapons stockpile
resulted in significant program changes. As a result of these changes, a revised NOI for the PEIS was published in the


Federal Register

 on July 23, 1993 (58 FR 39528). Changes in the scope of the Reconfiguration PEIS reflected the fact that the future Complex
could be smaller and more integrated than previously envisioned, and placed increased importance on stewardship
of existing special nuclear materials. 
During the public scoping period from July-October 1993, many members of the public questioned why the Department
planned to analyze new nuclear weapon facilities in general, and new nuclear weapon component fabrication facilities
in particular, given the lack of requirements for new nuclear weapons and an otherwise limited workload. There was
a perception among many members of the public that evaluation of new facilities in the PEIS indicated an intention
to construct those facilities in a predetermined time frame. Based upon this feedback, and a resulting reevaluation
of known and projected requirements for weapons complex work for the next decade, the Department believes that the
lack of any foreseeable need for new nuclear weapons, together with higher priority budget needs (both for the Department
and the Nation), make it unnecessary and inappropriate to consider most types of new weapons production facilities,
except for tritium facilities, at this time. Moreover, the Department has been directed, both by the President and
the Congress, to establish a program for maintaining the safety and reliability of the nuclear weapons stockpile
without nuclear testing. This new program, entitled Stockpile Stewardship, is expected to require new diagnostic
facilities and capabilities. As described above, efforts to formulate a new proposal for Stockpile Stewardship
and Management will be initiated in 1995. 
In addition, a new, separate project has been initiated by the Secretary of Energy to consider alternatives for: (1)
long-term storage of separated fissile nuclear materials (primarily plutonium and highly enriched uranium), whether
stored for defense purposes or surplus to defense needs; and (2) disposition of surplus fissile nuclear materials.
The environmental impacts associated with these options are being analyzed in the Storage and Disposition of Weapons-Usable
Fissile Nuclear Materials PEIS, currently in preparation. The establishment of that project has further reduced
the scope of the previously-envisioned Reconfiguration PEIS. 


Current Proposal for Tritium Supply and Recycling 


The proposal for tritium supply and recycling includes the evaluation of technology and siting alternatives. The
Department intends to identify a preferred technology and siting alternative in the Draft Tritium Supply and Recycling
PEIS. Four different technologies to supply tritium in a new facility will be assessed in the PEIS: Heavy Water Reactor
(HWR); Modular High Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactor (MHTGR); Advanced Light Water Reactor (ALWR) [both a large reactor
design and a smaller reactor design]; and Accelerator Production of Tritium (APT). 
Currently, five candidate sites are being considered for new tritium facilities: the Idaho National Engineering
Laboratory (INEL); the Nevada Test Site (NTS); the Oak Ridge Reservation (ORR) in Tennessee; the Pantex Plant near
Amarillo, Texas; and the Savannah River Site (SRS) in South Carolina. 
The tritium recycling mission includes removing, separating, and purifying tritium gas contained in tritium reservoirs
from returned weapons, receiving new tritium from the tritium supply plant, blending the recycled tritium and the
new tritium, and loading the tritium mixture into new or used reservoirs for shipment to the Pantex Plant for weapons
assembly operations. Currently, tritium recycling is conducted at SRS. If a new tritium supply facility were to be
located at SRS, tritium recycling would stay at SRS and be upgraded. If a tritium supply facility were constructed
elsewhere, either a new tritium recycling facility would be collocated with it and the facilities at SRS phased out
(thus terminating the defense mission at SRS), or the tritium recycling facilities at SRS would be upgraded. No-action
alternatives for each of the sites where tritium facilities may be located will provide a baseline for comparison
of the environmental impacts. 
Additionally, the Department intends to include, in the Tritium Supply and Recycling PEIS, an assessment of the environmental
and institutional impacts associated with using one or more commercial light water reactors for tritium production
as a contingency in the event of a national emergency.

While the purpose of the Tritium Supply and Recycling PEIS is focused on assessing the reasonable alternatives for
a government-owned, long-term, assured supply of tritium, programmatic NEPA coverage of this contingency option,
which would only be needed in the event of a national emergency, would ensure that the public is informed of the Department's
overall planning for meeting tritium requirements_both contingency (until a long-term, assured source is on line)
and long-term. This analysis would be generic and would not identify any specific commercial reactors that might
be used if such an option were ever required to be implemented. 
An IP for the Tritium Supply and Recycling PEIS, to be issued after comments on this notice have been received and reviewed,
will explain more fully the scope of the PEIS. 


Public Involvement 


The Department's initiatives for further public involvement in the Tritium Supply and Recycling PEIS are intended
to provide the public complete, accurate, and timely information, and to facilitate effective participation in
the NEPA process. The initiatives include a series of fact sheets describing various aspects of the Tritium Supply
and Recycling PEIS as well as other program activities. These fact sheets will be mailed to those on the program mailing
list throughout the remainder of 1994 and 1995. To provide substantial opportunities for feedback to the Department,
the initiatives include the use of a toll-free telephone number; placement of program information, including this
notice, on an electronic bulletin board to enable comments and feedback to be transmitted electronically; and a speakers
bureau to fulfill requests for DOE officials to speak with the public. In addition, once the Tritium Supply and Recycling
draft PEIS is published, the public will be invited to review and comment on the document. During the comment period,
the Department will conduct a series of interactive workshops to provide further explanation of information in the
document and to provide the public with an opportunity to present comments, questions, and concerns, and to discuss
them with DOE officials. 
DOE is in the process of updating the mailing list for the Tritium Supply and Recycling program and the Stockpile Stewardship
and Management program. A fact sheet on this notice, along with a mailback response form, is being sent to all those
on the current Reconfiguration mailing list. The purpose of the mailback response form is to allow individuals and
organizations to indicate their continuing interest in receiving information regarding either the Tritium Supply
and Recycling program or the Stockpile Stewardship and Management program. Interested parties wishing to remain
on the mailing list for either the Tritium Supply and Recycling program or the Stockpile Stewardship and Management
program must complete and return the mailback response form or call 1-800-776-2765 with the same
request. 


Environmental Issues 


The Tritium Supply and Recycling PEIS will identify and analyze direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts resulting
from the tritium supply and recycling alternatives. These include potential impacts from constructing and operating
the proposed facilities, including: impacts to air quality, water resources, plants and animals, land use, historic
resources, archaeological sites; socioeconomic impacts; impacts associated with generating radiological and
nonradiological wastes; impacts associated with transporting radioactive materials; and the potential consequences
of both normal and accidental radiological and nonradiological releases on the public and worker health and safety.



Tritium Supply and Recycling PEIS Schedule 


The IP for the Tritium Supply and Recycling PEIS will be completed after comments on this announcement have been considered.
It is expected to be completed in January 1995. The Draft Tritium Supply and Recycling PEIS, which will include preferred
alternatives for tritium supply and recycling functions, will be completed no later than March 1, 1995. Following
the publication of the Draft Tritium Supply and Recycling PEIS, public hearings (interactive workshops) will be
held, and a Final Tritium Supply and Recycling PEIS is expected to be completed by November 1995. 


Tritium Supply and Recycling Decisions 


No sooner than 30 days after issuance of the Final Tritium Supply and Recycling PEIS, DOE will issue a Record of Decision
(ROD) to document its decisions. The ROD will explain how DOE has balanced environmental considerations against
other relevant factors, such as economic and technical considerations, and the Department's statutory mission,
in reaching its decision. Following the ROD, project-specific NEPA documents will be prepared as necessary to support
actual implementation of the ROD.

Natural, Columbia Gas and Columbia Gulf (the parties) propose to abandon an exchange service performed under Natural's
Rate Schedule X-124, Columbia Gas' Rate Schedule X-106 and Columbia Gulf's Rate Schedule X-80,
jointly authorized in Docket Nos. CP80-432 and CP81-185, as amended.

3

 It is stated that pursuant to a natural gas exchange and interim transportation agreement dated June 25, 1980, up to
8,000 Mcf of gas per day of Natural's gas produced in Vermilion Blocks 277 and 287 and East Cameron Block 354, all offshore
Louisiana, is exchanged with Columbia Gas, gas produced in South Marsh Island Block 265, offshore Louisiana. 




It is explained that the agreement provides for Columbia Gas to make available its South Marsh Island Block 265 gas
to Natural, via ANR Pipeline Company (ANR),

4

 in South Marsh Island Block 265. In exchange, Natural delivers: (1) its Vermilion Blocks 277 and 287 gas to Columbia

Comment date

: November 9, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice. 



2. ANR Pipeline Company 


[Docket No. CP95-20-000] 


Take notice that on October 13, 1994, ANR Pipeline Company (ANR), 500 Renaissance Center, Detroit, Michigan 48243-1902,
filed in Docket No. CP95-20-000 a request pursuant to Sections 157.205 and 157.216(b) of the Commission's
Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205 and 157.216(b)) for authorization to abandon the South Stevens
Point Meter Station located in Portage County, Wisconsin, under the blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82-480-000,
pursuant to Section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request which is on file with the Commission
and open to public inspection. 
ANR is seeking abandonment authority because the station consists of two, 8-inch orifice meters which are oversized
for the present volume demand. ANR proposes to abandon the South Stevens Point Meter Station because to use the station
would require unnecessary and expensive downsizing to provide accurate measurement. In Docket No. CP94-713-000,
ANR proposes to construct a new interconnection (Rosholt Interconnection) to provide continued service to Wisconsin
Public Service Corporation (Public Service). ANR will continue to provide service through the South Stevens Point
Meter Station until the new Rosholt Interconnection is in place and in service. ANR states that the abandonment will
not result in any interruption of service. Public Service is the only customer served by this meter station. The cost
of the facilities to be abandoned is approximately $61,000. 


Comment date: 

December 5, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph G at the end of this notice. 


3. Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company 


[Docket No. CP95-21-000] 
 


Take notice that on October 14, 1994, Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company (Panhandle), P.O. Box 1642, Houston, Texas
77001, filed an application pursuant to Section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act for authority to abandon by sale to Anadarko
Gathering Company (AGC) a portion of Panhandle's pipeline and compressor facilities located in Seward, Morton and
Stevens Counties, Kansas and Texas County, Oklahoma, and located west of its Liberal Compressor Station, and to abandon
by transfer to Panhandle Field Services Company (Field Services), its subsidiary, 10 units of a compressor station
located in Morton County, Kansas, all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission
and open to public inspection.

<TEXT>
 

Panhandle states that, in a further effort to improve the jurisdictional pipeline operations of the facilities located
west of its Haven, Kansas Compressor Station, the abandonment proposed herein would enable Panhandle to streamline
its jurisdictional operations, to reduce its existing transportation rates and to assure producers and shippers
that gathering services in the future would not only continue to be available but would be provided on a more efficient
and competitive basis. 
Panhandle proposes to abandon by sale to AGC approximately 126 miles of pipeline, ranging in size of 6-inch to 26-inch
in diameter, 7 compressor stations, and 8 measuring and regulating stations, as more fully described in Exhibits
Z-1 and Z-2 of its application. Panhandle states that the facilities would be sold at the book value of the facilities,
$22,700,000. Panhandle also states that, in addition to the purchase price, AGC has also agreed to pay Panhandle $4.0
million to cover environmental-related costs and $1.3 million to cover the costs associated with the modifications
to the Elkhart Station. 
It is indicated that Panhandle states that the purchase of its Hugoton Area facilities by AGC, who currently has a gathering
system in a portion of the Hugoton Area, the HUGS System, would eliminate the need for the further construction by AGC
of duplicative facilities and would allow Panhandle to continue its effort to utilize and operate its system in the
most efficient manner and in an effort to continue providing the best service it can to its customers. Panhandle further
states that the authorization of the abandonment would serve the public interest by reducing jurisdictional rate
base and related cost of service, thereby having an impact on Panhandle's current Field Zone transmission rates.

Panhandle also proposes to abandon by transfer to Field Services 10 units at the Elkhart Compressor Station located
in Morton County, Kansas. Panhandle indicates that, if the remaining units at the station were not transferred to
Field Services, they would become a non-contiguous isolated compressor station in the middle of gathering systems
operated by AGC and Field Services. Panhandle states that these facilities would be transferred to Field Services
at the net book value of those facilities, $1,472,440. 


Comment date: 

November 9, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice. 



4. Anadarko Gathering Company


[Docket No. CP95-22-000] 


Take notice that on October 14, 1994, Anadarko Gathering Company (AGC), 17001 Northchase Drive, Houston, Texas 77251,
filed a petition for declaratory order in Docket No. CP95-22-000, as supplemented on October 17, 1994,
requesting that the Commission declare that AGC's proposed acquisition, ownership, and operation of certain natural
gas gathering systems and other facilities currently owned by Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company (Panhandle) would
not subject AGC or any portion of its facilities or services to the jurisdiction under the Natural Gas Act (NGA), all
as more fully set forth in the petition which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. 
 
AGC seeks a declaratory order finding that: 
 The facilities described in its petition that AGC wishes to acquire from Panhandle will be gathering facilities
exempt from the Commission's jurisdiction pursuant to Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act; 
 AGC will not be a ``natural gas company'' pursuant to Section 2 of the Natural Gas Act by virtue of its proposed
acquisition, ownership, and operation of such facilities; 
 The gathering services to be performed by AGC will be non-jurisdictional gathering services exempt from the
Commission's jurisdiction under Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act; and 
 AGC's rates, and charges for gathering services will not be subject to the Commission's jurisdiction pursuant
to Sections 4 and 5 of the Natural Gas Act. 
AGC states that it is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko). AGC indicates that
it would acquire facilities directly from Panhandle as well as facilities currently owned by Panhandle but proposed
in Docket No. CP94-151-000 to be transferred to Panhandle Field Services Company, Panhandle's affiliate.


 

It is indicated that recently Panhandle and AGC (APC) concluded negotiations concerning the sale to AGC of Panhandle's
Hugoton System. It is indicated that AGC's affiliate, Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko) produces approximately
76 percent of the natural gas connected to the subject facilities. AGC states that, subsequent to the transfer of facilities
by Panhandle, it would upgrade the subject facilities to maximize productive capacities of the wells connected to
the system. AGC also indicates that it would offer continuity of service to all existing gathering customers. 
It is argued that the facilities to be transferred to AGC meet the physical and non-physical criteria for determining
gathering as set forth in 

Farmland Industries, Inc., 

23 FERC   61.063 (1983), as modified by subsequent Commission orders. AGC states that the vast majority of the
1,147 miles of pipe are short in length and range from 2 to 26 inches in diameter, with 71 percent being 10 inches or less
in diameter. AGC indicates that of the 29 percent of the facilities 12 inches in diameter or larger, all but 31 miles
of the pipe are located behind field booster stations. AGC also indicates that the 31 miles of pipe on the discharge
side of the Hugoton Compressor Station still serve to aggregate area gas production. Also, AGC submits that all of
the facilities are located upstream of the Liberal Compressor Station, which it indicates is the central point in
the field. 
In addition, AGC states that virtually all of the gathering systems are web-like or rib-like in configuration, with
the facilities being located in a production area forming a network of short-length pipelines originating at wells
and connecting to aggregation points. It is also indicated that the gathering facilities contain a total of 57 field
booster compressor stations. AGC indicates that the suction pressures of the booster stations range from 30 to 375
psig, with 46 of the 57 stations having a suction pressure of less than 100 psig. AGC also states that wells are located
all along the facilities. With respect to the operating pressure of the lines, a review of the operational pressures
reveals that 87 percent of the pipelines operate below 100 psig, 10 percent operate above 100 psig but less than 450
psig, and 31 miles of pipe operate at above 450 psig. 

With respect to the non-physical criteria, AGC notes that Anadarko, its affiliate is primarily engaged in the exploration
and production of natural gas and petroleum, with a working interest in 833 wells attached to the subject facilities.
AGC also indicates that substantial effort would be expended to upgrade the gathering facilities to maximize the
efficient production on natural gas benefitting both producers with wells connected to the gathering facilities
and consumers consistent with the objectives of the NGA, Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, and the Commission's Order
No. 636. 
AGC requests that its petition be consolidated with Panhandle's abandonment application filed in Docket No. CP95-21-000
which involves the abandonment by sale to Anadarko of a portion of the facilities at issue in AGC's petition. 


Comment date: 

November 18, 1994, in accordance with the first paragraph of Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice. 


5. Panhandle Field Services Company


[Docket No. CP95-23-000]


Take notice that on October 14, 1994, Panhandle Field Services Company (Field Services), 5400 Westheimer Court,
Houston, Texas 77056-5310 filed a petition for declaratory order in Docket No. CP95-23-000, requesting
that the Commission disclaim jurisdiction over services to be performed by Field Services involving facilities
to be acquired from its affiliate, Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company (Panhandle), all as more fully set forth in
the petition which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. 
 
Field Services seeks a declaratory order finding that: 
 Panhandle's South Elkhart Station and related facilities in Morton County, Kansas are facilities to be used
for the gathering of natural gas and therefore exempt from the Commission's jurisdiction pursuant to Section 1(b)
of the Natural Gas Act; 
 Field Services will not be a ``natural gas company'' pursuant to Section 2(6) of the Natural Gas Act by virtue
of its proposed acquisition, ownership, and operation of such facilities; 
 Field Services' rates, and charges for gathering services will not be subject to the Commission's jurisdiction
pursuant to Sections 4 and 5 of the Natural Gas Act. 
Field Services states that it is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Panhandle and that the facilities at issue in this petition
are the subject of Panhandle's abandonment application filed in Docket No. CP95-21-000.

It is indicated that recently Panhandle and Anadarko Gathering Company (AGC) concluded negotiations concerning
the sale to AGC of Panhandle's Hugoton System. Field Services states that the sale of the Hugoton System to AGC includes
a portion of the Elkhart Compressor Station in Kansas. It is stated that Panhandle proposes to sell a part of the Elkhart
Station facilities to AGC and the remainder would be transferred to Field Services with Field Services operating
its portion of the Elkhart Station facilities in conjunction with the other gathering facilities it is acquiring
from Panhandle. 
It is also stated that, as currently configured, the Elkhart Station is located in Morton County, Kansas immediately
downstream of gathering facilities which are the subject of the Panhandle and Field Services' filings in Docket Nos.
CP94-151-000 and CP94-152-000, respectively. Field Services indicates that the Elkhart
Station is divided by a county road, but the two portions are currently integrated. It is also stated that, as a result
of the sale of the Panhandle Hugoton System to AGC, Panhandle proposes to split the Elkhart Station between AGC and
Field Services. It is indicated that Panhandle would transfer the portion south of the county road, consisting of
four 1,028 horsepower two-stage skid-mounted compressors and six 1,100 horsepower single-stage block-mounted
compressors, to Field Services. Field Services states that these facilities compress the gas gathered on the Elkhart
Gathering System for delivery into the 24-inch line to be transferred to AGC. Field Services states that the portion
of the facilities located north of the county road, consisting of one 3,162 horsepower four-stage compressor, would
be transferred to AGC. 
Field Services states that, subsequent to the transfer of facilities by Panhandle, significant modifications would
be undertaken to separate completely the operation of the South Elkhart Station from the North Elkhart Station so
that the two would be operated independently and would no longer be integrated. It is also indicated that, upon the
transfer of the Panhandle Hugoton Gathering System to AGC and the transfer of the remaining gathering to Field Services,
the South Elkhart Station would not be contiguous with any other facilities owned or operated by Panhandle. 


Field Services argues that, as a matter of law, the facilities to be transferred to Field Services are within the gathering
and production exemption of Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act because; and that, after the reconfiguration of facilities,
the sole function of the South Elkhart Station would be to boost the pressure of the gas produced behind the station
from a suction pressure of 50 psig to a pressure high enough (450 psig) so that the gas can be delivered into the 24-inch
discharge line.

<DOCTITLE>Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation; Notice of Petition To Amend </DOCTITLE>



Dated: October 24, 1994. 




Take notice that on October 20, 1994, Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation (TGPL), P.O. Box 1396, Houston,
Texas 77251, filed an application with the Commission in Docket No. CP74-33-015 pursuant to Section 7(c)
of the Natural Gas Act (NGA) for authorization to recomplete an existing well as an injection/withdrawal well and
connect the well to the Washington Storage Field
 in St. Landry Parish, Louisiana, all as more fully set forth in the application on file which is open to the public for
inspection. 





TGPL proposes to recomplete Well No. 62 as an injection/withdrawal well into the main storage reservoir and connect
the well to the Washington Storage Field with approximately 3,800 feet of 4-inch diameter pipe. TGPL states that the
proposed recompletion of Well No. 62 would not increase the injection, withdrawal, or storage capacity of TGPL's
Washington Storage Field above currently certificated levels; rather it would replace the decline in deliverability
from certain existing wells in the field that has occurred over time. TGPL states that the proposed recompletion of
Well No. 62 would restore physical operational flexibility to better serve its FERC Rate Schedule WSS storage customers.
TGPL estimates that it would cost $337,765 to recomplete Well No. 62. 

Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before November
14, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest
in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211)
and the Regulations under the NGA (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in
determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding.
Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion
to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. 

Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction conferred upon the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by Sections 7 and 15 of the NGA and the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure,
a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application if no motion
to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter finds that a
grant of the certificate is required by the public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene is
timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further notice of such
hearing will be duly given. 

Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for TGPL to appear or be
represented at the hearing.

Notice of required determinations, contract provisions and opportunity to comment:

 The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (``CERCLA'') as amended, (commonly

site events. The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requires that EPA provide requested information to other parties.
EPA has entered into a contract, No. 68-W9-0020, with ``E & E'' for enforcement and FOIA support services.
EPA Region 9 has determined that disclosure of CBI to ``E & E'' is necessary in order that they may carry out the work
required by that contract with EPA. The contract complies with all requirements of 40 CFR 2.301(h)(2)(ii), incorporated
by reference into 40 CFR 2.310(h)(2). EPA Region 9 will require that each ``E & E'' employee sign a written agreement
that he or she: (1) will use the information only for the purpose of carrying out the work required by the contract, (2)
shall refrain from disclosing the information to anyone other than EPA without the prior written approval of each
affected business or of an EPA legal office, and (3) shall return to EPA all copies of the information (and any abstracts
or extracts therefrom) upon request from the EPA program office, whenever the information is no longer required by
``E & E'' for performance of the work required by the contract. These nondisclosure statements shall be maintained
on file with the Project Officer. ``E & E'' employees will be trained on Superfund CBI requirements.



EPA hereby advises affected parties that they have ten working days to comment pursuant to 40 CFR 2.301(b)(2)(ii),

<DOCTITLE>The State of New Jersey; Partial Program Adequacy Determination of State Municipal Solid Waste Permit Program </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of tentative determination on Partial Program Application of the State of New Jersey for Partial Program Adequacy
Determination, Public Hearing and Public Comment Period.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Section 4005(c)(1)(B) of the Resource Conservation Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste
Amendments (HSWA) of 1984, requires States to develop and implement permit programs to ensure that municipal solid
waste landfills (MSWLFs) which may receive hazardous household waste or small quantity generator waste will comply
with the revised Federal MSWLF Criteria (40 CFR part 258). RCRA Section 4005(c)(1)(C) requires the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) to determine whether States have adequate ``permit'' programs for MSWLFs, but does not mandate
issuance of a rule for such determinations. EPA has drafted and is in the process of proposing a State/Tribe Implementation
Rule (STIR) that will provide procedures by which EPA will approve, or partially approve, State/Tribal landfill
permit programs. The Agency has been approving and intends to continue approving adequate State/Tribal MSWLF permit
programs as applications are submitted. Thus, these approvals are not dependent on final promulgation of the STIR.
Prior to promulgation of STIR, adequacy determinations will be made based on the statutory authorities and requirements.
In addition, States/Tribes may use the draft STIR as an aid in interpreting these requirements. The Agency believes
that early approvals have an important benefit. Approved State/Tribe permit programs provide for interaction between
State/Tribe and the owner/operator regarding site-specific permit conditions. Only those owners/operators located
in States/Tribes with approved permit programs can use the site-specific flexibility provided by part 258 to the
extent the State/Tribal permit program allows such flexibility. EPA notes that regardless of the approval status
of a State/Tribe and the permit status of any facility, the federal landfill criteria will apply to all permitted and
unpermitted MSWLF facilities. 


The State of New Jersey applied for a partial determination of adequacy under section 4005 of RCRA. EPA reviewed New
Jersey's application and certain amendments and revisions thereto, and made a tentative determination that all
portions of New Jersey's MSWLF permit program are adequate to assure compliance with the revised MSWLF Criteria,
except for Subpart E relating to Ground-Water Monitoring and Corrective Action. New Jersey plans to revise the remainder
of its permit program to assure complete compliance with the revised MSWLF Criteria and gain full program approval.
New Jersey's application for partial program adequacy determination is available for public review and comment.

Although RCRA does not require EPA to hold a hearing on any determination to approve a State/Tribe's MSWLF program,
the Region has scheduled an opportunity for a public hearing on this tentative determination. Details appear below
in the 

DATES 

section.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
A. Background 


On October 9, 1991, EPA promulgated revised Criteria for MSWLFs (40 CFR part 258). Subtitle D of RCRA, as amended by
the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), requires States to develop permitting programs to ensure
that MSWLFs comply with the Federal Criteria under part 258. Subtitle D also requires in section 4005 that EPA determine
that State municipal solid waste landfill permit programs are adequate to comply with the revised Federal Criteria.
To fulfill this requirement, the Agency has drafted and is in the process of proposing a State/Tribal Implementation
Rule (STIR). The rule will specify the requirements which State/Tribal programs must satisfy to be determined adequate.

EPA intends to propose in STIR to allow partial approvals if: (1) The Regional Administrator determines that the State/Tribal
permit program largely meets the requirements for ensuring compliance with part 258; (2) changes limited to a narrow
part(s) of the State/Tribal permit program are needed to meet these requirements; and (3) provisions not included
in the partially approved portions of the State/Tribal permit program are a clearly identifiable and a separable
subset of part 258. These requirements, if promulgated, will address the potential problems posed by the dual State/Tribal
and Federal programs that came into effect in October 1993 in those States/Tribes that only have partial approvals
of their MSWLF programs. On that date, Federal rules covering any portion of a State/Tribe's program that had not received
EPA approval became enforceable. Owners and operators of MSWLFs subject to such dual programs must be able to understand
which requirements apply and comply with them. In addition, the pieces of the Federal program that are in effect must
mesh well enough with the approved portions of the State/Tribal program to leave no significant gaps in regulatory
control of MSWLF's. Partial approval will allow the Agency to approve those provisions of the State/Tribal permit
program that meet the requirements and provide the State/Tribe time to make necessary changes to the remaining portions
of its program. As a result, owners/operators will be able to work with the State/Tribal permitting agency to take
advantage of the Criteria's flexibility for those portions of the program which have been approved.

As provided in the October 9, 1991 municipal landfill rule, EPA's national Subtitle D standards took effect on October
9, 1993. Consequently, any remaining portions of the Federal Criteria that are not included in an approved State/Tribal
program apply directly to the owner/operator without the flexibility that would be present in an approved State/Tribal
program. 
EPA has been approving and intends to continue approving State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs prior to the promulgation
of STIR. EPA interprets the requirements for States or Tribes to develop ``adequate'' programs for permits or other
forms of prior approval to impose several minimum requirements. First, each State/Tribe must have enforceable standards
for new and existing MSWLFs that are technically comparable to EPA's revised MSWLF criteria. Next, the State/Tribe
must have the authority to issue a permit or other notice of prior approval to all new and existing MSWLFs in its jurisdiction.
The State/Tribe also must provide for public participation in permit issuance and enforcement as required in section
7004(b) of RCRA. Finally, EPA believes that the State/Tribe must show that it has sufficient compliance monitoring
and enforcement authorities to take specific action against any owner or operator that fails to comply with an approved
MSWLF program. 
EPA Regions will determine whether a State/Tribe has submitted an ``Adequate'' program based on the interpretation
outlined above. EPA plans to provide more specific criteria for this evaluation when it proposes the State/Tribal
Implementation Rule. EPA expects States/Tribes to meet all of these requirements for all elements of a MSWLF program
before it gives full approval to a MSWLF program. Various components of authority and capability were submitted by
New Jersey in its application for partial program approval, and the revisions and amendments thereto. 
EPA also is requesting States/Tribes seeking partial program approval to provide a schedule for the submittal of
all remaining portions of their MSWLF permit programs. EPA notes that it intends to propose to make submission of a
schedule mandatory in STIR. 
Not all States/Tribes will have existing permit programs through which they can ensure compliance with all provisions
of the revised Federal Criteria. Were EPA to restrict a State/Tribe from submitting its application until it could
ensure compliance with the entirety of 40 CFR part 258, many States/Tribes would need to postpone obtaining approval
of their permit programs for a significant amount of time. This delay in determining the adequacy of the State/Tribal
permit program while the State/Tribe revises its statutes or regulations could impose a substantial burden on owners
and operators of landfills because the State/Tribe would be unable to exercise the flexibility available to States/Tribes
with permit programs which have been approved as adequate. 
As a State's/Tribe's regulations and statutes are amended to comply with the federal MSWLF landfill regulations,
unapproved portions of a partially approved MSWLF permit program may be approved by the EPA. The State/Tribe may submit
an amended application to EPA for review and an adequacy determination will be made using the same criteria as for the
initial application. This adequacy determination will be published in the 

Federal Register

 summarizing the Agency's decision and the portion(s) of the State/Tribal MSWLF permit program affected and providing
an opportunity to comment for a period of 30 days. The adequacy determination will become effective sixty (60) days
following publication if no adverse comments are received. If EPA receives adverse comments on its adequacy determination,
another 

Federal Register

 notice will be published either affirming or reversing the initial decision and responding to the public comments.



B. State of New Jersey 


On March 3, 1994, the State of New Jersey submitted an application for partial determination of adequacy of its solid
waste landfill permit program. Certain revisions and amendments were submitted on July 21, 1994 and September 6,
1994. The application addressed all components of 40 CFR part 258 and discussed New Jersey's enforcement authority,
provisions for citizen participation, and the current status of the universe of landfills within the State. EPA reviewed
New Jersey's application and tentatively determined that the State's program meets all requirements necessary
to qualify for a determination of partial approval of adequacy to ensure compliance with the Federal Criteria with
the exception of Subpart E_Ground-Water Monitoring and Corrective Action. Upon appropriate adoption of revisions
to its existing ground-water regulations, it is expected that New Jersey will become eligible for full approval which
will include subpart E. On September 6, 1994, New Jersey provided a schedule as called for in its application, which
indicates that all proposed regulatory revisions are expected to be adopted by October, 1995, at which time the revised
regulations will be fully effective. 
The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection has the responsibility for implementing and enforcing solid
waste management regulations, including a permit program, inspection authority and enforcement activities. The
State has determined that at present, 12 regional and 2 municipal sanitary landfills are subject to all components
of the Federal Criteria. Twenty-two other existing sole source landfills as well as those landfills that closed prior
to the effective date of the Federal Criteria, while not subject to the provisions of 40 CFR part 258, are still subject
to the laws and regulations of the State of New Jersey, including those pertaining to closed and unpermitted landfills.
New Jersey has identified a significant number of such sites, which may be classified as ``open dumps'' pursuant to
40 CFR part 257 and which are subject to regulation and enforcement by New Jersey under existing state law. 
To ensure compliance with all of the revised Federal Criteria, New Jersey needs to revise existing regulations concerning
groundwater monitoring and corrective action so that the revised regulations are aligned with part 258, subpart
E. As noted previously, New Jersey has submitted a schedule indicating that such regulatory revisions will be effective
by October, 1995. To allow Jersey to begin exercising some of the flexibility allowed in States/Tribes with adequate
permit programs, EPA is proposing to approve those portions of New Jersey's program that are ready for action today.
These include criteria for location, operation, closure and post-closure care, and financial assurance. 
The public may submit written comments on EPA's tentative determination until December 14, 1994. Copies of New Jersey's
application including revisions and amendments are available for inspection and copying at the location indicated
in the 

ADDRESSES

 section of this notice.

The EPA will hold a public hearing on its tentative decision. The hearing will be held on December 14, 1994 at the Public
Hearing Room, NJDEP, 401 E. State St, Trenton, NJ. Comments can be submitted orally at the hearing or in writing at the
time of the hearing. 
EPA will consider all public comments on its tentative determination received during the public comment period and
during the public hearing. Issues raised by those comments may be the basis for a determination of inadequacy for New
Jersey's program. EPA expects to make a final determination by January 27, 1995 and will give notice of it in the 

Federal Register

. The notice will include a summary of the reasons for the final determination and responses to all major comments.

Section 4005(a) of RCRA provides that citizens may use the citizen suit provisions of section 7002 of RCRA to enforce
the Federal MSWLF criteria in 40 CFR part 258 independent of any State/Tribal enforcement program. As EPA explained
in the preamble to the final MSWLF criteria, EPA expects that any owner or operator complying with provisions in a State/Tribal
program approved by EPA will be considered to be in compliance with Federal Criteria. See 56 FR 50978, 50995 (October
9, 1991).

 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Extension of public comment period. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The purpose of this notice is to announce the extension of the comment period for the ``Contaminated Sediment Management
Strategy'' (OW-FRL-5062-2) for 30 days. The comment period will close on November 30, 1994. 



The original notice, announcing the availability of the Contaminated Sediment Management Strategy, was published
on August 30, 1994, and the public comment period closed on October 31, 1994. Because the proposed Strategy is a unique
plan of action developed to address a significant national environmental problem, and to streamline decision-making
within and among EPA programs, the Agency is requesting comments on the Strategy. EPA is extending the public comment
period because the Agency has received requests to extend the comment period to ensure an adequate and thorough review
of the Strategy. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

EPA announced the availability of the Contaminated Sediment Management Strategy in the August 30, 1994, 

Federal Register

 (OW-FRL-5062-2). Contaminated sediment poses ecological and human 
health risks in many watersheds throughout the United States. In these watersheds, sediment serves as a contaminant
reservoir from which fish and bottom dwelling organisms can accumulate toxic compounds and pass them up the food chain.
EPA's proposed Contaminated Sediment Management Strategy was developed to streamline decision-making within
and among the Agency's program offices by promoting and ensuring: the use of consistent sediment assessment practices,
consistent consideration of risks posed by contaminated sediment, the use of consistent approaches to management
of contaminated sediment risks, and the wise use of scarce resources for research and technology development. 



A summary of the information provided in the Contaminated Sediment Management Strategy and the issues relevant to
sediment contamination are discussed in the August 30, 1994, 

Federal Register

 notice. Readers are referred to that notice for additional details. 

The agency has received requests to extend the public comment period to ensure an adequate and thorough review of the
Strategy. Therefore, the comment period is extended from October 31, 1994, for 30 days, to November 30, 1994.

National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health; Cooperative Research and Development Agreement


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Public Health Service, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH),
announces the opportunity for potential collaborators to enter into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement
(CRADA) to develop a system or systems to automate sampling method development and analysis for airborne contaminants.



It is anticipated that all inventions which may arise from this CRADA will be jointly owned. The collaborator(s) with
whom the CRADA is made will have an option to negotiate an exclusive or non-exclusive royalty-bearing license. The
CRADA will be executed for a 2-year period with the possibility of renewal for another 2-year period. 

Because CRADAs are designed to facilitate the development of scientific and technological knowledge into useful,
marketable products, a great deal of freedom is given to Federal agencies in implementing collaborative research.
The CDC may accept staff, facilities, equipment, supplies, and money from the other participants in a CRADA; CDC may
provide staff, facilities, equipment, and supplies to the project. There is a single restriction in this exchange:
CDC MAY NOT PROVIDE FUNDS to the other participants in a CRADA. This opportunity is available until 30 days after publication
of this notice. Respondents may be provided a longer period of time to furnish additional information if CDC finds
this necessary.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The system or systems to be developed will combine laboratory automation, with novel sampler designs and analytical
methodology to provide for an automated approach to method development and evaluation. The collaborator(s) and
NIOSH will jointly perform the research aimed at development of a commercial system to provide convenient sampling
and analytical methods for airborne contaminants. NIOSH will provide technical expertise, consultation and guidance,
verification of system integrity, and product evaluation and testing. Since this CRADA involves the bringing together
of diverse technologies, a consortium of collaborators will be considered. 


Applicants will be judged according to the following criteria: 
1. Adequacy and technical capabilities to develop the desired technologies and product; 
2. Ability to develop, produce, market, and support system(s); 
3. Evidence of technical credibility; and 
4. Ability to complete the CRADA in a timely fashion. 

This CRADA is proposed and implemented under the 1986 Federal Technology Transfer Act: Public Law 99-502. 
The responses must be made to: Theodore F. Schoenborn, Technology Transfer Coordinator, National Institute for
Occupational Safety and Health, CDC, 4676 Columbia Parkway, Mailstop R-2, Cincinnati, Ohio 45226.

Guidance Manual for Computer Assisted New Drug Applications; Availability



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing the availability of the revised guidance manual entitled ``Computer
Assisted New Drug Application (CANDA) Guidance Manual.'' This manual was developed by FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation
and Research (CDER), in conjunction with the pharmaceutical industry. The manual provides guidance for the submission
of computer assisted new drug applications (CANDA's), investigational new drug applications (IND's), and abbreviated
new drug applications (ANDA's). 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355) requires drug sponsors to submit new drug applications
(NDA's) to FDA for review and approval before marketing in the United States. FDA's review processes culminate in
a risk-benefit assessment and regulatory decision. To arrive at a substantive risk-benefit assessment and confident
regulatory decision, the agency must evaluate all information and data provided via the application supporting
safety, efficacy, and/or other claims. 


The agency has been assessing the use of automation technology to support and assist in premarketing review processes
and has found that technology holds the potential for enhancing review process quality and efficiencies. Consequently,
the agency supports the use of electronic submissions by the pharmaceutical industry.
In the 

Federal Register

 of October 9, 1992 (57 FR 46565), FDA published a notice announcing that the draft guidance manual for CANDA's was available
in hard copy and electronically. The guidance manual provides general guidance to assist the pharmaceutical industry
in preparing and submitting CANDA's that are effective and capable of being evaluated. In the 

Federal Register

 of April 8, 1993 (59 FR 18218), the agency published a notice announcing the procedures for revising the draft guidance
manual, and that the revised guidance manual would be available electronically.
Please note that an accompanying paper submission of the application remains a requirement at this time. The electronic
version should correspond exactly to the paper version; where it does not, the differences are to be specified. Currently,
assessment of electronic submissions versus paper submissions is underway. 
The ``CANDA Guidance Manual'' discusses procedures of general applicability that are acceptable to the agency,
but are not legal requirements. The ``CANDA Guidance Manual'' does not bind the agency, nor does it create or confer
any rights, privileges, benefits, or obligations for or on any person.
The agency will distribute copies free of charge since the electronic submission program is evolving and the manual
provides recommended interim guidance and procedures, and does not mandate electronic submission specifications.
An electronic version of the guidance manual is available via Internet. Requestors should connect to the CDER FTP
server using the FTP protocol. The manual and updates are available in the sub-directory ``CANDA'' in both WordPerfect
Version 5.2 and an ASCII version. Individual chapters are also available. The file READ.ME in the CANDA sub-directory
lists the file names of the WordPerfect and ASCII versions of the entire document and each chapter.




Interested persons may, on or before February 15, 1995, submit written comments on the guidance manual to the Dockets
Management Branch (address above). FDA will consider these comments in determining whether further revisions to
the draft guidance manual are warranted. Two copies of any comments should be submitted, except that individuals
may submit one copy.





Dated: October 24, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Since its creation, the Community Development Work Study Program has been administered by the Assistant Secretary
for Community Planning and Development. However, on September 6, 1994, the program was transferred to the Office
of University Partnerships under the Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research. This newly created
Office will administer HUD's ongoing grant programs to institutions of higher education as well as create initiatives
through which colleges and universities can bring their traditional missions of teaching, research, service, and
outreach to bear on the pressing local problems in their communities. 



The Community Development Work Study Program was enacted in the Housing and Community Development Act of 1988. Earlier
versions of the program were funded by the CDBG Technical Assistance Program (1982-1987) and the Comprehensive
Planning Assistance Program (1969-1981). 

The Community Development Work Study Program provides funds for: 
tuition support_the maximum amount of tuition may not exceed $3,000 per year for an undergraduate student and $3,500
per year for a graduate student; work stipend_based upon the prevailing hourly rate for entry positions in the community
and economic development field and the number of hours worked by the student at the work placement assignment with
a maximum amount of $6,000 per year for an undergraduate and $9,000 for a graduate student; additional support_financial
support for books and travel related to the academic program up to a maximum of $1,000 per year for an undergraduate
student and $1,500 per year for a graduate student; and administrative allowance_to grantees to cover the administrative
costs of the program fixed at $1,000 per year for each participating student. Each participating institution of higher
education must have a minimum of three students with the maximum number of ten students that can be funded. 

On December 29, 1993, HUD published a Notice of Funding Availability announcing the availability of $3 million in
FY 1994 funds for the Community Development Work Study Program (58 FR 68925). The Department reviewed, evaluated
and scored the applications received based on the criteria in the NOFA. As a result, HUD has funded the applications
announced below, and in accordance with section 102(a)(4)(C) of the Department of Housing and Urban Development
Reform Act of 1989 (Pub. L. 101-235, approved December 15, 1989), the Department is publishing details concerning
the recipients of funding awards, as follows:

Proposed Closure Order for Vehicle Use; California 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Bureau of Land Management, Interior.


</AGENCY>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In cooperation with the California Department of Fish & Game, and under authority of 43 CFR 8364.1, the Clear Lake
Resource Area of the Bureau of Land Management is designating emergency vehicular closures on three parcels of recently-acquired
public lands. These parcels are known as the Leal, Kerwin, and Johnson acquisitions. All vehicular use except for
that associated with administrative access, emergencies, and valid existing rights (mining claims, pre-existing
public access, rights-of-ways/easements, etc.) will be prohibited year-round. These closures are consistent
with the Clear Lake Resource Area Management Framework Plan (MFP) Update, as well as the Cache Creek Area of Critical
Environmental Concern (ACEC) Management Plan and the Cache Creek Tule Elk Habitat Management Plan (HMP). These closures
will be in effect until the Cache Creek Coordinated Resource Management Plan (CRMP) is completed, at which time a final
determination will be made to rescind, modify, or continue with the closures as is. 



These three closures are included within the Cache Creek Management Area, a unit managed primarily for wildlife and
primitive recreational values. Detailed maps of these three areas are available upon request from the Clear Lake
Resource Area office of the BLM in Ukiah, California.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Leal acquisition includes 1,475.92 acres acquired by the BLM in October 1993. These lands are located in portions
of Sections 28, 29, 32, 33, and 34 of T. 14N., R. 5W., MDM, and Sections 3 and 4 of T 13N., R. 5W, MDM. along the Lake and Colusa
county line. Prior to acquisition by the BLM, there was no public access on or through this property. These lands were
acquired primarily for wildlife and primitive recreational values. The habitats here support tule elk, blacktail
deer, wild turkey, feral pig, mountain lion, and many other species. Some key habitat improvements have been completed
and others will be implemented in the near future. These projects will further improve this area for the tule elk and
many of the other species found here. In the absence of a closure, unrestricted public vehicular use here would negate
the success and intended purpose of these projects. 



The Kerwin acquisition includes 948.72 acres acquired in January 1994. These lands are located in portions of Sections
30 and 31 of T. 14N., R. 5W., MDM (referred to as the Northern Unit), and all of Section 36 of T. 14N, R. 6W., MDM. (referred
to as the Southern Unit), all in Lake County and bisected by State Highway 20. Prior to acquisition by the BLM, an easement
granted to Lake County for public vehicular access across private lands (in the Northern Unit) was in existence along
the Walker Ridge Road, beginning at the turnoff from State Highway 20 and continuing for approximately one mile northwest
to the beginning of public lands. The Southern Unit had no previous public access available. The Kerwin property was
acquired for wildlife habitat, rare plants, and primitive recreational values. The acquired lands along the first
mile of the Walker Ridge Road (in the Northern Unit) pass through open oak-grassland and meadow habitats supporting
known populations of special status plant species. Currently vehicular access off the first mile of the Walker Ridge
Road is unrestricted for the most part, due to the open nature of the habitat. This use has resulted in documented damage
to the special status plants found here. In the Southern Unit year-round use by the tule elk has been documented. Unrestricted
vehicular use by adjacent landowners has resulted in disturbance to the elk herd, special status plants, and to soils.
Without a closure, unrestricted public vehicular use would result in further disturbance and damage to resource
values. 

The Johnson acquisition includes 2,032.06 acres acquired in January 1994. These lands are located in portions of
Sections 8, 9, 16, 17, 21, and 28 of T. 12N., R. 4W. MDM, all in Yolo County. Prior to acquisition an easement for public
vehicular access through 3.2 miles of this property existed on Yolo County Road 40. This access was limited to Road
40 only and did not allow for any use off the road. Because this property is now public land, there are no restrictions
in place to prohibit vehicular use off the road. Much of the habitat found here is open oak-grassland and is easily accessed
from Road 40. Soils here are fragile and easily damaged by vehicle use. This property was acquired primarily for wildlife
values (including endangered species habitat) and non-motorized recreational use. In the absence of a closure,
unrestricted public vehicular use here would result in serious soils damage in the sensitive oak-grassland habitats.

Title to the non-Federal lands was accepted on July 19, 1994. The value of the Federal lands exceeded the value of the
non-Federal lands by $1,612,500.00. An equalization payment in that amount was made to the United States by Olympic
Land Corporation. The purpose of the exchange was for the United States to acquire non-Federal lands with high value
for recreation and riparian habitat. 

At 10 a.m. on November 28, 1994 the lands acquired by the United States will be open to the operation of the public land
laws generally, subject to valid existing rights, the provisions of existing withdrawals, other segregations of
record and the requirements of applicable law. All valid applications received at or prior to 10 a.m. on November 28,
1994 will be considered as simultaneously filed at the time. Those received thereafter shall be considered in the
order of filing. 

At 10 a.m. on November 28, 1994 the land acquired by the United States will be open to location under the mining laws.
Appropriation of the land under the general mining laws prior to the date and time of restoration is unauthorized.
Any such attempted appropriation, including attempted adverse possession under 30 U.S.C. 38, shall vest no rights
against the United States. Acts required to establish a location and to initiate a right of possession are governed
by State law where not in conflict with Federal law. The Bureau of Land Management will not intervene in disputes between
rival locators over possessory rights since Congress has provided for such determinations in local courts. 

At 10 a.m. on November 28, 1994 the land acquired by the United States will also be open to applications/offers under
the mineral leasing laws, the material sale laws, and the Geothermal Steam Act. 

At 10 a.m. on November 28, 1994 the lands acquired by the United States, which lie within National Forest boundaries,
will be open to entry in accordance with the laws, rules and regulations of the U.S. Forest Service.

<DOCTITLE>Availability of an Environmental Assessment and Receipt of an Application for an Incidental Take Permit for a Project
Called the Cloisters, a Single Family Residence Subdivision, in Brevard County, FL</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Cavalear Companies (Applicant), is seeking an incidental take permit from the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service),
pursuant to Section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended. The permit would authorize
the take of the Florida scrub jay, 

Aphelocoma coerulescens coerulescens,

 a threatened species, in Brevard County, Florida, for a period of 5 years. The proposed taking is incidental to construction
of 266 single family homes including the necessary infrastructure on approximately 104 acres (Project), 12 acres
of which is occupied Florida scrub jay habitat to be permanently altered. The Project is called The Cloisters, and
is located along State Road A1A, south of the Terrace Shores subdivision, in the south beaches area of Brevard County,
Florida.


The Service also announces the availability of an environmental assessment (EA) and habitat conservation plan (HCP)
for the incidental take application. Copies of the EA or HCP may be obtained by making a request to the Regional Office
address below. This notice also advises the public that the Service has made a preliminary determination that issuing
the incidental take permit is not a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment
within the meaning of Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended. The Finding
of No Significant Impact is based on information contained in the EA and HCP. The final determination will be made no
sooner than 30 days from the date of this notice. This notice is provided pursuant to Section 10(c) of the Act and National
Environmental Policy Act Regulations (40 CFR 1506.6).


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Aphelocoma coerulescens coerulescens

 is geographically isolated from other subspecies of scrub jays found in Mexico and the Western United States. The
scrub jay is found almost exclusively in peninsular Florida and is restricted to scrub habitat. The total estimated
population is between 7,000 and 11,000 individuals. Due to habitat loss and degradation throughout the State of Florida,
it has been estimated that the scrub jay population has been reduced by at least half in the last 100 years.


The scrub jay survey provided by the Applicant indicates that one Florida scrub jay family currently uses the suitable
habitat within the Project. The Applicant proposes to impact this territory by removing constituent life support
elements. Initial construction of roads and utilities and subsequent development of individual homesites may therefore
result in death of, or injury to, scrub jays incidental to the carrying out of these otherwise lawful activities. Habitat
alteration associated with property development may reduce the availability of feeding, shelter, and nesting habitat.
To minimize and mitigate the impacts of the loss of 12 acres of scrub jay habitat and accompanying scrub jay family,
the Applicant will purchase 24 acres of scrub habitat known to support the scrub jay, deed the property to Brevard County,
and provide a management endowment of $24,000.00 to ensure management of the site in perpetuity. Other measures proposed
by the Applicant include protection of active nests, if discovered, during the nesting season.
The EA considers the environmental consequences of three alternatives, including acceptance of the HCP as submitted,
consideration of management of surrounding publicly-owned lands as mitigation in lieu of offsite purchase, and
no action.

<DOCTITLE>Availability of a Draft Environmental Assessment and Notice of an Application for an Incidental Take Permit for La
Costa Villages, Carlsbad, California, by the City of Carlsbad and Fieldstone/La Costa Associates</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Fieldstone/La Costa Associates and the City of Carlsbad have applied to the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service),
Department of the Interior, for an incidental take permit pursuant to section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Endangered Species
Act of 1973, as amended (Act). The application has been assigned permit No. PRT-795759. The application includes
a Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP) for a proposed 1,940 acre project (HCP area) in the southeastern corner of the City
of Carlsbad, San Diego County, California. Completion of the grading and construction activities associated with
the proposed project would result in direct impacts on-site to 30 of 48 known pairs of the threatened coastal California
gnatcatcher (

Polioptila californica californica

) (gnatcatcher), 507 of 944 acres of coastal sage scrub, 91 of 120 acres of southern maritime chaparral, 158 of 195 acres
of southern mixed chaparral, 254 of 307 acres of grassland, and 69 of 114 acres of riparian scrub/woodland. Approximately
18 pairs of gnatcatchers, 437 acres of coastal sage scrub, and 193 acres of associated habitats on-site will be conserved
and managed in perpetuity. In addition, 240 acres of off-site mitigation is proposed.


The applicants have requested the issuance of permits (immediately or when a species is listed) under section 10(a)
of the Act that would authorize incidental take, in accordance with the terms of the HCP, of the 66 sensitive species
listed in the HCP. Of these species, the coastal California gnatcatcher is the only one that is listed as threatened
or endangered under the Act and is the only federally listed species observed on-site. In a number of cases, the species
named in the HCP have not been observed on-site.
This notice advises the public of the availability of a draft Environmental Assessment (EA), HCP, and an Addendum
to the HCP. These documents were prepared by the applicants and their consultants. This notice is provided pursuant
to section 10(c) of the Act and National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulations (40 CFR 1506.6(b)). The Service
will evaluate the application, associated documents, and comments submitted thereon to determine whether the application
meets the requirements of NEPA regulations and section 10(a) of the Act. If it is determined that the requirements
are met, a permit will be issued for the incidental take of listed species identified in the application.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Under section 9 of the Act, and implementing regulations, taking of federally listed threatened or endangered species
is prohibited. Taking, in part, is defined as harm or harassment of federally listed species, including under certain
circumstances, the destruction of habitat. Under limited circumstances, the Service may issue section 10(a)(1)(B)
permits to take listed animal species if such taking is incidental to, and not the purpose of, otherwise lawful activities.
Regulations governing permits for listed species are found at Title 50 Code of Federal Regulations 17.22 and 17.32.


Fieldstone/La Costa Associates and the City of Carlsbad have applied for a 30-year permit to authorize incidental
take associated with a proposed residential development and re-alignment of Rancho Santa Fe Road in the HCP area.
The HCP area contains two geographic subareas: a 1,278 acre subarea identified as ``Rancheros-Southeast II'' and
a 662 acre subarea identified as ``Northwest,'' both occurring within the area covered by Carlsbad's citywide Habitat
Management Plan (HMP), a subarea plan under the statewide Natural Communities Conservation Program (NCCP). The
HCP area also is located within the jurisdiction of the Multiple Habitat Conservation Plan (MHCP), a subregional
plan addressing north coastal San Diego County under the NCCP. A concern has been raised regarding the consistency
of the HCP with the HMP and MHCP under the NCCP.

The HCP details project actions that may result in take of the gnatcatcher and 65 additional species proposed by the
applicant to be included in an Implementation Agreement (in preparation), and specific actions that will mitigate
such takings. Mitigation measures include dedication of the proposed on and off-site preserve areas to a ``conservation
entity'' approved by the Service, and long-term funding, management and monitoring. Other sensitive species that
occur on-site and are proposed to be included in the Implementation Agreement are the federally proposed endangered
Del Mar manzanita (

Arctostaphylos glandulosa crassifolia

); the Federal category 2 candidates: summer holly (

Comarostaphylis diversifolia diversifolia

), Bell's sage sparrow (

Amphispiza belli belli

), orange-throated whiptail (

Cnemidophorus hyperythrus beldingi

), and San Diego horned lizard (

Phrynosoma coronatum blainvillii

); and the State endangered thread-leaved brodiaea (

Brodiaea filifolia

).
The major alternatives under consideration during planning include: 1) no take of listed species; 2) no take of gnatcatchers;
3) take only within the Rancho Santa Fe Road project area; 4) delay of take pending completion of the HMP; 5) an off-site
mitigation strategy with unlimited take in the plan area; 6) reconfiguration of the proposed on-site conserved habitat;
7) no action; and 8) the applicants' proposal. Alternatives 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 were considered financially infeasible
by the applicants. Alternative 5 was considered biologically unacceptable by the Service. Alternative 8 is still
under discussion. 
All agencies and individuals are urged to provide comments and suggestions regarding the draft EA, proposal, and
the consistency of the HCP with the HMP and MHCP under the NCCP. All comments received by the closing date will be considered
in finalizing NEPA compliance and permit issuance or denial. Upon completion of the Implementation Agreement and
the NEPA compliance document, the Service will publish a second notice in the 

Federal Register

 inviting public comment.

Carbon Steel Pipe Nipples From Mexico


Determination 


On the basis of the record 
 developed in the subject investigation, the Commission determines,
 pursuant to section 733(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1673b(a)), that there is no reasonable indication that
an industry in the United States is materially injured or threatened with material injury, or that the establishment
of an industry in the United States is materially retarded, by reason of imports from Mexico of carbon steel pipe nipples,
provided for in subheading 7307.99.50 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, that are alleged to
be sold in the United States at less than fair value (LTFV). 





Background 


On August 31, 1994, a petition was filed with the Commission and the Department of Commerce by the U.S. Pipe Nipples
Group, an 

ad hoc

 trade association consisting of five domestic producers of carbon steel pipe nipples,
 alleging that an industry in the United States is materially injured or threatened with material injury by reason
of LTFV imports of carbon steel pipe nipples from Mexico. Accordingly, effective August 31, 1994, the Commission
instituted antidumping investigation No. 731-TA-719 (Preliminary).






Notice of the institution of the Commission's investigation and of a public conference to be held in connection therewith
was given by posting copies of the notice in the Office of the Secretary, U.S. International Trade Commission, Washington,
DC, and by publishing the notice in the 

Federal Register

 of September 8, 1994 (59 FR 46446). The conference was held in Washington, DC, on September 21, 1994, and all persons
who requested the opportunity were permitted to appear in person or by counsel. 
The Commission transmitted its determination in this investigation to the Secretary of Commerce on October 17, 1994.
The views of the Commission are contained in USITC Publication 2819 (October 1994), entitled ``Carbon Steel Pipe
Nipples from Mexico: Investigation No. 731-TA-719 (Preliminary).''



Issued: October 18, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Revision to Accounting and Reporting Requirements for Motor Carriers of Property</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Interstate Commerce Commission.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Decision.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Commission is modifying Annual Report Form M-2 (Form M-2) for class II common and contract motor carriers
of property. The revised Form M-2 is set forth below as an appendix. The intent of these changes is to provide the
Commission with sufficient data from these carriers so as to permit it to fully carry out its regulatory oversight
functions.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A notice instituting this proceeding was published in the 

Federal Register

 on June 6, 1994 at 57 FR 29301. Based on the comments received, the Commission is modifying Form M-2 for class II
motor carriers of property. The revised Form M-2 is set forth below as an appendix to this document. Additional
items will be required in the Form M-2, over and above those contained in the Form M-2 originally proposed
in Ex Parte No. MC-206, served January 27, 1994. Additional information, including the revised Form M-2,
is contained in the Commission's decision. To receive a copy of the full decision, write to, call, or pick up in person
from: Dynamic Concepts, Inc., Room 2229, Interstate Commerce Commission, 1201 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington,
DC 20423. Telephone: (202) 289-4357/4359. [Assistance for the hearing impaired is available through TDD services
(202) 927-5721.]


Environmental and Energy Considerations


This action will not significantly affect either the quality of the human environment or the conservation of energy
resources.


Regulatory Flexibility Analysis


Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), we conclude that our action in this proceeding will not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities. No new regulatory requirements are imposed, directly or indirectly, on
such entities. The economic impact on small entities, if any, is not likely to be significant within the meaning of
the Regulatory Flexibility Act.


Paperwork Reduction Analysis


The Form M-2 as adopted here will be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval
under Section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35). The burden to carriers for completion
of the Form M-2 will be approximately 10 hours per year. Interested persons may file comments concerning the
paperwork burden estimate to the OMB and ICC at:

Authority:

 49 U.S.C. 10321 and 5 U.S.C. 553.



Decided: October 7, 1994.

ACTION:

 Notice of decision accepting application for consideration. 

 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Commission accepts for consideration the application filed September 30, 1994, by Canadian Pacific Limited,
Canadian Pacific (U.S.) Holdings Inc., Soo Line Corporation, and Soo Line Railroad Company (Soo) (collectively,
applicants). Soo and Burlington Northern Railroad Company (BN) own the Davenport, Rock Island and North Western
Railway Company (DRI) jointly. Soo seeks to acquire sole control of DRI as a prelude to merging DRI into Soo. DRI lines
east of the Mississippi River will be transferred to BN, and lines west of the Mississippi River (and BN's ownership
interest in a joint BN/Soo line) will be transferred to Soo. Soo's East Moline-Albany line (east of the Mississippi
River) will also be transferred to BN. DRI will cease to exist. Under 49 CFR part 1180, the Commission finds this to be
a minor transaction.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Applicants seek Commission approval under 49 U.S.C. 11343, 

et seq.

, for: (1) BN to transfer to DRI all of BN's shares of DRI stock (and the resulting full control by Soo of DRI) (Finance
Docket No. 32579); (2) DRI to convey to BN its Davenport, IA-East Moline, IL line between DRI mileposts 36.65 at East
Wye Switch in Davenport and 45.55 at East Moline [Finance Docket No. 32579 (Sub-No. 1)]; (3) Soo to convey to BN its East
Moline-Albany, IL line between CP mileposts 52.00 and 26.60 [Finance Docket No. 32579 (Sub-No. 2)]; and (4) BN to convey
to Soo BN's one-half ownership interest in the joint BN/Soo main line between CP mileposts 157.70 and 158.42 at Clinton,
IA [Finance Docket No. 32579 (Sub-No. 3)].

DRI into Soo were also concurrently filed with this application.

Soo, a class I railroad, operates approximately 5,230 route miles in 11 states. Soo is wholly owned by Soo Line Corporation
(SLC), a noncarrier holding company. SLC is wholly owned by Canadian Pacific (U.S.) Holdings Inc. (Holdings), a noncarrier
holding company. Holdings is in turn wholly owned by Canadian Pacific Limited (CP), d/b/a CP Rail System, which owns
and operates approximately 17,650 miles of rail in Canada and the United States. CP and Holdings also control the Delaware
& Hudson Railway Company d/b/a CP Rail System, which operates in the northeastern United States and has no involvement
in the proposed transactions. 


 BN, also a class I railroad, operates more than 25,000 route miles in 26 states. BN is wholly owned by Burlington Northern,
Inc. 


 BN and Soo jointly own DRI,

3

 a class III switching and terminal railroad which owns and operates approximately 45 route miles between Clinton,
IA and East Moline, IL, via Davenport, IA (known as the Quad Cities area). 





The transactions described in this application will be consummated with internally generated funds and do not involve
the issuance of any new securities. 


 BN and Soo expect to benefit from administrative cost savings associated with eliminating DRI as a separate entity.
Applicants aver that the allocation of DRI's lines between BN and Soo reflect, in part, their operational patterns
in the Quad Cities area. They have concluded that it would be more efficient for each carrier to handle its own traffic
on the DRI lines with a contractual allocation of the cost of maintenance of the lines. Transfer of the DRI lines, they
say, will permit the efficient consolidation of former DRI switching operations with the existing operations of
BN and Soo in the area. 


 With the elimination of DRI, Soo and BN plan to establish a direct interchange in the Quad Cities area. Industries currently
switched by DRI for BN or Soo will now be served directly by those carriers. Applicants note that no shipper or industry
will lose rail service or experience any reduction in rail transportation options as a result of these transactions,
and shippers on the East Moline-Albany line currently served by one railroad will be served by two railroads. Applicants
anticipate no discontinuances or abandonments in connection with or as a result of the proposed transactions. 


 Applicants contend that the transactions will not adversely impact BN or Soo employees; however, DRI's current 25-man
workforce will be abolished before or upon consummation of the proposed transactions. On July 20, 1994, DRI offered
a voluntary severance package to employees with 10 or more years of service. Management employees received a separate
severance package. Applicants recognize that, for each transaction for which approval is sought, the appropriate
level of labor protection is that set forth in

 930 F.2d 511 (6th Cir. 1991). 


 Under 49 CFR 1180.4(b)(2)(iv), we must determine whether a proposed transaction is major, significant, minor or
exempt. The proposal here does not involve the control or merger of two or more class I railroads and has no regional
or national significance. 


 A review of the expected result of the transactions subject to this application, and the related exemptions, confirms
the minor nature of these transactions. Upon consummation BN will own and operate DRI's rail line between Davenport,
IA and East Moline, IL, over which BN and Soo already operate and over which Soo will continue to operate pursuant to
BN's grant back of trackage rights. BN will own and operate Soo's rail line between East Moline and Albany, IL, over
which Soo will also continue to operate pursuant to BN's grant back of trackage rights. Soo will own and operate the
joint BN/Soo line at Clinton, IA and the DRI line between Davenport and Clinton. Soo and BN already operate over both
lines, and BN will continue to operate over both lines pursuant to Soo's grant back of trackage rights. 


 It does not appear that the transactions contemplated by applicants will have any anticompetitive effects or will
result in a major market extension for any applicant.

Accordingly, we find the proposal a minor transaction as defined in 49 CFR 1180.2(c). 

See RR. Consolidation Proced. of Significant Transactions,

 9 I.C.C.2d 1198 (1993). Because the application complies with our regulations concerning minor transactions, we
are accepting it for consideration.

Commerce Commission in Washington, DC. In addition, copies may be obtained upon request from applicants' representatives
named above. 
Any interested person or government entity may participate in this proceeding by submitting written comments. Any
person or entity filing timely written comments shall be considered a party of record if the person's comments so request.
In this event, no petition for leave to intervene need be filed. 
Consistent with 49 CFR 1180.4(d)(1)(iii), written comments must contain: 
(a) the docket number and title of the proceeding; 
(b) the name, address, and telephone number of the commenting party and its representative upon whom service shall
be made; 
(c) the commenting party's position, i.e., whether it supports or opposes the proposed transaction; 
(d) a statement of whether the commenting party intends to participate formally in the proceeding or merely comment
on the proposal; 
(e) if desired, a request for an oral hearing with reasons supporting this request_the request must indicate the disputed
material facts that can only be resolved at a hearing; and 
(f) a list of all information sought to be discovered from applicant carriers. 
Because we have determined that this proposal constitutes a minor transaction, no responsive applications will
be permitted. The time limits for processing minor transactions are set forth at 49 U.S.C. 11345(d). 
Discovery may begin immediately. We admonish the parties to resolve all discovery matters expeditiously and amicably.

This action will not significantly affect either the quality of the human environment or the conservation of energy
resources. 


It is ordered

: 
1. This application is accepted for consideration as a minor transaction under 49 CFR 1180.2(c). 
2. The parties shall comply with all provisions stated above. 



Decided: October 21, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Pioneer Railcorp_Continuance in Control Exemption_Vandalia Railroad Company </DOCTITLE>



Pioneer Railcorp (Pioneer), a noncarrier holding company, has filed a notice of exemption to acquire control, through
stock purchase, of Vandalia Railroad Company, a class III rail carrier that leases and operates a former Illinois
Central Gulf Railroad line, between milepost 689.83 and milepost 692.54, a distance of 2.71 miles, in Vandalia, Fayette
County, IL. 

Pioneer owns and controls six other nonconnecting class III rail carriers: West Jersey Railroad Co., operating in
New Jersey; Fort Smith Railroad Co., operating in Arkansas; Alabama Railroad Co., operating in Alabama; Mississippi
Central Railroad Co. (formerly Natchez Trace Railroad), operating in Mississippi and Tennessee; Alabama &
Florida Railway Co., operating in Alabama; and Decatur Junction Railway Co., operating in Illinois.

1

 




Pioneer states that: (1) the properties operated by these carriers do not connect each other; (2) the continuance
in control is not a part of a series of anticipated transactions that would connect the railroads with each other or
any other railroad in their corporate family; and (3) the transaction does not involve a class I carrier. The transaction
therefore is exempt from the prior approval requirements of 49 U.S.C. 11343. 

See 

49 CFR 1180.2(d)(2). 

As a condition to use of this exemption, any employees affected by the transaction will be protected by the conditions
set forth in 

New York Dock Ry._Control_Brooklyn Eastern Dist., 

360 I.C.C. 60 (1979).

Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke
will not automatically stay the transaction. Pleadings must be filed with the Commission and served on: Donald G.
Avery, Slover & Loftus, 1224 Seventeenth Street NW., Washington, DC 20036.





Decided: October 21, 1994.

<USDEPT>DEPARTMENT OF LABOR</USDEPT>







<USBUREAU>Employment Standards Administration </USBUREAU>


Wage and Hour Division; Minimum Wages for Federal and Federally Assisted Construction; General Wage Determination
Decisions





General wage determination decisions of the Secretary of Labor are issued in accordance with applicable law and are
based on the information obtained by the Department of Labor from its study of local wage conditions and data made available
from other sources. They specify the basic hourly wage rates and fringe benefits which are determined to be prevailing
for the described classes of laborers and mechanics employed on construction projects of a similar character and
in the localities specified therein. 

The determinations in these decisions of prevailing rates and fringe benefits have been made in accordance with 29
CFR Part 1, by authority of the Secretary of Labor pursuant to the provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act of March 3, 1931,
as amended (46 Stat. 1494, as amended, 40 U.S.C. 276a) and of other Federal statutes referred to in 29 CFR Part 1, Appendix,
as well as such additional statutes as may from time to time be enacted containing provisions for the payment of wages
determined to be prevailing by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with the Davis-Bacon Act. The prevailing rates
and fringe benefits determined in these decisions shall, in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing statutes,
constitute the minimum wages payable on Federal and federally assisted construction projects to laborers and mechanics
of the specified classes engaged on contract work of the character and in the localities described therein. 

Good cause is hereby found for not utilizing notice and public comment procedure thereon prior to the issuance of these
determinations as prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 553 and not providing for delay in the effective date as prescribed in that
section, because the necessity to issue current construction industry wage determinations frequently and in large
volume causes procedures to be impractical and contrary to the public interest. 

General wage determination decisions, and modifications and supersedeas decisions thereto, contain no expiration
dates and are effective from their date of notice in the 

Federal Register

, or on the date written notice is received by the agency, whichever is earlier. These decisions are to be used in accordance
with the provisions of 29 CFR Parts 1 and 5. Accordingly, the applicable decision, together with any modifications
issued, must be made a part of every contract for performance of the described work within the geographic area indicated
as required by an applicable Federal prevailing wage law and 29 CFR Part 5. The wage rates and fringe benefits, notice
of which is published herein, and which are contained in the Government Printing Office (GPO) document entitled ``General
Wage Determinations Issued Under The Davis-Bacon And Related Acts,'' shall be the minimum paid by contractors and
subcontractors to laborers and mechanics. 

Any person, organization, or governmental agency having an interest in the rates determined as prevailing is encouraged
to submit wage rate and fringe benefit information for consideration by the Department. Further information and
self-explanatory forms for the purpose of submitting this data may be obtained by writing to the U.S. Department of
Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Wage and Hour Division, Division of Wage Determinations, 200 Constitution
Avenue, NW., Room S-3014, Washington, DC 20210.

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>






Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company, Et Al. (Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Plant, Unit No. 1); Environmental Assessment
and Finding of No Significant Impact



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of a partial exemption from the
requirements of 10 CFR part 50, appendix J, for Facility Operating License No. NPF-3 issued to the Toledo Edison
Company, Centerior Service Company, and the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company (the licensees), for operation
of the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station, Unit No. 1, located in Ottawa County, Ohio. 



Environmental Assessment



Identification of Proposed Action



The proposed exemption would relieve the licensee from the requirement of conducting a full pressure airlock leakage
test, pursuant to section III.D.2(b)(ii) of appendix J to 10 CFR part 50, whenever airlocks are opened during periods
when containment integrity is not required and no maintenance has been performed on the airlock that affects its sealing
capabilities. The licensee would rely instead, on the seal leakage test described in section III.D.2(b)(iii), when
the reactor is in cold shutdown (MODE 5) or refueling (MODE 6) and when no maintenance has been performed on the airlock.

The licensee's request for exemption and the bases therefor are contained in a letter dated October 21, 1994.



The Need for the Proposed Action



The proposed exemption is from performance of the leakage rate test required by paragraph III.D.2(b)(ii) of 10 CFR
part 50, appendix J, which requires at least 12 hours per airlock to perform. Exemption from full pressure leakage
tests on airlocks opened during a period when containment integrity is not required would provide the licensee with
greater plant availability over the lifetime of the plant.



Environmental Impact of Proposed Action



The proposed exemption would permit the substitution of an airlock seal leakage test (section III.D.2(b)(iii) of
appendix J of 10 CFR part 50) for the full pressure airlock test, otherwise required by section III.D.2(b)(ii) when
the airlock is opened, while the reactor is in cold shutdown or refueling mode. If the tests required by section III.D.2(b)
(i) and (iii) are current, and no maintenance performed on the airlock, then there will be adequate assurance of continued
leak tight integrity of the airlock, and this exemption will not affect containment integrity, and does not affect
the risk of facility accidents. Thus, post-accident radiological releases will not be greater than previously determined,
nor does the proposed exemption otherwise affect radiological plant effluents, nor result in any significant occupational
exposure. Likewise, the exemption does not affect non-radiological plant effluents and has no other environmental
impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant radiological or non-radiological environmental
impacts associated with the proposed exemption.



Alternative to the Proposed Action



Because it has been concluded that there is no significant impact associated with the proposed exemption, any alternative
to the exemption will have either no environmental impact or greater environmental impact.

The principal alternative would be to deny the requested exemption. Such action would not reduce environmental impacts
of Davis-Besse, Unit No. 1 operations and would result in reduced operational flexibility or unwarranted delays
in power ascension.



Alternative Use of Resources



This action does not involve the use of resources not previously considered in connection with the ``Final Environmental
Statement Related to Operation of Davis-Besse, Unit No. 1,'' dated October 1975.



Agencies and Persons Consulted



The NRC staff consulted with the Ohio State official regarding the environmental impact of the proposed action. The
state official had no comments.



Finding of No Significant Impact



Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have
a significant effect on the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the Commission has determined not to prepare
an environmental impact statement for the proposed exemption.

For further details with respect to the proposed action, see the licensee's request for exemption dated October 21,
1994, which is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 1717 H Street NW., Washington,
DC, and the University of Toledo Library, Documents Department, 2801 Bancroft Avenue, Toledo, Ohio 03606.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION




Customer Service Plan of the Securities and Exchange Commission 


In response to Executive Order 12862 issued as part of the 
Vice President's National Performance Review, the Securities and 
Exchange Commission (SEC) developed a customer service plan. The 
goal of the plan is to enhance investor protection through an 
improved investor education effort and a redirection of resources 
to augment the SEC's responsiveness to investor concerns and 
complaints. The plan submitted to the Vice President on September 
8, 1994 was modified slightly on October 24, 1994. The modified 
plan is as follows: 
The SEC is responsible for protecting investors through 
enforcement of the federal securities laws and oversight and 
regulation of the securities markets. Individual and institutional 
investors have trillions of dollars invested in securities and 
mutual funds in the United States and abroad. While the SEC does 
not approve or guarantee any investments, it is responsible for 
ensuring that securities issuers provide full disclosure of 
material information to investors and that markets adhere to fair 
standards. 
Investors deal directly with the SEC through its Office of 
Consumer Affairs, which is responsible for processing and 
responding to inquiries and complaint letters from the public. In 
fiscal 1993, the SEC received over 34,700 investor complaints and 
inquiries. Although the SEC has no authority to provide legal 
representation to investors, the SEC may request information from 
brokerage firms and securities exchanges regarding particular 
problems. The SEC obtains invaluable leads from investors; 
approximately 18% of investigations each year have resulted, at 
least in part, from investor complaints. 
The general public also deals directly with the SEC through 
its Public Reference Rooms located in Washington, D.C., New York 
City, and Chicago. These facilities maintain a library of 
corporate filings, Commission releases, and other documents for 
use by the public. The SEC staff provide assistance to the public 
in locating and obtaining information and in using the agency's 
electronic filing system, known as EDGAR. In fiscal 1993, these 
facilities had nearly 45,000 visitors requesting nearly 63,000 
documents and microfiche, and over 121,000 telephone inquiries. 
In its role of supervising the public securities markets, the 
SEC processes and reviews the filings of more than 13,000 entities 
that are required to file prospectuses, annual and quarterly 
reports, proxy statements and other informational documents. It 
also acts on the rule filings of the various stock exchanges and 
self-regulatory organizations. Efficiency is paramount for these 
time-sensitive filings. 
Because of its diverse customer base and the importance of 
its work to investors and the financial markets, efficient and 
effective customer service is a top priority at the SEC. The SEC 
has undertaken several initiatives to improve its ``user- 
friendliness'' and to educate investors. 


Mutual Fund Surveys 





</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941028-2-00126 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941028-2-00089 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 In November 1993, the SEC conducted a voluntary telephone consumer survey of up to 1,000 households to obtain
background information regarding the public's understanding of the risks involved with purchasing mutual funds
sold through banks. The survey found that 28% of those surveyed believed that all mutual funds sold through banks are
insured, and of people who have bought funds through banks, 66% believed that money market mutual funds are federally
insured. 
 Between January and March 1994, the SEC arranged four focus groups of 10 to 20 investors each to obtain more detailed
information from individual investors of mutual funds. The first two groups addressed the SEC's concern that consumers
do not adequately understand the risks involved with investing in mutual funds sold through banks. The other two sessions
provided the SEC insight on investor's understanding of mutual fund prospectuses and the information they derive
from the prospectuses. 


Education 


 On March 10, 1994 the SEC, along with other securities regulators, released a brochure, 

Invest Wisely,

 which provides basic information to help investors select a brokerage firm and salesperson, identify decisions
to be made before making an initial investment decision and address a problem that may arise. This brochure also helps
investors identify questions they should ask, provides background information about the securities industry,
and describes practices that may signal a problem. 


Consumer Affairs Advisory Committee 


 On March 10, 1994, Chairman Levitt announced the creation of the Consumer Affairs Advisory Committee. The
purpose of this committee is to open a channel through which the SEC can receive advice and information to help it better
address the needs of investors in their role as consumers of financial products and services. Made up of members with
diverse backgrounds and expertise, the committee will continue to explore broad, fundamental issues of concern
to investors, especially disclosure and communication of information from corporations, brokerage firms, investment
companies and investment advisers to their investors/clients. The committee also will address regulatory simplification
and examine how the SEC can be more responsive to consumer needs and effective in helping to resolve consumer problems.



Streamline Action on Rule Filings 


 Since taking office in July 1993, Chairman Levitt has taken significant steps to virtually eliminate the backlog
of overdue rule filings by the stock exchanges and the self-regulatory organizations (SRO). The Commission has proposed
rule amendments that would increase the number of SRO rule filings that may become effective immediately, and instituted
procedures to ensure that the Commission will take final action on other filings within a six-month period. 


Reorganize the SEC's Enforcement Efforts 


 The SEC's ability to hunt down securities violations has been enhanced by placing all regional SEC offices
under the supervision of the Enforcement Division and relocating certain operations. This has streamlined the organization
and provided more efficient allocation of resources. 
The SEC plans to take further action this fall regarding education of investors and improvement of customer service,
including: 

 The SEC will publish and distribute a second brochure, entitled 

Invest Wisely: Mutual Funds, 

to provide investors with basic information on mutual funds. The SEC plans to create a series of brochures to help investors
become better educated consumers. 
 The SEC will conduct additional surveys and focus groups to develop other meaningful and useful solutions
for better education of investors. 
 The SEC will disseminate information to investors via an electronic bulletin board on Internet. Such information
will include Investor Alerts, descriptions of new or emerging types of securities fraud; 

Information for Investors, 

articles on a variety of specific topics; and SEC publications that presently are available only in hardcopy. 
 The SEC will establish a toll-free consumer hotline to provide investors and the general public with useful
information regarding common consumer inquiries. The topics will include how to file investor complaints; what
the SEC can and cannot do for investors; how to obtain information from public companies, brokerage firms and other
investment representatives; and how to order certain publications from the SEC. 
 The SEC will install a new and improved Information Line in the headquarters Public Reference Room to provide
callers with access to general information about the SEC, a means to request facsimiles of the recorded general information
and the ability to transfer within the SEC to specific offices for detailed information. 
 The SEC is providing enhanced training to its consumer affairs specialists at headquarters and in the field
offices. A special review of the consumer affairs function is underway and several recommendations have been implemented
to improve the agency's responsiveness to consumers. 


SEC's Commitment to Customers 


The SEC makes a commitment to its customers to do the following: 
1. Provide courteous, timely and responsive answers to all customers. 
2. Suggest alternatives or options to customers when the SEC is unable to provide direct assistance. 
3. Obtain comments and suggestions from customers on how to improve or modify the SEC's consumer affairs program.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; American Stock Exchange, Inc.; Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated
Approval of Proposed Rule Change Relating to the Commencement of the Use of the New York Stock Exchange's Overnight
Comparison System</DOCTITLE>



October 21, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 notice is hereby given that on October 17, 1994, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and
II below, which Items have been prepared primarily by the Amex. On October 19, 1994, the Amex amended its proposal to
exclude all references to equity transactions.
 The Commission is publishing this notice and order to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested
persons.






I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms and Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The purpose of the proposed rule change is to permit the Amex to begin using the New York Stock Exchange's Overnight
Comparison System (``OCS'') for all bond transactions executed at the Amex on and after October 21, 1994.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the Amex included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. Amex has prepared summaries, set forth in section (A), (B), and (C)
below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



On October 21, 1994, the Amex will commence use of the New York Stock Exchange's OCS for the comparison of all Amex bond
transactions executed at the Amex. Transactions in Amex equities and options will continue to be compared and processed
through the Amex's Intra-Day Comparison System (``IDC'').

The change from IDC to OCS for the comparison of all Amex bond transactions will have no impact on the efficiency and
capacity of the electronic system. OCS will continue to deliver an automated, highly flexible, and efficient system
for capturing, comparing, and processing bond trades as well as providing a greater measure of uniformity between
the Amex and New York Stock Exchange marketplaces. Essentially, the same procedures presently in use for IDC will
continue to apply to OCS.

Specifically, the proposed rule change consists of amendments to Amex Rules 700(e),
 719(b),

 729,
 and 731
 and the rescission of Amex Rule 731A
 to require Amex members on and after October 21, 1994, to submit initial trade data for transactions in listed bonds
effected on the Amex through OCS for comparison. The proposal also will enable Amex members to resolve through OCS
all uncompared transactions in listed bonds effected on the Amex for ``Regular Way,'' ``Next Day,'' and ``Seller
Option'' settlement that are traded on an ``issued,'' ``when listed,'' and ``when distributed'' basis. Uncompared
transactions that cannot be resolved on T+1 will be subject to close out. However, if a transaction remains in the system
and both parties agree to the trade it will compare on T+2. In addition, OCS also will compare ``Ex-Clearing House''
bond transactions (

i.e. 

any transaction in which the buying and selling parties to the trade agree to physically settle the transaction between
themselves) for ``Cash,'' ``Next-Day,'' and ``Seller's Option'' settlement.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941028-2-00128 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941028-2-00090 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Amex will accept initial trade data submissions in all listed bonds traded on the floor of the Amex from its clearing
member organizations and compare the data through OCS. The compared trades then will be transmitted to the National
Securities Clearing Corporation (``NSCC'') where the transactions will be printed on clearing members' contract
sheets. NSCC then will complete the clearance and settlement process. Any uncompared trade will remain in OCS for
resolution until resolved or canceled.






Expanding the Amex's on-line comparison system to include bond transactions will automate the Exchange's bond trade
comparison and resolution system and will shorten the comparison cycle from T+2 to T+1. The Amex believes the proposal
will reduce the risk exposure to investors and to Amex members and will contribute to the prompt and efficient clearance
and settlement of securities transactions. The Amex also believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with
Section 6(b) of the Act and specifically with the objectives of Section 6(b)(5) in that it will foster cooperation
and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect
to, and facilitating transactions in securities and will protect investors and the public interest.



(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The Amex does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose a burden on competition that is not necessary or
appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.



(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants
or Others



Comments were neither solicited nor received.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



Section 6(b)(5) of the Act requires that the rules of the Exchange be designed to foster cooperation and coordination
with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating
transactions in securities and protect investors and the public interest. The Commission finds that the proposed
rule change is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) in that it will expand Amex's on-line comparison system to include
bond transactions and will automate Amex's bond trade resolution system. In addition, the proposal will shorten
the comparison cycle for bond transactions from T+2 to T+1, which is consistent with the conversion to a three business
day settlement cycle.






Amex has requested that the Commission find good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth
day after the date of publication of notice of the filing. The Commission finds good cause for so approving the proposed
rule change because it will allow Amex members to begin utilizing the New York Stock Exchange's OCS for bond transactions
as soon as possible. In addition, Amex has distributed two information circulars to its members concerning the use
of the New York Stock Exchange's OCS for bond transactions, and Amex has not received any comments. Further, the Commission
published for comment the New York Stock Exchange's proposal to implement OCS, received no comments, and subsequently
approved the proposal.






IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submission should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth
Street NW., Washington DC 20549. Copies of the submissions, all subsequent amendments, all written statements with
respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating to
the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C.  552, will be available for inspection and copying at the principal
office of Amex. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-Amex-94-44 and should be submitted by
November 21, 1994.



It Is Therefore Ordered, 

pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) that the proposed rule change is hereby approved.




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change and Amendment No. 1 to a Proposed Rule Change
and Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Amendment No. 2 to a Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago
Board Options Exchange, Inc. Relating to Firm Quote Responsibilities</DOCTITLE>



October 21, 1994.



I. Introduction




On June 7, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change to increase from 10 to 100 the firm quote contract size minimum applicable to Designated Primary
Market Makers (``DPMs'') in classes of interest rate options for which Public Automated Routing System (``PAR'')
workstations are available. On June 17, 1994, the CBOE filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change.
 The proposed rule change, as amended, was published for comment in the 

Federal Register

 on July 1, 1994.
 No comments were received on the proposed rule change. The Exchange filed Amendment No. 2 to the proposed rule change
on September 22, 1994.
 This order approves the proposal, as amended.









II. Description of Proposal



The CBOE proposes to require DPMs using PAR workstations to provide firm quotes of up to 100 contracts on interest rate
options for non-broker-dealer customer orders. This quote size minimum is substantially higher than the 10 contract
minimum otherwise applicable to DPMs under CBOE Rule 8.51 and prior Regulatory Circulars.
 The 100 contract minimum will be operative initially only in 30-year bond interest rate options, since this is the
first class for which a PAR workstation will be assigned. The Exchange expects that the 100-contract minimum will
be extended gradually to other classes of interest rate options, as the use of PAR workstations expands to these classes.
The CBOE will issue a Regulatory Circular describing the details of its proposal.







The Exchange believes that this change in DPM quote commitment levels will enhance the depth and liquidity of its markets
in interest rate options. Currently, much of the trading in interest rate derivatives is done in markets where quoted
or negotiated prices can be obtained in transaction sizes larger than is guaranteed at the CBOE. The Exchange believes
that increasing the firm quote size minimum should enable it to compete more effectively for order flow and trading
activity in interest rate options.

The Exchange also believes that the DPMs affected by the rule change will be able to meet the higher commitment levels
without incurring undue financial risk because of the inherent efficiencies of the PAR workstations combined with
the efficiencies already existing with respect to the Exchange's Autoquote System.
 A PAR workstation is a newly-developed, automated, computer-based workstation that provides users with the ability
to execute trades, transmit trade reports, and enter other data and commands at the touch of a screen, thereby eliminating
the delay inherent in a keyboard-based system. The Exchange's Autoquote System enables DPMs to change their published
quotes almost instantaneously in response to changed market conditions, which in combination with the PAR workstations
should permit DPMs to manage the risk of quoting 100-contract markets.







As indicated above, under this proposed rule change and in accordance with CBOE Rule 8.51, affected DPMs will be obligated
to provide firm quotes for up to 100 contracts on non-broker-dealer customer orders only. Under the proposal, the
firm quote size minimum will not apply whenever a ``fast market'' is declared,
 and may be suspended for any class or series on a case by case basis as determined by the CBOE's Market Performance Committee
(``MPC''). These exceptions are consistent with the firm quote commitment requirements for other options traded
on the Exchange.

III. Findings and Conclusions



The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section
6(b)(5) of the Act.
 Specifically, the Commission finds that the CBOE's proposal serves to facilitate transactions in securities, and
to protect investors and the public interest.





The CBOE's proposal is designed to benefit non-broker-dealer customers by increasing the size of orders for which
they can be assured executions to a minimum depth of 100 contracts for interest rate options. Although the Commission
carefully scrutinizes discriminatory order execution practices, limiting the 100 contract minimum to non-broker-dealer
customers is consistent with the purposes of the Act. The intent of the 100 contract minimum is to allow DPMs in interest
rate options to become more competitive in making markets, thereby contributing to a more free and open market and
facilitating customer orders. 

The Commission believes that the larger markets created by increasing the minimum firm-quote contract size could
result in tighter spreads. This in turn should contribute to a more liquid options market, to the benefit of all market
participants. Furthermore, increasing the minimum DPM quote sizes available to customer orders furthers the underlying
purposes of the CBOE's firm quote rule.

By limiting the applicability of the 100 minimum contract size to classes of interest rate options for which PAR workstations
are available, the CBOE's proposal addresses the need of DPMs to have flexibility in adjusting their quotes beyond
that which is provided by the Exchange's Autoquote System alone.
 The ``fast market'' exception of Rule 6.6 also addresses such concerns by providing DPMs relief during fast moving
markets.
 Although the CBOE Rules will continue to allow the MPC to grant exemptions from the 100 contract firm quote requirement
on a case by case basis,
 the Commission believes such exemptions should only be granted in extraordinary circumstances.







The Commission believes that the CBOE rules will ensure that those DPMs required to meet the 100 contract firm quote
guarantee for interest rate options will be adequately capitalized to handle the increased guarantee. In this regard,
CBOE Rules will continue to require that member organizations subject to Rule 15c3-1 under the Act comply with
the capital requirements prescribed therein, as well as comply with certain additional requirements of the CBOE.






The Commission also notes that the CBOE's proposal will be introduced gradually, and initially will only apply to
30-year bond interest rate options. As the use of PAR workstations extends to other classes of interest rate options,
so too will the applicability of the 100 contract firm quote minimum.

The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 2 to the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day
after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the 

Federal Register

. The Commission believes that Amendment No. 2 serves to clarify the operation of the Exchange's systems as they relate
to a DPM's firm quote responsibilities. Specifically, Amendment No. 2 describes how PAR workstations, together
with the CBOE's existing Autoquote System, allow DPMs to adjust quotes with speed and flexibility. In clarifying
the operation of the Exchange's systems, Amendment No. 2 does not create any substantive changes to the CBOE's proposal.
Based on the foregoing, the Commission believes that it is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act to approve Amendment
No. 2 to the CBOE's proposal on an accelerated basis.

Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning Amendment No. 2 to the proposed
rule change. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and
Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments,
all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written
communications relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that
may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection
and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC. Copies of such filing
will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of the Exchange. All submissions should
refer to File No. SR-CBOE-94-17 and should be submitted by November 21, 1994.



It Is Therefore Ordered, 

pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-CBOE-94-17), as amended, is approved.






For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Midwest Clearing Corporation and Stock Clearing Corporation of Philadelphia;
Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Changes Expanding the Interfaces With
the National Securities Clearing Corporation's Fixed Income Transaction System</DOCTITLE>



October 21, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 notice is hereby given that on October 13, 1994, and October 21, 1994, respectively, the Midwest Clearing Corporation
(``MCC'') and the Stock Clearing Corporation of Philadelphia (``SCCP'') filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule changes as described in Items I and II below, which Items have been
prepared primarily by MCC and SCCP. On October 20, 1994, MCC amended its filing to exclude the proposed addition of
an automated fixed income transaction system book entry feature for municipal bonds.
 The Commission is publishing this notice and order to solicit comments from interested persons and to grant accelerated
approval of the proposed rule changes.






I. Self-Regulatory Organizations' Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Changes



MCC and SCCP each propose to expand its interface with the National Securities Clearing Corporation's (``NSCC'')
fixed income transaction system (``FITS'')
 to include corporate bonds and unit investment trusts (``UITs'').













II. Self-Regulatory Organizations' Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Changes




In their filings with the Commission, MCC and SCCP included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the
proposed rule changes and discussed any comments they received on the proposed rule changes. The text of these statements
may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. MCC and SCCP have prepared summaries, set forth in section
(A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



(A) Self-Regulatory Organizations' Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Changes



Under the proposed rule filings, MCC and SCCP each propose to expand its interface with NSCC's FITS to enable MCC and
SCCP participants to take advantage of the improved input and comparison features of FITS for corporate bonds and
UITs.





</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941028-2-00133 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941028-2-00093 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Similar to MCC's and SCCP's current interfaces with NSCC's FITS for municipal securities,
 all trade comparisons for corporate bonds and UITs will be conducted at NSCC and not at either MCC or SCCP. Under the
expanded interfaces, the earlier cutoff times for the input by MCC and SCCP participants of two-side original trade
information that were previously applicable for municipal securities trades now will be applicable to trades in
corporate bonds and unit investment trusts. MCC's cutoff time for submission by its participants of original trade
input will be 7:00 P.M. (central time) on the trade date and 4:00 P.M. (central time) on the day following the trade date
(``T+1'') for supplemental trade input. SCCP's cutoff time for submission by its participants of original trade
input will be 1:00 A.M. (eastern time) on trade date, and adjustments to original trade input must be made prior to 4:00
P.M. (eastern time) on T+1.
 Because NSCC will be transmitting comparison reports to MCC and SCCP reflecting the compared trades of MCC and SCCP
participants early in the morning on T+1, MCC and SCCP will produce contract reports for their participants by 8:00
A.M. (central time) and 9:00 A.M. (eastern time), respectively, on T+1. The interface will enable MCC and SCCP participants
to take full advantage of the NSCC expansion of FITS.









(B) Self-Regulatory Organizations' Statement on Burden on Competition


MCC and SCCP do not believe that the proposed rule changes will impose a burden on competition that is not necessary
or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.



(C) Self-Regulatory Organizations' Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Changes Received from Members, Participants
or Others


Comments were neither solicited nor received.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Changes and Timing for Commission Action






Section 17A(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Act directs the Commission to facilitate the establishment of a national system for
the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions.
 Because the expanded interfaces enable MCC and SCCP participants to utilize FITS with all its benefits, the Commission
believes, for all the reasons set forth in the FITS approval order,
 that the proposed rule changes filed by MCC and SCCP further this goal.







MCC and SCCP have requested that the Commission find good cause for approving the proposed rule changes prior to the
thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of the filing. The Commission finds good cause for so approving
the proposed rule changes because accelerated approval will allow MCC participants and SCCP participants to utilize
and to take full advantage of the benefits of the expanded FITS as soon as it is operational at NSCC. Furthermore, the
Commission has previously published notice of and approved NSCC's implementation of the enhanced FITS. NSCC's proposed
rule change did not generate any comment letters, and none are expected on MCC's and SCCP's proposals.



IV. Solicitation of Comments 
 


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submission should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth
Street NW., Washington DC 20549. Copies of the submissions, all subsequent amendments, all written statements with
respect to the proposed rule changes that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule changes between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 5th Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filings will also be available
at the principal offices of MCC and SCCP. All submissions should refer to File Nos. SR-MCC-94-13
and SR-SCCP-94-06 and should be submitted by November 18, 1994. 
 
On the basis of the foregoing, the Commission finds that the proposal is consistent with the requirements of the Act,
particularly with Section 17A(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder. 
 
 


It Is Therefore Ordered,

 pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule changes (File Nos. SR-MCC-94-13
and SR-SCCP-94-06) be, and hereby are, approved.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; National Securities Clearing Corporation; Order Approving a Proposed Rule Change
Modifying the Automated Customer Account Transfer Service </DOCTITLE>


October 21, 1994. 


On July 20, 1994, the National Securities Clearing Corporation (``NSCC'') filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (``Commission'') a proposed rule change (File No. SR-NSCC-94-13) pursuant to Section
19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'').
 Notice of the proposal was published on August 25, 1994, in the 

Federal Register 

to solicit comments on the proposed rule change.
 No comment letters were received. For the reasons discussed below, the Commission is approving the proposed rule
change. 
 





I. Description 
 


NSCC is modifying its Automated Customer Account Transfer Service (``ACATS'') to accelerate the time in which customer
cash or margin accounts are transferred. NSCC's rule change is made in conjunction with the New York Stock Exchange's
(``NYSE'') recently approved rule change amending NYSE Rule 412
 and the National Association of Securities Dealers' (``NASD'') recently filed proposal to amend Section 65 of the
NASD's Uniform Practice Code,
 both of which set forth guidelines for their members' transfers of customer accounts. 





NSCC is amending its Rule 50, Section 9 to allow an NSCC member to whom a customer's securities account is being transferred
(``receiving member'') one business day after receipt of the customer account asset data report from NSCC to determine
whether to accept the account, to reject the account, or to request that the NSCC member who currently maintains the
account (``delivering member'') make adjustments to the account. Currently, receiving members have two business
days to respond after receiving the customer account asset data report. Where Mutual Fund Services eligible book
share mutual fund assets are to be transferred, a receiving member again will have one business day instead of two business
days after receipt of the customer account asset data report to submit detailed transfer instructions to NSCC. During
the one day review period, a delivering member is able to add, to delete, or to change an item in the securities account
being transferred. Each business day that the delivering member causes an adjustment to be made to an account will
give the receiving member one additional business day after each adjustment to accept, to reject, or to request adjustments
or in the case of mutual funds to submit transfer instructions. Currently, receiving member have two business days
after each adjustment. Additionally, the proposed rule change deletes language that treats account transfers containing
option positions differently from transfers of accounts without option positions. 
 


II. Discussion 
 


The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder and particularly with the requirements of Section 17A(b)(3)(F).
 Section 17A(b)(3)(F) requires that the rules of a clearing agency be designed to promote the prompt and accurate clearance
and settlement of securities transactions, and to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in the
clearance and settlement of securities transactions. The Commission believes that NSCC's rule change shortening
the time period for transferring accounts should result in benefits to both customers and members by increasing efficiency
in the transfer of accounts. NSCC's proposed rule change is made in conjunction with the NYSE's and the NASD's rule
changes governing their members' transfers of customer accounts; therefore, the Commission believes the proposal
fosters cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in clearance and settlement of securities transactions.
In addition, reducing the time for account transfers is consistent with Commission Rule 15c6-1 mandating a
three business day settlement cycle effective June 1, 1995.
 
 





III. Conclusion 


On the basis of the foregoing, the Commission finds that the proposal is consistent with the requirements of the Act,
particularly with Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder. 


It Is Therefore Ordered, 

pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-NSCC-94-13)
be, and hereby is, approved.

 
 

For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

Consolidated Natural Gas Company (70-6306) 
 


Consolidated Natural Gas Company, CNG Tower, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15222-3199 (``Consolidated''),
a registered holding company, has filed a post-effective amendment to its declaration under Sections 6(a) and 7 of
the Act. 
 
By prior Commission orders in this proceeding dated November 27, 1985, March 20, 1986 and December 18, 1989 (HCAR Nos.
23925, 24053 and 25003, respectively), Consolidated was authorized to issue 364,616 shares of its common stock,
$2.75 par value (``Common Stock''), from time-to-time through December 31, 1994, to the agent for participants in
Consolidated's Dividend Reinvestment Plan (``DRP'') and to the Trustees of the Employee Stock Ownership Plan (``ESOP'')
of Consolidated and its participating subsidiaries. Of the total number of shares authorized, Consolidated allocated
210,348 and 154,268 shares, respectively, to the DRP and ESOP. It is anticipated that 133,251 shares of Common Stock
allocated to the ESOP will remain unissued as of December 31, 1994. All shares allocated to the DRP have been issued.

 
Consolidated proposes to continue the ESOP and, at the option of its Board of Directors (``Board''), distribute to
participants either authorized and unissued Common Stock or outstanding Common Stock purchased in the open market.
Authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock will be issued whenever additional equity capital is needed by Consolidated.
The per share price of original issue Common Stock purchased from Consolidated will be the average of the closing price
of Consolidated's Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange Consolidated tape for the 20 consecutive trading days
immediately preceding the date of transfer. Consolidated will use the proceeds from the sale of such shares for general
corporate purposes. Whenever additional equity capital is not needed by Consolidated, ESOP shares will be acquired
through open market purchases by the ESOP trustees. 
 
The ESOP is noncontributory on the employee's part and is administered by trustees. No one has the right to vote any
shares acquired by the ESOP other than the participants who own such shares. The Board has the right to adjust the number
of shares reserved under the ESOP which may be issued in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of participants'
rights under the ESOP in the event of a stock split, reserve stock split, reorganization or similar event with respect
to which the Board determines that an equitable adjustment is appropriate. Consolidated requests authority to issue
said 133,251 shares, or such shares as may respectively remain unissued at December 31, 1994, until such numbers shall
be exhausted, but not beyond December 31, 1999. Consolidated further requests authority to adjust the number and
par value (if appropriate) of shares of Common Stock that may be issued under the ESOP in the implementation of the anticipation
or anti-enlargement of rights provisions of the ESOP.

Consolidated Natural Gas Company (70-7170) 
 


Consolidated Natural Gas Company, CNG Tower, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15222-3199 (``Consolidated''),
a registered holding company, has filed a post-effective amendment to its declaration under Sections 6(a) and 7 of
the Act.  
 
By prior Commission orders, dated November 27, 1985, March 20, 1986 and December 18, 1989 (HCAR Nos. 23926, 24052 and
25002, respectively), Consolidated was authorized to issue 1,500,000 shares of its common stock, $2.75 par value
(``Common Stock''), from time-to-time through December 31, 1994, to the agent for participants in Consolidated's
Dividend Reinvestment Plan (``DRP''). Pursuant to those orders, 84,097 shares of Common Stock have been issued through
September 8, 1994. It is anticipated that 1,415,903 shares of Common Stock allocated to the DRP will remain unissued
as of December 31, 1994.  
 
Consolidated proposes to continue the DRP and, at the option of its Board of Directors (``Board''), offer participants
either authorized and unissued Common Stock or outstanding Common Stock purchased in the open market. Authorized
and unissued shares of Common Stock will be issued whenever additional equity capital is needed by Consolidated.
The per share price of original issue Common Stock purchase from Consolidated will be the closing price of Consolidated's
Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange Consolidated tape on the dividend payment date. Consolidated will use
the proceeds from the sale of such shares for general corporate purposes. Whenever additional equity capital is not
needed by Consolidated, DRP shares will be acquired through open market purchases by Society National Bank (``Society'')
in Cleveland, Ohio, which will continue to act as agent for stockholders participating in the DRP. Consolidated will
absorb all brokerage commissions and administrative charges, such as agent fees.  
 
No one has the right to vote any shares acquired through the DRP other than the respective participants in the DRP who
own such shares. The Board has the right to adjust the number of shares reserved under the DRP which may be issued in order
to prevent dilution or enlargement of participants' rights under the DRP in the event of a stock split, reverse stock
split, reorganization or similar event with respect to which the Board determines that an equitable adjustment is
appropriate. Consolidated requests authority to issue 1,415,903 shares of Common Stock, or such shares as may actually
remain unissued at December 31, 1994, to Society as agent for the DRP until such number shall be exhausted, but not beyond
December 31, 1999. Consolidated further requests authority to adjust the number and par value (if appropriate) of
shares of Common Stock that may be issued under the DRP in the implementation of the anti-dilution of rights provisions
of the DRP.  
 


Central Power and Light Company (70-7572)  
 


Central Power and Light Company (``CPL''), 539 N. Carancahua Street, Corpus Christi, Texas 78401, an electric utility
subsidiary company of Central and South West Corporation, a registered holding company, has filed a post-effective
amendment to its application, previously filed under sections 9(a) and 10 of the Act, under sections 9(a) and 10 of
the Act and Rule 54 thereunder.  
 
By order dated April 13, 1989 (HCAR No. 24863), the Commission authorized CPL to lease to nonaffiliated third parties:
 
 
(1) Approximately 23,400 square feet of excess space on the first two floors of its corporate headquarters building,
located at 539 N. Carancahua Street, Corpus Christi, Texas (``Headquarters Building''); 
 
(2) Approximately 17,800 square feet of excess space on the third and fourth floors, in the basement and on the roof
of the Headquarters Building; and  
 
(3) Space in one of its former office buildings pending eventual sale of the building. 
 
CPL now proposes to lease to Enron Oil & Gas Company, a nonaffiliated third party (``Enron''), approximately
34,954 square feet of excess space in Headquarters Building (``Leased Space''). CPL has entered into a Lease Agreement,
dated September 16, 1994, with Enron providing for such lease, as supplemented by a letter, dated September 22, 1994,
from CPL to Enron (``Lease''). The obligations of CPL under the Lease are subject to and conditioned upon receipt by
CPL of all required governmental and regulatory approvals, including this Commission's. The term of the Lease is
for five years, commencing on November 1, 1994 and ending on October 31, 1999, unless certain improvements to the Leased
Space have not been completed or all required governmental and regulatory approvals have not been received by November
1, 1994. In the case of such a delay, the term of the lease will commence when such improvements have been completed or
such approvals have been obtained and will end five years thereafter.  
 
The rental payments due under the Lease are $30,584.75 per month, equivalent to an annual rental rate of $10.50 per
square foot of ``net rentable area,'' as defined in the Lease. The rental payments are subject to increase in accordance
with increases in a specified Consumer Price Index and to other customary adjustments. The Lease also provides for
a grant by CPL to Enron of a ``tenant finish allowance'' of $325,072.20 or $9.30 per square foot of net rentable area
for the purpose of constructing improvements to the Leased Space. This allowance is payable as work on improvements
to the Leased Space is performed and, to the extent not expended on improvements, shall be credited to rent due under
the Lease. Under the Lease, CPL is to pay a brokerage fee to Enron Property Company, an affiliate of Enron, of $73,403.40
or 4% of the gross rental due over the term of the Lease. Such fee is payable within ten days after the date the Lease becomes
effective. CPL believes that the rental payments, the tenant finish allowance and the brokerage fee provided for
in the Lease, taken together, will result in net rental payments that are at or near market rates for space comparable
to the Leased Space.  
 
CPL has also agreed to give Enron a right of first refusal to lease any additional space on two floors of the Headquarters
Building that might become available for lease during the term of the Lease. Such provisions as to additional space
are in addition to and independent of the provisions governing the Leased Space. Any lease of such additional space
would be for the remaining unexpired term of the Lease, at an annual rental rate per square foot equal to the rate to be
paid under the Lease. The lease would also provide for a tenant finish allowance per square foot equal to the allowance
to be paid under the Lease, but proportionately reduced to reflect the portion of the term of the Lease that will have
then expired. In all other respects, the lease of such additional space would be on the same terms and conditions as
are contained in the Lease.

Northeast Utilities, et al. (70-8479) 
 


Northeast Utilities (``Northeast''), 174 Brush Hill Avenue, West Springfield, Massachusetts 01809, a registered
holding company, and its wholly owned subsidiary companies (``Subsidiaries''), Holyoke Water Power Company (``Holyoke''),
Canal Street, Holyoke, Massachusetts 01040, Western Massachusetts Electric Company (``WMECO'') and The Quinnehtuk
Company (``Quinnehtuk''), both of 174 Brush Hill Avenue, West Springfield, Massachusetts 01809, Public Service
Company of New Hampshire (``PSNH'') and North Atlantic Energy Corporation (``North Atlantic''), both of 1000 Elm
Street, Manchester, New Hampshire 03015, The Connecticut Light & Power Company (``CL&P''), Northeast
Nuclear Energy Company (``Nuclear'') and The Rocky River Realty Company (``Rocky River''), each of 107 Selden Street,
Berlin, Connecticut 06037, and HEC Inc. (``HEC''), 24 Prime Parkway, Natick, Massachusetts 01760 (all companies
collectively, ``Applicants''), have filed an application-declaration under Sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10 and 12(b)
of the Act and Rules 43, 45, 53 and 54 thereunder. 
 
By orders dated December 16, 1992, June 25, 1993 and September 13, 1994 (HCAR Nos. 25710, 25836, and 26126, respectively),
authority was granted, through December 31, 1994 (subject to certain borrowing limits), for inter alia: 
 
(1) Northeast to make open account advances to its subsidiary companies; 
 
(2) The continuation of the Northeast Utilities System Money Pool (``Money Pool''); 
 
(3) The issuance of short-term notes pursuant to lines of credit by Northeast, Holyoke, WMECO, CL&P, Nuclear,
Rocky River and PSNH; and 
 
(4) The issuance and sale of commercial paper by Northeast, CL&P and WMECO. 
 
As described in more detail below, Applicants propose, subject to certain maximum limits described below, to: 
 
(1) Make short-term borrowings from time-to-time after December 31, 1994 and on or before December 31, 1996, evidenced
(a) in the case of Northeast, CL&P, WMECO, PSNH, Holyoke, Nuclear, and Rocky River, by notes (``Short-Term Notes'')
issued to banks and non-bank lending institutions through formal and informal credit lines and (b) in the case of CL&P,
WMECO and Northeast, by commercial paper (``Commercial Paper''); 
 
(2) Continue to use, through December 31, 1996, the Money Pool; and 
 
(3) Allow Northeast, under the terms of the Money Pool, to borrow funds from lending institutions solely for the purpose
of lending those funds through the Money Pool to PSNH, Nuclear, North Atlantic, Rocky River, Quinnehtuk and HEC. 
 
Applicants propose that the maximum aggregate borrowings pursuant to the authority requested herein shall not exceed
the following amounts: Northeast_$150 million; CL&P_$325 million;
 WMECO_$60 million; PSNH_$175 million; Holyoke_$5 million; Nuclear_$50 million; North Atlantic_$50 million;
Rocky River_$22 million; Quinnehtuk_$8 million; and HEC_$11 million. 
 




The Applicants propose to extend their present authority through December 31, 1996 to make open account advances
to PSNH, Nuclear, North Atlantic, Quinnehtuk, Rocky River and HEC through the Money Pool by issuing Short-Term Notes,
Selling Commercial Paper or borrowing from the Northeast Utilities multi-bank revolving credit facility (``Revolving
Credit Facility'').
 
 




It is also stated that North Atlantic and HEC will be entitled to borrow through the Money Pool only if and to the extent
that funds in the Money Pool attributable to contributions from Northeast are available for such borrowings. PSNH
will not be entitled to borrow funds through the Money Pool that are attributable to contributions from WMECO unless
and until the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities has issued an order authorizing WMECO to lend funds to
PSNH through the Money Pool. PSNH's participation in the Money Pool is only expected to be a back up to the PSNH Facility.

 
All borrowings from the contributions to the Money Pool, including the open account advances, will be documented
and will be evidenced on the books of each Applicant that is borrowing from or contributing surplus funds to the Money
Pool. Any Applicant contributing funds to the Money Pool may withdraw those funds at any time without notice to satisfy
its daily need for funds. Except for loans from the proceeds of external borrowings by Northeast, all loans will be
payable on demand, may be prepaid by any borrowing Applicant at any time without premium or penalty and will bear interest
for both the borrower and lender, payable monthly, equal to the daily Federal Funds Effective Rate as quoted by the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Loans from the proceeds of external borrowings by Northeast will bear interest at
the same rate paid by Northeast on its borrowings, and no such loans may be prepaid unless Northeast is made whole for
any additional costs that may be incurred because of such prepayment. Northeast will be fully reimbursed for all costs
that it incurs in relation to loans made to the other Applicants.

<TEXT>
 

If no such short-term needs match the amount of funds that are available for the period such funds are available, the
Applicants state that the funds in the Money Pool will be invested in:  
(1) Obligations issued or guaranteed by the United States; 
(2) Obligations issued or guaranteed by any person controlled or supervised by and acting as an instrumentality of
the U.S. pursuant to authority granted by the Congress of the U.S.; 
(3) Obligations issued or guaranteed by any state or political subdivision thereof, provided that such obligations
are rated for investment purposes at not less than ``A'' by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (``Moody's'') or by Standard
& Poors Corporation (``S&P'');  
(4) Commercial paper rated not less than ``P-1'' by Moody's or not less than ``A-1'' by S&P; or  
(5) Such other instruments as are permitted by Rule 40(a)(1) under the Act and approved by the Massachusetts Department
of Public Utilities (``DPU'') pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 164, section 17A and the regulations
thereunder. 
The Applicants (other than North Atlantic, HEC and Quinnehtuk) also request authority to secure both formal and informal
credit lines with a number of lending institutions. Formal credit lines may be subject to compensating balance and/or
fee requirements and will therefore be used only when an Applicant determines that such a credit line offers advantages
as compared with other available credit options. Compensating balance requirements will not exceed 5% of the committed
credit line amount, and fees will not exceed 0.30% per annum. Each Applicant participating in a credit line would be
able to draw funds to the exclusion of the other Applicants. The Applicants may change their credit lines and may obtain
additional lines over time. The continued availability of such credit lines is subject to the continuing review of
the lending institutions. 
In addition, the Applicants (other than North Atlantic, HEC and Quinnehtuk) propose to issue Short-Term Notes pursuant
to such formal and formal lines of credit. Short-Term Notes will be issued both on a transactional basis, with a separate
note evidencing each loan, and on a so-called grid note (``Grid Note'') basis, as described below. 
 
Each Short-Term Note issued on transactional basis will be dated the date of issue, will have a maximum term of 270 days,
and will bear interest at a fixed or floating rate. Such Short-Term Notes will be issued no later than December 31, 1996,
and will (except as described below) be subject to prepayment at any time at the borrower's option. From time-to-time,
an Applicant may use a different form of Short-Term Note containing customary terms to evidence its borrowings, if
necessary, to satisfy the needs of a particular lender. 
 
Short-Term Notes issued on a Grid Note basis will be issued by an Applicant to a particular lending institution at or
prior to the first borrowing under the Grid Note from that lender by the Applicant. Each repayment and reborrowing
subsequent to the first borrowing will be recorded on a schedule to the note without the necessity of issuing additional
notes. Also recorded on a schedule to the note at the time of a borrowing will be the date of the borrowing, the maturity
(which may not exceed 270 days from the date of the borrowing), the number of days the borrowing is outstanding, the
interest rate or method of determining the interest rate, the amount of interest due, and the date of payment. Except
as described below, borrowings on a Grid Note basis will be subject to prepayment at any time at the borrower's option.

 
The interest rate on all Short-Term Notes will be determined on the basis of competitive quotations from several lending
institutions, and will either be at a fixed interest rate or at a floating interest rate determined with reference
to an agreed-upon index (such as a Lending institution's prime rate, the London InterBank Offered Rate, certificate
of deposit rates, money market rates or commercial paper rates). The interest rate in any case will not exceed two percentage
points above the Federal Funds Effective Rate. The Applicants will select the lending institution(s) from which
to make a particular short-term borrowing and determine whether to borrow at a fixed or a floating rate on the basis
of the lowest expected effective interest cost for borrowings of comparable sizes and maturities. 
Borrowings bearing floating interest rates will generally be subject to prepayment at the borrower's option. The
Applicants believe that many lending institutions lending funds at fixed interest rates are engaged in ``matched
funding,'' i.e., such lenders acquire for comparable maturities the funds that are lent to their borrowers. Because
the lenders would remain obligated under their own borrowings from others if the Applicants were to prepay their borrowings
in advance of their scheduled maturities, many lending institutions lending funds at fixed interest rates stipulate
that such borrowings may not be prepaid or may be prepaid only with a premium that will make the lender whole for any losses
(including lost profits) it may incur. Accordingly, in order to realize the benefits of fixed interest rates when
a fixed-rate borrowing is evaluated to be the lowest cost borrowing available, the Applicants may from time to time
agree with individual lenders that such borrowings may not be prepaid or may only be prepaid if the lender is made whole
for its losses. 
CL&P, WMECO and Northeast request authority to continue to sell Commercial Paper publicly. Such Commercial
Paper will be issued through the Depository Trust Company in the form of book entry notes in denominations of not less
than $50,000, of varying maturities, with no maturity more than 270 days after the date of issue. The Commercial Paper
will not be repayable prior to maturity. The Commercial Paper will be sold through a placement agent or agents in a co-managed
commercial paper program pursuant to a placement agent agreement at either the discount rate per annum or the interest
rate per annum prevailing at the date of issuance for commercial paper of comparable quality and of the particular
maturity sold by public utility issuers thereof. No Commercial Paper will be issued unless the issuing Applicant
believes that the effective interest cost to the Applicant will be equal to or less than the effective interest rate
at which the applicant could issue Short-Term Notes in an amount at least equal to the principal amount of such Commercial
Paper. The placement agent or agents will receive a commission for the sale of the Commercial Paper of not more than
1/8 of 1% per annum, on a discounted basis. 
 
Except as otherwise described herein and unless otherwise authorized by the Commission, any short-term borrowings
of the Applicants outstanding at December 31, 1996 will either be repaid from internal cash resources or from the proceeds
of long-term debt or equity financing or remain outstanding if the Commission authorizes the Applicants to continue
such short-term borrowings after December 31, 1996.

 
 

For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority.

<USBUREAU>Federal Railroad Administration</USBUREAU>


<DOCTITLE>Petition for a Waiver of Compliance </DOCTITLE>



In accordance with 49 CFR 211.41, notice is hereby given that the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) has received
a request for a waiver of compliance with certain requirements of Federal railroad safety regulations. The individual
petitions are described below, including the party seeking relief, the regulatory provisions involved, the nature
of the relief being requested and the petitioner's arguments in favor of relief. 

Interested parties are invited to participate in these proceedings by submitting written views, data, or comments.
FRA does not anticipate scheduling a public hearing in connection with these proceedings since the facts do not appear
to warrant a hearing. If any interested party desires an opportunity for oral comment, they should notify FRA, in writing,
before the end of the comment period and specify the basis for their request. 

All communications concerning these proceedings should identify the appropriate docket number (e.g., Waiver Petition
Docket No. RSEQ-94-5) and must be submitted in triplicate to the Docket Clerk, Office of Chief Counsel,
Federal Railroad Administration, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20590. Communications
received before December 1, 1994, will be considered by FRA before final action is taken. Comments received after
that date will be considered as far as practicable. All written communications concerning these proceedings are
available for examination during regular business hours (9 a.m.-5 p.m.) in Room 8201, Nassif Building, 400
Seventh Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20590. 

The waiver petitions are as follows: 



Sperry Rail, Inc. (SRIX) (Waiver Petition Docket No. RSEQ-94-5) 



The Sperry Rail, Inc., (SRIX) seeks a permanent waiver of compliance from all provisions of 49 CFR part 240, Qualification
Standards for Locomotive Engineers. The SRIX operates 37 self-propelled rail testing cars utilizing their own operators,
and a railroad employee acting as a pilot who is qualified on the physical characteristics and operating rules over
the railroad it is being operated on. The SRIX argues that their operators are well trained and would not benefit from
part 240 certification requirements. The SRIX also argues that the cost of certification would make them non-competitive
due to increased labor costs. 



St. Louis & Chain of Rocks Railroad (SLCR) (Waiver Petition Docket No. RSEQ-94-6) 



The St. Louis & Chain of Rocks Railroad (SLCR) seeks a waiver of compliance from all provisions of 49 CFR Part 240,
Qualification Standards for Locomotive Engineers. The SLCR Railroad is an excursion railroad which operates in
the 
St. Louis, Missouri area. It is a non-profit rail museum and operates over less than three miles of track, fewer than
ten days a year at speeds not exceeding 5 mph.

<DOCTITLE>Petition for Exemption or Waiver of Compliance</DOCTITLE>



In accordance with 49 CFR 211.9 and 211.41, notice is hereby given that the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA)
has received from the Association of American Railroads (AAR) a request for an interim waiver of compliance with a
requirement of Federal rail safety standards. The petition is described below, including the regulatory provisions
involved and the nature of the relief being requested.

Interested parties are invited to participate in these proceedings by submitting written views, data, or comments.
FRA does not anticipate scheduling a public hearing in connection with these proceedings since the facts do not appear
to warrant a hearing. If any interested party desires an opportunity for oral comment, they should notify FRA, in writing,
before the end of the comment period and specify the basis for their request.

All communications concerning these proceedings should identify the appropriate docket number (e.g., Waiver Petition
Docket Number RSFC-94-2) and must be submitted in triplicate to the Docket Clerk, Office of Chief Counsel,
Federal Railroad Administration, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590. Communications
received before December 1, 1994, will be considered by FRA before final action is taken. Comments received after
that date will be considered as far as practicable. All written communications concerning these proceedings are
available for examination during regular business hours (9 a.m.-5 p.m.) in Room 8201, Nassif Building, 400
Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590.



Association of American Railroads (AAR)_(Waiver Petition Docket Number RSFC-94-2)



The Association of American Railroads (AAR) seeks an interim waiver of compliance with certain provisions of the
Railroad Freight Car Safety Standards, 49 CFR Part 215. The AAR is requesting an exemption from the requirement of
49 CFR 215.103(h) which requires the removal from service of freight car wheels that show signs of having been overheated
as evidenced by reddish brown discoloration, as it is applied to heat-treated curved-plate wheels. As a result of
a petition by the AAR (Rulemaking Petition No. 93-1), the FRA intends to initiate a rulemaking addressing the
proposal to revise 49 CFR 215.103(h) as it applies to heat-treated curved-plate (HT-CP) freight car wheels.

AAR indicates that it is filing this petition for an interim waiver to address the situation while the rulemaking process
proceeds.

AAR requests that FRA issue a waiver providing in substance, that:

49 CFR 215.103 shall not prohibit a railroad from placing or continuing in service a freight car if the only reason for
such prohibition is one or more wheels that are discolored as described in 49 CFR 215.103(h), provided:

(i) Each such discolored wheel is heat-treated and is of curve-plate design,

(ii) Each such wheel is identified as a heat-treated curved-plate wheel in accordance with AAR interchange rules,
and

(iii) The railroad has submitted to FRA and to AAR a written agreement to participate in the Data Collection Program
on Premature Wheel Failure.

AAR cites the following justification for the waiver request:

1. HT-CP wheels are extraordinarily resistant to the development of residual tensile rim stresses which are
a precondition for wheel fracture.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941028-2-00149 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941028-2-00105 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

2. The resistance of HT-CP wheels to development of residual tensile rim stress is a function of the design of
the wheels and the manufacturing processes used.
3. In-service wheel failure data and experimental data show that HT-CP wheels have an incidence of residual
tensile rim stress and of wheel failure that is approximately the same as non-discolored HT-CP wheels.
4. Transport Canada, the Canadian rail safety agency, does not prohibit the use of discolored curved-plate wheels
on railroad freight cars. Canadian data collected over nine years similarly show that discolored and non-discolored
HT-CP wheels fail for residual tensile rim stress related reasons at approximately the same rate.
5. New air brake testing procedures have significantly reduced the likelihood of sticking brakes_the principal
cause of the development of residual tensile rim stress in HT-CP wheels.
6. Removal of HT-CP wheels costs the railroad industry approximately $40 million per year, yet provides no discernible
safety benefit.


Data Collection on Premature Wheel Failure


AAR proposes a data collection program that will provide a data base which can be used to make sound decisions about
railroad freight car wheels, particularly HT-CP wheels.

Comments and Responses 



Section I. Introduction 

Section II. Recommendations 



A. Assignment of Responsibility 



No comments received on this section. 



B. Risk Assessment, Development of the TB Control Plan, and Periodic Reassessment 





Comments:

 Provide more flexibility in levels of risk to accommodate facilities that rarely or never provide services to patients
with tuberculosis. 



Response:

 Two new categories_``very low risk'' and ``minimal risk''_were added to accommodate such facilities. 



Comments:

 Rationale for selecting six patients per year in a given area as a criterion for risk level seems arbitrarily defined.




Response:

 This criterion is based on surveys conducted by CDC in conjunction with the American Hospital Association, the Society
for Health Care Epidemiology of America, and the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology.
These surveys suggest an increased risk of tuberculin skin test conversion in employees working in facilities admitting
six or more TB patients per year. 



Comments:

 Repeat skin testing at 3-month intervals in high-risk settings is too frequent. 



Response:

 The high-risk setting is essentially an outbreak setting, in which there is evidence of transmission of 

Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

 In this situation, it is reasonable to conduct follow-up skin testing 12 weeks (3 months) after the initial testing.
If there is no evidence of further transmission and any deficiencies in infection control practices and facilities
have been corrected, the area is no longer considered high risk, and there is no need to continue testing every 3 months.




Comments:

 A cluster of skin test conversions is defined as two or more conversions in one area within 3 months; however, because
of the limitations of skin testing, this may not represent true conversions due to nosocomial transmission. 



Response:

 It is assumed that a cluster would be investigated to determine the likelihood that it truly represents nosocomial
transmission. The situation would be classified as high risk only if this evaluation supported a conclusion that
nosocomial transmission had occurred. The recommendation will be modified to clarify this point. 



Comments:

 Retesting all employees in a area when a single conversion has occurred may not be warranted. 



Response:

 Clarified wording of this section. 



C. Detection of Patients Who Have Active TB 





Comments:

 Provide more information and place more emphasis on early detection, specifically those categories of patients
in whom TB should be suspected. 



Response:

 Reemphasized the need for protocols for early detection and the need to review and revise these protocols periodically.
In addition, explained that the index of suspicion varies from place to place, depending on various factors, including
the prevalence of infection in the population served.

Comments:

 Increase the recommended turnaround time for stat smears for laboratories unable to use rapid methods and remove
the term ``stat smears'' from recommendations. 



Response:

 Reemphasized the importance of rapid laboratory results. Discouraged batching of specimens and added the recommendation
that laboratories that perform mycobacterial tests infrequently refer specimens to an experienced laboratory.
Removed the term ``stat smears''. 



D. Management of Patients in Ambulatory Care Settings and Emergency Rooms
 




Comments:

 Clarify the requirement that patients should wear surgical masks but that health care workers (HCWs) must wear particulate
respirators. 



Response:

 Added a footnote to explain the rationale for each: one to protect the worker from infection and the other to decrease
the amount of droplet nuclei in the air produced by the patient. 



Comments:

 Do not require isolation rooms in all ambulatory care settings. 



Response:

 Restated and clarified that if TB patients are seen infrequently or not at all in a facility, an isolation room is not
needed. However, there must be a protocol for referral and periodic risk assessment. 



E. Management of Hospitalized Patients With TB 





Comments:

 Do not require isolation for most or all pediatric patients. 



Response:

 Provided some examples of potentially infectious pediatric TB patients and added a section explaining the need to
evaluate parents as possible source of infection. 



Comments:

 Radiology should not, and in many facilities, cannot have a separate area for TB patients. 



Response:

 Clarified the section to refer only to facilities where many TB patients are seen. 



Comments:

 Provide clearer recommendations for visitors and their use of respiratory protection. 



Response:

 Expanded the recommendations to make clearer. 



Comments:

 Requiring three negative smears to release a patient from isolation is excessive and unnecessary, especially for
suspected TB cases. 



Response:

 Clarified: if TB has been ruled out, there is no need to retain the patient in isolation. Reiterated that if TB has been
confirmed the patient should have three consecutive negative sputum smears collected on different days. 



Comments:

 The recommendation that TB patients not be discharged to home if an HIV-infected person or young children are in the
household is potentially problematic. 



Response:

 Clarified that this is one of many factors that should be taken into consideration when planning to discharge TB patients,
not a hard-and-fast rule. 



Comments:

 Labeling door TB Isolation would breach patient confidentiality. 



Response:

 Recommended using the term 

Isolation 

rather than 

TB Isolation 

giving hospitals the flexibility to label doors according to individual policies or practices.

F. Engineering Controls 

Ultraviolet Germicidal Irradiation 





Comments:

 Data are insufficient to recommend the use of UVGI. Greater emphasis should be placed on the use of UVGI in health care
settings. 



Response:

 No change. No new information was provided and the current guidelines were considered appropriate. 



Ventilation 





Comments:

 Provide specific recommendations on engineering controls as they relate to risk level. Provide information on how
to evaluate air changes per hour (ACHs). There are no data to support requirement for six or more ACHs. 



Response:

 Clarified: 6 ACHs are an absolute minimum, and a level of 12 or more ACHs are recommended, especially in new construction.
Referred to table S3-1, which provides the number of air changes per hour and the minutes required for removal
efficiencies of 90.0%, 99.0%, and 99.9%. The 12 ACHs or more recommendation was arrived at by both use of this table
and NIOSH experimental data. Added discussion on the benefits of higher ventilation and recommended ideal performance
criteria. 



Comments:

 Provide retrofit information and some examples of alternative methods for achieving required ventilation. 



Response:

 In response to requests for information on alternative methods, retrofit information, and interim guidelines,
expanded the introduction to this section and introduced a clearer hierarchy of ventilation methods. 



Comments:

 Provide clearer directions on bronchoscopy location and ventilation requirements. 



Response:

 The confusion about bronchoscopy location resulted from inconsistency in the guidelines in relation to performing
the procedure in the operating room vs. an area of patient isolation. Clarified this point. 



Room Units 





Comments:

 Provide information on room air ``cleaning'' units. Can these units serve as a substitute for not having six or more
ACHs?

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941028-2-00157 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941028-2-00109 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Response:

 Revised the document to present more clearly the potential use of air cleaning units in areas where air changes are
limited and to set their place in a control hierarchy. In addition, further clarified the importance of placement,
performance, and potential limitations. Added a statement that manufacturers of these units should provide documentation
of both the efficiency of the HEPA filter and the efficiency of the device in lowering air contaminant levels. 


Negative Pressure 




Comments:

 Because smoke can be an irritant, the use of smoke tubes for continuous pressure monitoring should be replaced with
flutter strips. Daily monitoring of negative pressure is unnecessary and labor intensive. 


Response:

 Made no change in the recommended monitoring schedule. The concern over the use of smoke tubes is unfounded. Controlled
tests by NIOSH have shown that the quantity of smoke that is released is so minute that it is not measurable in the air.
The location of the patient and the length of time the patient is exposed dilute the smoke to several orders of magnitude
below an 8-hour exposure limit. It is not practical and often not effective to use flutter strips or continuous monitoring
devices as alternatives to indicate directional air movement. The air flow (due usually to the small clearance area
under a door) is insufficient to move the flutter strip. Likewise, low negative pressure, which will satisfactorily
provide adequate directional air flow into the isolation room, may not be readable on continuous monitoring devices.
Devices must be capable of reading 0.001 inch of water, the established minimum, to be effective. Clarified the overall
guidance in this area by indicating the use of smoke as the optimum test procedure and clearly stating the potential
results of flutter strips and continuous instrumentation. Used illustrations to clarify procedures for setting
negative pressure. 


HEPA Filtration 




Comments:

 The recommendations on the use of HEPA filtration in a ventilation system are not supported by the data. The purpose
of its use is unclear. 


Response:

 Addressed the general confusion on the use of HEPA filtration by rewording the section. 


Comments:

 Provide information on the necessity of ``bag in_bag out'' and ``red bag'' use when changing filters. 


Response:

 Eliminated the bag in_bag out requirement since there is no evidence that it is needed. Retained the red bag recommendation
(treating filters as infectious waste). 


G. Respiratory Protection 
and Supplement 4. Respiratory Protection 




Comments:

 HEPA filtered masks are too expensive, and no data support their use. Instituting a fit-testing program and, in general,
a respiratory protection program is too expensive. HCWs will not wear the masks. The masks are uncomfortable, impede
communication, and interfere with general patient care. 


Response:

 Retained the original performance criteria on respiratory protection; however, details on specific respirators
such as dust-mist and dust-fume-mist were removed. Removed the respiratory protection table and accompanying performance
characteristics in the supplement in anticipation of the new certification process. Retained the explanations
about fit, fit testing and fit checking, and the elements of a respiratory protection program. Added a statement about
ongoing research being conducted on various forms of respiratory protection.

Comments:

 The performance criteria for respiratory protection for HCWs exposed to tuberculosis fail to take into consideration
the potential higher level of risk for workers in selected settings (e.g., bronchoscopy performed on patients suspected
of having TB or autopsy performed on deceased persons suspected of having TB at the time of death). 


Response:

 Clarified that the facility's risk assessment may identify those limited settings where the estimated risk for transmission
of 

M. tuberculosis

 may be such that a level of respiratory protection exceeding the standard criteria is appropriate. 


Comments:

 NIOSH certification process should be changed to accommodate the certification of a more appropriate mask for use
in health care settings. 


Response:

 On May 24, 1994, CDC published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 26850) a Notice of Proposed Rule Making on revised certification requirements for respiratory protective
devices. The certification of air-purifying respirators under these proposed requirements would enable respirator
users to select from a broader range of certified respirators that meet the current performance criteria in this document.



Comments:

 Provide information on the storage and reuse of respirators. 


Response:

 Expanded the general guidelines on the reuse of respirators classified as disposable and those with replaceable
filters. Retained the original suggestion to refer to manufacturers recommendations concerning storage and reuse.



Comment:

 It is unclear which facilities must have a respiratory protection program. 


Response:

 Clarified that facilities that do not have isolation rooms for TB, that do not perform cough-inducing procedures,
and refer all potential TB patients need not have a respirator program but must perform a periodic risk assessment,
have protocols for referral, and an infection control plan that is periodically reviewed. 


H. Cough-Inducing Procedures 


No comments were received that differed substantively from those covered in other sections of the document. 



I. Education and Training of Health-Care Workers 




Comments:

 In general, the comments supported the concept of education for HCWs. Persons from a number of specialties noted that
educational programs should be flexible and should allow for the selection of information to be included in these
programs and that the frequency of training should be based on the risk of TB transmission in the facility or area. Some
suggested emphasis on educating physicians in the early recognition and proper treatment for persons with tuberculosis.
Because of difficulties with compliance with attendance and the time needed away from the job in the busy health care
environment, concern was expressed about the increasing requirements for mandatory annual educational training
sessions on various subjects (bloodborne pathogens, fire safety, hazardous exposure). A few persons suggested
that CDC provide standardized training materials. A few commented on the expense of the training program, including
the respirator training program. 


Response:

 Modified section to allow more flexibility in selection of topics to cover and frequency of education.

J. Health Care Worker Counseling, Screening and Evaluation 
Counseling 




Comments:

 Most of the comments on this section were very favorable. Some persons commented that the HIV-infected HCW may not
report their infection to the facility and asked about the facility's responsibility to HCWs and to patients should
this occur. Some expressed concern about confidentiality and about the Americans with Disabilities Act. 


Response: 

No changes were considered necessary. 


Screening HCWs for Active Disease 




Comments: 

Evaluation of every HCW with a cough of 2 weeks or greater duration is excessive. 


Response:

 Reemphasized the need to tailor each program to fit the situation. The infection rate in a particular facility, the
time of year (e.g., flu season), the potential exposure of individual workers_all these need to be taken into consideration.




Screening HCWs for Latent TB Infection 




Comments: 

Annual PPD testing in areas of low prevalence is unnecessary. It is unclear which HCWs should be tested. Provide clearer
information on the number of conversions during a specified period to trigger the testing of others from the same area
or group. 


Response: 

Modified this section and coordinated it with recommendations in the risk assessment and the skin testing supplement,
which give clearer guidance on who should be tested and how frequently. 


Comments: 

Two-step skin testing is not necessary for all HCWs, especially those who are transferring from hospitals and whose
PPD results are negative and those from areas where the prevalence of booster phenomenon is low or where boosting was
assessed as no problem. 


Response: 

Clarified that 2-step testing is not necessary if an HCW has had a documented negative PPD result in the past 12 months
or if the institution has determined that boosting is not common in their population. Also added the potential consequences
of misinterpreting a boosted reaction as a new infection. 



Evaluation and Management of Health Care Workers With Positive PPD Tests 
Evaluation 




Comments: M. tuberculosis

 antimicrobial susceptibilities should be recorded in the HCW's medical record and given to the employee if he or she
leaves the facility. The HCW can then be put on appropriate therapy if active disease develops. Persons who are PPD
positive and have not had adequate preventive therapy should be monitored at least annually. 


Response: 

Added these recommendations to this section. 


Routine and Follow-Up Chest Radiographs 




Comments:

 Consideration should be given to performing chest radiographs on HCWs whose PPD tests are positive. 


Response:

 Reemphasized the need to monitor more frequently for symptoms of TB in high-risk persons but retained the statement
that regular chest radiographs have not been shown to be effective in detecting TB in these persons.

<TEXT>
 

Work Restrictions 




Comments:

 Requiring three consecutive negative smears before an HCW who is receiving treatment for active TB can return to work
is excessive. A person who has improved does not cough and does not produce sputum and may be kept off duty unnecessarily.



Response:

 Confusion had been caused by an incorrect wording in the guidelines, that ``negative smears on consecutive days''
were required. This has been clarified. The recommendation for 3 consecutive negative smears collected on separate
days was deemed appropriate and retained. 


Comments: 

If an HCW who has a positive skin test result does not take preventive therapy, the HCW should be required to be seen and
interviewed frequently. 


Response:

 The frequency of follow-up was not specified to allow for flexibility. 

 



Supplement 2 




Comment: 

HCWs should be allowed to read their own skin test results. 


Response:

 Retained the recommendation that they not read their own test results and cited a reference as to why they should not.



Comment:

 Clarification is needed on what constitutes a positive skin test result for HCWs. 


Response: 

Added to the recommendation that a HCW may be considered positive if the induration is 10 mm or more and referred to the
Diagnostic Standards (ATS/CDC statement). 


K. Problem Evaluation 


Comments and subsequent changes made in the risk assessment section also apply here. Revised this section. 


L. Coordination With Public Health Department 


No substantive comments or questions received on this section. 



M. Additional Considerations for Selected Areas 




Comment:

 What controls are needed in special areas such as hospices and nursing homes? 


Response:

 Added a statement on the need to conduct a risk assessment and have an infection control plan, which should be reviewed
and revised regularly. For hospices and nursing homes, it was clarified that TB isolation rooms are not needed if they
do not provide care to TB patients. Restated the need for a referral protocol with periodic review. 


Supplement 5 Decontamination: Cleaning, Disinfecting, and Sterilizing of Patient-Care Equipment 




Comments: 

Only one comment on this section concerned the cleaning of ventilation ducts. 


Response:

 No changes were considered necessary.

Executive Summary 



This document updates and replaces all previously published guidelines for the prevention of Mycobacterium tuberculosis

 transmission in health-care facilities. The purpose of this revision is to emphasize the importance of (a) the hierarchy
of control measures, including administrative and engineering controls and personal respiratory protection;
(b) the use of risk assessments for developing a written tuberculosis (TB) control plan; (c) early identification
and management of persons who have TB; (d) TB screening programs for health-care workers (HCWs); (e) HCW training
and education; and (f) the evaluation of TB infection-control programs. 


Transmission of 

M. tuberculosis 

is a recognized risk to patients and HCWs in health-care facilities. Transmission is most likely to occur from patients
who have unrecognized pulmonary or laryngeal TB, are not on effective anti-TB therapy, and have not been placed in
TB isolation. Several recent TB outbreaks in health-care facilities, including outbreaks of multidrug-resistant
TB, have heightened concern about nosocomial transmission. Patients who have multidrug-resistant TB can remain
infectious for prolonged periods, which increases the risk for nosocomial and/or occupational transmission of


M. tuberculosis.

 Increases in the incidence of TB have been observed in some geographic areas; these increases are related partially
to the high risk for TB among immunosuppressed persons, particularly those infected with human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV). Transmission of 

M. tuberculosis

 to HIV-infected persons is of particular concern because these persons are at high risk for developing active TB if
they become infected with the bacteria. Thus, health-care facilities should be particularly alert to the need for
preventing transmission of

 M. tuberculosis 

in settings in which HIV-infected persons work or receive care. 

Supervisory responsibility for the TB infection-control program should be assigned to a designated person or group
of persons who should be given the authority to implement and enforce TB infection-control policies. An effective
TB infection-control program requires early identification, isolation, and treatment of persons who have active
TB. The primary emphasis of TB infection-control plans in health-care facilities should be achieving these three
goals by the application of a hierarchy of control measures, including (a) the use of administrative measures to reduce
the risk for exposure to persons who have infectious TB, (b) the use of engineering controls to prevent the spread and
reduce the concentration of infectious droplet nuclei, and (c) the use of personal respiratory protective equipment
in areas where there is still a risk for exposure to 

M. tuberculosis

 (e.g., TB isolation rooms). Implementation of a TB infection-control program requires risk assessment and development
of a TB infection-control plan; early identification, treatment, and isolation of infectious TB patients; effective
engineering controls; an appropriate respiratory protection program; HCW TB training, education, counseling,
and screening; and evaluation of the program's effectiveness. 

Although completely eliminating the risk for transmission of 

M. tuberculosis

 in all health-care facilities may not be possible at the present time, adherence to these guidelines should reduce
the risk to persons in these settings. Recently, nosocomial TB outbreaks have demonstrated the substantial morbidity
and mortality among patients and HCWs that have been associated with incomplete implementation of CDC's 

Guidelines for Preventing the Transmission of Tuberculosis in Health-Care Facilities, with Special Focus on HIV-Related
Issues

 published in 1990.* Follow-up investigations at some of these hospitals have documented that complete implementation
of measures similar or identical to those in the 

1990 TB Guidelines 

significantly reduced or eliminated nosocomial transmission of 

M. tuberculosis 

to patients and/or HCWs.






I. Introduction 


A. Purpose of Document 



In April 1992, the National MDR-TB Task Force published the 

National Action Plan to Combat Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis 

(

1

). The publication was a response to reported nosocomial outbreaks of tuberculosis (TB), including outbreaks of
multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), and the increasing incidence of TB in some geographic areas. The plan called
for the update and revision of the guidelines for preventing nosocomial transmission of 

Mycobacterium tuberculosis

 published December 7, 1990 (

2

). 


Public meetings were held in October 1992 and January 1993 to discuss revision of the 

1990 TB Guidelines

 (

2

). CDC received considerable input on various aspects of infection control, including health-care worker (HCW)
education; administrative controls (e.g., having protocols for the early identification and management of patients
who have TB); the need for more specific recommendations regarding ventilation; and clarification on the use of respiratory
protection in health-care settings. On the basis of these events and the input received, on October 12, 1993, CDC published
in the 

Federal Register

 the 

Draft Guidelines For Preventing the Transmission of Tuberculosis in Health-Care Facilities, Second Edition 

(

3

). During and after the 90-day comment period following publication of this draft, CDC's TB Infection-Control Guidelines
Work Group received and reviewed more than 2,500 comments. 


The purpose of this document is to make recommendations for reducing the risk for transmitting 

M. tuberculosis 

to HCWs, patients, volunteers, visitors, and other persons in these settings. The information also may serve as a
useful resource for educating HCWs about TB. 

These recommendations update and replace all previously published CDC recommendations for TB infection control
in health-care facilities (

2, 4

). The recommendations in this document are applicable primarily to inpatient facilities in which health care is
provided (e.g., hospitals, medical wards in correctional facilities, nursing homes, and hospices). Recommendations
applicable to ambulatory-care facilities, emergency departments, home-health-care settings, emergency medical
services, medical offices, dental settings, and other facilities or residential settings that provide medical
care are provided in separate sections, with cross-references to other sections of the guidelines if appropriate.


Designated personnel at health-care facilities should conduct a risk assessment for the entire facility and for
each area* and occupational group, determine the risk for nosocomial or occupational transmission of 

M. tuberculosis,

 and implement an appropriate TB infection-control program. The extent of the TB infection-control program may range
from a simple program emphasizing administrative controls in settings where there is minimal risk for exposure to


M. tuberculosis,

 to a comprehensive program that includes administrative controls, engineering controls, and respiratory protection
in settings where the risk for exposure is high. In all settings, administrative measures should be used to minimize
the number of HCWs exposed to 

M. tuberculosis

 while still providing optimal care for TB patients. HCWs providing care to patients who have TB should be informed
about the level of risk for transmission of 

M. tuberculosis 

and the appropriate control measures to minimize that risk.




In this document, the term ``HCWs'' refers to all the paid and unpaid persons working in health-care settings who have
the potential for exposure to 

M. tuberculosis.

 This may include, but is not limited to, physicians; nurses; aides; dental workers; technicians; workers in laboratories
and morgues; emergency medical service (EMS) personnel; students; part-time personnel; temporary staff not employed
by the health-care facility; and persons not involved directly in patient care but who are potentially at risk for
occupational exposure to 

M. tuberculosis

 (e.g., volunteer workers and dietary, housekeeping, maintenance, clerical, and janitorial staff). 

Although the purpose of this document is to make recommendations for reducing the risk for transmission of 

M. tuberculosis

 in health-care facilities, the process of implementing these recommendations must safeguard, in accordance with
applicable state and federal laws, the confidentiality and civil rights of persons who have TB.

B. Epidemiology, Transmission, and Pathogenesis of TB 



The prevalence of TB is not distributed evenly throughout all segments of the U.S. population. Some subgroups or persons
have a higher risk for TB either because they are more likely than other persons in the general population to have been
exposed to and infected with 

M. tuberculosis 

or because their infection is more likely to progress to active TB after they have been infected (

5

). In some cases, both of these factors may be present. Groups of persons known to have a higher prevalence of TB infection
include contacts of persons who have active TB, foreign-born persons from areas of the world with a high prevalence
of TB (e.g., Asia, Africa, the Caribbean, and Latin America), medically underserved populations (e.g., some African-Americans,
Hispanics, Asians and Pacific Islanders, American Indians, and Alaskan Natives), homeless persons, current or
former correctional-facility inmates, alcoholics, injecting-drug users, and the elderly. Groups with a higher
risk for progression from latent TB infection to active disease include persons who have been infected recently (i.e.,
within the previous 2 years), children less than <4 years of age, persons with fibrotic lesions on chest radiographs,
and persons with certain medical conditions (i.e., human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection, silicosis, gastrectomy
or jejuno-ileal bypass, being "10% below ideal body weight, chronic renal failure with renal dialysis, diabetes
mellitus, immunosuppression resulting from receipt of high-dose corticosteroid or other immunosuppressive therapy,
and some malignancies) (

5

). 



M. tuberculosis 

is carried in airborne particles, or droplet nuclei, that can be generated when persons who have pulmonary or laryngeal
TB sneeze, cough, speak, or sing (

6

). The particles are an estimated 1-5  u m in size, and normal air currents can keep them airborne for prolonged
time periods and spread them throughout a room or building (

7

). Infection occurs when a susceptible person inhales droplet nuclei containing 

M. tuberculosis

, and these droplet nuclei traverse the mouth or nasal passages, upper respiratory tract, and bronchi to reach the
alveoli of the lungs. Once in the alveoli, the organisms are taken up by alveolar macrophages and spread throughout
the body. Usually within 2-10 weeks after initial infection with 

M. tuberculosis

, the immune response limits further multiplication and spread of the tubercle bacilli; however, some of the bacilli
remain dormant and viable for many years. This condition is referred to as latent TB infection. Persons with latent
TB infection usually have positive purified protein derivative (PPD)-tuberculin skin-test results, but they do
not have symptoms of active TB, and they are not infectious. 

In general, persons who become infected with 

M. tuberculosis 

have approximately a 10% risk for developing active TB during their lifetimes. This risk is greatest during the first
2 years after infection. Immunocompromised persons have a greater risk for the progression of latent TB infection
to active TB disease; HIV infection is the strongest known risk factor for this progression. Persons with latent TB
infection who become coinfected with HIV have approximately an 8%-10% risk per year for developing active TB
(

8

). HIV-infected persons who are already severely immunosuppressed and who become newly infected with 

M. tuberculosis 

have an even greater risk for developing active TB (

9-12

). 

The probability that a person who is exposed to 

M. tuberculosis 

will become infected depends primarily on the concentration of infectious droplet nuclei in the air and the duration
of exposure. Characteristics of the TB patient that enhance transmission include (a) disease in the lungs, airways,
or larynx; (b) presence of cough or other forceful expiratory measures; (c) presence of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) in
the sputum; (d) failure of the patient to cover the mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing; (e) presence of cavitation
on chest radiograph; (f) inappropriate or short duration of chemotherapy; and (g) administration of procedures
that can induce coughing or cause aerosolization of 

M. tuberculosis 

(e.g., sputum induction). Environmental factors that enhance the likelihood of transmission include (a) exposure
in relatively small, enclosed spaces; (b) inadequate local or general ventilation that results in insufficient
dilution and/or removal of infectious droplet nuclei; and (c) recirculation of air containing infectious droplet
nuclei. Characteristics of the persons exposed to 

M. tuberculosis 

that may affect the risk for becoming infected are not as well defined. In general, persons who have been infected previously
with 

M. tuberculosis 

may be less susceptible to subsequent infection. However, reinfection can occur among previously infected persons,
especially if they are severely immunocompromised. Vaccination with Bacille of Calmette and Gu&eacute;rin (BCG)
probably does not affect the risk for infection; rather, it decreases the risk for progressing from latent TB infection
to active TB (

13

). Finally, although it is well established that HIV infection increases the likelihood of progressing from latent
TB infection to active TB, it is unknown whether HIV infection increases the risk for becoming infected if exposed
to 

M. tuberculosis

. 



C. Risk for Nosocomial Transmission of 

M. Tuberclosis

 



Transmission of 

M. tuberclosis

 is a recognized risk in health-care facilities (

14-22

). The magnitude of the risk varies considerably by the type of health-care facility, the prevalence of TB in the community,
the patient population served, the HCW's occupational group, the area of the health-care facility in which the HCW
works, and the effectiveness of TB infection-control interventions. The risk may be higher in areas where patients
with TB are provided care before diagnosis and initiation of TB treatment and isolation precautions (e.g., in clinic
waiting areas and emergency departments) or where diagnostic or treatment procedures that stimulate coughing are
performed. Nosocomial transmission of 

M. tuberclosis

 has been associated with close contact with persons who have infectious TB and with the performance of certain procedures
(e.g., bronchoscopy [

17

], endotracheal intubation and suctioning [

18

], open abscess irrigation [

20

], and autopsy [

21,22

]). Sputum induction and aerosol treatments that induce coughing may also increase the potential for transmission
of 

M. tuberclosis

 (

23,24

). Personnel of health-care facilities should be particularly alert to the need for preventing transmission of 

M. tuberclosis

 in those facilities in which immunocompromised persons (e.g., HIV-infected persons) work or receive care_especially
if cough-inducing procedures, such as sputum induction and aerosolized pentamidine treatments, are being performed.


Several TB outbreaks among persons in health-care facilities have been reported recently (

11,24-28

; CDC, unpublished data). Many of these outbreaks involved transmission of multidrug-resistant strains of 

M. tuberclosis

 to both patients and HCWs. Most of the patients and some of the HCWs were HIV-infected persons in whom new infection
progressed rapidly to active disease. Mortality associated with those outbreaks was high (range: 43%-93%).
Furthermore, the interval between diagnosis and death was brief (range of median intervals: 4-16 weeks). Factors
contributing to these outbreaks included delayed diagnosis of TB, delayed recognition of drug resistance, and delayed
initiation of effective therapy_all of which resulted in prolonged infectiousness, delayed initiation and inadequate
duration of TB isolation, inadequate ventilation in TB isolation rooms, lapses in TB isolation practices and inadequate
precautions for cough-inducing procedures, and lack of adequate respiratory protection. Analysis of data collected
from three of the health-care facilities involved in the outbreaks indicates that transmission of 

M. tuberclosis

 decreased significantly or ceased entirely in areas where measures similar to those in the 

1990 TB Guidelines 

were implemented (

2,29-32

). However, several interventions were implemented simultaneously, and the effectiveness of the separate interventions
could not be determined. 



D. Fundamentals of TB Infection Control 



An effective TB infection-control program requires early identification, isolation, and effective treatment
of persons who have active TB. The primary emphasis of the TB infection-control plan should be on achieving these three
goals. In all health-care facilities, particularly those in which persons who are at high risk for TB work or receive
care, policies and procedures for TB control should be developed, reviewed periodically, and evaluated for effectiveness
to determine the actions necessary to minimize the risk for transmission of 

M. tuberclosis

. 

The TB infection-control program should be based on a hierarchy of control measures. The first level of the hierarchy,
and that which affects the largest number of persons, is using administrative measures intended primarily to reduce
the risk for exposing uninfected persons to persons who have infectious TB. These measures include (a) developing
and implementing effective written policies and protocols to ensure the rapid identification, isolation, diagnostic
evaluation, and treatment of persons likely to have TB; (b) implementing effective work practices among HCWs in the
health-care facility (e.g., correctly wearing respiratory protection and keeping doors to isolation rooms closed);
(c) educating, training, and counseling HCWs about TB; and (d) screening HCWs for TB infection and disease.

The second level of the hierarchy is the use of engineering controls to prevent the spread and reduce the concentration
of infectious droplet nuclei. These controls include (a) direct source control using local exhaust ventilation,
(b) controlling direction of airflow to prevent contamination of air in areas adjacent to the infectious source,
(c) diluting and removing contaminated air via general ventilation, and (d) air cleaning via air filtration or ultraviolet
germicidal irradiation (UVGI). 

The first two levels of the hierarchy minimize the number of areas in the health-care facility where exposure to infectious
TB may occur, and they reduce, but do not eliminate, the risk in those few areas where exposure to 

M. tuberculosis

 can still occur (e.g., rooms in which patients with known or suspected infectious TB are being isolated and treatment
rooms in which cough-inducing or aerosol-generating procedures are performed on such patients). Because persons
entering such rooms may be exposed to 

M. tuberculosis

, the third level of the hierarchy is the use of personal respiratory protective equipment in these and certain other
situations in which the risk for infection with 

M. tuberculosis

 may be relatively higher. 

Specific measures to reduce the risk for transmission of 

M. tuberculosis

 include the following: 

 Assigning to specific persons in the health-care facility the supervisory responsibility for designing,
implementing, evaluating, and maintaining the TB infection-control program (Section II.A). 

 Conducting a risk assessment to evaluate the risk for transmission of 

M. tuberculosis

 in all areas of the health-care facility, developing a written TB infection-control program based on the risk assessment,
and periodically repeating the risk assessment to evaluate the effectiveness of the TB infection-control program
(Section II.B). 

 Developing, implementing, and enforcing policies and protocols to ensure early identification, diagnostic
evaluation, and effective treatment of patients who may have infectious TB (Section II.C; Suppl. 2). 

 Providing prompt triage for and appropriate management of patients in the outpatient setting who may have
infectious TB (Section II.D). 

 Promptly initiating and maintaining TB isolation for persons who may have infectious TB and who are admitted
to the inpatient setting (Section II.E; Suppl. 1). 

 Effectively planning arrangements for discharge (Section II.E). 

 Developing, installing, maintaining, and evaluating ventilation and other engineering controls to reduce
the potential for airborne exposure to 

M. tuberculosis

 (Section II.F; Suppl. 3). 

 Developing, implementing, maintaining, and evaluating a respiratory protection program (Section II.G;
Suppl. 4). 

 Using precautions while performing cough-inducing procedures (Section II.H; Suppl. 3). 

 Educating and training HCWs about TB, effective methods for preventing transmission of 

M. tuberculosis

, and the benefits of medical screening programs (Section II.I). 

 Developing and implementing a program for routine periodic counseling and screening of HCWs for active TB
and latent TB infection (Section II.J; Suppl. 2). 

 Promptly evaluating possible episodes of 

M. tuberculosis

 transmission in health-care facilities, including PPD skin-test conversions among HCWs, epidemiologically associated
cases among HCWs or patients, and contacts of patients or HCWs who have TB and who were not promptly identified and isolated
(Section II.K). 

 Coordinating activities with the local public health department, emphasizing reporting, and ensuring adequate
discharge follow-up and the continuation and completion of therapy (Section II.L). 



II. Recommendations 


A. Assignment of Responsibility 



 Supervisory responsibility for the TB infection-control program should be assigned to a designated person
or group of persons with expertise in infection control, occupational health, and engineering. These persons should
be given the authority to implement and enforce TB infection-control policies. 

 If supervisory responsibility is assigned to a committee, one person should be designated as the TB contact
person. Questions and problems can then be addressed to this person. 



B. Risk Assessment, Development of the TB Infection-Control Plan, and Periodic Reassessment 

1. Risk Assessment 



a. General. 

 TB infection-control measures for each health-care facility should be based on a careful assessment of the
risk for transmission of 

M. tuberculosis

 in that particular setting. The first step in developing the TB infection-control program should be to conduct a baseline
risk assessment to evaluate the risk for transmission of 

M. tuberculosis

 in each area and occupational group in the facility (Table 1, Figure 1). Appropriate infection-control interventions
can then be developed on the basis of actual risk. Risk assessments should be performed for all inpatient and outpatient
settings (e.g., medical and dental offices). 

 Regardless of risk level, the management of patients with known or suspected infectious TB should not vary.
However, the index of suspicion for infectious TB among patients, the frequency of HCW PPD skin testing, the number
of TB isolation rooms, and other factors will depend on whether the risk for transmission of 

M. tuberculosis

 in the facility, area, or occupational group is high, intermediate, low, very low, or minimal. 

 The risk assessment should be conducted by a qualified person or group of persons (e.g., hospital epidemiologists,
infectious disease specialists, pulmonary disease specialists, infection-control practitioners, health-care
administrators, occupational health personnel, engineers, HCWs, or local public health personnel). 

 The risk assessment should be conducted for the entire facility and for specific areas within the facility
(e.g., medical, TB, pulmonary, or HIV wards; HIV, infectious disease, or pulmonary clinics; and emergency departments
or other areas where TB patients might receive care or where cough-inducing procedures are performed). This should
include both inpatient and outpatient areas. In addition, risk assessments should be conducted for groups of HCWs
who work throughout the facility rather than in a specific area (e.g., respiratory therapists; bronchoscopists;
environmental services, dietary, and maintenance personnel; and students, interns, residents, and fellows).


 Classification of risk for a facility, for a specific area, and for a specific occupational group should be
based on (a) the profile of TB in the community; (b) the number of infectious TB patients admitted to the area or ward,
or the estimated number of infectious TB patients to whom HCWs in an occupational group may be exposed; and (c) the results
of analysis of HCW PPD test conversions (where applicable) and possible person-to-person transmission of 

M. tuberculosis

 (Figure 1). 

 All TB infection-control programs should include periodic reassessments of risk. The frequency of repeat
risk assessments should be based on the results of the most recent risk assessment (Table 2, Figure 1). 

 The ``minimal-risk'' category applies only to an entire facility. A ``minimal-risk'' facility does not admit
TB patients to inpatient or outpatient areas and is not located in a community with TB (i.e., counties or communities
in which TB cases have not been reported during the previous year). Thus, there is essentially no risk for exposure
to TB patients in the facility. This category may also apply to many outpatient settings (e.g., many medical and dental
offices).

Table 1. Elements of a Risk Assessment for Tuberculosis (TB) in Health-care Facilities


1. Review the community TB profile (from public health department data).
2. Review the number of TB patients who were treated in each area of the facility (both inpatient and outpatient). (This
information can be obtained by analyzing laboratory surveillance data and by reviewing discharge diagnoses or medical
and infection-control records.)
3. Review the drug-susceptibility patterns of TB isolates of patients who were treated at the facility.
4. Analyze purified protein derivative (PPD)-tuberculin skin-test results of health-care workers (HCWs), by area
or by occupational group for HCWs not assigned to specific area (e.g., respiratory therapists).
5. To evaluate infection-control parameters, review medical records of a sample of TB patients seen at the facility.



Calculate Intervals From


 Admission until TB suspected;
 Admission until TB evaluation performed;
 Admission until acid-fast bacilli (AFB) specimens ordered;
 AFB specimens ordered until AFB specimens collected;
 AFB specimens collected until AFB smears performed and reported;
 AFB specimens collected until cultures performed and reported;
 AFB specimens collected until species identification conducted and reported; 
 AFB specimens collected until drug-susceptibility tests performed and reported;
 Admission until TB isolation initiated;
 Admission until TB treatment initiated; and
 Duration of TB isolation.



Obtain the Following Additional Information



 Were appropriate criteria used for discontinuing isolation?
 Did the patient have a history of prior admission to the facility?
 Was the TB treatment regimen adequate?
 Were follow-up sputum specimens collected properly?
 Was appropriate discharge planning conducted?
6. Perform an observational review of TB infection control practices.
7. Review the most recent environmental evaluation and maintenance procedures.

 The ``very low-risk'' category generally applies only to an entire facility. A very low-risk facility is one
in which (a) patients with active TB are not admitted to inpatient areas but may receive initial assessment and diagnostic
evaluation or outpatient management in outpatient areas (e.g., ambulatory-care and emergency departments) and
(b) patients who may have active TB and need inpatient care are promptly referred to a collaborating facility. In such
facilities, the outpatient areas in which exposure to patients with active TB could occur should be assessed and assigned
to the appropriate low-, intermediate-, or high-risk category. Categorical assignment will depend on the number
of TB patients examined in the area during the preceding year and whether there is evidence of nosocomial transmission
of 

M. tuberculosis

 in the area. If TB cases have been reported in the community, but no patients with active TB have been examined in the
outpatient area during the preceding year, the area can be designated as very low risk (e.g., many medical offices).

The referring and receiving facilities should establish a referral agreement to prevent inappropriate management
and potential loss to follow-up of patients suspected of having TB during evaluation in the triage system of a very
low-risk facility. 
In some facilities in which TB patients are admitted to inpatient areas, a very low-risk protocol may be appropriate
for areas (e.g., administrative areas) or occupational groups that have only a very remote possibility of exposure
to 

M. tuberculosis

. 
The very low-risk category may also be appropriate for outpatient facilities that do not provide initial assessment
of persons who may have TB, but do screen patients for active TB as part of a limited medical screening before undertaking
specialty care (e.g., dental settings). 
 ``Low-risk'' areas or occupational groups are those in which (a) the PPD test conversion rate is not greater
than that for areas or groups in which occupational exposure to 

M. tuberculosis

 is unlikely or than previous conversion rates for the same area or group, (b) no clusters* of PPD test conversions have
occurred, (c) person-to-person transmission of 

M. tuberculosis

 has not been detected, and (d) fewer than six TB patients are examined or treated per year.




 ``Intermediate-risk'' areas or occupational groups are those in which (a) the PPD test conversion rate is
not greater than that for areas or groups in which occupational exposure to 

M. tuberculosis

 is unlikely or than previous conversion rates for the same area or group, (b) no clusters of PPD test conversions have
occurred, (c) person-to-person transmission of 

M. tuberculosis)

 has not been detected, and (d) six or more patients with active TB are examined or treated each year. Survey data suggest
that facilities in which six or more TB patients are examined or treated each year may have an increased risk for transmission
of 

M. tuberculosis

 (CDC, unpublished data); thus, areas in which six or more patients with active TB are examined or treated each year
(or occupational groups in which HCWs are likely to be exposed to six or more TB patients per year) should be classified
as ``intermediate risk.'' 
 ``High-risk'' areas or occupational groups are those in which (a) the PPD test conversion rate is significantly
greater than for areas or groups in which occupational exposure to 

M. tuberculosis

 is unlikely or than previous conversion rates for the same area or group, and epidemiologic evaluation suggests nosocomial
transmission; or (b) a cluster of PPD test conversions has occurred, and epidemiologic evaluation suggests nosocomial
transmission of 

M. tuberculosis

; or (c) possible person-to-person transmission of 

M. tuberculosis

 has been detected. 
 If no data or insufficient data for adequate determination of risk have been collected, such data should be
compiled, analyzed, and reviewed expeditiously. 
b. Community TB profile.
 A profile of TB in the community that is served by the facility should be obtained from the public health department.
This profile should include, at a minimum, the incidence (and prevalence, if available) of active TB in the community
and the drug-susceptibility patterns of 

M. tuberculosis

 isolates (i.e., the antituberculous agents to which each isolate is susceptible and those to which it is resistant)
from patients in the community. 
c. Case surveillance.
 Data concerning the number of suspected and confirmed active TB cases among patients and HCWs in the facility
should be systematically collected, reviewed, and used to estimate the number of TB isolation rooms needed, to recognize
possible clusters of nosocomial transmission, and to assess the level of potential occupational risk. The number
of TB patients in specific areas of a facility can be obtained from laboratory surveillance data on specimens positive
for AFB smears or 

M. tuberculosis

 cultures, from infection-control records, and from databases containing information about hospital discharge
diagnoses. 
 Drug-susceptibility patterns of 

M. tuberculosis

 isolates from TB patients treated in the facility should be reviewed to identify the frequency and patterns of drug
resistance. This information may indicate a need to modify the initial treatment regimen or may suggest possible
nosocomial transmission or increased occupational risk. 
d. Analysis of HCW PPD test screening data.
 Results of HCW PPD testing should be recorded in the individual HCW's employee health record and in a retrievable
aggregate database of all HCW PPD test results. Personal identifying information should be handled confidentially.
PPD test conversion rates should be calculated at appropriate intervals to estimate the risk for PPD test conversions
for each area of the facility and for each specific occupational group not assigned to a specific area (Table 2). To
calculate PPD test conversion rates, the total number of previously PPD-negative HCWs tested in each area or group
(i.e., the denominator) and the number of PPD test conversions among HCWs in each area or group (the numerator) must
be obtained. 
 PPD test conversion rates for each area or occupational group should be compared with rates for areas or groups
in which occupational exposure to 

M. tuberculosis

 is unlikely and with previous conversion rates in the same area or group to identify areas or groups where the risk for
occupational PPD test conversions may be increased. A low number of HCWs in a specific area may result in a greatly increased
rate of conversion for that area, although the actual risk may not be significantly greater than that for other areas.
Testing for statistical significance (e.g., Fisher's exact test or chi square test) may assist interpretation;
however, lack of statistical significance may not rule out a problem (i.e., if the number of HCWs tested is low, there
may not be adequate statistical power to detect a significant difference). Thus, interpretation of individual situations
is necessary. 
 An epidemiologic investigation to evaluate the likelihood of nosocomial transmission should be conducted
if PPD test conversions are noted (Section II.K.1). 
 The frequency and comprehensiveness of the HCW PPD testing program should be evaluated periodically to ensure
that all HCWs who should be included in the program are being tested at appropriate intervals. For surveillance purposes,
earlier detection of transmission may be enhanced if HCWs in a given area or occupational group are tested on different
scheduled dates rather than all being tested on the same date (Section II.J.3). 
e. Review of TB patient medical records.
 The medical records of a sample of TB patients examined at the facility can be reviewed periodically to evaluate
infection-control parameters (Table 1). Parameters to examine may include the intervals from date of admission
until (a) TB was suspected, (b) specimens for AFB smears were ordered, (c) these specimens were collected, (d) tests
were performed, and (e) results were reported. Moreover, the adequacy of the TB treatment regimens that were used
should be evaluated. 
 Medical record reviews should note previous hospital admissions of TB patients before the onset of TB symptoms.
Patient-to-patient transmission may be suspected if active TB occurs in a patient who had a prior hospitalization
during which exposure to another TB patient occurred or if isolates from two or more TB patients have identical characteristic
drug-susceptibility or DNA fingerprint patterns.

 Data from the case review should be used to determine if there is a need to modify (a) protocols for identifying
and isolating patients who may have infectious TB, (b) laboratory procedures, (c) administrative policies and practices,
or (d) protocols for patient management. 
f. Observation of TB infection-control practices.
 Assessing adherence to the policies of the TB infection-control program should be part of the evaluation process.
This assessment should be performed on a regular basis and whenever an increase occurs in the number of TB patients
or HCW PPD test conversions. Areas at high risk for transmission of 

M. tuberculosis

 should be monitored more frequently than other areas. The review of patient medical records provides information
on HCW adherence to some of the policies of the TB infection-control program. In addition, work practices related
to TB isolation (e.g., keeping doors to isolation rooms closed) should be observed to determine if employers are enforcing,
and HCWs are adhering to, these policies and if patient adherence is being enforced. If these policies are not being
enforced or adhered to, appropriate education and other corrective action should be implemented. 
g. Engineering evaluation 
 Results of engineering maintenance measures should be reviewed at regular intervals (Table 3). Data from
the most recent evaluation and from maintenance procedures and logs should be reviewed carefully as part of the risk
assessment. 


2. Development of the TB Infection-Control Plan 


 Based on the results of the risk assessment, a written TB infection-control plan should be developed and implemented
for each area of the facility and for each occupational group of HCWs not assigned to a specific area of the facility
(Table 2; Table 3). 
 The occurrence of drug-resistant TB in the facility or the community, or a relatively high prevalence of HIV
infection among patients or HCWs in the community, may increase the concern about transmission of 

M. tuberculosis

 and may influence the decision regarding which protocol to follow (i.e., a higher-risk classification may be selected).

 Health-care facilities are likely to have a combination of low-, intermediate-, and high-risk areas or occupational
groups during the same time period. The appropriate protocol should be implemented for each area or group. 
 Areas in which cough-inducing procedures are performed on patients who may have active TB should, at the minimum,
implement the intermediate-risk protocol. 


3. Periodic Reassessment 


 Follow-up risk assessment should be performed at the interval indicated by the most recent risk assessment
(Figure 1; Table 2). Based on the results of the follow-up assessment, problem evaluation may need to be conducted
or the protocol may need to be modified to a higher- or lower-risk level.

<TEXT>
 

 After each risk assessment, the staff responsible for TB control, in conjunction with other appropriate HCWs,
should review all TB control policies to ensure that they are effective and meet current needs. 


4. Examples of Risk Assessment 


Examples of six hypothetical situations and the means by which surveillance data are used to select a TB control protocol
are described as follows: 
Hospital A. The overall HCW PPD test conversion rate in the facility is 1.6%. No areas or HCW occupational groups have
a significantly greater PPD test conversion rate than areas or groups in which occupational exposure to M. tuberculosis


is unlikely (or than previous rates for the same area or group). No clusters of PPD test conversions have occurred.
Patient-to-patient transmission has not been detected. Patients who have TB are admitted to the facility, but no
area admits six or more TB patients per year. The low-risk protocol will be followed in all areas. 
Hospital B. The overall HCW PPD test conversion rate in the facility is 1.8%. The PPD test conversion rate for the medical
intensive-care unit rate is significantly higher than all other areas in the facility. The problem identification
process is initiated (Section II.K). It is determined that all TB patients have been isolated appropriately. Other
potential problems are then evaluated, and the cause for the higher rate is not identified. After consulting the public
health department TB infection-control program, the high-risk protocol is followed in the unit until the PPD test
conversion rate is similar to areas of the facility in which occupational exposure to TB patients is unlikely. If the
rate remains significantly higher than other areas, further evaluation, including environmental and procedural
studies, will be performed to identify possible reasons for the high conversion rate. 
Hospital C. The overall HCW PPD test conversion rate in the facility is 2.4%. Rates range from 0 to 2.6% for the individual
areas and occupational groups. None of these rates is significantly higher than rates for areas in which occupational
exposure to 

M. tuberculosis 

is unlikely. No particular HCW group has higher conversion rates than the other groups. No clusters of HCW PPD test
conversions have occurred. In two of the areas, HCWs cared for more than six TB patients during the preceding year.
These two areas will follow the intermediate-risk protocol, and all other areas will follow the low-risk protocol.
This hospital is located in the southeastern United States, and these conversion rates may reflect cross-reactivity
with nontuberculous mycobacteria. 
Hospital D. The overall HCW PPD test conversion rate in the facility is 1.2%. In no area did HCWs care for six or more TB
patients during the preceding year. Three of the 20 respiratory therapists tested had PPD conversions, for a rate
of 15%. The respiratory therapists who had PPD test conversions had spent all or part of their time in the pulmonary
function laboratory, where induced sputum specimens were obtained. A low-risk protocol is maintained for all areas
and occupational groups in the facility except for respiratory therapists. A problem evaluation is conducted in
the pulmonary function laboratory (Section II.K). It is determined that the ventilation in this area is inadequate.
Booths are installed for sputum induction. PPD testing and the risk assessment are repeated 3 months later. If the
repeat testing at 3 months indicates that no more conversions have occurred, the respiratory therapists will return
to the low-risk protocol. 
Hospital E. Hospital E is located in a community that has a relatively low incidence of TB. To optimize TB services in
the community, the four hospitals in the community have developed an agreement that one of them (e.g., Hospital G)
will provide all inpatient services to persons who have suspected or confirmed TB. The other hospitals have implemented
protocols in their ambulatory-care clinics and emergency departments to identify patients who may have active TB.
These patients are then transferred to Hospital G for inpatient care if such care is considered necessary. After discharge
from Hospital G, they receive follow-up care in the public health department's TB clinic. During the preceding year,
Hospital E has identified fewer than six TB patients in its ambulatory-care and emergency departments and has had
no PPD test conversions or other evidence of 

M. tuberculosis 

transmission among HCWs or patients in these areas. These areas are classified as low risk, and all other areas are
classified as very low risk. 
Hospital F. Hospital F is located in a county in which no TB cases have been reported during the preceding 2 years. A risk
assessment conducted at the facility did not identify any patients who had suspected or confirmed TB during the preceding
year. The facility is classified as minimal risk. 


C. Identifying, Evaluating, and Initiating Treatment for Patients Who May Have Active TB 


The most important factors in preventing transmission of 

M. tuberculosis 

are the early identification of patients who may have infectious TB, prompt implementation of TB precautions for
such patients, and prompt initiation of effective treatment for those who are likely to have TB. 


1. Identifying Patients Who May Have Active TB 


 Health-care personnel who are assigned responsibility for TB infection control in ambulatory-care and inpatient
settings should develop, implement, and enforce protocols for the early identification of patients who may have
infectious TB.

<TEXT>
 

 The criteria used in these protocols should be based on the prevalence and characteristics of TB in the population
served by the specific facility. These protocols should be evaluated periodically and revised according to the results
of the evaluation. Review of medical records of patients who were examined in the facility and diagnosed as having
TB may serve as a guide for developing or revising these protocols. 
 A diagnosis of TB may be considered for any patient who has a persistent cough (i.e., a cough lasting for "3 weeks)
or other signs or symptoms compatible with active TB (e.g., bloody sputum, night sweats, weight loss, anorexia, or
fever). However, the index of suspicion for TB will vary in different geographic areas and will depend on the prevalence
of TB and other characteristics of the population served by the facility. The index of suspicion for TB should be very
high in geographic areas or among groups of patients in which the prevalence of TB is high (Section I.B). Appropriate
diagnostic measures should be conducted and TB precautions implemented for patients in whom active TB is suspected.



2. Diagnostic Evaluation for Active TB 


 Diagnostic measures for identifying TB should be conducted for patients in whom active TB is being considered.
These measures include obtaining a medical history and performing a physical examination, PPD skin test, chest radiograph,
and microscopic examination and culture of sputum or other appropriate specimens (

6,34,35

). Other diagnostic procedures (e.g., bronchoscopy or biopsy) may be indicated for some patients (

36,37

). 
 Prompt laboratory results are crucial to the proper treatment of the TB patient and to early initiation of infection
control. To ensure timely results, laboratories performing mycobacteriologic tests should be proficient at both
the laboratory and administrative aspects of specimen processing. Laboratories should use the most rapid methods
available (e.g., fluorescent microscopy for AFB smears; radiometric culture methods for isolation of mycobacteria;


r

-nitro-




-acetylamino-




-hydroxy-proprophenone [NAP] test, nucleic acid probes, or high-pressure liquid chromatography [HPLC] for species
identification; and radiometric methods for drug-susceptibility testing). As other more rapid or sensitive tests
become available, practical, and affordable, such tests should be incorporated promptly into the mycobacteriology
laboratory. Laboratories that rarely receive specimens for mycobacteriologic analysis should refer the specimens
to a laboratory that more frequently performs these tests. 
 Results of AFB sputum smears should be available within 24 hours of specimen collection (

38

). 
 The probability of TB is greater among patients who have positive PPD test results or a history of positive PPD
test results, who have previously had TB or have been exposed to 

M. tuberculosis, 

or who belong to a group at high risk for TB (Section I.B). Active TB is strongly suggested if the diagnostic evaluation
reveals AFB in sputum, a chest radiograph suggestive of TB, or symptoms highly suggestive of TB. TB can occur simultaneously
in immunosuppressed persons who have pulmonary infections caused by other organisms (e.g., 

Pneumocystis carinii 

or 

Mycobacterium avium 

complex) and should be considered in the diagnostic evaluation of all patients who have symptoms compatible with
TB (Suppl. 1; Suppl. 2). 
 TB may be more difficult to diagnose among persons who have HIV infection (or other conditions associated with
severe suppression of cell-mediated immunity) because of a nonclassical clinical or radiographic presentation
and/or the simultaneous occurrence of other pulmonary infections (e.g., 

P. carinii 

pneumonia and 

M. avium 

complex). The difficulty in diagnosing TB in HIV-infected persons may be further compounded by impaired responses
to PPD skin tests (

39,40

), the possibly lower sensitivity of sputum smears for detecting AFB (

41

), or the overgrowth of cultures with 

M. avium 

complex in specimens from patients infected with both 

M. avium 

complex and 

M. tuberculosis 

(

42

). 
 Immunosuppressed patients who have pulmonary signs or symptoms that are ascribed initially to infections
or conditions other than TB should be evaluated initially for coexisting TB. The evaluation for TB should be repeated
if the patient does not respond to appropriate therapy for the presumed cause(s) of the pulmonary abnormalities (Suppl.
1; Suppl. 2). 
 Patients with suspected or confirmed TB should be reported immediately to the appropriate public health department
so that standard procedures for identifying and evaluating TB contacts can be initiated. 


3. Initiation of Treatment for Suspected or Confirmed TB 


 Patients who have confirmed active TB or who are considered highly likely to have active TB should be started
promptly on appropriate treatment in accordance with current guidelines (Suppl. 2) (

43

). In geographic areas or facilities that have a high prevalence of MDR-TB, the initial regimen used may need to be enhanced
while the results of drug-susceptibility tests are pending. The decision should be based on analysis of surveillance
data. 
 While the patient is in the health-care facility, anti-TB drugs should be administered by directly observed
therapy (DOT), the process by which an HCW observes the patient swallowing the medications. Continuing DOT after
the patient is discharged should be strongly considered. This decision and the arrangements for providing outpatient
DOT should be made in collaboration with the public health department. 


D. Management of Patients Who May Have Active TB in Ambulatory-Care Settings and Emergency Departments 


 Triage of patients in ambulatory-care settings and emergency departments should include vigorous efforts
to promptly identify patients who have active TB. HCWs who are the first points of contact in facilities that serve
populations at risk for TB should be trained to ask questions that will facilitate identification of patients with
signs and symptoms suggestive of TB. 
 Patients with signs or symptoms suggestive of TB should be evaluated promptly to minimize the amount of time
they are in ambulatory-care areas. TB precautions should be followed while the diagnostic evaluation is being conducted
for these patients. 
 TB precautions in the ambulatory-care setting should include (a) placing these patients in a separate area
apart from other patients, and not in open waiting areas (ideally, in a room or enclosure meeting TB isolation requirements);
(b) giving these patients surgical masks* to wear and instructing them to keep their masks on; and (c) giving these
patients tissues and instructing them to cover their mouths and noses with the tissues when coughing or sneezing.





 TB precautions should be followed for patients who are known to have active TB and who have not completed therapy
until a determination has been made that they are noninfectious (Suppl. 1). 
 Patients with active TB who need to attend a health-care clinic should have appointments scheduled to avoid
exposing HIV-infected or otherwise severely immunocompromised persons to 

M. tuberculosis. 

This recommendation could be accomplished by designating certain times of the day for appointments for these patients
or by treating them in areas where immunocompromised persons are not treated. 
 Ventilation in ambulatory-care areas where patients at high risk for TB are treated should be designed and
maintained to reduce the risk for transmission of 

M. tuberculosis. 

General-use areas (e.g., waiting rooms) and special areas (e.g., treatment or TB isolation rooms in ambulatory areas)
should be ventilated in the same manner as described for similar inpatient areas (Sections II.E.3, II.F; Suppl. 3).
Enhanced general ventilation or the use of air-disinfection techniques (e.g., UVGI or recirculation of air within
the room through high-efficiency particulate air [HEPA] filters) may be useful in general-use areas of facilities
where many infectious TB patients receive care (Section II.F; Suppl. 3). 
 Ideally, ambulatory-care settings in which patients with TB are frequently examined or treated should have
a TB isolation room(s) available. Such rooms are not necessary in ambulatory-care settings in which patients who
have confirmed or suspected TB are seen infrequently. However, these facilities should have a written protocol for
early identification of patients with TB symptoms and referral to an area or a collaborating facility where the patient
can be evaluated and managed appropriately. These protocols should be reviewed on a regular basis and revised as necessary.
The additional guidelines in Section II.H should be followed in ambulatory-care settings where cough-inducing
procedures are performed on patients who may have active TB.

E. Management of Hospitalized Patients Who Have Confirmed or Suspected TB 

1. Initiation of Isolation for TB 


 In hospitals and other inpatient facilities, any patient suspected of having or known to have infectious TB
should be placed in a TB isolation room that has currently recommended ventilation characteristics (Section II.E.3;
Suppl. 3). Written policies for initiating isolation should specify (a) the indications for isolation, (b) the person(s)
authorized to initiate and discontinue isolation, (c) the isolation practices to follow, (d) the monitoring of isolation,
(e) the management of patients who do not adhere to isolation practices, and (f) the criteria for discontinuing isolation.


 In rare circumstances, placing more than one TB patient together in the same room may be acceptable. This practice
is sometimes referred to as ``cohorting.'' Because of the risk for patients becoming superinfected with drug-resistant
organisms, patients with TB should be placed in the same room only if all patients involved (a) have culture-confirmed
TB, (b) have drug-susceptibility test results available on a current specimen obtained during the present hospitalization,
(c) have identical drug-susceptibility patterns on these specimens, and (d) are on effective therapy. Having isolates
with identical DNA fingerprint patterns is not adequate evidence for placing two TB patients together in the same
room, because isolates with the same DNA fingerprint pattern can have different drug-susceptibility patterns.


 Pediatric patients with suspected or confirmed TB should be evaluated for potential infectiousness according
to the same criteria as are adults (i.e., on the basis of symptoms, sputum AFB smears, radiologic findings, and other
criteria) (Suppl. 1). Children who may be infectious should be placed in isolation until they are determined to be
noninfectious. Pediatric patients who may be infectious include those who have laryngeal or extensive pulmonary
involvement, pronounced cough, positive sputum AFB smears, or cavitary TB or those for whom cough-inducing procedures
are performed (

44

). 
 The source of infection for a child with TB is often a member of the child's family (

45

). Therefore, parents and other visitors of all pediatric TB patients should be evaluated for TB as soon as possible.
Until they have been evaluated, or the source case is identified, they should wear surgical masks when in areas of the
facility outside of the child's room, and they should refrain from visiting common areas in the facility (e.g., the
cafeteria or lounge areas). 

 TB patients in intensive-care units should be treated the same as patients in noncritical-care settings.
They should be placed in TB isolation and have respiratory secretions submitted for AFB smear and culture if they have
undiagnosed pulmonary symptoms suggestive of TB. 
 If readmitted to a health-care facility, patients who are known to have active TB and who have not completed
therapy should have TB precautions applied until a determination has been made that they are noninfectious (Suppl.
1). 



2. TB Isolation Practices 



 Patients who are placed in TB isolation should be educated about the mechanisms of 

M. tuberculosis 

transmission and the reasons for their being placed in isolation. They should be taught to cover their mouths and noses
with a tissue when coughing or sneezing, even while in the isolation room, to contain liquid drops and droplets before
they are expelled into the air (

46

). 

 Efforts should be made to facilitate patient adherence to isolation measures (e.g., staying in the TB isolation
room). Such efforts might include the use of incentives (e.g., providing them with telephones, televisions, or radios
in their rooms or allowing special dietary requests). Efforts should also be made to address other problems that could
interfere with adherence to isolation (e.g., management of the patient's withdrawal from addictive substances
[including tobacco]). 
 Patients placed in isolation should remain in their isolation rooms with the door closed. If possible, diagnostic
and treatment procedures should be performed in the isolation rooms to avoid transporting patients through other
areas of the facility. If patients who may have infectious TB must be transported outside their isolation rooms for
medically essential procedures that cannot be performed in the isolation rooms, they should wear surgical masks
that cover their mouths and noses during transport. Persons transporting the patients do not need to wear respiratory
protection outside the TB isolation rooms. Procedures for these patients should be scheduled at times when they can
be performed rapidly and when waiting areas are less crowded. 
 Treatment and procedure rooms in which patients who have infectious TB or who have an undiagnosed pulmonary
disease and are at high risk for active TB receive care should meet the ventilation recommendations for isolation
rooms (Section II.E.3; Suppl. 3). Ideally, facilities in which TB patients are frequently treated should have an
area in the radiology department that is ventilated separately for TB patients. If this is not possible, TB patients
should wear surgical masks and should stay in the radiology suite the minimum amount of time possible, then be returned
promptly to their isolation rooms. 
 The number of persons entering an isolation room should be minimal. All persons who enter an isolation room
should wear respiratory protection (Section II.G; Suppl. 4). The patient's visitors should be given respirators
to wear while in the isolation room, and they should be given general instructions on how to use their respirators.

 Disposable items contaminated with respiratory secretions are not associated with transmission of 

M. tuberculosis. 

However, for general infection-control purposes, these items should be handled and transported in a manner that
reduces the risk for transmitting other microorganisms to patients, HCWs, and visitors and that decreases environmental
contamination in the health-care facility. Such items should be disposed of in accordance with hospital policy and
applicable regulations (Suppl. 5). 


3. The TB Isolation Room 



 TB isolation rooms should be single-patient rooms with special ventilation characteristics appropriate
for the purposes of isolation (Suppl. 3). The primary purposes of TB isolation rooms are to (a) separate patients who
are likely to have infectious TB from other persons; (b) provide an environment that will allow reduction of the concentration
of droplet nuclei through various engineering methods; and (c) prevent the escape of droplet nuclei from the TB isolation
room and treatment room, thus preventing entry of 

M. tuberculosis 

into the corridor and other areas of the facility. 

 To prevent the escape of droplet nuclei, the TB isolation room should be maintained under negative pressure
(Suppl. 3). Doors to isolation rooms should be kept closed, except when patients or personnel must enter or exit the
room, so that negative pressure can be maintained. 
 Negative pressure in the room should be monitored daily while the room is being used for TB isolation. 
 The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc. (ASHRAE) (

47

), the American Institute of Architects (AIA) (

48

), and the Health Resources and Services Administration (

49

) recommend a minimum of 6 air changes per hour (ACH) for TB isolation and treatment rooms. This ventilation rate is
based on comfort and odor control considerations. The effectiveness of this level of airflow in reducing the concentration
of droplet nuclei in the room, thus reducing the transmission of airborne pathogens, has not been evaluated directly
or adequately. 

Ventilation rates of >6 ACH are likely to produce an incrementally greater reduction in the concentration of bacteria
in a room than are lower rates (

50-52

). However, accurate quantitation of decreases in risk that would result from specific increases in general ventilation
levels has not been performed and may not be possible. 

For the purposes of reducing the concentration of droplet nuclei, TB isolation and treatment rooms in existing health-care
facilities should have an airflow of "6 ACH. Where feasible, this airflow rate should be increased to "12 ACH by adjusting
or modifying the ventilation system or by using auxiliary means (e.g., recirculation of air through fixed HEPA filtration
systems or portable air cleaners) (Suppl. 3, Section II.B.5.a) (

53

). New construction or renovation of existing health-care facilities should be designed so that TB isolation rooms
achieve an airflow of "12 ACH. 

 Air from TB isolation rooms and treatment rooms used to treat patients who have known or suspected infectious
TB should be exhausted to the outside in accordance with applicable federal, state, and local regulations. The air
should not be recirculated into the general ventilation. In some instances, recirculation of air into the general
ventilation system from such rooms is unavoidable (i.e., in existing facilities in which the ventilation system
or facility configuration makes venting the exhaust to the outside impossible). In such cases, HEPA filters should
be installed in the exhaust duct leading from the room to the general ventilation system to remove infectious organisms
and particulates the size of droplet nuclei from the air before it is returned to the general ventilation system (Section
II.F; Suppl. 3). Air from TB isolation and treatment rooms in new or renovated facilities should not be recirculated
into the general ventilation system.

<TEXT>
 

 Although not required, an anteroom may increase the effectiveness of the isolation room by minimizing the
potential escape of droplet nuclei into the corridor when the door is opened. To work effectively, the anteroom should
have positive air pressure in relation to the isolation room. The pressure relationship between the anteroom and
the corridor may vary according to ventilation design. 
 Upper-room air UVGI may be used as an adjunct to general ventilation in the isolation room (Section II.F; Suppl.
3). Air in the isolation room may be recirculated within the room through HEPA filters or UVGI devices to increase the
effective ACH and to increase thermal efficiency. 
 Health-care facilities should have enough isolation rooms to appropriately isolate all patients who have
suspected or confirmed active TB. This number should be estimated using the results of the risk assessment of the health-care
facility. Except for minimal-and very low-risk health-care facilities, all acute-care inpatient facilities should
have at least one TB isolation room (Section II.B). 
 Grouping isolation rooms together in one area of the facility may reduce the possibility of transmitting 

M. tuberculosis 

to other patients and may facilitate care of TB patients and the installation and maintenance of optimal engineering
(particularly ventilation) controls. 


4. Discontinuation of TB Isolation 


 TB isolation can be discontinued if the diagnosis of TB is ruled out. For some patients, TB can be ruled out when
another diagnosis is confirmed. If a diagnosis of TB cannot be ruled out, the patient should remain in isolation until
a determination has been made that the patient is noninfectious. However, patients can be discharged from the health-care
facility while still potentially infectious if appropriate postdischarge arrangements can be ensured (Section
II.E.5). 
 The length of time required for a TB patient to become noninfectious after starting anti-TB therapy varies
considerably (Suppl. 1). Isolation should be discontinued only when the patient is on effective therapy, is improving
clinically, and has had three consecutive negative sputum AFB smears collected on different days. 
 Hospitalized patients who have active TB should be monitored for relapse by having sputum AFB smears examined
regularly (e.g., every 2 weeks). Nonadherence to therapy (i.e., failure to take medications as prescribed) and the
presence of drug-resistant organisms are the two most common reasons why patients remain infectious despite treatment.
These reasons should be considered if a patient does not respond clinically to therapy within 2-3 weeks. 
 Continued isolation throughout the hospitalization should be strongly considered for patients who have
MDR-TB because of the tendency for treatment failure or relapse (i.e., difficulty in maintaining noninfectiousness)
that has been observed in such cases. 


5. Discharge Planning 


 Before a TB patient is discharged from the health-care facility, the facility's staff and public health authorities
should collaborate to ensure continuation of therapy. Discharge planning in the health-care facility should include,
at a minimum, (a) a confirmed outpatient appointment with the provider who will manage the patient until the patient
is cured, (b) sufficient medication to take until the outpatient appointment, and (c) placement into case management
(e.g., DOT) or outreach programs of the public health department. These plans should be initiated and in place before
the patient's discharge. 

 Patients who may be infectious at the time of discharge should only be discharged to facilities that have isolation
capability or to their homes. Plans for discharging a patient who will return home must consider whether all the household
members were infected previously and whether any uninfected household members are at very high risk for active TB
if infected (e.g., children <4 years of age or persons infected with HIV or otherwise severely immunocompromised).
If the household does include such persons, arrangements should be made to prevent them from being exposed to the TB
patient until a determination has been made that the patient is noninfectious. 



F. Engineering Control Recommendations 
1. General Ventilation 


This section deals only with engineering controls for general-use areas of health-care facilities (e.g., waiting-room
areas and emergency departments). Recommendations for engineering controls for specific areas of the facility
(e.g., TB isolation rooms) are contained in the sections encompassing those areas. Details regarding ventilation
design, evaluation, and supplemental approaches are described in Supplement 3. 
 Health-care facilities should either (a) include as part of their staff an engineer or other professional
with expertise in ventilation or (b) have this expertise available from a consultant who is an expert in ventilation
engineering and who also has hospital experience. These persons should work closely with infection-control staff
to assist in controlling airborne infections. 
 Ventilation system designs in health-care facilities should meet any applicable federal, state, and local
requirements.

<PARENT> FR941028-2-00109 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 The direction of airflow in health-care facilities should be designed, constructed, and maintained so that
air flows from clean areas to less-clean areas. 


 Health-care facilities serving populations that have a high prevalence of TB may need to supplement the general
ventilation or use additional engineering approaches (i.e., HEPA filtration or UVGI) in general-use areas where
TB patients are likely to go (e.g., waiting-room areas, emergency departments, and radiology suites). A single-pass,
nonrecirculating system that exhausts air to the outside, a recirculation system that passes air through HEPA filters
before recirculating it to the general ventilation system, or upper air UVGI may be used in such areas. 



2. Additional Engineering Control Approaches 




a. HEPA filtration.


HEPA filters may be used in a number of ways to reduce or eliminate infectious droplet nuclei from room air or exhaust
(Suppl. 3). These methods include placement of HEPA filters (a) in exhaust ducts discharging air from booths or enclosures
into the surrounding room; (b) in ducts or in ceiling- or wall-mounted units, for recirculation of air within an individual
room (fixed recirculation systems); (c) in portable air cleaners; (d) in exhaust ducts to remove droplet nuclei from
air being discharged to the outside, either directly or through ventilation equipment; and (e) in ducts discharging
air from the TB isolation room into the general ventilation system. In any application, HEPA filters should be installed
carefully and maintained meticulously to ensure adequate functioning. 


The manufacturers of in-room air cleaning equipment should provide documentation of the HEPA filter efficiency
and the efficiency of the device in lowering room air contaminant levels. 

b. UVGI.


For general-use areas in which the risk for transmission of

 M. tuberculosis

 is relatively high, UVGI lamps may be used as an adjunct to ventilation for reducing the concentration of infectious
droplet nuclei (Suppl. 3), although the effectiveness of such units has not been evaluated adequately. Ultraviolet
(UV) units can be installed in a room or corridor to irradiate the air in the upper portion of the room (i.e., upper-room
air irradiation), or they can be installed in ducts to irradiate air passing through the ducts. UV units installed
in ducts should not be substituted for HEPA filters in ducts that discharge air from TB isolation rooms into the general
ventilation system. However, UV units can be used in ducts that recirculate air back into the same room. 


To function properly and decrease hazards to HCWs and others in the health-care facility, UV lamps should be installed
properly and maintained adequately, which includes the monitoring of irradiance levels. UV tubes should be changed
according to the manufacturer's instructions or when meter readings indicate tube failure. An employee trained
in the use and handling of UV lamps should be responsible for these measures and for keeping maintenance records. Applicable
safety guidelines should be followed. Caution should be exercised to protect HCWs, patients, visitors, and others
from excessive exposure to UV radiation. 



G. Respiratory Protection 



 Personal respiratory protection should be used by (a) persons entering rooms in which patients with known
or suspected infectious TB are being isolated, (b) persons present during cough-inducing or aerosol-generating
procedures performed on such patients, and (c) persons in other settings where administrative and engineering controls
are not likely to protect them from inhaling infectious airborne droplet nuclei (Suppl. 4). These other settings
include transporting patients who may have infectious TB in emergency transport vehicles and providing urgent surgical
or dental care to patients who may have infectious TB before a determination has been made that the patient is noninfectious
(Suppl. 1). 

 Respiratory protective devices used in health-care settings for protection against 

M. tuberculosis 

should meet the following standard performance criteria: 

1. The ability to filter particles 1  u m in size in the unloaded* state with a filter efficiency of "95% (i.e., filter
leakage of >5%), given flow rates of up to 50 L per minute. 




2. The ability to be qualitatively or quantitatively fit tested in a reliable way to obtain a face-seal leakage of >10%
(

54,55

). 


3. The ability to fit the different facial sizes and characteristics of HCWs, which can usually be met by making the
respirators available in at least three sizes. 


4. The ability to be checked for facepiece fit, in accordance with standards established by the Occupational Safety
and Health Administration (OSHA) and good industrial hygiene practice, by HCWs each time they put on their respirators
(

54,55

). 

 The facility's risk assessment may identify a limited number of selected settings (e.g., bronchoscopy performed
on patients suspected of having TB or autopsy performed on deceased persons suspected of having had active TB at the
time of death) where the estimated risk for transmission of

 M. tuberculosis

 may be such that a level of respiratory protection exceeding the standard performance criteria is appropriate. In
such circumstances, a level of respiratory protection exceeding the standard criteria and compatible with patient-care
delivery (e.g., more protective negative-pressure respirators; powered air-purifying particulate respirators
[PAPRs]; or positive-pressure air-line, half-mask respirators) should be provided by employers to HCWs who are
exposed to

 M. tuberculosis.

 Information on these and other respirators is in the

 NIOSH Guide to Industrial Respiratory Protection

 (

55

) and in Supplement 4 of this document. 


 In some settings, HCWs may be at risk for two types of exposure: (a) inhalation of

 M. tuberculosis

 and (b) mucous membrane exposure to fluids that may contain bloodborne pathogens. In these settings, protection
against both types of exposure should be used. 

 When operative procedures (or other procedures requiring a sterile field) are performed on patients who may
have infectious TB, respiratory protection worn by the HCW should serve two functions: (a) It should protect the surgical
field from the respiratory secretions of the HCW, and (b) it should protect the HCW from infectious droplet nuclei
that may be expelled by the patient or generated by the procedure. Respirators with exhalation valves and most positive-pressure
respirators do not protect the sterile field. 


 Health-care facilities in which respiratory protection is used to prevent inhalation of

 M. tuberculosis

 are required by OSHA to develop, implement, and maintain a respiratory protection program (Suppl. 4). All HCWs who
use respiratory protection should be included in this program. Visitors to TB patients should be given respirators
to wear while in isolation rooms, and they should be given general instructions on how to use their respirators. 

 Facilities that do not have isolation rooms and do not perform cough-inducing procedures on patients who may
have TB may not need to have a respiratory protection program for TB. However, such facilities should have written
protocols for the early identification of patients who have signs or symptoms of TB and procedures for referring these
patients to a facility where they can be evaluated and managed appropriately. These protocols should be evaluated
regularly and revised as needed. 


 Surgical masks are designed to prevent the respiratory secretions of the person wearing the mask from entering
the air. To reduce the expulsion of droplet nuclei into the air, patients suspected of having TB should wear surgical
masks when not in TB isolation rooms. These patients do not need to wear particulate respirators, which are designed
to filter the air before it is inhaled by the person wearing the respirator. Patients suspected of having or known to
have TB should never wear a respirator that has an exhalation valve, because this type of respirator does not prevent
expulsion of droplet nuclei into the air. 



H. Cough-Inducing and Aerosol-Generating Procedures 

1. General Guidelines 



Procedures that involve instrumentation of the lower respiratory tract or induce coughing can increase the likelihood
of droplet nuclei being expelled into the air. These cough-inducing procedures include endotracheal intubation
and suctioning, diagnostic sputum induction, aerosol treatments (e.g., pentamidine therapy), and bronchoscopy.
Other procedures that can generate aerosols (e.g., irrigation of tuberculous abscesses, homogenizing or lyophilizing
tissue, or other processing of tissue that may contain tubercle bacilli) are also covered by these recommendations.



</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941028-2-00176 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941028-2-00109 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

  Cough-inducing procedures should not be performed on patients who may have infectious TB unless the procedures
are absolutely necessary and can be performed with appropriate precautions. 

 All cough-inducing procedures performed on patients who may have infectious TB should be performed using
local exhaust ventilation devices (e.g., booths or special enclosures) or, if this is not feasible, in a room that
meets the ventilation requirements for TB isolation. 

 HCWs should wear respiratory protection when present in rooms or enclosures in which cough-inducing procedures
are being performed on patients who may have infectious TB. 

 After completion of cough-inducing procedures, patients who may have infectious TB should remain in their
isolation rooms or enclosures and not return to common waiting areas until coughing subsides. They should be given
tissues and instructed to cover their mouths and noses with the tissues when coughing. If TB patients must recover
from sedatives or anesthesia after a procedure (e.g, after a bronchoscopy), they should be placed in separate isolation
rooms (and not in recovery rooms with other patients) while they are being monitored. 

 Before the booth, enclosure, or room is used for another patient, enough time should be allowed to pass for at
least 99% of airborne contaminants to be removed. This time will vary according to the efficiency of the ventilation
or filtration used (Suppl. 3, Table S3-1). 



2. Special Considerations for Bronchoscopy 



 If performing bronchoscopy in positive-pressure rooms (e.g., operating rooms) is unavoidable, TB should
be ruled out as a diagnosis before the procedure is performed. If the bronchoscopy is being performed for the purpose
of diagnosing pulmonary disease and that diagnosis could include TB, the procedure should be performed in a room that
meets TB isolation ventilation requirements. 



3. Special Considerations for the Administration of Aerosolized Pentamidine 



 Patients should be screened for active TB before prophylactic therapy with aerosolized pentamidine is initiated.
Screening should include obtaining a medical history and performing skin testing and chest radiography. 

 Before each subsequent treatment with aerosolized pentamidine, patients should be screened for symptoms
suggestive of TB (e.g., development of a productive cough). If such symptoms are elicited, a diagnostic evaluation
for TB should be initiated. 

 Patients who have suspected or confirmed active TB should take, if clinically practical, oral prophylaxis
for 

P. carinii

 pneumonia. 



I. Education and Training of HCWs 



All HCWs, including physicians, should receive education regarding TB that is relevant to persons in their particular
occupational group. Ideally, training should be conducted before initial assignment, and the need for additional
training should be reevaluated periodically (e.g., once a year). The level and detail of this education will vary
according to the HCW's work responsibilities and the level of risk in the facility (or area of the facility) in which
the HCW works. However, the program may include the following elements: 

 The basic concepts of

 M. tuberculosis

 transmission, pathogenesis, and diagnosis, including information concerning the difference between latent TB
infection and active TB disease, the signs and symptoms of TB, and the possibility of reinfection. 

 The potential for occupational exposure to persons who have infectious TB in the health-care facility, including
information concerning the prevalence of TB in the community and facility, the ability of the facility to properly
isolate patients who have active TB, and situations with increased risk for exposure to

 M. tuberculosis. 

 The principles and practices of infection control that reduce the risk for transmission of M. tuberculosis,

 including information concerning the hierarchy of TB infection-control measures and the written policies and procedures
of the facility. Site-specific control measures should be provided to HCWs working in areas that require control
measures in addition to those of the basic TB infection-control program. 

 The purpose of PPD skin testing, the significance of a positive PPD test result, and the importance of participating
in the skin-test program. 

 The principles of preventive therapy for latent TB infection. These principles include the indications,
use, effectiveness, and the potential adverse effects of the drugs (Suppl. 2). 

 The HCW's responsibility to seek prompt medical evaluation if a PPD test conversion occurs or if symptoms develop
that could be caused by TB. Medical evaluation will enable HCWs who have TB to receive appropriate therapy and will
help to prevent transmission of

 M. tuberculosis

 to patients and other HCWs. 

 The principles of drug therapy for active TB. 

 The importance of notifying the facility if the HCW is diagnosed with active TB so that contact investigation
procedures can be initiated. 

 The responsibilities of the facility to maintain the confidentiality of the HCW while ensuring that the HCW
who has TB receives appropriate therapy and is noninfectious before returning to duty. 

 The higher risks associated with TB infection in persons who have HIV infection or other causes of severely
impaired cell-mediated immunity, including (a) the more frequent and rapid development of clinical TB after infection
with

 M. tuberculosis,

 (b) the differences in the clinical presentation of disease, and (c) the high mortality rate associated with MDR-TB
in such persons. 

 The potential development of cutaneous anergy as immune function (as measured by CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts)
declines. 

 Information regarding the efficacy and safety of BCG vaccination and the principles of PPD screening among
BCG recipients. 

 The facility's policy on voluntary work reassignment options for immunocompromised HCWs. 



J. HCW Counseling, Screening, and Evaluation 



A TB counseling, screening, and prevention program for HCWs should be established to protect both HCWs and patients.
HCWs who have positive PPD test results, PPD test conversions, or symptoms suggestive of TB should be identified,
evaluated to rule out a diagnosis of active TB, and started on therapy or preventive therapy if indicated (

5

). In addition, the results of the HCW PPD screening program will contribute to evaluation of the effectiveness of
current infection-control practices. 



1. Counseling HCWs Regarding TB 



 Because of the increased risk for rapid progression from latent TB infection to active TB in HIV-infected or
otherwise severely immunocompromised persons, all HCWs should know if they have a medical condition or are receiving
a medical treatment that may lead to severely impaired cell-mediated immunity. HCWs who may be at risk for HIV infection
should know their HIV status (i.e., they should be encouraged to voluntarily seek counseling and testing for HIV antibody
status). Existing guidelines for counseling and testing should be followed routinely (

56

). Knowledge of these conditions allows the HCW to seek the appropriate preventive measures outlined in this document
and to consider voluntary work reassignments. Of particular importance is that HCWs need to know their HIV status
if they are at risk for HIV infection and they work in settings where patients who have drug-resistant TB may be encountered.


 All HCWs should be informed about the need to follow existing recommendations for infection control to minimize
the risk for exposure to infectious agents; implementation of these recommendations will greatly reduce the risk
for occupational infections among HCWs (

57

). All HCWs should also be informed about the potential risks to severely immunocompromised persons associated with
caring for patients who have some infectious diseases, including TB. It should be emphasized that limiting exposure
to TB patients is the most protective measure that severely immunosuppressed HCWs can take to avoid becoming infected
with 

M. tuberculosis

. HCWs who have severely impaired cell-mediated immunity and who may be exposed to

 M. tuberculosis

 may consider a change in job setting to avoid such exposure. HCWs should be advised of the option that severely immunocompromised
HCWs can choose to transfer voluntarily to areas and work activities in which there is the lowest possible risk for
exposure to

 M. tuberculosis

. This choice should be a personal decision for HCWs after they have been informed of the risks to their health. 

 Employers should make reasonable accommodations (e.g., alternative job assignments) for employees who
have a health condition that compromises cell-mediated immunity and who work in settings where they may be exposed
to 

M. tuberculosis

. HCWs who are known to be immunocompromised should be referred to employee health professionals who can individually
counsel the employees regarding their risk for TB. Upon the request of the immunocompromised HCW, employers should
offer, but not compel, a work setting in which the HCW would have the lowest possible risk for occupational exposure
to 

M. tuberculosis.

 Evaluation of these situations should also include consideration of the provisions of the Americans With Disabilities
Act of 1990* and other applicable federal, state, and local laws. 





 All HCWs should be informed that immunosuppressed HCWs should have appropriate follow-up and screening for
infectious diseases, including TB, provided by their medical practitioner. HCWs who are known to be HIV-infected
or otherwise severely immunosuppressed should be tested for cutaneous anergy at the time of PPD testing (Suppl. 2).
Consideration should be given to retesting, at least every 6 months, those immunocompromised HCWs who are potentially
exposed to

 M. tuberculosis

 because of the high risk for rapid progression to active TB if they become infected. 

 Information provided by HCWs regarding their immune status should be treated confidentially. If the HCW requests
voluntary job reassignment, the confidentiality of the HCW should be maintained. Facilities should have written
procedures on confidential handling of such information. 



2. Screening HCWs for Active TB 



 Any HCW who has a persistent cough (i.e., a cough lasting "3 weeks), especially in the presence of other signs
or symptoms compatible with active TB (e.g., weight loss, night sweats, bloody sputum, anorexia, or fever), should
be evaluated promptly for TB. The HCW should not return to the workplace until a diagnosis of TB has been excluded or
until the HCW is on therapy and a determination has been made that the HCW is noninfectious. 



3. Screening HCWs for Latent TB Infection 



 The risk assessment should identify which HCWs have potential for exposure to

 M. tuberculosis

 and the frequency with which the exposure may occur. This information is used to determine which HCWs to include in
the skin-testing program and the frequency with which they should be tested (Table 2).

<TEXT>
 

 If HCWs are from risks groups with increased prevalence of TB, consideration may be given to including them
in the skin-testing program, even if they do not have potential occupational exposure to 

M. tuberculosis

, so that converters can be identified and preventive therapy offered. 
 Administrators of health-care facilities should ensure that physicians and other personnel not paid by,
but working in, the facility receive skin testing at appropriate intervals for their occupational group and work
location. 
 During the pre-employment physical or when applying for hospital privileges, HCWs who have potential for
exposure to 

M. tuberculosis

 (Table 2), including those with a history of BCG vaccination, should have baseline PPD skin testing performed (Suppl.
2). For HCWs who have not had a documented negative PPD test result during the preceding 12 months, the baseline PPD
testing should employ the two-step method; this will detect boosting phenomena that might be misinterpreted as a
skin-test conversion. Decisions concerning the use of the two-step procedure for baseline testing in a particular
facility should be based on the frequency of boosting in that facility. 
 HCWs who have a documented history of a positive PPD test, adequate treatment for disease, or adequate preventive
therapy for infection, should be exempt from further PPD screening unless they develop signs or symptoms suggestive
of TB. 
 PPD-negative HCWs should undergo repeat PPD testing at regular intervals as determined by the risk assessment
(Section II.B). In addition, these HCWs should be tested whenever they have been exposed to a TB patient and appropriate
precautions were not observed at the time of exposure (Section II.K.3). Performing PPD testing of HCWs who work in
the same area or occupational group on different scheduled dates (e.g., test them on their birthdays or on their employment
anniversary dates), rather than testing all HCWs in the area or group on the same day, may lead to earlier detection
of 

M. tuberculosis

 transmission. 
 All PPD tests should be administered, read, and interpreted in accordance with current guidelines by specified
trained personnel (Suppl. 2). At the time their test results are read, HCWs should be informed about the interpretation
of both positive and negative PPD test results. This information should indicate that the interpretation of an induration
that is 5-9 mm in diameter depends on the HCW's immune status and history of exposure to persons who have infectious
TB. Specifically, HCWs who have indurations of 5-9 mm in diameter should be advised that such results may be considered
positive for HCWs who are contacts of persons with infectious TB or who have HIV infection or other causes of severe
immunosuppression (e.g., immunosuppressive therapy for organ transplantation). 
 When an HCW who is not assigned regularly to a single work area has a PPD test conversion, appropriate personnel
should identify the areas where the HCW worked during the time when infection was likely to have occurred. This information
can then be considered in analyzing the risk for transmission in those areas. 
 In any area of the facility where transmission of 

M. tuberculosis

 is known to have occurred, a problem evaluation should be conducted (Section II.K), and the frequency of skin testing
should be determined according to the applicable risk category (Section II.B). 
 PPD test results should be recorded confidentially in the individual HCW's employee health record and in an
aggregate database of all HCW PPD test results. The database can be analyzed periodically to estimate the risk for
acquiring new infection in specific areas or occupational groups in the facility. 


4. Evaluation and Management of HCWs Who Have Positive PPD Test Results or Active TB 


a. Evaluation 
 All HCWs with newly recognized positive PPD test results or PPD test conversions should be evaluated promptly
for active TB. This evaluation should include a clinical examination and a chest radiograph. If the history, clinical
examination, or chest radiograph is compatible with active TB, additional tests should be performed (Section II.C.2).
If symptoms compatible with TB are present, the HCW should be excluded from the workplace until either a) a diagnosis
of active TB is ruled out or b) a diagnosis of active TB was established, the HCW is being treated, and a determination
has been made that the HCW is noninfectious (Suppl. 2). HCWs who do not have active TB should be evaluated for preventive
therapy according to published guidelines (Suppl. 2). 
 If an HCW's PPD test result converts to positive, a history of confirmed or suspected TB exposure should be obtained
in an attempt to determine the potential source. When the source of exposure is known, the drug-susceptibility pattern
of the 

M. tuberculosis

 isolated from the source should be identified so that the correct curative or preventive therapy can be initiated
for the HCW with the PPD test conversion. The drug-susceptibility pattern should be recorded in the HCW's medical
record, where it will be available if the HCW subsequently develops active TB and needs therapy specific for the drug-susceptibility
pattern. 
 All HCWs, including those with histories of positive PPD test results, should be reminded periodically about
the symptoms of TB and the need for prompt evaluation of any pulmonary symptoms suggestive of TB. 
b. Routine and follow-up chest radiographs. 
 Routine chest radiographs are not required for asymptomatic, PPD-negative HCWs. HCWs with positive PPD test
results should have a chest radiograph as part of the initial evaluation of their PPD test; if negative, repeat chest
radiographs are not needed unless symptoms develop that could be attributed to TB (

58

). However, more frequent monitoring for symptoms of TB may be considered for recent converters and other PPD-positive
HCWs who are at increased risk for developing active TB (e.g., HIV-infected or otherwise severely immunocompromised
HCWs). 
c. Workplace restrictions.


(1) Active TB.
 HCWs with pulmonary or laryngeal TB pose a risk to patients and other HCWs while they are infectious, and they
should be excluded from the workplace until they are noninfectious. The same work restrictions apply to all HCWs regardless
of their immune status. 
 Before the HCW who has TB can return to the workplace, the health-care facility should have documentation from
the HCW's health-care provider that the HCW is receiving adequate therapy, the cough has resolved, and the HCW has
had three consecutive negative sputum smears collected on different days. After work duties are resumed and while
the HCW remains on anti-TB therapy, facility staff should receive periodic documentation from the HCW's health-care
provider that the HCW is being maintained on effective drug therapy for the recommended time period and that the sputum
AFB smears continue to be negative. 
 HCWs with active laryngeal or pulmonary TB who discontinue treatment before they are cured should be evaluated
promptly for infectiousness. If the evaluation determines that they are still infectious, they should be excluded
from the workplace until treatment has been resumed, an adequate response to therapy has been documented, and three
more consecutive sputum AFB smears collected on different days have been negative. 
 HCWs who have TB at sites other than the lung or larynx usually do not need to be excluded from the workplace if
a diagnosis of concurrent pulmonary TB has been ruled out. 
(2) Latent TB infection.
 HCWs receiving preventive treatment for latent TB infection should not be restricted from their usual work
activities. 
 HCWs with latent TB infection who cannot take or who do not accept or complete a full course of preventive therapy
should not be excluded from the workplace. These HCWs should be counseled about the risk for developing active TB and
instructed regularly to seek prompt evaluation if signs or symptoms develop that could be caused by TB. 


K. Problem Evaluation 


Epidemiologic investigations may be indicated for several situations. These include, but are not limited to, (a)
the occurrence of PPD test conversions or active TB in HCWs; (b) the occurrence of possible person-to-person transmission
of M. tuberculosis

; and (c) situations in which patients or HCWs with active TB are not promptly identified and isolated, thus exposing
other persons in the facility to 

M. tuberculosis

. The general objectives of the epidemiologic investigations in these situations are as follows: 
(1) To determine the likelihood that transmission of and infection with 

M. tuberculosis

 has occurred in the facility; 
(2) To determine the extent to which 

M. tuberculosis

 has been transmitted; 
(3) To identify those persons who have been exposed and infected, enabling them to receive appropriate clinical management;

(4) To identify factors that could have contributed to transmission and infection and to implement appropriate interventions;
and 
(5) To evaluate the effectiveness of any interventions that are implemented and to ensure that exposure to and transmission
of 

M. tuberculosis

 have been terminated. 
The exact circumstances of these situations are likely to vary considerably, and the associated epidemiologic investigations
should be tailored to the individual circumstances. The following sections provide general guidance for conducting
these investigations. 


1. Investigating PPD Test Conversions and Active TB in HCWs 


a. Investigating PPD test conversions in HCWs.
PPD test conversions may be detected in HCWs as a result of a contact investigation, in which case the probable source
of exposure and transmission is already known (Section II.K.3.), or as a result of routine screening, in which case
the probable source of exposure and infection is not already known and may not be immediately apparent. 
If a skin-test conversion in an HCW is identified as part of routine screening, the following steps should be considered
(Figure 2): 
 The HCW should be evaluated promptly for active TB. The initial evaluation should include a thorough history,
physical examination, and chest radiograph. On the basis of the initial evaluation, other diagnostic procedures
(e.g., sputum examination) may be indicated. 
 If appropriate, the HCW should be placed on preventive or curative therapy in accordance with current guidelines
(Suppl. 2) (

5

). 
 A history of possible exposure to 

M. tuberculosis

 should be obtained from the HCW to determine the most likely source of infection. When the source of infection is known,
the drug-susceptibility pattern of the 

M. tuberculosis

 isolate from the source patient should be identified to determine appropriate preventive or curative therapy regimens.

<TEXT>
 

 If the history suggests that the HCW was exposed to and infected with 

M. tuberculosis 

outside the facility, no further epidemiologic investigation to identify a source in the facility is necessary.

 If the history does not suggest that the HCW was exposed and infected outside the facility but does identify
a probable source of exposure in the facility, contacts of the suspected source patient should be identified and evaluated.
Possible reasons for the exposure and transmission should be evaluated (Table 4), interventions should be implemented
to correct these causes, and PPD testing of PPD-negative HCWs should be performed immediately and repeated after
3 months. 
If no additional PPD test conversions are detected on follow-up testing, the investigation can be terminated. 
If additional PPD test conversions are detected on follow-up testing, the possible reasons for exposure and transmission
should be reassessed, the appropriateness of and degree of adherence to the interventions implemented should be
evaluated, and PPD testing of PPD-negative HCWs should be repeated after another 3 months. 
If no additional PPD test conversions are detected on the second round of follow-up testing, the investigation can
be terminated. However, if additional PPD conversions are detected on the second round of follow-up testing, a high-risk
protocol should be implemented in the affected area or occupational group, and the public health department or other
persons with expertise in TB infection control should be consulted. 
 If the history does not suggest that the HCW was exposed to and infected with 

M. tuberculosis 

outside the facility and does not identify a probable source of exposure in the facility, further investigation to
identify the probable source patient in the facility is warranted. 
The interval during which the HCW could have been infected should be estimated. Generally, this would be the interval
from 10 weeks before the most recent negative PPD test through 2 weeks before the first positive PPD test (i.e., the
conversion). 
Laboratory and infection-control records should be reviewed to identify all patients or HCWs who have suspected
or confirmed infectious TB and who could have transmitted 

M. tuberculosis 

to the HCW. 
If this process does identify a likely source patient, contacts of the suspected source patient should be identified
and evaluated, and possible reasons for the exposure and transmission should be evaluated (Table 4). Interventions
should be implemented to correct these causes, and PPD testing of PPD-negative HCWs should be repeated after 3 months.
However, if this process does not identify a probable source case, PPD screening results of other HCWs in the same area
or occupational group should be reviewed for additional evidence of 

M. tuberculosis 

transmission. If sufficient additional PPD screening results are not available, appropriate personnel should
consider conducting additional PPD screening of other HCWs in the same area or occupational group.

If this review and/or screening does not identify additional PPD conversions, nosocomial transmission is less likely,
and the contact investigation can probably be terminated. Whether the HCW's PPD test conversion resulted from occupational
exposure and infection is uncertain; however, the absence of other data implicating nosocomial transmission suggests
that the conversion could have resulted from (a) unrecognized exposure to 

M. tuberculosis 

outside the facility; (b) cross-reactivity with another antigen (e.g., nontuberculous mycobacteria); (c) errors
in applying, reading, or interpreting the test; (d) false positivity caused by the normal variability of the test;
or (e) false positivity caused by a defective PPD preparation. 

If this review and/or screening does identify additional PPD test conversions, nosocomial transmission is more
likely. In this situation, the patient identification (i.e., triage) process, TB infection-control policies and
practices, and engineering controls should be evaluated to identify problems that could have led to exposure and
transmission (Table 4). 

If no such problems are identified, a high-risk protocol should be implemented in the affected area or occupational
group, and the public health department or other persons with expertise in TB infection control should be consulted.


If such problems are identified, appropriate interventions should be implemented to correct the problem(s), and
PPD skin testing of PPD-negative HCWs should be repeated after 3 months. 

If no additional PPD conversions are detected on follow-up testing, the investigation can be terminated. 

If additional PPD conversions are detected on follow-up testing, the possible reasons for exposure and transmission
should be reassessed, the appropriateness of and adherence to the interventions implemented should be evaluated,
and PPD skin testing of PPD-negative HCWs should be repeated after another 3 months. 

If no additional PPD test conversions are detected on this second round of follow-up testing, the investigation can
be terminated. However, if additional PPD test conversions are detected on the second round of follow-up testing,
a high-risk protocol should be implemented in the affected area or occupational group, and the public health department
or other persons with expertise in TB infection control should be consulted. 

b. Investigating cases of active TB in HCWs.

If an HCW develops active TB, the following steps should be taken: 

 The case should be evaluated epidemiologically, in a manner similar to PPD test conversions in HCWs, to determine
the likelihood that it resulted from occupational transmission and to identify possible causes and implement appropriate
interventions if the evaluation suggests such transmission. 

 Contacts of the HCW (e.g., other HCWs, patients, visitors, and others who have had intense exposure to the HCW)
should be identified and evaluated for TB infection and disease (Section II.K.3; Suppl. 2). The public health department
should be notified immediately for consultation and to allow for investigation of community contacts who were not
exposed in the health-care facility. 

 The public health department should notify facilities when HCWs with TB are reported by physicians so that
an investigation of contacts can be conducted in the facility. The information provided by the health department
to facilities should be in accordance with state or local laws to protect the confidentiality of the HCW. 



2. Investigating Possible Patient-to-Patient Transmission of 

M. tuberculosis 



Surveillance of active TB cases in patients should be conducted. If this surveillance suggests the possibility of
patient-to-patient transmission of M. tuberculosis 

(e.g., a high proportion of TB patients had prior admissions during the year preceding onset of their TB, the number
of patients with drug-resistant TB increased suddenly, or isolates obtained from multiple patients had identical
and characteristic drug-susceptibility or DNA fingerprint patterns), the following steps should be taken: 

 Review the HCW PPD test results and patient surveillance data for the suspected areas to detect additional
patients or HCWs with PPD test conversions or active disease. 

 Look for possible exposures that patients with newly diagnosed TB could have had to other TB patients during
previous admissions. For example, were the patients admitted to the same room or area, or did they receive the same
procedure or go to the same treatment area on the same day? 

If the evaluation thus far suggests transmission has occurred, the following steps should be taken: 

 Evaluate possible causes of the transmission (e.g., problem with patient detection, institutional barriers
to implementing appropriate isolation practices, or inadequate engineering controls) (Table 4). 

 Ascertain whether other patients or HCWs could have been exposed; if so, evaluate these persons for TB infection
and disease (Section II.K.3; Suppl. 2). 

 Notify the public health department so they can begin a community contact investigation if necessary. 



3. Investigating Contacts of Patients and HCWs Who Have Infectious TB 



If a patient who has active TB is examined in a health-care facility and the illness is not diagnosed correctly, resulting
in failure to apply appropriate precautions, or if an HCW develops active TB and exposes other persons in the facility,
the following steps should be taken when the illness is later diagnosed correctly: 

 To identify other patients and HCWs who were exposed to the source patient before isolation procedures were
begun, interview the source patient and all applicable personnel and review that patient's medical record. Determine
the areas of the facility in which the source patient was hospitalized, visited, or worked before being placed in isolation
(e.g., outpatient clinics, hospital rooms, treatment rooms, radiology and procedure areas, and patient lounges)
and the HCWs who may have been exposed during that time (e.g., persons providing direct care, therapists, clerks,
transportation personnel, housekeepers, and social workers). 

 The contact investigation should first determine if 

M. tuberculosis

 transmission has occurred from the source patient to those persons with whom the source patient had the most intense
contact. 

 Administer PPD tests to the most intensely exposed HCWs and patients as soon as possible after the exposure
has occurred. If transmission did occur to the most intensely exposed persons, then those persons with whom the patient
had less contact should be evaluated. If the initial PPD test result is negative, a second test should be administered
12 weeks after the exposure was terminated. 

 Those persons who were exposed to 

M. tuberculosis 

and who have either a PPD test conversion or symptoms suggestive of TB should receive prompt clinical evaluation and,
if indicated, chest radiographs and bacteriologic studies should be performed (Suppl. 2). Those persons who have
evidence of newly acquired infection or active disease should be evaluated for preventive or curative therapy (Suppl.
2). Persons who have previously had positive PPD test results and who have been exposed to an infectious TB patient
do not require a repeat PPD test or a chest radiograph unless they have symptoms suggestive of TB. 

 In addition to PPD testing those HCWs and patients who have been exposed to 

M. tuberculosis 

because a patient was not isolated promptly or an HCW with active TB was not identified promptly, the investigation
should determine why the diagnosis of TB was delayed. If the correct diagnosis was made but the patient was not isolated
promptly, the reasons for the delay need to be defined so that corrective actions can be taken. 



L. Coordination With the Public Health Department 



 As soon as a patient or HCW is known or suspected to have active TB, the patient or HCW should be reported to the
public health department so that appropriate follow-up can be arranged and a community contact investigation can
be performed. The health department should be notified well before patient discharge to facilitate follow-up and
continuation of therapy. A discharge plan coordinated with the patient or HCW, the health department, and the inpatient
facility should be implemented. 

 The public health department should protect the confidentiality of the patient or HCW in accordance with state
and local laws. 



</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941028-2-00181 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941028-2-00109 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 Health-care facilities and health departments should coordinate their efforts to perform appropriate contact
investigations on patients and HCWs who have active TB.

 In accordance with state and local laws and regulations, results of all AFB-positive sputum smears, cultures
positive for 

M. tuberculosis, 

and drug-susceptibility results on 

M. tuberculosis

 isolates should be reported to the public health department as soon as these results are available. 

 The public health department may be able to assist facilities with planning and implementing various aspects
of a TB infection-control program (e.g., surveillance, screening activities, and outbreak investigations). In
addition, the state health department may be able to provide names of experts to assist with the engineering aspects
of TB infection control.



M. Additional Considerations for Selected Areas in Health-Care Facilities and Other Health-Care Settings 



This section contains additional information for selected areas in health-care facilities and for other health-care
settings.



1. Selected Areas in Health-Care Facilities



a. Operating rooms.

 Elective operative procedures on patients who have TB should be delayed until the patient is no longer infectious.

 If operative procedures must be performed, they should be done, if possible, in operating rooms that have anterooms.
For operating rooms without anterooms, the doors to the operating room should be closed, and traffic into and out of
the room should be minimal to reduce the frequency of opening and closing the door. Attempts should be made to perform
the procedure at a time when other patients are not present in the operative suite and when a minimum number of personnel
are present (e.g., at the end of day).

 Placing a bacterial filter on the patient endotracheal tube (or at the expiratory side of the breathing circuit
of a ventilator or anesthesia machine if these are used) when operating on a patient who has confirmed or suspected
TB may help reduce the risk for contaminating anesthesia equipment or discharging tubercle bacilli into the ambient
air.

 During postoperative recovery, the patient should be monitored and should be placed in a private room that
meets recommended standards for ventilating TB isolation rooms.

 When operative procedures (or other procedures requiring a sterile field) are performed on patients who may
have infectious TB, respiratory protection worn by the HCW must protect the field from the respiratory secretions
of the HCW and protect the HCW from the infectious droplet nuclei generated by the patient. Valved or positive-pressure
respirators do not protect the sterile field; therefore, a respirator that does not have a valve and that meets the
criteria in Section II.G should be used.

b. Autopsy rooms.

 Because infectious aerosols are likely to be present in autopsy rooms, such areas should be at negative pressure
with respect to adjacent areas (Suppl. 3), and the room air should be exhausted directly to the outside of the building.
ASHRAE recommends that autopsy rooms have ventilation that provides an airflow of 12 ACH (

47

), although the effectiveness of this ventilation level in reducing the risk for 

M. tuberculosis, 

transmission has not been evaluated. Where possible, this level should be increased by means of ventilation system
design or by auxiliary methods (e.g., recirculation of air within the room through HEPA filters) (Suppl. 3). 

 Respiratory protection should be worn by personnel while performing autopsies on deceased persons who may
have had TB at the time of death (Section II.G; Suppl. 4).

 Recirculation of HEPA-filtered air within the room or UVGI may be used as a supplement to the recommended ventilation
(Suppl. 3).

c. Laboratories.

 Laboratories in which specimens for mycobacteriologic studies (e.g., AFB smears and cultures) are processed
should be designed to conform with criteria specified by CDC and the National Institutes of Health (

59

).



2. Other Health-Care Settings



TB precautions may be appropriate in a number of other types of health care settings. The specific precautions that
are applied will vary depending on the setting. At a minimum, a risk assessment should be performed yearly for these
settings; a written TB infection-control plan should be developed, evaluated, and revised on a regular basis; protocols
should be in place for identifying and managing patients who may have active TB; HCWs should receive appropriate training,
education, and screening; protocols for problem evaluation should be in place; and coordination with the public
health department should be arranged when necessary. Other recommendations specific to certain of these settings
follow.

a. Emergency medical services.

 When EMS personnel or others must transport patients who have confirmed or suspected active TB, a surgical
mask should be placed, if possible, over the patient's mouth and nose. Because administrative and engineering controls
during emergency transport situations cannot be ensured, EMS personnel should wear respiratory protection when
transporting such patients. If feasible, the windows of the vehicle should be kept open. The heating and air-conditioning
system should be set on a nonrecirculating cycle.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941028-2-00182 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941028-2-00109 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 EMS personnel should be included in a comprehensive PPD screening program and should receive a baseline PPD
test and follow-up testing as indicated by the risk assessment. They should also be included in the follow-up of contacts
of a patient with infectious TB.*





b. Hospices. 

 Hospice patients who have confirmed or suspected TB should be managed in the manner described in this document
for management of TB patients in hospitals. General-use and specialized areas (e.g., treatment or TB isolation rooms)
should be ventilated in the same manner as described for similar hospital areas. 

c. Long-term care facilities. 

 Recommendations published previously for preventing and controlling TB in long-term care facilities should
be followed (

60

). 

 Long-term care facilities should also follow the recommendations outlined in this document. 

d. Correctional facilities. 

 Recommendations published previously for preventing and controlling TB in correctional facilities should
be followed (

61

). 

 Prison medical facilities should also follow the recommendations outlined in this document. 

e. Dental settings. 

In general, the symptoms for which patients seek treatment in a dental-care setting are not likely to be caused by infectious
TB. Unless a patient requiring dental care coincidentally has TB, it is unlikely that infectious TB will be encountered
in the dental setting. Furthermore, generation of droplet nuclei containing 

M. tuberculosis 

during dental procedures has not been demonstrated (

62

). Therefore, the risk for transmission of 

M. tuberculosis

 in most dental settings is probably quite low. Nevertheless, during dental procedures, patients and dental workers
share the same air for varying periods of time. Coughing may be stimulated occasionally by oral manipulations, although
no specific dental procedures have been classified as ``cough-inducing.'' In some instances, the population served
by a dental-care facility, or the HCWs in the facility, may be at relatively high risk for TB. Because the potential
exists for transmission of 

M. tuberculosis

 in dental settings, the following recommendations should be followed: 


 A risk assessment (Section II.B) should be done periodically, and TB infection-control policies for each
dental setting should be based on the risk assessment. The policies should include provisions for detection and referral
of patients who may have undiagnosed active TB; management of patients with active TB, relative to provision of urgent
dental care; and employer-sponsored HCW education, counseling, and screening. 

 While taking patients' initial medical histories and at periodic updates, dental HCWs should routinely ask
all patients whether they have a history of TB disease and symptoms suggestive of TB. 

 Patients with a medical history or symptoms suggestive of undiagnosed active TB should be referred promptly
for medical evaluation of possible infectiousness. Such patients should not remain in the dental-care facility
any longer than required to arrange a referral. While in the dental-care facility, they should wear surgical masks
and should be instructed to cover their mouths and noses when coughing or sneezing. 

 Elective dental treatment should be deferred until a physician confirms that the patient does not have infectious
TB. If the patient is diagnosed as having active TB, elective dental treatment should be deferred until the patient
is no longer infectious. 

 If urgent dental care must be provided for a patient who has, or is strongly suspected of having, infectious
TB, such care should be provided in facilities that can provide TB isolation (Sections II.E and G). Dental HCWs should
use respiratory protection while performing procedures on such patients. 

 Any dental HCW who has a persistent cough (i.e., a cough lasting "3 weeks), especially in the presence of other
signs or symptoms compatible with active TB (e.g., weight loss, night sweats, bloody sputum, anorexia, and fever),
should be evaluated promptly for TB. The HCW should not return to the workplace until a diagnosis of TB has been excluded
or until the HCW is on therapy and a determination has been made that the HCW is noninfectious. 

 In dental-care facilities that provide care to populations at high risk for active TB, it may be appropriate
to use engineering controls similar to those used in general-use areas (e.g., waiting rooms) of medical facilities
that have a similar risk profile. 

f. Home-health-care settings. 

 HCWs who provide medical services in the homes of patients who have suspected or confirmed infectious TB should
instruct such patients to cover their mouths and noses with a tissue when coughing or sneezing. Until such patients
are no longer infectious, HCWs should wear respiratory protection when entering these patients' homes (Suppl. 4).


 Precautions in the home may be discontinued when the patient is no longer infectious (Suppl. 1). 

 HCWs who provide health-care services in their patients' homes can assist in preventing transmission of 

M. tuberculosis

 by educating their patients regarding the importance of taking medications as prescribed and by administering DOT.

 Cough-inducing procedures performed on patients who have infectious TB should not be done in the patients'
homes unless absolutely necessary. When medically necessary cough-inducing procedures (e.g., AFB sputum collection
for evaluation of therapy) must be performed on patients who may have infectious TB, the procedures should be performed
in a health-care facility in a room or booth that has the recommended ventilation for such procedures. If these procedures
must be performed in a patient's home, they should be performed in a well-ventilated area away from other household
members. If feasible, the HCW should consider opening a window to improve ventilation or collecting the specimen
while outside the dwelling. The HCW collecting these specimens should wear respiratory protection during the procedure
(Section II.G). 

 HCWs who provide medical services in their patients' homes should be included in comprehensive employer-sponsored
TB training, education, counseling, and screening programs. These programs should include provisions for identifying
HCWs who have active TB, baseline PPD skin testing, and follow-up PPD testing at intervals appropriate to the degree
of risk. 

 Patients who are at risk for developing active TB and the HCWs who provide medical services in the homes of such
patients should be reminded periodically of the importance of having pulmonary symptoms evaluated promptly to permit
early detection of and treatment for TB. 

g. Medical offices. 

In general, the symptoms of active TB are symptoms for which patients are likely to seek treatment in a medical office.
Furthermore, the populations served by some medical offices, or the HCWs in the office, may be at relatively high risk
for TB. Thus, it is likely that infectious TB will be encountered in a medical office. Because of the potential for 

M. tuberculosis

 transmission, the following recommendations should be observed: 

 A risk assessment should be conducted periodically, and TB infection-control policies based on results of
the risk assessment should be developed for the medical office. The policies should include provisions for identifying
and managing patients who may have undiagnosed active TB; managing patients who have active TB; and educating, training,
counseling, and screening HCWs. 

 While taking patients' initial medical histories and at periodic updates, HCWs who work in medical offices
should routinely ask all patients whether they have a history of TB disease or have had symptoms suggestive of TB. 

 Patients with a medical history and symptoms suggestive of active TB should receive an appropriate diagnostic
evaluation for TB and be evaluated promptly for possible infectiousness. Ideally, this evaluation should be done
in a facility that has TB isolation capability. At a minimum, the patient should be provided with and asked to wear a
surgical mask, instructed to cover the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing, and separated as much
as possible from other patients. 

 Medical offices that provide evaluation or treatment services for TB patients should follow the recommendations
for managing patients in ambulatory-care settings (Section II.D). 

 If cough-inducing procedures are to be administered in a medical office to patients who may have active TB,
appropriate precautions should be followed (Section II.H). 

 Any HCW who has a persistent cough (i.e., a cough lasting "3 weeks), especially in the presence of other signs
or symptoms compatible with active TB (e.g., weight loss, night sweats, bloody sputum, anorexia, or fever) should
be evaluated promptly for TB. HCWs with such signs or symptoms should not return to the workplace until a diagnosis
of TB has been excluded or until they are on therapy and a determination has been made that they are noninfectious. 

 HCWs who work in medical offices in which there is a likelihood of exposure to patients who have infectious TB
should be included in employer-sponsored education, training, counseling, and PPD testing programs appropriate
to the level of risk in the office. 

 In medical offices that provide care to populations at relatively high risk for active TB, use of engineering
controls as described in this document for general-use areas (e.g., waiting rooms) may be appropriate (Section II.F;
Suppl. 3).

Supplement 1: Determining the Infectiousness of a TB Patient



The infectiousness of patients with TB correlates with the number of organisms expelled into the air, which, in turn,
correlates with the following factors: (a) Disease in the lungs, airways, or larynx; (b) presence of cough or other
forceful expiratory measures; (c) presence of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) in the sputum; (d) failure of the patient to
cover the mouth and nose when coughing; (e) presence of cavitation on chest radiograph; (f) inappropriate or short
duration of chemotherapy; and (g) administration of procedures that can induce coughing or cause aerosolization
of 

M. tuberculosis 

(e.g., sputum induction).

The most infectious persons are most likely those who have not been treated for TB and who have either (a) pulmonary
or laryngeal TB and a cough or are undergoing cough-inducing procedures, (b) a positive AFB sputum smear, or (c) cavitation
on chest radiograph. Persons with extrapulmonary TB usually are not infectious unless they have (a) concomitant
pulmonary disease; (b) nonpulmonary disease located in the respiratory tract or oral cavity; or (c) extrapulmonary
disease that includes an open abscess or lesion in which the concentration of organisms is high, especially if drainage
from the abscess or lesion is extensive (

20,22

). Coinfection with HIV does not appear to affect the infectiousness of TB patients (

63-65

).

In general, children who have TB may be less likely than adults to be infectious; however, transmission from children
can occur. Therefore, children with TB should be evaluated for infectiousness using the same parameters as for adults
(i.e., pulmonary or laryngeal TB, presence of cough or cough-inducing procedures, positive sputum AFB smear, cavitation
on chest radiograph, and adequacy and duration of therapy). Pediatric patients who may be infectious include those
who (a) are not on therapy, (b) have just been started on therapy, or (c) are on inadequate therapy, 

and 

who (a) have laryngeal or extensive pulmonary involvement, (b) have pronounced cough or are undergoing cough-inducing
procedures, (c) have positive sputum AFB smears, or (d) have cavitary TB. Children who have typical primary tuberculous
lesions and do not have any of the indicators of infectiousness listed previously usually do not need to be placed in
isolation. Because the source case for pediatric TB patients often occurs in a member of the infected child's family
(

45

), parents and other visitors of all pediatric TB patients should be evaluated for TB as soon as possible.

Infection is most likely to result from exposure to persons who have unsuspected pulmonary TB and are not receiving
anti-TB therapy or from persons who have diagnosed TB and are not receiving adequate therapy. Administration of effective
anti-TB therapy has been associated with decreased infectiousness among persons who have active TB (

66

). Effective therapy reduces coughing, the amount of sputum produced, and the number of organisms in the sputum. However,
the period of time a patient must take effective therapy before becoming noninfectious varies between patients (

67

). For example, some TB patients are never infectious, whereas those with unrecognized or inadequately treated drug-resistant
TB may remain infectious for weeks or months (

24

). Thus, decisions about infectiousness should be made on an individual basis.

In general, patients who have suspected or confirmed active TB should be considered infectious if they (a) are coughing,
(b) are undergoing cough-inducing procedures, or (c) have positive AFB sputum smears, 

and 

if they (a) are not on chemotherapy, (b) have just started chemotherapy, or (c) have a poor clinical or bacteriologic
response to chemotherapy. A patient who has drug-susceptible TB and who is on adequate chemotherapy and has had a significant
clinical and bacteriologic response to therapy (i.e., reduction in cough, resolution of fever, and progressively
decreasing quantity of bacilli on smear) is probably no longer infectious. However, because drug-susceptibility
results are not usually known when the decision to discontinue isolation is made, all TB patients should remain in
isolation while hospitalized until they have had three consecutive negative sputum smears collected on different
days and they demonstrate clinical improvement.

Supplement 2: Diagnosis and Treatment of Latent TB Infection and Active TB



I. Diagnostic Procedures for TB Infection and Disease



A diagnosis of TB may be considered for any patient who has a persistent cough (i.e., a cough lasting "3 weeks) or other
signs or symptoms compatible with TB (e.g., bloody sputum, night sweats, weight loss, anorexia, or fever). However,
the index of suspicion for TB will vary in different geographic areas and will depend on the prevalence of TB and other
characteristics of the population served by the facility. The index of suspicion for TB should be very high in areas
or among groups of patients in which the prevalence of TB is high (Section I.B). Persons for whom a diagnosis of TB is
being considered should receive appropriate diagnostic tests, which may include PPD skin testing, chest radiography,
and bacteriologic studies (e.g., sputum microscopy and culture).



A. PPD Skin Testing and Anergy Testing

1. Application and Reading of PPD Skin Tests



The PPD skin test is the only method available for demonstrating infection with 

M. tuberculosis. 

Although currently available PPD tests are <100% sensitive and specific for detection of infection with 

M. tuberculosis, 

no better diagnostic methods have yet been devised. Interpretation of PPD test results requires knowledge of the
antigen used, the immunologic basis for the reaction to this antigen, the technique used to administer and read the
test, and the results of epidemiologic and clinical experience with the test (

2,5,6

). The PPD test, like all medical tests, is subject to variability, but many of the variations in administering and
reading PPD tests can be avoided by proper training and careful attention to details.

The intracutaneous (Mantoux) administration of a measured amount of PPD-tuberculin is currently the preferred
method for doing the test. One-tenth milliliter of PPD (5 TU) is injected just beneath the surface of the skin on either
the volar or dorsal surface of the forearm. A discrete, pale elevation of the skin (i.e., a wheal) that is 6-10
mm in diameter should be produced.

PPD test results should be read by designated, trained personnel between 48 and 72 hours after injection. Patient
or HCW self-reading of PPD test results should not be accepted (

68

). The result of the test is based on the presence or absence of an induration at the injection site. Redness or erythema
should not be measured. The transverse diameter of induration should be recorded in millimeters.



2. Interpretation of PPD Skin Tests



a. General.

The interpretation of a PPD reaction should be influenced by the purpose for which the test was given (e.g., epidemiologic
versus diagnostic purposes), by the prevalence of TB infection in the population being tested, and by the consequences
of false classification. Errors in classification can be minimized by establishing an appropriate definition of
a positive reaction (Table S2-1).

The positive-predictive value of PPD tests (i.e, the probability that a person with a positive PPD test is actually
infected with 

M. tuberculosis

) is dependent on the prevalence of TB infection in the population being tested and the specificity of the test (

69,70

). In populations with a low prevalence of TB infection, the probability that a positive PPD test represents true infection
with 

M. tuberculosis 

is very low if the cut-point is set too low (i.e., the test is not adequately specific). In populations with a high prevalence
of TB infection, the probability that a positive PPD test using the same cut-point represents true infection with


M. tuberculosis 

is much higher. To ensure that few persons infected with tubercle bacilli will be misclassified as having negative
reactions and few persons not infected with tubercle bacilli will be misclassified as having positive reactions,
different cut-points are used to separate positive reactions from negative reactions for different populations,
depending on the risk for TB infection in that population.

A lower cut-point (i.e., 5 mm) is used for persons in the highest risk groups, which include HIV-infected persons,
recent close contacts of persons with TB (e.g., in the household or in an unprotected occupational exposure similar
in intensity and duration to household contact), and persons who have abnormal chest radiographs with fibrotic changes
consistent with inactive TB. A higher cut-point (i.e., 10 mm) is used for persons who are not in the highest risk group
but who have other risk factors (e.g., injecting-drug users known to be HIV seronegative; persons with certain medical
conditions that increase the risk for progression from latent TB infection to active TB [Table S2-1]); medically
underserved, low-income populations; persons born in foreign countries that have a high prevalence of TB; and residents
of correctional institutions and nursing homes). An even higher cut-point (i.e., 15 mm) is used for all other persons
who have none of the above risk factors.

Recent PPD converters are considered members of a high-risk group. A "10 mm increase in the size of the induration within
a 2-year period is classified as a conversion from a negative to a positive test result for persons <35 years of age.
An increase of induration of "15 mm within a 2-year period is classified as a conversion for persons "35 years of age
(5).

b. HCWs.

In general, HCWs should have their skin-test results interpreted according to the recommendations in this supplement
and in sections 1, 2, 3, and 5 of Table S2-1. However, the prevalence of TB in the facility should be considered
when choosing the appropriate cut-point for defining a positive PPD reaction. In facilities where there is essentially
no risk for exposure to TB patients (i.e., minimal- or very low-risk facilities [Section II.B]), an induration "15
mm may be an appropriate cut-point for HCWs who have no other risk factors. In other facilities where TB patients receive
care, the appropriate cut-point for HCWs who have no other risk factors may be "10 mm.

A recent PPD test conversion in an HCW should be defined generally as an increase of "10 mm in the size of induration within
a 2-year period. For HCWs in facilities where exposure to TB is very unlikely (e.g., minimal-risk facilities), an
increase of "15 mm within a 2-year period may be more appropriate for defining a recent conversion because of the lower
positive-predictive value of the test in such groups.



3. Anergy Testing



HIV-infected persons may have suppressed reactions to PPD skin tests because of anergy, particularly if their CD4+
T-lymphocyte counts decline (

71

). Persons with anergy will have a negative PPD test regardless of infection with 

M. tuberculosis. 

HIV-infected persons should be evaluated for anergy in conjunction with PPD testing (

72

). Two companion antigens (e.g., Candida antigen and tetanus toxoid) should be administered in addition to PPD. Persons
with "3 mm of induration to any of the skin tests (including tuberculin) are considered not anergic. Reactions of "5
mm to PPD are considered to be evidence of TB infection in HIV-infected persons regardless of the reactions to the companion
antigens. If there is no reaction (i.e., <3 mm induration) to any of the antigens, the person being tested is considered
anergic. Determination of whether such persons are likely to be infected with 

M. tuberculosis 

must be based on other epidemiologic factors (e.g., the proportion of other persons with the same level of exposure
who have positive PPD test results and the intensity or duration of exposure to infectious TB patients that the anergic
person experienced).



4. Pregnancy and PPD Skin Testing



Although thousands (perhaps millions) of pregnant women have been PPD skin tested since the test was devised, thus
far no documented episodes of fetal harm have resulted from use of the tuberculin test (

73

). Pregnancy should not exclude a female HCW from being skin tested as part of a contact investigation or as part of a
regular skin-testing program.

Table S2-1. Summary of Interpretation of Purified Protein Derivative (PPD)-Tuberculin Skin-Test Results



1. An induration of "5 mm is classified as positive in: 
 Persons who have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or risk factors for HIV infection but unknown
HIV status; 
 Persons who have had recent close contact* with persons who have active tuberculosis (TB); 




 Persons who have fibrotic chest radiographs (consistent with healed TB). 
2. An induration of "10 mm is classified as positive in all persons who do not meet any of the criteria above but who have
other risk factors for TB, including: 


High-Risk Groups


 Injecting-drug users known to be HIV seronegative; 
 Persons who have other medical conditions that reportedly increase the risk for progressing from latent TB
infection to active TB (e.g., silicosis; gastrectomy or jejuno-ileal bypass; being "10% below ideal body weight;
chronic renal failure with renal dialysis; diabetes mellitus; high-dose corticosteroid or other immuno-suppressive
therapy; some hematologic disorders, including malignancies such as leukemias and lymphomas; and other malignancies);

 Children <4 years of age. 


High-prevalence Groups


 Persons born in countries in Asia, Africa, the Caribbean, and Latin America that have high prevalence of TB;

 Persons from medically underserved, low-income populations; 
 Residents of long-term-care facilities (e.g., correctional institutions and nursing homes); 
 Persons from high-risk populations in their communities, as determined by local public health authorities.

3. An induration of "15 mm is classified as positive in persons who do not meet any of the above criteria. 
4. Recent converters are defined on the basis of both size of induration and age of the person being tested: 
 "10 mm increase within a 2-year period is classified as a recent conversion for persons <35 years of age;

 "15 mm increase within a 2-year period is classified as a recent conversion for persons "35 years of age. 
5. PPD skin-test results in health-care workers (HCWs)
 In general, the recommendations in sections 1, 2, and 3 of this table should be followed when interpreting skin-test
results in HCWs. 
However, the prevalence of TB in the facility should be considered when choosing the appropriate cut-point for defining
a positive PPD reaction. In facilities where there is essentially no risk for exposure to 

Mycobacterium tuberculosis 

(i.e., minimal- or very low-risk facilities [Section II.B]), an induration "15 mm may be a suitable cut-point for
HCWs who have no other risk factors. In facilities where TB patients receive care, the cut-point for HCWs with no other
risk factors maybe "10 mm. 
 A recent conversion in an HCW should be defined generally as a "10 mm increase in size of induration within a 2-year
period. For HCWs who work in facilities where exposure to TB is very unlikely (e.g., minimal-risk facilities), an
increase of "15 mm within a 2-year period may be more appropriate for defining a recent conversion because of the lower
positive-predictive value of the test in such groups.

5. BCG Vaccination and PPD Skin Testing 



BCG vaccination may produce a PPD reaction that cannot be distinguished reliably from a reaction caused by infection
with 

M. tuberculosis

. For a person who was vaccinated with BCG, the probability that a PPD test reaction results from infection with 

M. tuberculosis

 increases (a) as the size of the reaction increases, (b) when the person is a contact of a person with TB, (c) when the
person's country of origin has a high prevalence of TB, and (d) as the length of time between vaccination and PPD testing
increases. For example, a PPD test reaction of "10 mm probably can be attributed to 

M. tuberculosis

 infection in an adult who was vaccinated with BCG as a child and who is from a country with a high prevalence of TB (

74,75

). 



6. The Booster Phenomenon 



The ability of persons who have TB infection to react to PPD may gradually wane. For example, if tested with PPD, adults
who were infected during their childhood may have a negative reaction. However, the PPD could boost the hypersensitivity,
and the size of the reaction could be larger on a subsequent test. This boosted reaction may be misinterpreted as a PPD
test conversion from a newly acquired infection. Misinterpretation of a boosted reaction as a new infection could
result in unnecessary investigations of laboratory and patient records in an attempt to identify the source case
and in unnecessary prescription of preventive therapy for HCWs. Although boosting can occur among persons in any
age group, the likelihood of the reaction increases with the age of the person being tested (

6,76

). 

When PPD testing of adults is to be repeated periodically (as in HCW skin-testing programs), two-step testing can
be used to reduce the likelihood that a boosted reaction is misinterpreted as a new infection. Two-step testing should
be performed on all newly employed HCWs who have an initial negative PPD test result at the time of employment and have
not had a documented negative PPD test result during the 12 months preceding the initial test. A second test should
be performed 1-3 weeks after the first test. If the second test result is positive, this is most likely a boosted
reaction, and the HCW should be classified as previously infected. If the second test result remains negative, the
HCW is classified as uninfected, and a positive reaction to a subsequent test is likely to represent a new infection
with 

M. tuberculosis

. 



B. Chest Radiography 



Patients who have positive skin-test results or symptoms suggestive of TB should be evaluated with a chest radiograph
regardless of PPD test results. Radiographic abnormalities that strongly suggest active TB include upper-lobe
infiltration, particularly if cavitation is seen (

77

), and patchy or nodular infiltrates in the apical or subapical posterior upper lobes or the superior segment of the
lower lobe. If abnormalities are noted, or if the patient has symptoms suggestive of extrapulmonary TB, additional
diagnostic tests should be conducted. 

The radiographic presentation of pulmonary TB in HIV-infected patients may be unusual (

78

). Typical apical cavitary disease is less common among such patients. They may have infiltrates in any lung zone,
a finding that is often associated with mediastinal and/or hilar adenopathy, or they may have a normal chest radiograph,
although this latter finding occurs rarely. 



C. Bacteriology 



Smear and culture examination of at least three sputum specimens collected on different days is the main diagnostic
procedure for pulmonary TB (

6

). Sputum smears that fail to demonstrate AFB do not exclude the diagnosis of TB. In the United States, approximately
60% of patients with positive sputum cultures have positive AFB sputum smears. HIV-infected patients who have pulmonary
TB may be less likely than immunocompetent patients to have AFB present on sputum smears, which is consistent with
the lower frequency of cavitary pulmonary disease observed among HIV-infected persons (

39,41

). 

Specimens for smear and culture should contain an adequate amount of expectorated sputum but not much saliva. If a
diagnosis of TB cannot be established from sputum, a bronchoscopy may be necessary (

36,37

). In young children who cannot produce an adequate amount of sputum, gastric aspirates may provide an adequate specimen
for diagnosis. 

A culture of sputum or other clinical specimen that contains 

M. tuberculosis

 provides a definitive diagnosis of TB. Conventional laboratory methods may require 4-8 weeks for species identification;
however, the use of radiometric culture techniques and nucleic acid probes facilitates more rapid detection and
identification of mycobacteria (

79,80

). Mixed mycobacterial infection, either simultaneous or sequential, can obscure the identification of 

M. tuberculosis

 during the clinical evaluation and the laboratory analysis (

42

). The use of nucleic acid probes for both 

M. avium 

complex and 

M. tuberculosis

 may be useful for identifying mixed mycobacterial infections in clinical specimens. 



II. Preventive Therapy for Latent TB Infection and Treatment of Active TB 


A. Preventive Therapy for Latent TB Infection 


Determining whether a person with a positive PPD test reaction or conversion is a candidate for preventive therapy
must be based on (a) the likelihood that the reaction represents true infection with 

M. tuberculosis

 (as determined by the cut-points), (b) the estimated risk for progression from latent infection to active TB, and
(c) the risk for hepatitis associated with taking isoniazid (INH) preventive therapy (as determined by age and other
factors). 


HCWs with positive PPD test results should be evaluated for preventive therapy regardless of their ages if they (a)
are recent converters, (b) are close contacts of persons who have active TB, (c) have a medical condition that increases
the risk for TB, (d) have HIV infection, or (e) use injecting drugs (

5

). HCWs with positive PPD test results who do not have these risk factors should be evaluated for preventive therapy
if they are <35 years of age. 

 Preventive therapy should be considered for anergic persons who are known contacts of infectious TB patients and
for persons from populations in which the prevalence of TB infection is very high (e.g., a prevalence of >10%). 

Because the risk for INH-associated hepatitis may be increased during the peripartum period, the decision to use
preventive therapy during pregnancy should be made on an individual basis and should depend on the patient's estimated
risk for progression to active disease. In general, preventive therapy can be delayed until after delivery. However,
for pregnant women who were probably infected recently or who have high-risk medical conditions, especially HIV
infection, INH preventive therapy should begin when the infection is documented (

81-84

). No evidence suggests that INH poses a carcinogenic risk to humans (

85-87

). 

The usual preventive therapy regimen is oral INH 300 mg daily for adults and 10 mg/kg/day for children (

88

). The recommended duration of therapy is 12 months for persons with HIV infection and 9 months for children. Other
persons should receive INH therapy for 6-12 months. For persons who have silicosis or a chest radiograph demonstrating
inactive fibrotic lesions and who have no evidence of active TB, acceptable regimens include (a) 4 months of INH plus
rifampin or (b) 12 months of INH, providing that infection with INH-resistant organisms is unlikely (

33

). For persons likely to be infected with MDR-TB, alternative multidrug preventive therapy regimens should be considered
(

89

). 





</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941028-2-00188 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941028-2-00109 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

All persons placed on preventive therapy should be educated regarding the possible adverse reactions associated
with INH use, and they should be questioned carefully at monthly intervals by qualified personnel for signs or symptoms
consistent with liver damage or other adverse effects (

81-84,88,90,91

). Because INH-associated hepatitis occurs more frequently among persons >35 years of age, a transaminase measurement
should be obtained from persons in this age group before initiation of INH therapy and then obtained monthly until
treatment has been completed. Other factors associated with an increased risk for hepatitis include daily alcohol
use, chronic liver disease, and injecting-drug use. In addition, postpubertal black and Hispanic women may be at
greater risk for hepatitis or drug interactions (

92

). More careful clinical monitoring of persons with these risk factors and possibly more frequent laboratory monitoring
should be considered. If any of these tests exceeds three to five times the upper limit of normal, discontinuation
of INH should be strongly considered. Liver function tests are not a substitute for monthly clinical evaluations
or for the prompt assessment of signs or symptoms of adverse reactions that could occur between the regularly scheduled
evaluations (

33

). 


Persons who have latent TB infection should be advised that they can be reinfected with another strain of 

M. tuberculosis

 (

93

). 




B. Treatment of Patients Who Have Active TB 




Drug-susceptibility testing should be performed on all initial isolates from patients with TB. However, test results
may not be available for several weeks, making selection of an initial regimen difficult, especially in areas where
drug-resistant TB has been documented. Current recommendations for therapy and dosage schedules for the treatment
of drug-susceptible TB should be followed (Table S2-2; Table S2-3) (

43

). Streptomycin is contraindicated in the treatment of pregnant women because of the risk for ototoxicity to the fetus.
In geographic areas or facilities in which drug-resistant TB is highly prevalent, the initial treatment regimen
used while results of drug-susceptibility tests are pending may need to be expanded. This decision should be based
on analysis of surveillance data. 


When results from drug-susceptibility tests become available, the regimen should be adjusted appropriately (

94-97

). If drug resistance is present, clinicians unfamiliar with the management of patients with drug-resistant TB should
seek expert consultation. 


For any regimen to be effective, adherence to the regimen must be ensured. The most effective method of ensuring adherence
is the use of DOT after the patient has been discharged from the hospital (

43,91

). This practice should be coordinated with the public health department.

Supplement 3: Engineering Controls


I. Introduction


This supplement provides information regarding the use of ventilation (Section II) and UVGI (Section III) for preventing
the transmission of 

M. tuberculosis

 in health-care facilities. The information provided is primarily conceptual and is intended to educate staff in
the health-care facility concerning engineering controls and how these controls can be used as part of the TB infection-control
program. This supplement should not be used in place of consultation with experts, who can assume responsibility
for advising on ventilation system design and selection, installation, and maintenance of equipment.
The recommendations for engineering controls include (a) local exhaust ventilation (i.e., source control), (b)
general ventilation, and (c) air cleaning. General ventilation considerations include (a) dilution and removal
of contaminants, (b) airflow patterns within rooms, (c) airflow direction in facilities, (d) negative pressure
in rooms, and (e) TB isolation rooms. Air cleaning or disinfection can be accomplished by filtration of air (e.g.,
through HEPA filters) or by UVGI.


II. Ventilation


Ventilation systems for health-care facilities should be designed, and modified when necessary, by ventilation
engineers in collaboration with infection-control and occupational health staff. Recommendations for designing
and operating ventilation systems have been published by ASHRAE (

47

), AIA (

48

), and the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists, Inc. (

98

).
As part of the TB infection-control plan, health-care facility personnel should determine the number of TB isolation
rooms, treatment rooms, and local exhaust devices (i.e., for cough-inducing or aerosol-generating procedures)
that the facility needs. The locations of these rooms and devices will depend on where in the facility the ventilation
conditions recommended in this document can be achieved. Grouping isolation rooms together in one area of the facility
may facilitate the care of TB patients and the installation and maintenance of optimal engineering controls (particularly
ventilation).
Periodic evaluations of the ventilation system should review the number of TB isolation rooms, treatment rooms,
and local exhaust devices needed and the regular maintenance and monitoring of the local and general exhaust systems
(including HEPA filtration systems if they are used).
The various types and conditions of ventilation systems in health-care facilities and the individual needs of these
facilities preclude the ability to provide specific instructions regarding the implementation of these recommendations.
Engineering control methods must be tailored to each facility on the basis of need and the feasibility of using the
ventilation and air-cleaning concepts discussed in this supplement.


A. Local Exhaust Ventilation




Purpose:

 To capture airborne contaminants at or near their source (i.e., the source control method) and remove these contaminants
without exposing persons in the area to infectious agents (

98

).
Source control techniques can prevent or reduce the spread of infectious droplet nuclei into the general air circulation
by entrapping infectious droplet nuclei as they are being emitted by the patient (i.e., the source). These techniques
are especially important when performing procedures likely to generate aerosols containing infectious particles
and when infectious TB patients are coughing or sneezing.
Local exhaust ventilation is a preferred source control technique, and it is often the most efficient way to contain
airborne contaminants because it captures these contaminants near their source before they can disperse. Therefore,
the technique should be used, if feasible, wherever aerosol-generating procedures are performed. Two basic types
of local exhaust devices use hoods: (a) The enclosing type, in which the hood either partially or fully encloses the
infectious source; and (b) the exterior type, in which the infectious source is near but outside the hood. Fully enclosed
hoods, booths, or tents are always preferable to exterior types because of their superior ability to prevent contaminants
from escaping into the HCW's breathing zone. Descriptions of both enclosing and exterior devices have been published
previously (

98

).


1. Enclosing Devices


The enclosing type of local exhaust ventilation device includes laboratory hoods used for processing specimens
that could contain viable infectious organisms, booths used for sputum induction or administration of aerosolized
medications (e.g., aerosolized pentamidine) (Figure S3-1), and tents or hoods made of vinyl or other materials
used to enclose and isolate a patient. These devices are available in various configurations. The most simple of these
latter devices is a tent that is placed over the patient; the tent has an exhaust connection to the room discharge exhaust
system. The most complex device is an enclosure that has a sophisticated self-contained airflow and recirculation
system.
Both tents and booths should have sufficient airflow to remove at least 99% of airborne particles during the interval
between the departure of one patient and the arrival of the next (

99

). The time required for removing a given percentage of airborne particles from an enclosed space depends on several
factors. These factors include the number of ACH, which is determined by the number of cubic feet of air in the room or
booth and the rate at which air is entering the room or booth at the intake source; the location of the ventilation inlet
and outlet; and the physical configuration of the room or booth (Table S3-1).

2. Exterior Devices


The exterior type of local exhaust ventilation device is usually a hood very near, but not enclosing, the infectious
patient. The airflow produced by these devices should be sufficient to prevent cross-currents of air near the patient's
face from causing escape of droplet nuclei. Whenever possible, the patient should face directly into the hood opening
so that any coughing or sneezing is directed into the hood, where the droplet nuclei are captured. The device should
maintain an air velocity of " 200 feet per minute at the patient's breathing zone to ensure capture of droplet nuclei.


3. Discharge Exhaust From Booths, Tents, and Hoods


Air from booths, tents, and hoods may be discharged into the room in which the device is located or it may be exhausted
to the outside. If the air is discharged into the room, a HEPA filter should be incorporated at the discharge duct or
vent of the device. The exhaust fan should be located on the discharge side of the HEPA filter to ensure that the air pressure
in the filter housing and booth is negative with respect to adjacent areas. Uncontaminated air from the room will flow
into the booth through all openings, thus preventing infectious droplet nuclei in the booth from escaping into the
room. Most commercially available booths, tents, and hoods are fitted with HEPA filters, in which case additional
HEPA filtration is not needed.
If the device does not incorporate a HEPA filter, the air from the device should be exhausted to the outside in accordance
with recommendations for isolation room exhaust (Suppl. 3, Section II.B.5). (See Supplement 3, Section II.C, for
information regarding recirculation of exhaust air.)

B. General Ventilation 


General ventilation can be used for several purposes, including diluting and removing contaminated air, controlling
airflow patterns within rooms, and controlling the direction of airflow throughout a facility. Information on these
topics is contained in the following sections. 


1. Dilution and Removal 




Purpose: 

To reduce the concentration of contaminants in the air. 
General ventilation maintains air quality by two processes: dilution and removal of airborne contaminants. Uncontaminated
supply (i.e., incoming) air mixes with the contaminated room air (i.e., dilution), which is subsequently removed
from the room by the exhaust system (i.e., removal). These processes reduce the concentration of droplet nuclei in
the room air. 
a. Types of general ventilation systems.
Two types of general ventilation systems can be used for dilution and removal of contaminated air: the single-pass
system and the recirculating system. In a single-pass system, the supply air is either outside air that has been appropriately
heated and cooled or air from a central system that supplies a number of areas. After air passes through the room (or
area), 100% of that air is exhausted to the outside. The single-pass system is the preferred choice in areas where infectious
airborne droplet nuclei are known to be present (e.g., TB isolation rooms or treatment rooms) because it prevents
contaminated air from being recirculated to other areas of the facility. 
In a recirculating system, a small portion of the exhaust air is discharged to the outside and is replaced with fresh
outside air, which mixes with the portion of exhaust air that was not discharged to the outside. The resulting mixture,
which can contain a large proportion of contaminated air, is then recirculated to the areas serviced by the system.
This air mixture could be recirculated into the general ventilation, in which case contaminants may be carried from
contaminated areas to uncontaminated areas. Alternatively, the air mixture could also be recirculated within a
specific room or area, in which case other areas of the facility will not be affected (Suppl. 3, Section II.C.3). 
b. Ventilation rates. 
Recommended general ventilation rates for health-care facilities are usually expressed in number of ACH. This number
is the ratio of the volume of air entering the room per hour to the room volume and is equal to the exhaust airflow (Q [cubic
feet per minute]) divided by the room volume (V [cubic feet]) multiplied by 60 (i.e., ACH = Q 
 V  x  60). 
The feasibility of achieving specific ventilation rates depends on the construction and operational requirements
of the ventilation system (e.g., the energy requirements to move and to heat or cool the air). The feasibility of achieving
specific ventilation rates may also be different for retrofitted facilities and newly constructed facilities.
The expense and effort of achieving specific higher ventilation rates for new construction may be reasonable, whereas
retrofitting an existing facility to achieve similar ventilation rates may be more difficult. However, achieving
higher ventilation rates by using auxiliary methods (e.g., room-air recirculation) in addition to exhaust ventilation
may be feasible in existing facilities (Suppl. 3, Section II.C). 


2. Airflow Patterns Within Rooms (Air Mixing) 




Purpose: 

To provide optimum airflow patterns and prevent both stagnation and short-circuiting of air. 
General ventilation systems should be designed to provide optimal patterns of airflow within rooms and prevent air
stagnation or short-circuiting of air from the supply to the exhaust (i.e., passage of air directly from the air supply
to the air exhaust). To provide optimal airflow patterns, the air supply and exhaust should be located such that clean
air first flows to parts of the room where HCWs are likely to work, and then flows across the infectious source and into
the exhaust. In this way, the HCW is not positioned between the infectious source and the exhaust location. Although
this configuration may not always be possible, it should be used whenever feasible. One way to achieve this airflow
pattern is to supply air at the side of the room opposite the patient and exhaust it from the side where the patient is
located. Another method, which is most effective when the supply air is cooler than the room air, is to supply air near
the ceiling and exhaust it near the floor (Figure S3-2). Airflow patterns are affected by large air temperature
differentials, the precise location of the supply and exhausts, the location of furniture, the movement of HCWs and
patients, and the physical configuration of the space. Smoke tubes can be used to visualize airflow patterns in a manner
similar to that described for estimating room air mixing.

Adequate air mixing, which requires that an adequate number of ACH be provided to a room (Suppl. 3, Section II.B.1),
must be ensured to prevent air stagnation within the room. However, the air will not usually be changed the calculated
number of times per hour because the airflow patterns in the room may not permit complete mixing of the supply and room
air in all parts of the room. This results in an ``effective'' airflow rate in which the supplied airflow may be less
than required for proper ventilation. To account for this variation, a mixing factor (which ranges from 1 for perfect
mixing to 10 for poor mixing) is applied as a multiplier to determine the actual supply airflow (i.e., the recommended
ACH multiplied by the mixing factor equals the actual required ACH) (

51,98

). The room air supply and exhaust system should be designed to achieve the lowest mixing factor possible. The mixing
factor is determined most accurately by experimentally testing each space configuration, but this procedure is
complex and time-consuming. A reasonably good qualitative measure of mixing can be estimated by an experienced ventilation
engineer who releases smoke from smoke tubes at a number of locations in the room and observes the movement of the smoke.
Smoke movement in all areas of the room indicates good mixing. Stagnation of air in some areas of the room indicates
poor mixing, and movement of the supply and exhaust openings or redirection of the supply air is necessary. 


3. Airflow Direction in the Facility 




Purpose: 

To contain contaminated air in localized areas in a facility and prevent its spread to uncontaminated areas. 
a. Directional airflow.

The general ventilation system should be designed and balanced so that air flows from less contaminated (i.e., more
clean) to more contaminated (less clean) areas (

47,48

). For example, air should flow from corridors (cleaner areas) into TB isolation rooms (less clean areas) to prevent
spread of contaminants to other areas. In some special treatment rooms in which operative and invasive procedures
are performed, the direction of airflow is from the room to the hallway to provide cleaner air during these procedures.
Cough-inducing or aerosol-generating procedures (e.g., bronchoscopy and irrigation of tuberculous abscesses)
should not be performed in rooms with this type of airflow on patients who may have infectious TB. 

b. Negative pressure for achieving directional airflow. 

The direction of airflow is controlled by creating a lower (negative) pressure in the area into which the flow of air
is desired. For air to flow from one area to another, the air pressure in the two areas must be different. Air will flow
from a higher pressure area to a lower pressure area. The lower pressure area is described as being at negative* pressure
relative to the higher pressure area. Negative pressure is attained by exhausting air from an area at a higher rate
than air is being supplied. The level of negative pressure necessary to achieve the desired airflow will depend on
the physical configuration of the ventilation system and area, including the airflow path and flow openings, and
should be determined on an individual basis by an experienced ventilation engineer. 





4. Achieving Negative Pressure in a Room 





Purpose: 

To control the direction of airflow between the room and adjacent areas, thereby preventing contaminated air from
escaping from the room into other areas of the facility. 

a. Pressure differential. 
The minimum pressure difference necessary to achieve and maintain negative pressure that will result in airflow
into the room is very small (0.001 inch of water). Higher pressures (" 0.001 inch of water) are satisfactory; however,
these higher pressures may be difficult to achieve. The actual level of negative pressure achieved will depend on
the difference in the ventilation exhaust and supply flows and the physical configuration of the room, including
the airflow path and flow openings. If the room is well sealed, negative pressures greater than the minimum of 0.001
inch of water may be readily achieved. However, if rooms are not well sealed, as may be the case in many facilities (especially
older facilities), achieving higher negative pressures may require exhaust/supply flow differentials beyond
the capability of the ventilation system. 


To establish negative pressure in a room that has a normally functioning ventilation system, the room supply and exhaust
airflows are first balanced to achieve an exhaust flow of either 10% or 50 cubic feet per minute (cfm) greater than the
supply (whichever is the greater). In most situations, this specification should achieve a negative pressure of
at least 0.001 inch of water. If the minimum 0.001 inch of water is not achieved and cannot be achieved by increasing
the flow differential (within the limits of the ventilation system), the room should be inspected for leakage (e.g.,
through doors, windows, plumbing, and equipment wall penetrations), and corrective action should be taken to seal
the leaks. 
Negative pressure in a room can be altered by changing the ventilation system operation or by the opening and closing
of the room's doors, corridor doors, or windows. When an operating configuration has been established, it is essential
that all doors and windows remain properly closed in the isolation room and other areas (e.g., doors in corridors that
affect air pressure) except when persons need to enter or leave the room or area. 
b. Alternate methods for achieving negative pressure. 
Although an anteroom is not a substitute for negative pressure in a room, it may be used to reduce escape of droplet nuclei
during opening and closing of the isolation room door. Some anterooms have their own air supply duct, but others do
not. The TB isolation room should have negative pressure relative to the anteroom, but the air pressure in the anteroom
relative to the corridor may vary depending on the building design. This should be determined, in accordance with
applicable regulations, by a qualified ventilation engineer. 
If the existing ventilation system is incapable of achieving the desired negative pressure because the room lacks
a separate ventilation system or the room's system cannot provide the proper airflow, steps should be taken to provide
a means to discharge air from the room. The amount of air to be exhausted will be the same as discussed previously (Suppl.
3, Section II.B.4.a).

<TEXT>
 

Fixed room-air recirculation systems (i.e., systems that recirculate the air in an entire room) may be designed to
achieve negative pressure by discharging air outside the room (Suppl. 3, Section II.C.3). 

Some portable room-air recirculation units (Suppl. 3, Section II.C.3.b.) are designed to discharge air to the outside
to achieve negative pressure. Air cleaners that can accomplish this must be designed specifically for this purpose.


A small centrifugal blower (i.e., exhaust fan) can be used to exhaust air to the outside through a window or outside
wall. This approach may be used as an interim measure to achieve negative pressure, but it provides no fresh air and
suboptimal dilution. 

Another approach to achieving the required pressure difference is to pressurize the corridor. Using this method,
the corridor's general ventilation system is balanced to create a higher air pressure in the corridor than in the isolation
room; the type of balancing necessary depends on the configuration of the ventilation system. Ideally, the corridor
air supply rate should be increased while the corridor exhaust rate is not increased. If this is not possible, the exhaust
rate should be decreased by resetting appropriate exhaust dampers. Caution should be exercised, however, to ensure
that the exhaust rate is not reduced below acceptable levels. This approach requires that all settings used to achieve
the pressure balance, including doors, be maintained. This method may not be desirable if the corridor being pressurized
has rooms in which negative pressure is not desired. In many situations, this system is difficult to achieve, and it
should be considered only after careful review by ventilation personnel. 

c. Monitoring negative pressure. 

The negative pressure in a room can be monitored by visually observing the direction of airflow (e.g., using smoke
tubes) or by measuring the differential pressure between the room and its surrounding area. 

Smoke from a smoke tube can be used to observe airflow between areas or airflow patterns within an area. To check the
negative pressure in a room by using a smoke tube, hold the smoke tube near the bottom of the door and approximately 2
inches in front of the door, or at the face of a grille or other opening if the door has such a feature, and generate a small
amount of smoke by gently squeezing the bulb (Figure S3-3). The smoke tube should be held parallel to the door,
and the smoke should be issued from the tube slowly to ensure the velocity of the smoke from the tube does not overpower
the air velocity. The smoke will travel in the direction of airflow. If the room is at negative pressure, the smoke will
travel under the door and into the room (e.g., from higher to lower pressure). If the room is not at negative pressure,
the smoke will be blown outward or will stay stationary. This test must be performed while the door is closed. If room
air cleaners are being used in the room, they should be running. The smoke is irritating if inhaled, and care should
be taken not to inhale it directly from the smoke tube. However, the quantity of smoke issued from the tube is minimal
and is not detectable at short distances from the tube. 

Differential pressure-sensing devices also can be used to monitor negative pressure; they can provide either periodic
(noncontinuous) pressure measurements or continuous pressure monitoring. The continuous monitoring component
may simply be a visible and/or audible warning signal that air pressure is low. In addition, it may also provide a pressure
readout signal, which can be recorded for later verification or used to automatically adjust the facility's ventilation
control system.

Pressure-measuring devices should sense the room pressure just inside the airflow path into the room (e.g., at the
bottom of the door). Unusual airflow patterns within the room can cause pressure variations; for example, the air
can be at negative pressure at the middle of a door and at positive pressure at the bottom of the same door (Figure S3-4).
If the pressure-sensing ports of the device cannot be located directly across the airflow path, it will be necessary
to validate that the negative pressure at the sensing point is and remains the same as the negative pressure across
the flow path. 

Pressure-sensing devices should incorporate an audible warning with a time delay to indicate that a door is open.
When the door to the room is opened, the negative pressure will decrease. The time-delayed signal should allow sufficient
time for persons to enter or leave the room without activating the audible warning.

A potential problem with using pressure-sensing devices is that the pressure differentials used to achieve the low
negative pressure necessitate the use of very sensitive mechanical devices, electronic devices, or pressure gauges
to ensure accurate measurements. Use of devices that cannot measure these low pressures (i.e., pressures as low as
0.001 inch of water) will require setting higher negative pressures that may be difficult and, in some instances,
impractical to achieve (Suppl. 3, Section II.B.4). 
Periodic checks are required to ensure that the desired negative pressure is present and that the continuous monitoring
devices, if used, are operating properly. If smoke tubes or other visual checks are used, TB isolation rooms and treatment
rooms should be checked frequently for negative pressure. Rooms undergoing changes to the ventilation system should
be checked daily. TB isolation rooms should be checked daily for negative pressure while being used for TB isolation.
If these rooms are not being used for patients who have suspected or confirmed TB but potentially could be used for such
patients, the negative pressure in the rooms should be checked monthly. If pressure-sensing devices are used, negative
pressure should be verified at least once a month by using smoke tubes or taking pressure measurements. 



C. HEPA Filtration 




Purpose: 

To remove contaminants from the air. 

HEPA filtration can be used as a method of air cleaning that supplements other recommended ventilation measures.
For the purposes of these guidelines, HEPA filters are defined as air-cleaning devices that have a demonstrated and
documented minimum removal efficiency of 99.97% of particles greater than or equal to 0.3 

m

m in diameter. HEPA filters have been shown to be effective in reducing the concentration of 

Aspergillus 

spores (which range in size from 1.5 

m

m to 6 

m

m) to below measurable levels (100-102). The ability of HEPA filters to remove tubercle bacilli from the air
has not been studied, but 

M. tuberculosis 

droplet nuclei probably range from 1 

m

m to 5 

m

m in diameter (i.e., approximately the same size as 

Aspergillus 

spores). Therefore, HEPA filters can be expected to remove infectious droplet nuclei from contaminated air. HEPA
filters can be used to clean air before it is exhausted to the outside, recirculated to other areas of a facility, or
recirculated within a room. If the device is not completely passive (e.g., it utilizes techniques such as electrostatics)
and the failure of the electrostatic components permits loss of filtration efficiency to less than 99.97%, the device
should not be used in systems that recirculate air back into the general facility ventilation system from TB isolation
rooms and treatment rooms in which procedures are performed on patients who may have infectious TB (Suppl. 3, Section
II.C.2). 

HEPA filters can be used in a number of ways to reduce or eliminate infectious droplet nuclei from room air or exhaust.
These methods include placement of HEPA filters (a) in exhaust ducts to remove droplet nuclei from air being discharged
to the outside, either directly or through ventilation equipment; (b) in ducts discharging room air into the general
ventilation system; and (c) in fixed or portable room-air cleaners. The effectiveness of portable HEPA room-air
cleaning units has not been evaluated adequately, and there is probably considerable variation in their effectiveness.
HEPA filters can also be used in exhaust ducts or vents that discharge air from booths or enclosures into the surrounding
room (Suppl. 3, Section II.A.3). In any application, HEPA filters should be installed carefully and maintained meticulously
to ensure adequate function. 
Manufacturers of room-air cleaning equipment should provide documentation of the HEPA filter efficiency and the
efficiency of the installed device in lowering room-air contaminant levels.

1. Use of HEPA Filtration When Exhausting Air to the Outside



HEPA filters can be used as an added safety measure to clean air from isolation rooms and local exhaust devices (i.e.,
booths, tents, or hoods used for cough-inducing procedures) before exhausting it directly to the outside, but such
use is unnecessary if the exhaust air cannot re-enter the ventilation system supply. The use of HEPA filters should
be considered wherever exhaust air could possibly reenter the system. 
In many instances, exhaust air is not discharged directly to the outside; rather, the air is directed through heat-recovery
devices (e.g., heat wheels). Heat wheels are often used to reduce the costs of operating ventilation systems (

103

). If such units are used with the system, a HEPA filter should also be used. As the wheel rotates, energy is transferred
into or removed from the supply inlet air stream. The HEPA filter should be placed upstream from the heat wheel because
of the potential for leakage across the seals separating the inlet and exhaust chambers and the theoretical possibility
that droplet nuclei could be impacted on the wheel by the exhaust air and subsequently stripped off into the supply
air. 



2. Recirculation of HEPA-Filtered Air to Other Areas of a Facility



Air from TB isolation rooms and treatment rooms used to treat patients who have confirmed or suspected infectious
TB should be exhausted to the outside in accordance with applicable Federal, state, and local regulations. The air
should not be recirculated into the general ventilation. In some instances, recirculation of air into the general
ventilation system from such rooms is unavoidable (i.e., in existing facilities in which the ventilation system
or facility configuration makes venting the exhaust to the outside impossible). In such cases, HEPA filters should
be installed in the exhaust duct leading from the room to the general ventilation system to remove infectious organisms
and particulates the size of droplet nuclei from the air before it is returned to the general ventilation system (Section
II.F; Suppl. 3). Air from TB isolation rooms and treatment rooms in new or renovated facilities should not be recirculated
into the general ventilation system. 



3. Recirculation of HEPA-Filtered Air Within a Room




Individual room-air recirculation can be used in areas where there is no general ventilation system, where an existing
system is incapable of providing adequate airflow, or where an increase in ventilation is desired without affecting
the fresh air supply or negative pressure system already in place. Recirculation of HEPA-filtered air within a room
can be achieved in several ways: (a) by exhausting air from the room into a duct, filtering it through a HEPA filter installed
in the duct, and returning it to the room (Figure S3-5); (b) by filtering air through HEPA recirculation systems
mounted on the wall or ceiling of the room (Figure S3-6); or (c) by filtering air through portable HEPA recirculation
systems. In this document, the first two of these approaches are referred to as fixed room-air recirculation systems,
because the HEPA filter devices are fixed in place and are not easily movable.

<PARENT> FR941028-2-00109 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

a. Fixed room-air recirculation systems.

The preferred method of recirculating HEPA-filtered air within a room is a built-in system, in which air is exhausted
from the room into a duct, filtered through a HEPA filter, and returned to the room (Figure S3-5). This technique
may be used to add air changes in areas where there is a recommended minimum ACH that is difficult to meet with general
ventilation alone. The air does not have to be conditioned, other than by the filtration, and this permits higher airflow
rates than the general ventilation system can usually achieve. An alternative is the use of HEPA filtration units
that are mounted on the wall or ceiling of the room (Figure S3-7). Fixed recirculation systems are preferred
over portable (free-standing) units because they can be installed and maintained with a greater degree of reliability.

b. Portable room-air recirculation units.

Portable HEPA filtration units may be considered for recirculating air within rooms in which there is no general ventilation
system, where the system is incapable of providing adequate airflow, or where increased effectiveness in room airflow
is desired. Effectiveness depends on circulating as much of the air in the room as possible through the HEPA filter,
which may be difficult to achieve and evaluate. The effectiveness of a particular unit can vary depending on the room's
configuration, the furniture and persons in the room, and placement of the HEPA filtration unit and the supply and
exhaust grilles. Therefore, the effectiveness of the portable unit may vary considerably in rooms with different
configurations or in the same room if moved from one location to another in the room. If portable units are used, caution
should be exercised to ensure they can recirculate all or nearly all of the room air through the HEPA filter. Some commercially
available units may not be able to meet this requirement because of design limitations or insufficient airflow capacity.
In addition, units should be designed and operated to ensure that persons in the room cannot interfere with or otherwise
compromise the functioning of the unit. Portable HEPA filtration units have not been evaluated adequately to determine
their role in TB infection-control programs.

Portable HEPA filtration units should be designed to achieve the equivalent of "12 ACH. They should also be designed
to ensure adequate air mixing in all areas of the hospital rooms in which they are used, and they should not interfere
with the current ventilation system.

Some HEPA filtration units employ UVGI for disinfecting air after HEPA filtration. However, whether exposing the
HEPA-filtered air to UV irradiation further decreases the concentration of contaminants is not known.

c. Evaluation of room-air recirculation systems and units.

Detailed and accurate evaluations of room-air recirculation systems and units require the use of sophisticated
test equipment and lengthy test procedures that are not practical. However, an estimate of the unit's ability to circulate
the air in the room can be made by visualizing airflow patterns as was described previously for estimating room air
mixing (Suppl. 3, Section II.B.1). If the air movement is good in all areas of the room, the unit should be effective.



4. Installing, Maintaining, and Monitoring HEPA Filters



Proper installation and testing and meticulous maintenance are critical if a HEPA filtration system is used (

104

), especially if the system used recirculates air to other parts of the facility. Improper design, installation,
or maintenance could allow infectious particles to circumvent filtration and escape into the general ventilation
system (

47

). HEPA filters should be installed to prevent leakage between filter segments and between the filter bed and its frame.
A regularly scheduled maintenance program is required to monitor the HEPA filter for possible leakage and for filter
loading. A quantitative leakage and filter performance test (e.g., the dioctal phthalate [DOP] penetration test
[

105

]) should be performed at the initial installation and every time the filter is changed or moved. The test should be
repeated every 6 months for filters in general-use areas and in areas with systems that exhaust air that is likely to
be contaminated with 

M. tuberculosis

 (e.g, TB isolation rooms).

A manometer or other pressure-sensing device should be installed in the filter system to provide an accurate and objective
means of determining the need for filter replacement. Pressure drop characteristics of the filter are supplied by
the manufacturer of the filter. Installation of the filter should allow for maintenance that will not contaminate
the delivery system or the area served. For general infection-control purposes, special care should be taken to not
jar or drop the filter element during or after removal.

The scheduled maintenance program should include procedures for installation, removal, and disposal of filter
elements. HEPA filter maintenance should be performed only by adequately trained personnel. Appropriate respiratory
protection should be worn while performing maintenance and testing procedures. In addition, filter housing and
ducts leading to the housing should be labelled clearly with the words ``Contaminated Air'' (or a similar warning).

When a HEPA filter is used, one or more lower efficiency disposable prefilters installed upstream will extend the
useful life of the HEPA filter. A disposable filter can increase the life of a HEPA filter by 25%. If the disposable filter
is followed by a 90% extended surface filter, the life of the HEPA filter can be extended almost 900% (

98

). These prefilters should be handled and disposed of in the same manner as the HEPA filter.



D. TB Isolation Rooms and Treatment Rooms





Purpose: 

To separate patients who are likely to have infectious TB from other persons, to provide an environment that will allow
reduction of the concentration of droplet nuclei through various engineering methods, and to prevent the escape
of droplet nuclei from such rooms into the corridor and other areas of the facility using directional airflow.

A hierarchy of ventilation methods used to achieve a reduction in the concentration of droplet nuclei and to achieve
directional airflow using negative pressure has been developed (Table S3-2). The methods are listed in order
from the most desirable to the least desirable. The method selected will depend on the configuration of the isolation
room and the ventilation system in the facility; the determination should be made in consultation with a ventilation
engineer.

1. Preventing the Escape of Droplet Nuclei From the Room



Rooms used for TB isolation should be single-patient rooms with negative pressure relative to the corridor or other
areas connected to the room. Doors between the isolation room and other areas should remain closed except for entry
into or exit from the room. The room's openings (e.g., windows and electrical and plumbing entries) should be sealed
as much as possible. However, a small gap of 1/8 to 1/2 inch should be at the bottom of the door to provide a controlled
airflow path. Proper use of negative pressure will prevent contaminated air from escaping the room.



2. Reducing the Concentration of Droplet Nuclei in the Room



ASHRAE (

47

), AIA (

48

), and the Health Resources and Services Administration (

49

) recommend a minimum of 6 ACH for TB isolation rooms and treatment rooms. This ventilation rate is based on comfort-
and odor-control considerations. The effectiveness of this level of airflow in reducing the concentration of droplet
nuclei in the room, thus reducing the transmission of airborne pathogens, has not been evaluated directly or adequately.

Ventilation rates >6 ACH are likely to produce an incrementally greater reduction in the concentration of bacteria
in a room than are lower rates (

50-52

). However, accurate quantitation of decreases in risk that would result from specific increases in general ventilation
levels has not been performed and may not be possible.

To reduce the concentration of droplet nuclei, TB isolation rooms and treatment rooms in existing health-care facilities
should have an airflow of "6 ACH. Where feasible, this airflow rate should be increased to "12 ACH by adjusting or modifying
the ventilation system or by using auxiliary means (e.g., recirculation of air through fixed HEPA filtration units
or portable air cleaners) (Suppl. 3, Section II.C) (

53

). New construction or renovation of existing health-care facilities should be designed so that TB isolation rooms
achieve an airflow of "12 ACH.



3. Exhaust From TB Isolation Rooms and Treatment Rooms



Air from TB isolation rooms and treatment rooms in which patients with infectious TB may be examined should be exhausted
directly to the outside of the building and away from air-intake vents, persons, and animals in accordance with federal,
state, and local regulations concerning environmental discharges. (See Suppl. 3, Section II.C, for information
regarding recirculation of exhaust air.) Exhaust ducts should not be located near areas that may be populated (e.g.,
near sidewalks or windows that could be opened). Ventilation system exhaust discharges and inlets should be designed
to prevent reentry of exhausted air. Wind blowing over a building creates a highly turbulent recirculation zone,
which can cause exhausted air to reenter the building (Figure S3-7). Exhaust flow should be discharged above
this zone (Suppl. 3, Section II.C.1). Design guidelines for proper placement of exhaust ducts can be found in the 1989


ASHRAE Fundamentals Handbook 

(

106

). If recirculation of air from such rooms into the general ventilation system is unavoidable, the air should be passed
through a HEPA filter before recirculation (Suppl. 3, Section II.C.2).

4. Alternatives to TB Isolation Rooms 



Isolation can also be achieved by use of negative-pressure enclosures (e.g, tents or booths) (Suppl. 3, Section II.A.1).
These can be used to provide patient isolation in areas such as emergency rooms and medical testing and treatment areas
and to supplement isolation in designated isolation rooms. 



III. UVGI 




Purpose: 

To kill or inactivate airborne tubercle bacilli. 

Research has demonstrated that UVGI is effective in killing or inactivating tubercle bacilli under experimental
conditions (

66,107-110

) and in reducing transmission of other infections in hospitals (

111

), military housing (

112

), and classrooms (

113-115

). Because of the results of numerous studies (

116-120

) and the experiences of TB clinicians and mycobacteriologists during the past several decades, the use of UVGI has
been recommended as a supplement to other TB infection-control measures in settings where the need for killing or
inactivating tubercle bacilli is important (

2,4,121-125

). 

UV radiation is defined as that portion of the electromagnetic spectrum described by wavelengths from 100 to 400 nm.
For convenience of classification, the UV spectrum has been separated into three different wavelength bands: UV-A
(long wavelengths, range: 320-400 nm), UV-B (midrange wavelengths, range: 290-320 nm), and UV-C
(short wavelengths, range: 100-290 nm) (

126

). Commercially available UV lamps used for germicidal purposes are low-pressure mercury vapor lamps (

127

) that emit radiant energy in the UV-C range, predominantly at a wavelength of 253.7 nm (

128

). 



A. Applications 



UVGI can be used as a method of air disinfection to supplement other engineering controls. Two systems of UVGI can be
used for this purpose: duct irradiation and upper-room air irradiation. 



1. Duct Irradiation 





Purpose: 

To inactivate tubercle bacilli without exposing persons to UVGI. 

In duct irradiation systems, UV lamps are placed inside ducts that remove air from rooms to disinfect the air before
it is recirculated. When UVGI duct systems are properly designed, installed, and maintained, high levels of UV radiation
may be produced in the duct work. The only potential for human exposure to this radiation occurs during maintenance
operations. 

Duct irradiation may be used: 
 In a TB isolation room or treatment room to recirculate air from the room, through a duct containing UV lamps,
and back into the room. This recirculation method can increase the overall room airflow but does not increase the supply
of fresh outside air to the room. 

 In other patients' rooms and in waiting rooms, emergency rooms, and other general-use areas of a facility where
patients with undiagnosed TB could potentially contaminate the air, to recirculate air back into the general ventilation.
Duct-irradiation systems are dependent on airflow patterns within a room that ensure that all or nearly all of the
room air circulates through the duct. 



2. Upper-Room Air Irradiation 





Purpose: 

To inactivate tubercle bacilli in the upper part of the room, while minimizing radiation exposure to persons in the
lower part of the room. 

In upper-room air irradiation, UVGI lamps are suspended from the ceiling or mounted on the wall. The bottom of the lamp
is shielded to direct the radiation upward but not downward. The system depends on air mixing to take irradiated air
from the upper to the lower part of the room, and nonirradiated air from the lower to the upper part. The irradiated air
space is much larger than that in a duct system. 

UVGI has been effective in killing bacteria under conditions where air mixing was accomplished mainly by convection.
For example, BCG was atomized in a room that did not have supplemental ventilation (

120

), and in another study a surrogate bacteria, 

Serratia marcesens

, was aerosolized in a room with a ventilation rate of 6 ACH (

129

). These reports estimated the effect of UVGI to be equivalent to 10 and 39 ACH, respectively, for the organisms tested,
which are less resistant to UVGI than 

M. tuberculosis 

(

120

). The addition of fans or some heating/air conditioning arrangements may double the effectiveness of UVGI lamps
(

130-132

). Greater rates of ventilation, however, may decrease the length of time the air is irradiated, thus decreasing the
killing of bacteria (

117,129

). The optimal relationship between ventilation and UVGI is not known. Air irradiation lamps used in corridors have
been effective in killing atomized 

S. marcesens 

(

133

). Use of UVGI lamps in an outpatient room has reduced culturable airborne bacteria by 14%-19%. However, the
irradiation did not reduce the concentration of gram-positive, rod-shaped bacteria; although fast-growing mycobacteria
were cultured, 

M. tuberculosis 

could not be recovered from the room's air samples because of fungal overgrowth of media plates (

134

). 

Upper-room air UVGI irradiation may be used: 
 In isolation or treatment rooms as a supplemental method of air cleaning. 
 In other patients' rooms and in waiting rooms, emergency rooms, corridors, and other central areas of a facility
where patients with undiagnosed TB could potentially contaminate the air. Determinants of UVGI effectiveness include
room configuration, UV lamp placement, and the adequacy of airflow patterns in bringing contaminated air into contact
with the irradiated upper-room space. Air mixing may be facilitated by supplying cool air near the ceiling in rooms
where warmer air (or a heating device) is present below. The ceiling should be high enough for a large volume of upper-room
air to be irradiated without HCWs and patients being overexposed to UV radiation. 


B. Limitations 


Because the clinical effectiveness of UV systems varies, and because of the risk for transmission of 

M. tuberculosis 

if a system malfunctions or is maintained improperly, UVGI is not recommended for the following specific applications:

<DOCNO> FR941028-2-00201 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941028-2-00109 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

1. Duct systems using UVGI are not recommended as a substitute for HEPA filters if air from isolation rooms must be recirculated
to other areas of a facility. 
2. UVGI alone is not recommended as a substitute for HEPA filtration or local exhaust of air to the outside from booths,
tents, or hoods used for cough-inducing procedures. 
3. UVGI is not a substitute for negative pressure. 
The use of UV lamps and HEPA filtration in a single unit would not be expected to have any infection-control benefits
not provided by use of the HEPA filter alone. 
The effectiveness of UVGI in killing airborne tubercle bacilli depends on the intensity of UVGI, the duration of contact
the organism has with the irradiation, and the relative humidity (

66,108,111

). Humidity can have an adverse effect on UVGI effectiveness at levels >70% relative humidity for 

S. marcescens 

(

135

). The interaction of these factors has not been fully defined, however, making precise recommendations for individual
UVGI installations difficult to develop. 
Old lamps or dust-covered UV lamps are less effective; therefore, regular maintenance of UVGI systems is crucial.



C. Safety Issues 


Short-term overexposure to UV radiation can cause erythema and keratoconjunctivitis (

136,137

). Broad-spectrum UV radiation has been associated with increased risk for squamous and basal cell carcinomas of
the skin (138). UV-C was recently classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as ``probably
carcinogenic to humans (Group 2A)'' (

138

). This classification is based on studies suggesting that UV-C radiation can induce skin cancers in animals;
DNA damage, chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchange and transformation in human cells in vitro; and
DNA damage in mammalian skin cells in vivo. In the animal studies, a contribution of UV-B to the tumor effects
could not be excluded, but the effects were greater than expected for UV-B alone (

138

). Although some recent studies have demonstrated that UV radiation can activate HIV gene promoters (i.e., the genes
in HIV that prompt replication of the virus) in laboratory samples of human cells (

139-144

), the implications of these in vitro findings for humans are unknown. 
In 1972, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) published a recommended exposure limit
(REL) for occupational exposure to UV radiation (

136

). The REL is intended to protect workers from the acute effects of UV exposure (e.g., erythema and photokeratoconjunctivitis).
However, photosensitive persons and those exposed concomitantly to photoactive chemicals may not be protected
by the recommended standard. If proper procedures are not followed, HCWs performing maintenance on such fixtures
are at risk for exposure to UV radiation. Because UV fixtures used for upper-room air irradiation are present in rooms,
rather than hidden in ducts, safety may be much more difficult to achieve and maintain. Fixtures must be designed and
installed to ensure that UV exposure to persons in the room (including HCWs and inpatients) are below current safe
exposure levels. Recent health hazard evaluations conducted by CDC have noted problems with overexposure of HCWs
to UVGI and with inadequate maintenance, training, labelling, and use of personal protective equipment (

145-147

). 

The current number of persons who are properly trained in UVGI system design and installation is limited. CDC strongly
recommends that a competent UVGI system designer be consulted to address safety considerations before such a system
is procured and installed. Experts who might be consulted include industrial hygienists, engineers, and health
physicists. Principles for the safe installation of UV lamp fixtures have been developed and can be used as guidelines
(

148,149

). 

If UV lamps are being used in a facility, the general TB education of HCWs should include: 
1. The basic principles of UVGI systems (i.e., how they work and what their limitations are). 
2. The potential hazardous effects of UVGI if overexposure occurs. 
3. The potential for photosensitivity associated with certain medical conditions or use of some medications. 
4. The importance of general maintenance procedures for UVGI fixtures. 
Exposure to UV intensities above the REL should be avoided. Lightweight clothing made of tightly woven fabric and
UV-absorbing sunscreens with solar-protection factors (SPFs) "15 may help protect photosensitive persons. HCWs
should be advised that any eye or skin irritation that develops after UV exposure should be examined by occupational
health staff. 


D. Exposure Criteria for UV Radiation 


The NIOSH REL for UV radiation is wavelength dependent because different wavelengths of UV radiation have different
adverse effects on the skin and eyes (

136

). Relative spectral effectiveness (S
) is used to compare various UV sources with a source producing UV radiation at 270 nm, the wavelength of maximum ocular
sensitivity. For example, the S
 at 254 nm is 0.5; therefore, twice as much energy is required at 254 nm to produce an identical biologic effect at 270
nm (

136

). Thus, at 254 nm, the NIOSH REL is 0.006 joules per square centimeter (J/cm2); and at 270 nm, it is 0.003 J/cm2.

<PARENT> FR941028-2-00109 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

For germicidal lamps that emit radiant energy predominantly at a wavelength of 254 nm, proper use of the REL requires
that the measured irradiance level (E) in microwatts per square centimeter ( u W/cm

2

) be multiplied by the relative spectral effectiveness at 254 nm (0.5) to obtain the effective irradiance (E

eff

). The maximum permissible exposure time can then be determined for selected values of E

eff

 (Table S3-3), or it can be calculated (in seconds) by dividing 0.003 J/cm

2

 (the NIOSH REL at 270 nm) by E

eff

 in  u W/cm

2

 (

136,150

). 

To protect HCWs who are exposed to germicidal UV radiation for 8 hours per workday, the measured irradiance (E) should
be >0.2  u W/cm

2

. This is calculated by obtaining E

eff

 (0.1  u W/cm

2

) (Table S3-3) and then dividing this value by S

l

 (0.5).

E. Maintenance and Monitoring 

1. Labelling and Posting 



Warning signs should be posted on UV lamps and wherever high-intensity (i.e., UV exposure greater than the REL) germicidal
UV irradiation is present (e.g., upper-room air space and accesses to ducts [if duct irradiation is used]) to alert
maintenance staff or other HCWs of the hazard. Some examples are shown below: 



CAUTION 

ULTRAVIOLET ENERGY: TURN OFF LAMPS BEFORE ENTERING UPPER ROOM 

CAUTION 

ULTRAVIOLET ENERGY: PROTECT EYES & SKIN 



2. Maintenance 



Because the intensity of UV lamps fluctuates as they age, a schedule for replacing the lamps should be developed. The
schedule can be determined from either a time/use log or a system based on cumulative time. The tube should be checked
periodically for dust build-up, which lessens the output of UVGI. If the tube is dirty, it should be allowed to cool,
then cleaned with a damp cloth. Tubes should be replaced if they stop glowing or if they flicker to an objectionable
extent. Maintenance personnel must turn off all UV tubes before entering the upper part of the room or before accessing
ducts for any purpose. Only a few seconds of direct exposure to the intense UV radiation in the upper-room air space
or in ducts can cause burns. Protective equipment (e.g., gloves and goggles [and/or face shields]) should be worn
if exposure greater than the recommended standard is anticipated. 

Banks of UVGI tubes can be installed in ventilating ducts. Safety devices should be used on access doors to eliminate
hazard to maintenance personnel. For duct irradiation systems, the access door for servicing the lamps should have
an inspection window* through which the lamps are checked periodically for dust build-up and malfunctioning. The
access door should have a warning sign written in languages appropriate for maintenance personnel to alert them to
the health hazard of looking directly at bare tubes. The lock for this door should have an automatic electric switch
or other device that turns off the lamps when the door is opened. 





Two types of fixtures are used in upper-room air irradiation: wall-mounted fixtures that have louvers to block downward
radiation and ceiling-mounted fixtures that have baffles to block radiation below the horizontal plane of the UV
tube. The actual UV tube in either type of fixture must not be visible from any normal position in the room. Light switches
that can be locked should be used, if possible, to prevent injury to personnel who might unintentionally turn the lamps
on during maintenance procedures. 
In most applications, properly shielding the UV lamps to provide protection from most, if not all, of the direct UV
radiation is not difficult. However, radiation reflected from glass, polished metal, and high-gloss ceramic paints
can be harmful to persons in the room, particularly if more than one UV lamp is in use. Surfaces in irradiated rooms that
can reflect UVGI into occupied areas of the room should be covered with non-UV reflecting material. 



3. Monitoring 



A regularly scheduled evaluation of the UV intensity to which HCWs, patients, and others are exposed should be conducted.


UV measurements should be made in various locations within a room using a detector designed to be most sensitive at
254 nm. Equipment used to measure germicidal UV radiation should be maintained and calibrated on a regular schedule.


A new UV installation must be carefully checked for hot spots (i.e., areas of the room where the REL is exceeded) by an
industrial hygienist or other person knowledgeable in making UV measurements. UV radiation levels should not exceed
those in the recommended guidelines.

Supplement 4: Respiratory Protection 



I. Considerations for Selection of Respirators 



Personal respiratory protection should be used by (a) persons entering rooms where patients with known or suspected
infectious TB are being isolated, (b) persons present during cough-inducing or aerosol-generating procedures
performed on such patients, and (c) persons in other settings where administrative and engineering controls are
not likely to protect them from inhaling infectious airborne droplet nuclei. These other settings should be identified
on the basis of the facility's risk assessment. 

Although data regarding the effectiveness of respiratory protection from many hazardous airborne materials have
been collected, the precise level of effectiveness in protecting HCWs from 

M. tuberculosis

 transmission in health-care settings has not been determined. Information concerning the transmission of 

M. tuberculosis

 is incomplete. Neither the smallest infectious dose of 

M. tuberculosis

 nor the highest level of exposure to 

M. tuberculosis

 at which transmission will not occur has been defined conclusively (

59,151,152

). Furthermore, the size distribution of droplet nuclei and the number of particles containing viable 

M. tuberculosis

 that are expelled by infectious TB patients have not been defined adequately, and accurate methods of measuring the
concentration of infectious droplet nuclei in a room have not been developed. 

Nevertheless, in certain settings the administrative and engineering controls may not adequately protect HCWs
from airborne droplet nuclei (e.g., in TB isolation rooms, treatment rooms in which cough-inducing or aerosol-generating
procedures are performed, and ambulances during the transport of infectious TB patients). Respiratory protective
devices used in these settings should have characteristics that are suitable for the organism they are protecting
against and the settings in which they are used. 



A. Performance Criteria for Personal Respirators for Protection Against Transmission of 

M. tuberculosis

 



Respiratory protective devices used in health-care settings for protection against 

M. tuberculosis

 should meet the following standard criteria. These criteria are based on currently available information, including
(a) data on the effectiveness of respiratory protection against noninfectious hazardous materials in workplaces
other than health-care settings and on an interpretation of how these data can be applied to respiratory protection
against 

M. tuberculosis

; (b) data on the efficiency of respirator filters in filtering biological aerosols; (c) data on face-seal leakage;
and (d) data on the characteristics of respirators that were used in conjunction with administrative and engineering
controls in outbreak settings where transmission to HCWs and patients was terminated. 

1. The ability to filter particles 1 um in size in the unloaded state with a filter efficiency of "95% (i.e., filter leakage
of >5%), given flow rates of up to 50 L per minute. 

Available data suggest that infectious droplet nuclei range in size from 1  u m to 5  u m; therefore, respirators
used in health-care settings should be able to efficiently filter the smallest particles in this range. Fifty liters
per minute is a reasonable estimate of the highest airflow rate an HCW is likely to achieve during breathing, even while
performing strenuous work activities. 

2. The ability to be qualitatively or quantitatively fit tested in a reliable way to obtain a face-seal leakage of >10%
(

54,55

). 

3. The ability to fit the different facial sizes and characteristics of HCWs, which can usually be met by making the
respirators available in at least three sizes. 

4. The ability to be checked for facepiece fit, in accordance with OSHA standards and good industrial hygiene practice,
by HCWs each time they put on their respirators (

54,55

). 

In some settings, HCWs may be at risk for two types of exposure: (a) inhalation of 

M. tuberculosis

 and (b) mucous membrane exposure to fluids that may contain bloodborne pathogens. In these settings, protection
against both types of exposure should be used. 

When operative procedures (or other procedures requiring a sterile field) are performed on patients who may have
infectious TB, respiratory protection worn by the HCW should serve two functions: (a) it should protect the surgical
field from the respiratory secretions of the HCW and (b) it should protect the HCW from infectious droplet nuclei that
may be expelled by the patient or generated by the procedure. Respirators with expiration valves and positive-pressure
respirators do not protect the sterile field; therefore, a respirator that does not have a valve and that meets the
criteria in Supplement 4, Section I.A, should be used. 



B. Specific Respirators 



The OSHA respiratory protection standard requires that all respiratory protective devices used in the workplace
be certified by NIOSH.* NIOSH-approved HEPA respirators are the only currently available air-purifying respirators
that meet or exceed the standard performance criteria stated above. However, the NIOSH certification procedures
are currently being revised (

153

). Under the proposed revision, filter materials would be tested at a flow rate of 85 L/min for penetration by particles
with a median aerodynamic diameter of 0.3  u m and, if certified, would be placed in one of the following categories:
type A, which has "99.97% efficiency (similar to current HEPA filter media); type B, "99% efficiency; or type C, "95%
efficiency. According to this proposed scheme, type C filter material would meet or exceed the standard performance
criteria specified in this document.

<TEXT>
 

The facility's risk assessment may identify a limited number of selected settings (e.g., bronchoscopy performed
on patients suspected of having TB or autopsy performed on deceased persons suspected of having had active TB at the
time of death) where the estimated risk for transmission of 

M. tuberculosis

 may be such that a level of respiratory protection exceeding the standard criteria is appropriate. In such circumstances,
a level of respiratory protection exceeding the standard criteria and compatible with patient-care delivery (e.g.,
negative-pressure respirators that are more protective; powered air-purifying particulate respirators [PAPRs];
or positive-pressure airline, half-mask respirators) should be provided by employers to HCWs who are exposed to


M. tuberculosis

. Information on these and other respirators may be found in the 

NIOSH Guide to Industrial Respiratory Protection (55

). 



C. The Effectiveness of Respiratory Protective Devices 



The following information, which is based on experience with respiratory protection in the industrial setting,
summarizes the available data about the effectiveness of respiratory protection against hazardous airborne materials.
Data regarding protection against transmission of 

M. tuberculosis

 are not available. 

The parameters used to determine the effectiveness of a respiratory protective device are face-seal efficacy and
filter efficacy. 



1. Face-Seal Leakage 



Face-seal leakage compromises the ability of particulate respirators to protect HCWs from airborne materials (

154-156

). A proper seal between the respirator's sealing surface and the face of the person wearing the respirator is essential
for effective and reliable performance of any negative-pressure respirator. This seal is less critical, but still
important, for positive-pressure respirators. Face-seal leakage can result from various factors, including incorrect
facepiece size or shape, incorrect or defective facepiece sealing-lip, beard growth, perspiration or facial oils
that can cause facepiece slippage, failure to use all the head straps, incorrect positioning of the facepiece on the
face, incorrect head strap tension or position, improper respirator maintenance, and respirator damage. 

Every time a person wearing a negative-pressure particulate respirator inhales, a negative pressure (relative
to the workplace air) is created inside the facepiece. Because of this negative pressure, air containing contaminants
can take a path of least resistance into the respirator_through leaks at the face-seal interface_thus avoiding the
higher-resistance filter material. Currently available, cup-shaped, disposable particulate respirators have
from 0 to 20% face-seal leakage (

55,154

). This face-seal leakage results from the variability of the human face and from limitations in the respirator's
design, construction, and number of sizes available. The face-seal leakage is probably higher if the respirator
is not fitted properly to the HCW's face, tested for an adequate fit by a qualified person, and then checked for fit by
the HCW every time the respirator is put on. Face-seal leakage may be reduced to less than <10% with improvements
in design, a greater variety in available sizes, and appropriate fit testing and fit checking. 

In comparison with negative-pressure respirators, positive-pressure respirators produce a positive pressure
inside the facepiece under most conditions of use. For example, in a PAPR, a blower forcibly draws ambient air through
HEPA filters, then delivers the filtered air to the facepiece. This air is blown into the facepiece at flow rates that
generally exceed the expected inhalation flow rates. The positive pressure inside the facepiece reduces face-seal
leakage to low levels, particularly during the relatively low inhalation rates expected in health-care settings.
PAPRs with a tight-fitting facepiece have <2% face-seal leakage under routine conditions (

55

). Powered-air respirators with loose-fitting facepieces, hoods, or helmets have <4% face-seal leakage under
routine conditions (

55

). Thus, a PAPR may offer lower levels of face-seal leakage than nonpowered, half-mask respirators. Full facepiece,
nonpowered respirators have the same leakage (i.e., <2%) as PAPRs. 

Another factor contributing to face-seal leakage of cup-shaped, disposable respirators is that some of these respirators
are available in only one size. A single size may produce higher leakage for persons who have smaller or difficult-to-fit
faces (

157

). The facepieces used for some reusable (including HEPA and replaceable filter, negative-pressure) and all positive-pressure
particulate air-purifying respirators are available in as many as three different sizes. 



2. Filter Leakage 



Aerosol leakage through respirator filters depends on at least five independent variables: (a) the filtration characteristics
for each type of filter, (b) the size distribution of the droplets in the aerosol, (c) the linear velocity through the
filtering material, (d) the filter loading (i.e., the amount of contaminant deposited on the filter), and (e) any
electrostatic charges on the filter and on the droplets in the aerosol (

158

). 

When HEPA filters are used in particulate air-purifying respirators, filter efficiency is so high (i.e., effectively
100%) that filter leakage is not a consideration. Therefore, for all HEPA-filter respirators, virtually all inward
leakage of droplet nuclei occurs at the respirator's face seal. 



3. Fit Testing 



Fit testing is part of the respiratory protection program required by OSHA for all respiratory protective devices
used in the workplace. A fit test determines whether a respiratory protective device adequately fits a particular
HCW. The HCW may need to be fit tested with several devices to determine which device offers the best fit. However, fit
tests can detect only the leakage that occurs at the time of the fit testing, and the tests cannot distinguish face-seal
leakage from filter leakage. 

Determination of facepiece fit can involve qualitative or quantitative tests (

55

). A qualitative test relies on the subjective response of the HCW being fit tested. A quantitative test uses detectors
to measure inward leakage. 

Disposable, negative-pressure particulate respirators can be qualitatively fit tested with aerosolized substances
that can be tasted, although the results of this testing are limited because the tests depend on the subjective response
of the HCW being tested. Quantitative fit testing of disposable negative-pressure particulate respirators can
best be performed if the manufacturer provides a test respirator with a probe for this purpose. 

Replaceable filter, negative-pressure particulate respirators and all positive-pressure particulate respirators
can be fit tested reliably, both qualitatively and quantitatively, when fitted with HEPA filters. 



4. Fit Checking 



A fit check is a maneuver that an HCW performs before each use of the respiratory protective device to check the fit.
The fit check can be performed according to the manufacturer's facepiece fitting instructions by using the applicable
negative-pressure or positive-pressure test. 

Some currently available cup-shaped, disposable negative-pressure particulate respirators cannot be fit checked
reliably by persons wearing the devices because occluding the entire surface of the filter is difficult. Strategies
for overcoming these limitations are being developed by respirator manufacturers. 



5. Reuse of Respirators 



Conscientious respirator maintenance should be an integral part of an overall respirator program. This maintenance
applies both to respirators with replaceable filters and respirators that are classified as disposable but that
are reused. Manufacturers' instructions for inspecting, cleaning, and maintaining respirators should be followed
to ensure that the respirator continues to function properly (

55

). 

When respirators are used for protection against noninfectious aerosols (e.g., wood dust), which may be present
in the air in heavy concentrations, the filter material may become occluded with airborne material. This occlusion
may result in an uncomfortable breathing resistance. In health-care settings where respirators are used for protection
against biological aerosols, the concentration of infectious particles in the air is probably low; thus, the filter
material in a respirator is very unlikely to become occluded with airborne material. In addition, there is no evidence
that particles impacting on the filter material in a respirator are re-aerosolized easily. For these reasons, the
filter material used in respirators in the health-care setting should remain functional for weeks to months. Respirators
with replaceable filters are reusable, and a respirator classified as disposable may be reused by the same HCW as long
as it remains functional. 

Before each use, the outside of the filter material should be inspected. If the filter material is physically damaged
or soiled, the filter should be changed (in the case of respirators with replaceable filters) or the respirator discarded
(in the case of disposable respirators). Infection-control personnel should develop standard operating procedures
for storing, reusing, and disposing of respirators that have been designated as disposable and for disposing of replaceable
filter elements.

II. Implementing a Personal Respiratory Protection Program 



If personal respiratory protection is used in a health-care setting, OSHA requires that an effective personal respiratory
protection program be developed, implemented, administered, and periodically reevaluated (

54,55

). 

All HCWs who need to use respirators for protection against infection with 

M. tuberculosis 

should be included in the respiratory protection program. Visitors to TB patients should be given respirators to
wear while in isolation rooms, and they should be given general instructions on how to use their respirators. 

The number of HCWs included in the respiratory protection program in each facility will vary depending on (a) the number
of potentially infectious TB patients, (b) the number of rooms or areas to which patients with suspected or confirmed
infectious TB are admitted, and (c) the number of HCWs needed in these rooms or areas. Where respiratory protection
programs are required, they should include enough HCWs to provide adequate care for a patient with known or suspected
TB should such a patient be admitted to the facility. However, administrative measures should be used to limit the
number of HCWs who need to enter these rooms or areas, thus limiting the number of HCWs who need to be included in the respiratory
protection program.
 
Information regarding the development and management of a respiratory protection program is available in technical
training courses that cover the basics of personal respiratory protection. Such courses are offered by various organizations,
such as NIOSH, OSHA, and the American Industrial Hygiene Association. Similar courses are available from private
contractors and universities. 

To be effective and reliable, respiratory protection programs must contain at least the following elements (

55,154

): 

1. 

Assignment of responsibility. 

Supervisory responsibility for the respiratory protection program should be assigned to designated persons who
have expertise in issues relevant to the program, including infectious diseases and occupational health. 

2. 

Standard operating procedures. 

Written standard operating procedures should contain information concerning all aspects of the respiratory protection
program. 

3. 

Medical screening. 

HCWs should not be assigned a task requiring use of respirators unless they are physically able to perform the task
while wearing the respirator. HCWs should be screened for pertinent medical conditions at the time they are hired,
then rescreened periodically (

55

). The screening could occur as infrequently as every 5 years. The screening process should begin with a general screening
(e.g., a questionnaire) for pertinent medical conditions, and the results of the screening should then be used to
identify HCWs who need further evaluation. Routine physical examination or testing with chest radiographs or spirometry
is not necessary or required. 

Few medical conditions preclude the use of most negative-pressure particulate respirators. HCWs who have mild pulmonary
or cardiac conditions may report discomfort with breathing when wearing negative-pressure particulate respirators,
but these respirators are unlikely to have adverse health effects on the HCWs. Those HCWs who have more severe cardiac
or pulmonary conditions may have more difficulty than HCWs with similar but milder conditions if performing duties
while wearing negative-pressure respirators. Furthermore, these HCWs may be unable to use some PAPRs because of
the added weight of these respirators. 

4. 

Training. 

HCWs who wear respirators and the persons who supervise them should be informed about the necessity for wearing respirators
and the potential risks associated with not doing so. This training should also include at a minimum: 

 The nature, extent, and specific hazards of 

M. tuberculosis

 transmission in their respective health-care facility. 

 A description of specific risks for TB infection among persons exposed to 

M. tuberculosis, 

of any subsequent treatment with INH or other chemoprophylactic agents, and of the possibility of active TB disease.


 A description of engineering controls and work practices and the reasons why they do not eliminate the need
for personal respiratory protection. 

 An explanation for selecting a particular type of respirator, how the respirator is properly maintained and
stored, and the operation, capabilities, and limitations of the respirator provided. 

 Instruction in how the HCW wearing the respirator should inspect, put on, fit check, and correctly wear the
provided respirator (i.e., achieve and maintain proper face-seal fit on the HCW's face). 

 An opportunity to handle the provided respirator and learn how to put it on, wear it properly, and check the important
parts. 

 Instruction in how to recognize an inadequately functioning respirator. 

5. 

Face-seal fit testing and fit checking. 

HCWs should undergo fit testing to identify a respirator that adequately fits each individual HCW. The HCW should
receive fitting instructions that include demonstrations and practice in how the respirator should be worn, how
it should be adjusted, and how to determine if it fits properly. The HCW should be taught to check the facepiece fit before
each use. 

6. 

Respirator inspection, cleaning, maintenance, and storage. 

Conscientious respirator maintenance should be an integral part of an overall respirator program. This maintenance
applies both to respirators with replaceable filters and respirators that are classified as disposable but that
are reused. Manufacturers' instructions for inspecting, cleaning, and maintaining respirators should be followed
to ensure that the respirator continues to function properly (

55

). 

7. 

Periodic evaluation of the personal respiratory protection program. 

The program should be evaluated completely at least once a year, and both the written operating procedures and program
administration should be revised as necessary based on the results of the evaluation. Elements of the program that
should be evaluated include work practices and employee acceptance of respirator use (i.e., subjective comments
made by employees concerning comfort during use and interference with duties).

Supplement 5: Decontamination_Cleaning, Disinfecting, and Sterilizing of Patient-Care Equipment 



Equipment used on patients who have TB is usually not involved in the transmission of 

M. tuberculosis, 

although transmission by contaminated bronchoscopes has been demonstrated (

159,160

). Guidelines for cleaning, disinfecting, and sterilizing equipment have been published (

161,162

). The rationale for cleaning, disinfecting, or sterilizing patient-care equipment can be understood more readily
if medical devices, equipment, and surgical materials are divided into three general categories. These categories_critical,
semicritical, and noncritical items_are defined by the potential risk for infection associated with their use (

163,164

). 



Critical items 

are instruments that are introduced directly into the bloodstream or into other normally sterile areas of the body
(e.g., needles, surgical instruments, cardiac catheters, and implants). These items should be sterile at the time
of use. 



Semicritical items 

are those that may come in contact with mucous membranes but do not ordinarily penetrate body surfaces (e.g., noninvasive
flexible and rigid fiberoptic endoscopes or bronchoscopes, endotracheal tubes, and anesthesia breathing circuits).
Although sterilization is preferred for these instruments, high-level disinfection that destroys vegetative
microorganisms, most fungal spores, tubercle bacilli, and small nonlipid viruses may be used. Meticulous physical
cleaning of such items before sterilization or high-level disinfection is essential. 



Noncritical items 

are those that either do not ordinarily touch the patient or touch only the patient's intact skin (e.g., crutches,
bedboards, blood pressure cuffs, and various other medical accessories). These items are not associated with direct
transmission of 

M. tuberculosis, 

and washing them with detergent is usually sufficient. 

Health-care facility policies should specify whether cleaning, disinfecting, or sterilizing an item is necessary
to decrease the risk for infection. Decisions about decontamination processes should be based on the intended use
of the item, not on the diagnosis of the patient for whom the item was used. Selection of chemical disinfectants depends
on the intended use, the level of disinfection required, and the structure and material of the item to be disinfected.


Although microorganisms are ordinarily found on walls, floors, and other environmental surfaces, these surfaces
are rarely associated with transmission of infections to patients or HCWs. This is particularly true with organisms
such as 

M. tuberculosis, 

which generally require inhalation by the host for infection to occur. Therefore, extraordinary attempts to disinfect
or sterilize environmental surfaces are not indicated. If a detergent germicide is used for routine cleaning, a hospital-grade,
EPA-approved germicide/disinfectant that is not tuberculocidal can be used. The same routine daily cleaning procedures
used in other rooms in the facility should be used to clean TB isolation rooms, and personnel should follow isolation
practices while cleaning these rooms. For final cleaning of the isolation room after a patient has been discharged,
personal protective equipment is not necessary if the room has been ventilated for the appropriate amount of time
(Table S3-1).

Glossary




This glossary contains many of the terms used in the guidelines, as well as others that are encountered frequently
by persons who implement TB infection-control programs. The definitions given are not dictionary definitions but
are those most applicable to usage relating to TB. 

Acid-fast bacilli (AFB): Bacteria that retain certain dyes after being washed in an acid solution. Most acid-fast
organisms are mycobacteria. When AFB are seen on a stained smear of sputum or other clinical specimen, a diagnosis
of TB should be suspected; however, the diagnosis of TB is not confirmed until a culture is grown and identified as 

M. tuberculosis. 

Adherence: Refers to the behavior of patients when they follow all aspects of the treatment regimen as prescribed
by the medical provider, and also refers to the behavior of HCWs and employers when they follow all guidelines pertaining
to infection control. 

Aerosol: The droplet nuclei that are expelled by an infectious person (e.g., by coughing or sneezing); these droplet
nuclei can remain suspended in the air and can transmit M. tuberculosis 

to other persons. 

AIA: The American Institute of Architects, a professional body that develops standards for building ventilation.


Air changes: The ratio of the volume of air flowing through a space in a certain period of time (i.e., the airflow rate)
to the volume of that space (i.e., the room volume); this ratio is usually expressed as the number of air changes per
hour (ACH). 

Air mixing: The degree to which air supplied to a room mixes with the air already in the room, usually expressed as a 

mixing 

factor. This factor varies from 1 (for perfect mixing) to 10 (for poor mixing), and it is used as a multiplier to determine
the actual airflow required (i.e., the recommended ACH multiplied by the mixing factor equals the actual ACH required).

Alveoli: The small air sacs in the lungs that lie at the end of the bronchial tree; the site where carbon dioxide in the
blood is replaced by oxygen from the lungs and where TB infection usually begins. 

Anergy; The inability of a person to react to skin-test antigens (even if the person is infected with the organisms
tested) because of immunosuppression. 

Anteroom: A small room leading from a corridor into an isolation room; this room can act as an airlock, preventing the
escape of contaminants from the isolation room into the corridor. 

Area: A structural unit (e.g., a hospital ward or laboratory) or functional unit (e.g., an internal medicine service)
in which HCWs provide services to and share air with a specific patient population or work with clinical specimens
that may contain viable 

M tuberculosis 

organisms. The risk for exposure to 

M tuberculosis 

in a given area depends on the prevalence of TB in the population served and the characteristics of the environment.


ASHRAE: The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc., a professional body
that develops standards for building ventilation. 

Asymptomatic: Without symptoms, or producing no symptoms. 

Bacillus of Calmette and Gu&eacute;rin (BCG) vaccine: A TB vaccine used in many parts of the world. 

BACTEC

 

: One of the most often used radiometric methods for detecting the early growth of mycobacteria in culture. It provides
rapid growth (in 7-14 days) and rapid drug-susceptibility testing (in 5-6 days). When BACTEC

 

 is used with rapid species identification methods, 

M. tuberculosis 

can be identified within 10-14 days of specimen collection. 

Booster phenomenon: A phenomenon in which some persons (especially older adults) who are skin tested many years after
infection with 

M. tuberculosis 

have a negative reaction to an initial skin test, followed by a positive reaction to a subsequent skin test. The second
(i.e., positive) reaction is caused by a boosted immune response. Two-step testing is used to distinguish new infections
from boosted reactions (see Two-step testing). 

Bronchoscopy: A procedure for examining the respiratory tract that requires inserting an instrument (a bronchoscope)
through the mouth or nose and into the trachea. The procedure can be used to obtain diagnostic specimens. 

Capreomycin: An injectable, second-line anti-TB drug used primarily for the treatment of drug-resistant TB. 

Cavity: A hole in the lung resulting from the destruction of pulmonary tissue by TB or other pulmonary infections or
conditions. TB patients who have cavities in their lungs are referred to as having cavitary disease, and they are often
more infectious than TB patients without cavitary disease. 

Chemotherapy: Treatment of an infection or disease by means of oral or injectable drugs. 

Cluster: Two or more PPD skin-test conversions occurring within a 3-month period among HCWs in a specific area or occupational
group, and epidemiologic evidence suggests occupational (nosocomial) transmission. 

Contact: A person who has shared the same air with a person who has infectious TB for a sufficient amount of time to allow
possible transmission of 

M. tuberculosis. 

Conversion, PPD: See PPD test conversion. 

Culture: The process of growing bacteria in the laboratory so that organisms can be identified. 

Cycloserine: A second-line, oral anti-TB drug used primarily for treating drug-resistant TB.

Directly observed therapy (DOT): An adherence-enhancing strategy in which an HCW or other designated person watches
the patient swallow each does of medication.

DNA probe: A technique that allows rapid and precise identification of mycobacteria (e.g., M. tuberculosis

 and 

M. bovis

) that are grown in culture. The identification can often be completed in 2 hours.

Droplet nuclei: Microscopic particles (i.e., 1-5  u m in diameter) produced when a person coughs, sneezes,
shouts, or sings. The droplets produced by an infectious TB patient can carry tubercle bacilli and can remain suspended
in the air for prolonged periods of time and be carried on normal air currents in the room.

Drug resistance, acquired: A resistance to one or more anti-TB drugs that develops while a patient is receiving therapy
and which usually results from the patient's nonadherence to therapy or the prescription of an inadequate regimen
by a health-care provider.

Drug resistance, primary: A resistance to one or more anti-TB drugs the exists before a patient is treated with the
drug(s). Primary resistance occurs in persons exposed to and infected with a drug-resistant strain of 

M. tuberculosis

.

Drug-susceptibility pattern: The anti-TB drugs to which the tubercle bacilli cultured from a TB patient are susceptible
or resistant based on drug-susceptibility tests.

Drug-susceptibility tests: Laboratory tests that determine whether tubercle bacilli cultured from a patient are
susceptible or resistant to various anti-TB drugs.

Ethambutol: A first-line, oral anti-TB drug sometimes used concomitantly with INH, rifampin, and pyrazinamide.

Ethionamide: A second-line, oral anti-TB drug used primarily for treating drug-resistant TB.

Exposure: The condition of being subjected to something (e.g., infectious agents) that could have a harmful effect.
A person exposed to 

M. tuberculosis

 does not necessarily become infected (see Transmission).

First-line drugs: The most often used anti-TB drugs (i.e., INH, rifampin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, and streptomycin).

Fixed room-air HEPA recirculation systems: Nonmobile devices or systems that remove airborne contaminants by recirculating
air through a HEPA filter. These may be built into the room and permanently ducted or may be mounted to the wall or ceiling
within the room. In either situation, they are fixed in place and are not easily movable.

Fluorochrome stain: A technique for staining a clinical specimen with fluorescent dyes to perform a microscopic
examination (smear) for mycobacteria. This technique is preferable to other staining techniques because the mycobacteria
can be seen easily and the slides can be read quickly.

Fomites: Linens, books, dishes, or other objects used or touched by a patient. These objects are not involved in the
transmission of 

M. tuberculosis

.

Gastric aspirate: A procedure sometimes used to obtain a specimen for culture when a patient cannot cough up adequate
sputum. A tube is inserted through the mouth or nose and into the stomach to recover sputum that was coughed into the
throat and then swallowed. This procedure is particularly useful for diagnosis in children, who are often unable
to cough up sputum.

High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter: A specialized filter that is capable of removing 99.97% of particles
"0.3  u m in diameter and that may assist in controlling the transmission of 

M. tuberculosis.

 Filters may be used in ventilation systems to remove particles from the air or in personal respirators to filter air
before it is inhaled by the person wearing the respirator. The use of HEPA filters in ventilation systems requires
expertise in installation and maintenance.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection: Infection with the virus that causes acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome (AIDS). HIV infection is the most important risk factor for the progression of latent TB infection to active
TB.

Immunosuppressed: A condition in which the immune system is not functioning normally (e.g., severe cellular immunosuppression
resulting from HIV infection or immunosuppressive therapy). Immunosuppressed persons are at greatly increased
risk for developing active TB after they have been infected with 

M. tuberculosis

. No data are available regarding whether these persons are also at increased risk for infection with 

M. tuberculosis

 after they have been exposed to the organism.

Induration: An area of swelling produced by an immune response to an antigen. In tuberculin skin testing or anergy
testing, the diameter of the indurated area is measured 48-72 hours after the injection, and the result is recorded
in millimeters.

Infection: The condition in which organisms capable of causing disease (e.g., 

M. tuberculosis

) enter the body and elicit a response from the host's immune defenses. TB infection may or may not lead to clinical disease.

Infectious: Capable of transmitting infection. When persons who have clinically active pulmonary or laryngeal
TB disease cough or sneeze, they can expel droplets containing 

M. tuberculosis

 into the air. Persons whose sputum smears are positive for AFB are probably infectious.

Injectable: A medication that is usually administered by injection into the muscle (intramuscular [IM]) or the bloodstream
(intravenous [IV]).

Intermittent therapy: Therapy administered either two or three times per week, rather than daily. Intermittent
therapy should be administered only under the direct supervision of an HCW or other designated person (see Directly
observed therapy [DOT]).

Intradermal: Within the layers of the skin.

Isoniazid (INH): A first-line, oral drug used either done as preventive therapy or in combination with several other
drugs to treat TB disease.

Kanamycin: An injectable, second-line anti-TB drug used primarily for treatment of drug-resistant TB.

Latent TB infection: Infection with 

M. tuberculosis,

 usually detected by a positive PPD skin-test result, in a person who has no symptoms of active TB and who is not infectious.

Mantoux test: A method of skin testing that is performed by injecting 0.1 mL of PPD-tuberculin containing 5 tuberculin
units into the dermis (i.e., the second layer of skin) of the forearm with a needle and syringe. This test is the most
reliable and standardized technique for tuberculin testing (see Tuberculin skin test and Purified protein derivative
[PPD]-tuberculin test).

Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB): Active TB caused by 

M. tuberculosis

 organisms that are resistant to more than one anti-TB drug; in practice, often refers to organisms that are resistant
to both INH and rifampin with or without resistance to other drugs (see Drug resistance, acquired and Drug resistance,
primary). 



M. tuberculosis

 complex: A group of closely related mycobacterial species that can cause active TB (e.g., 

M. tuberculosis, M. bovis, 

and 

M. africanum

); most TB in the United States is caused by 

M. tuberculosis.



Negative pressure: The relative air pressure difference between two areas in a healthcare facility. A room that is
at negative pressure has a lower pressure than adjacent areas, which keeps air from flowing out of the room and into
adjacent rooms or areas.

Nosocomial: An occurrence, usually an infection, that is acquired in a hospital or as a result of medical care.

Para-aminosalicylic acid: A second-line, oral anti-TB drug used for treating drug-resistant TB.

Pathogenesis: The pathologic, physiologic, or biochemical process by which a disease develops.

Pathogenicity: The quality of producing or the ability to produce pathologic changes or disease. Some nontuberculous
mycobacteria are pathogenic (e.g., 

Mycobacterium kansasii

), and others are not (.e.g., 

Mycobacterium phlei

).

Portable room-air HEPA recirculation units: Free-standing portable devices that remove airborne contaminants
by recirculating air through a HEPA filter.

Positive PPD reaction: A reaction to the purified protein derivative (PPD)-tuberculin skin test that suggests the
person tested is infected with 

M. tuberculosis

. The person interpreting the skin-test reaction determines whether it is positive on the basis of the size of the induration
and the medical history and risk factors of the person being tested.

Preventive therapy: Treatment of latent TB infection used to prevent the progression of latent infection to clinically
active disease.

Purified protein derivative (PPD)-tuberculin: A purified tuberculin preparation that was developed in the 1930s
and that was derived from old tuberculin. The standard Mantoux test uses 0.1 mL of PPD standardized to 5 tuberculin
units.

Purified protein derivative (PPD)-tuberculin test: A method used to evaluate the likelihood that a person is infected
with 

M. tuberculosis.

 A small dose of tuberculin (PPD) is injected just beneath the surface of the skin, and the area is examined 48-72
hours after the injection. A reaction is measured according to the size of the induration. The classification of a
reaction as positive or negative depends on the patient's medical history and various risk factors (see Mantoux test).

Purified protein derivative (PPD)-tuberculin test conversion: A change in PPD test results from negative to positive.
A conversion within a 2-year period is usually interpreted as new 

M. tuberculosis

 infection, which carries an increased risk for progression to active disease. A booster reaction may be misinterpreted
as a new infection (see Booster phenomenon and Two-step testing).

Pyrazinamide: A first-line, oral anti-TB drug used in treatment regimens.

Radiography: A method of viewing the respiratory system by using radiation to transmit an image of the respiratory
system to film. A chest radiograph is taken to view the respiratory system of a person who is being evaluated for pulmonary
TB. Abnormalities (e.g., lesions or cavities in the lungs and enlarged lymph nodes) may indicate the presence of TB.

Radiometric method: A method for culturing a specimen that allows for rapid detection of bacterial growth by measuring
production of CO

2

 by viable organisms; also a method of rapidly performing susceptibility testing of 

M. tuberculosis.



Recirculation: Ventilation in which all or most of the air that is exhausted from an area is returned to the same area
or other areas of the facility.

Regimen: Any particular TB treatment plan that specifies which drugs are used, in what doses, according to what schedule,
and for how long.

Registry: A record-keeping method for collecting clinical, laboratory, and radiographic data concerning TB patients
so that the data can be organized and made available for epidemiologic study.

Resistance: The ability of some strains of bacteria, including 

M. tuberculosis,

 to grow and multiply in the presence of certain drugs that ordinarily kill them; such strains are referred to as drug-resistant
strains.

Rifampin: A first-line, oral anti-TB drug that, when used concomitantly with INH and pyrazinamide, provides the
basis for short-course therapy.

Room-air HEPA recirculation systems and units: Devices (either fixed or portable) that remove airborne contaminants
by recirculating air through a HEPA filter.

Second-line drugs: Anti-TB drugs used when the first-line drugs cannot be use (e.g., for drug-resistant TB or because
of adverse reactions to the first-line drugs). Examples are cycloserine, ethionamide, and capreomycin.

Single-pass ventilation: Ventilation in which 100% of the air supplied to an area is exhausted to the outside.

Smear (AFB smear): A laboratory technique for visualizing mycobacteria. The specimen is smeared onto a slide and
stained, then examined using a microscope. Smear results should be available within 24 hours. In TB, a large number
of mycobacteria seen on an AFB smear usually indicates infectiousness. However, a positive result is not diagnostic
of TB because organisms other than 

M. tuberculosis

 may be seen on an AFB smear (e.g., nontuberculous mycobacteria).

Source case: A case of TB in an infectious person who has transmitted 

M. tuberculosis

 to another person or persons.

Source control: Controlling a contaminant at the source of its generation, which prevents the spread of the contaminant
to the general work space.

Specimen: Any body fluid, secretion, or tissue sent to a laboratory where smears and cultures for 

M. tuberculosis

 will be performed (e.g., sputum, urine, spinal fluid, and material obtained at biopsy).

Sputum: Phlegm coughed up from deep within the lungs. If a patient has pulmonary disease, an examination of the sputum
by smear and culture can be helpful in evaluating the organism responsible for the infection. Sputum should not be
confused with saliva or nasal secretions.

Sputum induction: A method used to obtain sputum from a patient who is unable to cough up a specimen spontaneously.
The patient inhales a saline mist, which stimulates a cough from deep within the lungs.

Sputum smear, positive: AFB are visible on the sputum smear when viewed under a microscope. Persons with a sputum smear
positive for AFB are considered more infectious than those with smear-negative sputum.

Streptomycin: A first-line, injectable anti-TB drug.

Symptomatic: Having symptoms that may indicate the presence of TB or another disease (see Asymptomatic).

TB case: A particular episode of clinically active TB. This term should be used only to refer to the disease itself,
not the patient with the disease. By law, cases of TB must be reported to the local health department.

TB infection: A condition in which living tubercle bacilli are present in the body but the disease is not clinically
active. Infected persons usually have positive tuberculin reactions, but they have no symptoms related to the infection
and are not infectious. However, infected persons remain at lifelong risk for developing disease unless preventive
therapy is given.

Transmission: The spread of an infectious agent from one person to another. The likelihood of transmission is directly
related to the duration and intensity of exposure to 

M. tuberculosis

 (see Exposure).

Treatment failures: TB disease in patients who do not respond to chemotherapy and in patients whose disease worsens
after having improved initially.

Tubercle bacilli: 

M. tuberculosis

 organisms.

Tuberculin skin test: A method used to evaluate the likelihood that a person is infected with 

M. tuberculosis

. A small dose of PPD-tuberculin is injected just beneath the surface of the skin, and the area is examined 48-72
hours after the injection. A reaction is measured according to the size of the induration. The classification of a
reaction as positive or negative depends on the patient's medical history and various risk factors (see Mantoux test,
PPD test).

Tuberculosis (TB): A clinically active, symptomatic disease caused by an organism in the 

M. tuberculosis

 complex (usually 

M. tuberculosis

 or, rarely, 

M. bovis 

or 

M. africanum

).

Two-step testing: A procedure used for the baseline testing of persons who will periodically receive tuberculin
skin tests (e.g., HCWs) to reduce the likelihood of mistaking a boosted reaction for a new infection. If the initial
tuberculin-test result is classified as negative, a second test is repeated 1-3 weeks later. If the reaction
to the second test is positive, it probably represents a boosted reaction. If the second test result is also negative,
the person is classified as not infected. A positive reaction to a subsequent test would indicate new infection (i.e.,
a skin-test conversion) in such a person.

Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI): The use of ultraviolet radiation to kill or inactivate microorganisms.

Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) lamps: Lamps that kill or inactivate microorganisms by emitting ultraviolet
germicidal radiation, predominantly at a wavelength of 254 nm (intermediate light waves between visible light and
X-rays). UVGI lamps can be used in ceiling or wall fixtures or within air ducts of ventilation systems.

Ventilation, dilution: An engineering control technique to dilute and remove airborne contaminants by the flow
of air into and out of an area. Air that contains droplet nuclei is removed and replaced by contaminant-free air. If
the flow is sufficient, droplet nuclei become dispersed, and their concentration in the air is diminished.

Ventilation, local exhaust: Ventilation used to capture and remove airborne contaminants by enclosing the contaminant
source (i.e., the patient) or by placing an exhaust hood close to the contaminant source.

Virulence: The degree of pathogenicity of a micoorganism as indicated by the severity of the disease produced and
its ability to invade the tissues of a host. 

M. tuberculosis

 is a virulent organism.

ACTION:

 Notice of proposed priorities. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Secretary proposes absolute priorities and a competitive preference priority under the Jacob K. Javits Gifted
and Talented Students Education Program. The Secretary takes this action to focus Federal financial assistance
on specific approaches to identifying and serving gifted and talented students and to developing ways in which the
programs and services developed for gifted and talented students can be used to benefit all children. The priorities
bring special attention to programs and services for students (including economically disadvantaged individuals,
individuals of limited-English proficiency, and individuals with disabilities) who may not be identified and served
through traditional gifted and talented programs. The priorities also encourage programs and projects to develop
and improve the capability of schools in an entire State or region of the Nation through cooperative efforts and participation
of State and local educational agencies, institutions of higher education, and other public and private agencies
and organizations, such as business, industry, and labor, to plan, conduct, and improve programs in schools using,
where appropriate, methods and materials developed in gifted and talented programs to improve the educational opportunities
for all children. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Jacob K. Javits Gifted and Talented Students Education Program is designed to build nationwide capability in
gifted and talented education and encourage rich and challenging curricula for all children. 



The Secretary seeks to improve the education of gifted and talented children, and to use the strategies developed
in gifted and talented education programs to improve the education of all children in a school. The Secretary believes
that this is an integral part of the National Education Goals, which require that every student attain higher standards
of academic excellence. Gifted and talented education programs can contribute to systemic reform by modeling a coordinated
system of high standards, assessments, challenging curricula, and teacher preparation to improve education. In
addition, the Secretary believes that the educational needs of gifted and talented students from populations historically
underserved by gifted and talented education programs must be addressed. 

In order to carry out these improvements, the Secretary proposes a priority that would support the development of
model demonstration programs that focus on economically disadvantaged children, children with limited English
proficiency or children with disabilities. The projects will be required to involve a school or schools that serve
at least 50 percent low-income children and to incorporate professional development of staff and training of parents
into their programs. 

In addition, the Secretary proposes a second priority that encourages cooperative efforts of technical assistance
and information dissemination throughout a State or region that focuses on how programs and methods for teaching
gifted and talented students, where appropriate, could be adapted to improve instruction for all students in schools.


In both proposed priorities, the projects must be based on challenging content and performance standards in one or
more of the core subject areas, and include comprehensive improvement plans for the school or schools involved in
the projects. These priorities focus on projects that incorporate challenging content and performance standards
in the core subjects because the Secretary believes that this is the most promising way to raise students' achievement.

The Secretary estimates that at least 75 percent of available funds will be used to support model projects in schools,
and 25 percent of available funds will support technical assistance and dissemination projects. 
For the first priority involving model programs, the Secretary proposes to direct financial assistance to projects
that primarily benefit urban or rural areas that have been designated as Empowerment Zones or Enterprise Communities
in accordance with Section 1391 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), as amended by Title XIII of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act (OBRA) of 1993. 


Background on Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Community Program 


The Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Community program is a critical element of the Administration's community revitalization
strategy. The program is the first step in rebuilding communities in America's poverty-stricken inner cities and
rural heartlands. It is designed to empower people and communities by inspiring Americans to work together to create
jobs and opportunity. 
Under this program, the Federal government will designate up to nine areas as Empowerment Zones and up to 95 areas as
Enterprise Communities in accordance with Internal Revenue Code section 1311, as amended by Title XIII of the Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103-66). To be eligible for designation, an area must be nominated
by one or more local governments and the State or States in which it is located or by a State-Chartered Economic Development
Corporation. A nominated area must be one of pervasive poverty, unemployment, and general distress, and must have
a poverty rate of not less than the level specified in section 1392 of the Internal Revenue Code. 
In the Empowerment Zone
