Walnuts Grown in California; Expenses and Assessment Rate 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim final rule with request for comments. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This interim final rule authorizes expenditures and establishes an assessment rate under Marketing Order No. 984
for the 1994-95 marketing year. Authorization of this budget enables the Walnut Marketing Board (Board) to
incur expenses that are reasonable and necessary to administer the program. Funds to administer this program are
derived from assessments on handlers. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 984, both as amended (7 CFR part 984), regulating the handling
of walnuts grown in California. The marketing agreement and order are effective under the Agricultural Marketing
Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), hereinafter referred to as the Act. 



The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 

This interim final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the provisions
of the marketing order now in effect, California walnuts are subject to assessments. It is intended that the assessment
rate as issued herein will be applicable to all assessable walnuts handled during the 1994-95 marketing year,
which began August 1, 1994, and ends July 31, 1995. This interim final rule will not preempt any State or local laws,
regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 

The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a
hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district
court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of
business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling not later than 20 days after the date of the entry
of the ruling. 

Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. 

The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and the
rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities
acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 

There are approximately 5,000 producers of California walnuts under this marketing order, and approximately 65
handlers. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601)
as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose
annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. The majority of California walnut producers and handlers may be classified
as small entities. 

The budget of expenses for the 1994-95 marketing year was prepared by the Walnut Marketing Board, the agency
responsible for local administration of the marketing order, and submitted to the Department for approval. The members
of the Board are producers and handlers of California walnuts. They are familiar with the Board's needs and with the
costs of goods and services in their local areas and are thus in a position to formulate an appropriate budget. The budget
was formulated and discussed in a public meeting. Thus, all directly affected persons have had an opportunity to participate
and provide input. 

The assessment rate recommended by the Board was derived by dividing anticipated expenses by expected merchantable
certifications of California walnuts. Because that rate will be applied to the actual quantity of certified merchantable
walnuts, it must be established at a rate that will provide sufficient income to pay the Board's expenses. 

The Board met September 9, 1994, and unanimously recommended a 1994-95 budget of $2,170,772, $229,125 more
than the previous year. Budget items for 1994-95 which have increased compared to those budgeted for 1993-94
(in parentheses) are: Administrative salaries, $101,712 ($101,331), Board expenses, $35,000 ($32,000), office
rent, $26,419 ($25,704), domestic market research and development, $953,000 ($875,000), walnut production research,
$718,302 ($438,488), crop survey, $45,000 ($43,000), and crop estimate, $60,000 ($52,000). Items which have decreased
compared to the amount budgeted for 1993-94 (in parentheses) are: social security and hospital insurance taxes,
$8,129 ($9,700), group life, retirement, and medical, $44,370 ($47,485), office salaries, $40,740 ($40,771),
equipment maintenance and warranties, $10,000 ($12,000), furniture, fixtures, and automobiles, $5,000 ($20,000),
and production research director, $40,000 ($91,068). The Board also eliminated funding for export market research
and development and the reserve for contingencies for which $20,000 and $50,000 were recommended last year, respectively.
All other items are budgeted at last year's amounts.

The Board also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $0.0111 per kernelweight pound, $0.0021 more than the
previous year. This rate, when applied to anticipated shipments of 198,000,000 kernelweight pounds of merchantable
walnuts, will yield $2,197,800 in assessment income, which will be adequate to cover budgeted expenses. Unexpended
funds may be used temporarily during the first five months of the subsequent marketing year, but must be made available
to the handlers from whom collected within that period. 

While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on
handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the benefits
derived by the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this
action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 

After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including the information and recommendations submitted
by the Board and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule, as hereinafter set forth, will tend
to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. 

Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and
contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect and that good cause
exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

 because: (1) The Board needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis;
(2) the marketing year began on August 1, 1994, and the marketing order requires that the rate of assessment for the
marketing year apply to all assessable walnuts handled during the marketing year; (3) handlers are aware of this action
which was unanimously recommended by the Board at a public meeting and similar to other budget actions issued in past
years; and (4) this interim final rule provides a 30-day comment period, and all comments timely received will be considered
prior to finalization of this action.

Spearmint Oil Produced in the Far West; Revision of the Salable Quantities and Allotment Percentages for ``Class
1'' (Scotch) and ``Class 3'' (Native) Spearmint Oil for the 
1994-95 Marketing Year

 Interim final rule with request for comments. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This interim final rule increases the quantities of ``Class 1'' (Scotch) and ``Class 3'' (Native) spearmint oil produced
in the Far West that handlers may purchase from, or handle for, producers during the 1994-95 marketing year.
This rule was recommended by the Spearmint Oil Administrative Committee (Committee), the agency responsible for
local administration of the marketing order for spearmint oil produced in the Far West. The Committee recommended
this rule to avoid extreme fluctuations in supplies and prices and thus help to maintain stability in the Far West spearmint
oil market. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This rule is issued under Marketing Order No. 985 [7 CFR Part 985], regulating the handling of spearmint oil produced
in the Far West (Washington, Idaho, Oregon, and designated parts of California, Nevada, Montana, and Utah). This
marketing order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601-674],
hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.'' 



The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.

This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the provisions of the marketing
order now in effect, salable quantities and allotment percentages may be established for classes of spearmint oil
produced in the Far West. This rule increases the quantities of ``Class 1'' and ``Class 3'' spearmint oil produced
in the Far West that may be purchased from or handled for producers by handlers during the 1994-95 marketing year,
which ends on May 31, 1995. This rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they
present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 

The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. 

Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. 

The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 

There are eight spearmint oil handlers subject to regulation under the marketing order and approximately 260 producers
of spearmint oil in the regulated production area. Of the 260 producers, approximately 160 producers hold ``Class
1'' Scotch spearmint oil allotment base, and approximately 145 producers hold ``Class 3'' (Native) spearmint oil
allotment base. Small agricultural service firms have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR
121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $5,000,000, and small agricultural producers are defined as
those whose annual receipts are less than $500,000. A minority of handlers and producers of Far West spearmint oil
may be classified as small entities. 

The Far West spearmint oil industry is characterized by producers whose farming operations generally involve more
than one commodity and whose income from farming operations are not exclusively dependent on the production of spearmint
oil. The U.S. production of spearmint oil is concentrated in the Far West, primarily Washington, Idaho, and Oregon
(part of the area covered by the marketing order). Spearmint oil is also produced in the Midwest. The production area
covered by the marketing order normally accounts for 75 percent of the annual U.S. production of spearmint oil. 

This rule increases the quantities of the Scotch and Native classes of spearmint oil that handlers may purchase from,
or handle for, producers during the 1994-95 marketing year, which ends on May 31, 1995. This rule increases the
Scotch spearmint oil salable quantity and allotment percentage from 723,326 pounds to 811,516 pounds and 41 percent
to 46 percent, respectively, and the Native spearmint oil salable quantity and allotment percentage from 1,092,577
pounds to 1,287,680 pounds and 56 percent to 66 percent, respectively, for the 1994-95 marketing year. 

The salable quantity is the total quantity of each class of oil that handlers may purchase from, or handle for, producers
during a marketing year. The salable quantity calculated by the Committee is based on the estimated trade demand.
The total salable quantity is divided by the total industry allotment base to determine an allotment percentage.
Each producer is allotted a share of the salable quantity by applying the allotment percentage to the producer's allotment
base for the applicable class of spearmint oil. 

The initial salable quantities and allotment percentages for the Scotch and Native classes of spearmint oil for the
1994-95 marketing year were recommended by the Committee at its October 6, 1993, meeting. The Committee recommended
salable quantities of 723,326 pounds and 897,388 pounds, and allotment percentages of 41 percent and 46 percent,
respectively, for the Scotch and Native classes of spearmint oil. A proposed rule incorporating the Committee's
October 6, 1993, recommendation was published in the December 21, 1993, issue of the 

Federal Register

 [58 FR 67378]. Comments on the proposed rule were solicited from interested persons until January 20, 1994. No comments
were received. Accordingly, based upon analysis of available information, a final rule establishing the Committee's
recommendation as the salable quantities and allotment percentages for the Scotch and Native classes of spearmint
oil for the 1994-95 marketing year was published in the March 16, 1994, issue of the 

Federal Register

 [59 FR 12151].

At its June 14, 1994, teleconference meeting, the Committee unanimously recommended that the salable quantity and
allotment percentage for Native spearmint oil for the 1994-95 marketing year be increased. The Committee recommended
that the Native spearmint oil salable quantity be increased from 897,388 pounds to 1,092,577 pounds, and that the
allotment percentage, based on a revised total allotment base of 1,951,032 pounds, be increased from 46 to 56 percent
resulting in a 195,189 pound increase in the salable quantity. 

An interim final rule incorporating the Committee's June 14, 1994, recommendation was published in the August 26,
1994, 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 44028). Comments on the interim rule were solicited from interested persons until September 26, 1994. No comments
were received. 

Pursuant to authority contained in sections 985.50, 985.51, and 985.52 of the marketing order, at its October 5, 1994,
meeting, the Committee recommended by a unanimous vote to increase the salable quantity and allotment percentage
for Scotch spearmint oil. The committee also recommended by 10 to 1 vote an increase in the salable quantity and allotment
percentage for Native spearmint oil. The person voting in opposition favored a smaller increase in the salable quantity
and allotment percentage for Native spearmint oil. 

Specifically, the committee recommended that the salable quantities and allotment percentages for Scotch and Native
classes of spearmint oil for the 1994-95 marketing year be increased from 723,326 pounds to 811,516 pounds,
and 1,092,577 pounds to 1,287,680 pounds, respectively. Based on a revised total allotment base of 1,763,795 pounds,
the allotment percentage for Scotch spearmint oil is increased from 41 percent to 46 percent, resulting in an 88,190
pound increase in the salable quantity. Further, based on the same revised total allotment base published in the August
26, 1994, 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 44028) the allotment percentage for Native spearmint oil is increased from 56 percent to 66 percent, resulting
in a 195,103 pound increase in the salable quantity. 








 

In making this recommendation the Committee considered all available information on supply and demand. As of October
5, 1994, the Committee reports that of the respective 1994-95 Scotch and Native spearmint oil salable quantities
of 723,326 pounds and 1,092,577 pounds, and approximately 116,000 pounds and 87,000 pounds, respectively, remained
available for handling. Handlers have indicated, however, that demand may approximate 200,000 pounds of Scotch
spearmint oil, and 300,000 pounds of Native spearmint oil for the remainder of this marketing year. This level of demand
was not anticipated by the Committee when it made its initial recommendation for the establishment of the Scotch and
Native spearmint oil salable quantities and allotment percentages for the 1994-95 marketing year, nor was
it foreseen when the Committee made its June 14, 1994, recommendation for an increase in the Native spearmint oil salable
quantity and allotment percentage.

The recommended salable quantity of 811,516 pounds of Scotch spearmint oil (an increase of 88,190 pounds), combined
with the actual June 1, 1994, carry-in of 145,809 pounds, results in a revised 1994-95 available supply of 957,325
pounds. Similarly, the recommended salable quantity of 1,287,680 pounds of Native spearmint oil (an increase of
195,103 pounds), combined with the revised June 1, 1994, carry-in of 19,139 pounds, results in a revised 1994-95
available supply of 1,306,819 pounds. The revised available supplies of the Scotch and Native classes of spearmint
oil, respectively, are approximately 67,000 pounds and 227,000 pounds higher than the respective annual average
of sales for the past five years. The Committee anticipates that foreseeable demand for both classes of oil will be
adequately met with the recommended increase. 

The Department, based on its analysis of available information, has determined that allotment percentages of 46
percent and 66 percent, respectively, should be established for the Scotch and Native classes of spearmint oil for
the 1994-95 marketing year. These percentages will provide an increased salable quantity of 811,516 pounds
of Scotch spearmint oil and an increased salable quantity of 1,287,680 pounds of Native spearmint oil. 

Based on available information, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that the issuance of this interim final
rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 

After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including that contained in the prior proposed, final, and
interim final rules in connection with the establishment of the salable quantities and allotment percentages for
the Scotch and Native classes of spearmint oil for the 1994-95 marketing year, the Committee's recommendation
and other available information, it is found that to revise  985.213 to change the salable quantities and allotment
percentages for the Scotch and Native classes of spearmint oil, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate
the declared policy of the Act. 

Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and
contrary to public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect and that good cause exists
for not postponing the effective date of this rule until 30 days after publication in the Federal Register

 because: (1) This interim final rule increases the quantities of the Scotch and Native classes of spearmint oil that
may be marketed immediately; (2) the committee recommended this rule a public meeting and all interested persons
had an opportuntnity to provide input; and (3) This rule provides a 30-day comment period and any comments received
will be considered prior to finalization of this rule.

Raisins Produced From Grapes Grown in California; Expenses and Assessment Rate 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim final rule with request for comments. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This interim final rule authorizes expenditures and establishes an assessment rate under Marketing Order No. 989
for the 1994-95 crop year. Authorization of this budget enables the Raisin Administrative Committee (Committee)
to incur expenses that are reasonable and necessary to administer the program. Funds to administer this program are
derived from assessments on handlers.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 989 (7 CFR part 989), regulating the handling of raisins
produced from grapes grown in California. The marketing agreement and order are effective under the Agricultural
Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), hereinafter referred to as the Act. 




The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 


This interim final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the provisions
of the marketing order now in effect, California raisins are subject to assessments. It is intended that the assessment
rate as issued herein will be applicable to all assessable raisins handled during the 1994-95 crop year, which
began August 1, 1994, and ends July 31, 1995. This interim final rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations,
or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 


The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a
hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district
court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of
business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is
filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 

Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. 


The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and the
rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities
acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 


There are approximately 5,000 producers of California raisins under this marketing order, and approximately 20
handlers. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601)
as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose
annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. A majority of California raisin producers and a minority of handlers may
be classified as small entities. 


The budget of expenses for the 1994-95 crop year was prepared by the Committee, the agency responsible for local
administration of the marketing order, and submitted to the Department for approval. The members of the Committee
are producers and handlers of California raisins. They are familiar with the Committee's needs and with the costs
of goods and services in their local area and are thus in a position to formulate an appropriate budget. The budget was
formulated and discussed in a public meeting. Thus, all directly affected persons have had an opportunity to participate
and provide input. 


The assessment rate recommended by the Committee was derived by dividing anticipated expenses by expected acquisitions
of California raisins. Because that rate will be applied to actual acquisitions, it must be established at a rate that
will provide sufficient income to pay the Committee's expenses. 


The Committee, with headquarters in Fresno, California, met August 15, 1994, and unanimously recommended a 1994-95
budget of $1,324,000, which is $744,940 more than the previous year. Budget items for 1994-95 which have increased
compared to those budgeted for 1993-94 (in parentheses) are: Office salaries, $123,000 ($90,000), fieldman
salaries, $44,000 ($42,600), Payroll taxes, $30,000 ($27,500), employer retirement contribution, $20,000 ($18,200),
general insurance, $8,000 ($6,000), group medical insurance, $40,000 ($37,000), rent, $43,000 ($17,900), telephone,

for contingencies, $142,400 ($55,810). The Committee also recommended employee benefit expenses of $2,500 and
export program funding of $50,000 for travel and $350,000 for foreign program administration, for which no funding
was recommended last year.

The Committee also provided for $1,652,750 for certain expenses likely to be incurred in connection with the 1994-95
raisin reserve pools for Natural (sun-dried) Seedless and Zante Currant raisins. Pool expenses are deducted from
proceeds obtained from the sale of reserve raisins. These proposed expenses are $766,150 more than the $886,600 for
1993-94 reserve pool expenses. 
The larger administrative and reserve pool expenses result from the Committee's takeover of certain industry export
marketing activities and the fact that the Natural (sun-dried) Seedless raisin crop is expected to be significantly
larger than last year. This large crop, and the pooling of Zante Currant raisins for the first time in many years, will
result in a larger quantity to be pooled and increased costs. Reserve pool expenditures are reviewed annually by the
Department. 
A California State raisin marketing order was terminated earlier this year. Its administrative agency, the California
Raisin Advisory Board (CALRAB), formerly conducted marketing promotion and paid advertising activities here and
abroad for the California raisin industry. 
The Committee is taking over the funding and administration of the Market Promotion Program (MPP). The MPP, administered
by the Department's Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS), encourages the development, maintenance, and expansion
of export markets for agricultural commodities like raisins. 
Recently, the FAS redirected MPP funds allocated to CALRAB for foreign promotion and advertising to the Committee
which desires to use the funds to continue the industry's strong overseas promotion and advertising activities.
To receive the full allocation ($4,479,549), the Committee must be able to show that it plans to spend, from industry
sources, an amount equal to 50 percent of that allotment ($2,239,975). This spending can be for administration or
promotion. The Committee recommended that the increased spending necessary to meet the required MPP matching figure
be funded through increased handler assessments, reserve pool funds, and merchandising incentive program funds.

Under the marketing order's volume regulation provisions, marketing percentages (free and reserve) for a varietal
type can be implemented to stabilize supplies. The free percentage prescribes the portion of the crop that can be shipped
immediately to any market. The reserve percentage prescribes the portion of the crop to be held for later shipment.
Reserve raisins are held in a reserve pool by handlers for the account of the Committee. Funds generated from the sales
of reserve raisins, after deduction of reserve pool expenses, are distributed equally to equity holders in the pool
(producers).

A Committee implemented merchandising incentive program promotes the consumption of California raisins in foreign
markets. For various countries, cash rebates and advertising/promotion incentives are offered to qualifying importers.
Funds used to pay the incentives are derived from reserve pool sales. 
The Committee's MPP match of $2,239,775 will be made up of $1,249,775 in Committee domestic and overseas administration
costs and $990,000 in industry market promotion funds. Domestic administration costs include $283,560 in employee
salaries and benefits and $252,215 for MPP overhead costs. The overhead costs include expenditures for Committee
staff to travel overseas ($100,000), Committee delegation trips ($50,000), rent ($28,500), insurance ($1,600),
telephone ($7,500), postage ($6,000), office supplies, ($2,500), repairs and maintenance ($2,000), audit fees
($15,000), local travel ($3,000), equipment ($5,000), and miscellaneous expenses ($31,715). 
The overseas costs of $714,000 include funding for the Committee's overseas marketing representatives and their
staffs for nine countries (United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, Singapore, Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, China,
and Hong Kong). The costs include salaries and benefits, travel, office rent, office supplies, utilities, and postage.
The representatives will handle the administration and day-to-day details of the marketing activities conducted
in these countries. 
The domestic and overseas administrative and overhead costs for the MPP will be paid with handler administrative
assessments and reserve pool proceeds. Most of the major expense items for the MPP (employees salaries and benefits,
domestic and overseas travel, and office rent) will be shared equally between administrative and reserve pool funds.

A total of $1,442,325 is presently available for the Committee's merchandising incentive program. Of that amount,
a total of $990,000 will qualify for the MPP match. The Committee plans to use these funds for authorized promotion
activities in Japan. 
The Committee unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $4.00 per ton, which is $2.20 more than last year. This
rate, when applied to anticipated acquisitions of 331,000 tons, will yield $1,324,000 in assessment income, which
will be adequate to cover anticipated administrative expenses. Any unexpended assessment funds from the crop year
are required to be credited or refunded to the handlers from whom collected. 
While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers and producers, the costs on handlers are in the form
of uniform assessments, and those on producers will be shared equally by all equity holders in the 1994-95 reserve
pool for Natural (sun-dried) Seedless raisins. However, these costs will be offset by the benefits derived by the
operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including the information and recommendations submitted
by the Committee and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule, as hereinafter set forth, will
tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. 
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and
contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect and that good cause
exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

 because: 
(1) The Committee needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis; 
(2) the crop year began on August 1, 1994, and the marketing order requires that the rate of assessment for the crop year
apply to all assessable raisins handled during the crop year; 
(3) handlers are aware of this action which was unanimously recommended by the Committee at a public meeting and it
is similar to other budget actions issued in past years; and 
(4) this interim final rule provides a 60-day comment period, and all comments timely received will be considered
prior to finalization of this action.

ACTION:

 Final rule; correcting amendment.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Rural Electrification Administration (REA) published a final rule correction in the

common to guaranteed and insured telephone loans which was published in the 

Federal Register

 on June 10, 1991 (56 FR 26590). Due to an erroneous regulation cite within the August 28, 1991 correction, REA is publishing
a correcting amendment. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 REA published a final rule which was published in the 

Federal Register

 on Monday, June 10, 
1991 (56 FR 26590) to revise Agency pre-loan procedures for guaranteed and insured telephone loans. Due to a typographical
error in the final rule, REA published a correction on Wednesday, August 28, 1991 (56 FR 42524). The amendatory instruction
in the August 28, 1991 correction incorrectly 
identified the amended section as `` 1741.41'' instead of `` 1737.41''. This section will be correctly
designated as  1737.41 by this correcting amendment.

Securities Credit Transactions; List of Marginable OTC Stocks; List of Foreign Margin Stocks 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; determination of applicability of regulations. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The List of Marginable OTC Stocks (OTC List) is composed of stocks traded over-the-counter (OTC) in the United States
that have been determined by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to be subject to the margin requirements
under certain Federal Reserve regulations. The List of Foreign Margin Stocks (Foreign List) is composed of foreign
equity securities that have met the Board's eligibility criteria under Regulation T. The OTC List and the Foreign
List are published four times a year by the Board. This document sets forth additions to and deletions from the previous
OTC List and Foreign List. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Listed below are additions to and deletions from the OTC List, which was last published on July 25, 1994 (59 FR 37651),
and became effective August 8, 1994. A copy of the complete OTC List is available from the Federal Reserve Banks. 


The OTC List includes those stocks that meet the criteria in Regulations G, T and U (12 CFR parts 207, 220 and 221, respectively).
This determination also affects the applicability of Regulation X (12 CFR part 224). These stocks have the degree
of national investor interest, the depth and breadth of market, and the availability of information respecting the
stock and its issuer to warrant regulation in the same fashion as exchange-traded securities. The OTC List also includes
any OTC stock designated for trading in the national market system (NMS security) under a rule approved by the Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC). Additional OTC stocks may be designated as NMS securities in the interim between the
Board's quarterly publications. They will become automatically marginable upon the effective date of their NMS
designation. The names of these stocks are available at the SEC and at the National Association of Securities Dealers,
Inc. and will be incorporated into the Board's next quarterly publication of the OTC List. 
Also listed below are additions to and deletions from the Board's Foreign List, which was last published on July 25,
1994 (59 FR 37651), and became effective August 8, 1994. The Foreign List includes those foreign securities that meet
the criteria in section 220.17 of Regulation T and are eligible for margin treatment at broker-dealers on the same
basis as domestic margin securities. A copy of the complete Foreign List is available from the Federal Reserve Banks.



Public Comment and Deferred Effective Date 


The requirements of 5 U.S.C. 553 with respect to notice and public participation were not followed in connection with
the issuance of this amendment due to the objective character of the criteria for inclusion and continued inclusion
on the Lists specified in 12 CFR 207.6(a) and (b), 220.17(a), (b), (c) and (d), and 221.7(a) and (b). No additional useful
information would be gained by public participation. The full requirements of 5 U.S.C. 553 with respect to deferred
effective date have not been followed in connection with the issuance of this amendment because the Board finds that
it is in the public interest to facilitate investment and credit decisions based in whole or in part upon the composition
of these Lists as soon as possible. The Board has responded to a request by the public and allowed approximately a two-week
delay before the Lists are effective.

Removal of the Prohibition Against Certain Flights Within the Territory and Airspace of Yemen



<AGENCY>
agency: 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
action: 

Final rule; removal.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

This action removes Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) No. 68, which prohibits flight operations within
the territory and airspace of Yemen by any United States air carrier and commercial operator, by any person exercising
the privileges of an airman certificate issued by the FAA, or by an operator using an aircraft registered in the United
States unless the operator of such aircraft is a foreign air carrier. This action is taken in response to the end of the
civil war in Yemen, which has reduced the threat of hostile actions against persons and aircraft engaged in flight
operations in Yemen.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information: 

On May 18, 1994, the FAA published a final rule (59 FR 25284) prohibiting certain aircraft operations within the territory
and airspace of Yemen. In the exercise of its statutory responsibility for the safety of U.S.-registered aircraft
and U.S. operators, the FAA determined that the civil war in Yemen justified the imposition of certain measures to
ensure the safety of U.S.-registered aircraft and operators conducting flight operations in the vicinity of Yemen's
territory and airspace. SFAR 68 prohibits flight operations within the territory and airspace of Yemen by any United
States air carrier and commercial operator, by any person exercising the privileges of an airman certificate issued
by the FAA, or by an operator using an aircraft registered in the United States unless the operator of such aircraft
is a foreign air carrier.



The civil war in Yemen ended on July 7, 1994. With the end of the war has come a corresponding reduction in the threat to
civil aircraft operating in the territory and airspace of Yemen. There now appears to be no continuing specific threat
to civil aviation arising out of, or related to, the civil war and its end.

The FAA has been advised by Yemen's civil aviation authorities that its international airports are open and operating
normally. The FAA, however, has no specific information on the facilities or level of services available at individual
airports in Yemen. Yemen reports that it expects to issue a new Aeronautical Information Publication by the end of
1994. Information concerning the civil aviation system in Yemen is available from the Director of the Aeronautical
Information Service, Sana'a International Airport, Post Office Box 1438, Sana'a Republic of Yemen. Telephone:
011-967-1-250820. Telex: 2434. Commercial Telegraph: CIVILAIR SANA'A.

On the basis of the foregoing information, I have determined that the immediate removal of SFAR 68 from 14 CFR part 91
is appropriate. The Department of State has been advised of, and has no objection to, the action taken herein.



List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 91



Air traffic control, Aircraft, Airmen, Airports, Aviation safety, Freight, Yemen.



The Amendment



For the reasons set forth above, the Federal Aviation Administration amends 14 CFR part 91 by removing SFAR 68 as follows:

Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS)



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Aeronautics and Space Administration.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

NASA is amending 14 CFR Part 1215, ``Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS),'' by revising Appendix A to
reflect the estimated service rates in 1995 dollars for TDRSS standard services, based on NASA escalation estimates.
14 CFR Part 1215 sets forth the policy governing the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) services provided
to non-U.S. Government users and the reimbursement for rendering such services. The TDRSS represents a major investment
by the U.S. Government with the primary goal of providing improved communications and tracking services to spacecraft
in low earth orbit or to mobile terrestrial users such as aircraft or balloons.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This regulation was first published in the 

Federal Register 

on March 9, 1983 (48 FR 9845). Each year since that time, 14 CFR Part 1215 has been amended by revising Appendix A to reflect
the rate changes for the appropriate calendar years (CY). Since this revision of Appendix A to 14 CFR Part 1215 reflects
the rate changes for CY 1995 and involves NASA management procedures and decisions, no public comment is required.



The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has determined that this rule is not subject to the requirements
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601-612, since it will not exert a significant economic impact on
a substantial number of small entities, and it is not a major rule as defined in Executive Order 12291.



List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 1215



Satellites, Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System, Communications equipment, Government contract.



PART 1215_TRACKING AND DATA RELAY SATELLITE SYSTEM (TDRSS) 



For reasons set out in the Preamble, 14 CFR Part 1215 is amended as follows:

1. The authority citation for 14 CFR Part 1215 continues to read as follows:






Authority:

 Sec. 203, Pub. L. 85-568, 72 Stat., 429, as amended; 42 U.S.C. 2473.




2. Appendix A is revised to read as follows:



Appendix A to Part 1215_Estimated Service Rates in 1995 Dollars for TDRSS Standard Services (Based on NASA Escalation
Estimate)



TDRSS user service rates for services rendered in CY-95 based on current projections in 1995 dollars are as follows:



Single Access Service

_Forward command, return telemetry, or tracking, or any combination of these, the base rate is $194.00 per minute
for non-U.S. Government users.



Multiple Access Forward Service

_Base rate is $42.00 per minute for non-U.S. Government users.



Multiple Access Return Service

_Base rate is $13.00 per minute for non-U.S. Government users.

Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans Alabama: Title V, Section 507, Small Business Stationary Source
Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Direct final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is approving revisions to the State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted by the State of Alabama through the Alabama
Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) for the purpose of establishing a Small Business Stationary Source
Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program (PROGRAM), which will be fully implemented by November
15, 1994. This implementation plan was submitted by the State on November 13, 1992, to satisfy the federal mandate
to ensure that small businesses have access to the technical assistance and regulatory information necessary to
comply with the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990 (CAA).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Implementation of the CAA will require small businesses to comply with specific regulations in order for areas to
attain and maintain the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) and reduce the emission of air toxics. In anticipation
of the impact of these requirements on small businesses, the CAA requires that states adopt a PROGRAM, and submit this
PROGRAM as a revision to the federally approved SIP. In addition, the CAA directs the EPA to oversee the small business
assistance program and report to Congress on their implementation. The requirements for establishing a PROGRAM
are set out in section 507 of title V of the CAA and the EPA guidance document Guidelines for the Implementation of section
507 of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. In order to gain full approval, the state submittal must provide for each of
the following PROGRAM elements: (1) The establishment of a Small Business Assistance Program to provide technical
and compliance assistance to small businesses; (2) the establishment of a state Small Business Ombudsman to represent
the interests of small businesses in the regulatory process; and (3) the creation of a Compliance Advisory Panel (CAP)
to determine and report on the overall effectiveness of the SBAP. The plan must also determine the eligibility of small
business stationary sources for assistance in the PROGRAM. The plan includes the duties, funding and schedule of
implementation for the three PROGRAM components. 



Section 507(a) and (e) of the CAA set forth requirements the State must meet to have an approvable PROGRAM. The State
of Alabama has addressed these requirements and established a PROGRAM as described below. 



1. Small Business Assistance Program (SBAP) 



Alabama has established a mechanism to implement the following six requirements set forth in section 507 of title
V of the CAA:




A. The establishment of adequate mechanisms for developing, collecting and coordinating information concerning
compliance methods and technologies for small business stationary sources, and programs to encourage lawful cooperation
among such sources and other persons to further comply with the CAA; 

B. The establishment of adequate mechanisms for assisting small business stationary sources with pollution prevention
and accidental release detection and prevention, including providing information concerning 
alternative technologies, process changes, products and methods of operation that help reduce air pollution; 

C. The development of a compliance and technical assistance program for small business stationary sources which
assist small businesses in determining applicable permit requirements under the CAA in a timely and efficient manner;

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941031-0-00020 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941031-0-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

D. The development of adequate mechanisms to assure that small business stationary sources receive notice of their
rights under the CAA in such manner and form as to assure reasonably adequate time for such sources to evaluate compliance
methods and any relevant or applicable proposed or final regulation or standards issued under the CAA; 

E. The development of adequate mechanisms for informing small business stationary sources of their obligations
under the CAA, including mechanisms for referring such sources to qualified auditors, or at the option of the State,
for providing audits of the operations of such sources to determine compliance with the CAA; and 

F. The development of procedures for consideration of requests from a small business stationary source for modification
of: (A) Any work practice or technological method of compliance; or (B) the schedule of milestones for implementing
such work practice or method of compliance preceding any applicable compliance date, based on the technological
and financial capability of any such small business stationary source. 




The State of Alabama Department of Environmental Management has indicated the Chief of the Non-Industrial Section
in the Engineering Branch of the Air Division will be designated the coordinator of the Technical and Environmental
Assistance Group (TEAG). The coordinator will direct and coordinate the activities of a group of at least six individuals
with experience in permitting, source sampling, dispersion modeling, and public information. ADEM will support
the TEAG with additional personnel as warranted. The TEAG will establish a clearinghouse of relevant technical and
regulatory literature to disseminate to the small business community. It will provide information concerning compliance
methods and technologies for small business stationary sources to operators and owners through interaction and
cooperation with the Alabama Development Office (ADO), the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs
(ADECA), Alabama Small Business Development Consortium, Safe-State, the Waste Reduction and Technology Transfer
(WRATT) program, trade associations, and other appropriate groups. 

The TEAG will provide information concerning pollution prevention and accidental release detection and prevention
programs. This shall include providing information about alternative technologies, process changes, products,
and methods of operation that reduce air pollution. The TEAG will support the activities of the Ombudsman and answer
questions from that office, other state and local agencies, trade associations, and other appropriate groups concerning
air permit requirements and applicability in a timely and efficient manner. Public notices will be posted in the State's
four largest newspapers of proposed and/or final rules, regulations or standards issued under the CAA. Personnel
from the TEAG will speak at forums and/or meetings concerning applicable proposed or final rules, regulations or
standards issued under the CAA. The TEAG will serve as the secretariat to the Ombudsman and the Compliance Advisory
Panel in the development and dissemination of reports, advisory opinions and other information. 

The TEAG will inform small businesses of the procedures for the Department to consider requests for a variance from
a rule, work practice, standard or compliance date. The WRATT will be included in the Assistance Group where multi-media
pollution prevention opportunity information is requested. Public service announcements, seminars and workshops
will be developed and utilized. The TEAG will use EPA services such as the Control Technology Center (CTC) and the Emission
Measurement Technical Information Center (EMTIC). Compliance Assistance to small businesses will be provided
to aid them to identify applicable requirements and procedures to obtain permits in a timely fashion. The TEAG has
developed and continues to work on responsive techniques, outreach techniques and information packets. This will
cover topics such as pollution prevention, accidental release prevention and detection, source rights and obligations,
and how to obtain approval for modification of work practices, compliance methods or schedules of compliance. 

The Department will perform on-site audits at the request of small businesses to evaluate work practices, compliance
monitoring procedures and recordkeeping procedures. Such audits may be performed by Department personnel or by
the WRATT program at no cost to the small businesses. 



2. Ombudsman 



Section 507(a)(3) of the CAA requires the designation of a state office to serve as the Ombudsman for small business
stationary sources. Alabama has appointed a Small Business Ombudsman and established the office of Alabama Small
Business Ombudsman to represent the interests of small businesses as they come under the regulation of the CAA and
the oversight of the Small Business Technical and Environmental Assistance Group. The Ombudsman reports directly
to the Director of the Department of Environmental Management. The Alabama Ombusman operates a toll-free hotline
to provide free confidential help to small businesses on specific source problems and grievances. The Ombudsman
is authorized to communicate directly with the Governor's Office, the Director of ADEM, the Chief of the Air Division,
other state agencies and other government officials. The Ombudsman may propose legislation or administrative action
through ADEM or the Compliance Advisory Panel. 

 


3. Compliance Advisory Panel 



Section 507(e) of the CAA requires the state to establish a Compliance Advisory Panel (CAP) that must include two members
selected by the Governor who are not owners or representatives of owners of small businesses; four members selected
by the state legislature who are owners, or represent owners, of small businesses; and one member selected by the head
of the agency in charge of the Air Pollution Permit Program. Alabama established a seven member CAP with a membership
consistent with the aforementioned CAA requirements. The makeup of the CAP is prescribed as required by the CAA and
administrative support will be provided by the Department to fulfill all the responsibilities under the CAA. 

The duties of the CAP include: rendering advisory opinions regarding the effectiveness of the Small Business Technical
and Environmental Assistance Group; reviewing information for small business stationary air pollution sources
to assure such information is understandable by the layperson; and to make periodic reports to the Administrator
of the Environmental Protection Agency in accordance with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act, the Regulatory
Flexibility Act, and the Equal Access to Justice Act.

4. Source Eligibility 



Alabama has incorporated section 507(c)(1) and defined a Small Business Stationary Source as a source that: 




(1) Operates in Alabama; 

(2) Is owned or operated by a person who employs 100 or fewer individuals; 

(3) Is a small business concern as defined in the Small Business Act; 

(4) Is not a major stationary source as defined in Titles I and III of the CAA which means the potential to emit for the
source is less than: 

a. 100 tons per year (tpy) of any criteria air pollutant; 

b. 10 tpy of any toxic pollutant; or 

c. 25 tpy of all toxic pollutants; 

(5) Does not emit 50 tpy or more of any regulated pollutant; and 

(6) Emits less than 75 tpy of all regulated pollutants. 




Alabama has established the following mechanisms as required by section 507: (1) A process for ascertaining the eligibility
of a source to receive assistance under the PROGRAM, including an evaluation of a source's eligibility using the criteria
in section 507(c)(1) of the CAA; (2) A process for public notice and comment on grants of eligibility to sources that
do not meet the provisions of sections 507(c)(1)(C), (D), and (E) of the CAA, but do not emit more than 100 tpy of all regulated
pollutants; and (3) A process for exclusion from the small business stationary source definition, after consultation
with the EPA and the Small Business Administration Administrator and after providing notice and opportunity for
public comment, of any category or subcategory of sources that the Department determines to have sufficient technical
and financial capabilities to meet the requirements of the CAA. 



Final Action



In this action, EPA is approving the PROGRAM SIP revision submitted by the State of Alabama through the Alabama Department
of Environmental Management. This action is being taken without prior proposal because the changes are noncontroversial
and EPA anticipates no significant comments on them. The public should be advised that this action will be effective
on December 30, 1994. However, if notice is received by November 30, 1994 that someone wishes to submit adverse or critical
comments, this action will be withdrawn and two subsequent notices will be published before the effective date. One
notice will withdraw the final action and another will begin a new rulemaking by announcing a proposal of the action
and establishing a comment period. 

Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7607 (b)(1), petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed
in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by December 30, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration
by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for purposes of judicial review nor
does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section
307(b)(2) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7607 (b)(2)). 

This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables.
On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions from the requirements
of Section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for 2 years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and
Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's request. This
request 
continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.

Nothing in this action shall be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for a revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et. seq.

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, 
and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the federal SIP-approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its
actions concerning SIPs on such 
grounds.

.0531, submitted May 15, 1991, is being approved in this notice. The remaining revisions submitted May 15, 1991, will
be addressed in a separate notice. A brief description of each revision being addressed in this notice follows. 





15A NCAC 2D .0531 Sources in Nonattainment Areas

 



North Carolina amended this rule to extend the NSR requirements to new nonattainment areas for O

3

 and CO. The amendments require offsets to be obtained for both VOCs and nitrogen oxides (NO

X

) in ozone nonattainment areas. The amendments also require that major new sources of the nonattainment pollutant
locating in a nonattainment area to obtain offsets for the major new source and associated minor sources using a ratio
of at least 1.15 to 1.00 for VOC and NO

X

 sources on ozone nonattainment areas and greater than one to one for CO nonattainment areas. This rule is also amended
to add new compounds to the list of compounds whose emissions are exempt under this rule. This rule meets the requirement
of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990 for new sources locating in nonattainment areas.

Final Action 



EPA is approving the above referenced revisions to the North Carolina SIP. This action is being taken without prior
proposal because the EPA views this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. However,
in a separate document in this 

Federal Register

 publication, the EPA is proposing to approve the SIP revision should adverse or critical comments be filed. This action
will be effective on December 30, 1994 unless, by November 30, 1994, adverse or critical comments are received. 

If the EPA receives such comments, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing a subsequent
document that will withdraw the final action. All public comments received will then be addressed in a subsequent
final rule based on this action serving as a proposed rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this
action. Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. If no such 
comments are received, the public is advised that this action will be effective on December 30, 1994.

Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, 42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1), petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed
in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by December 30, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration
by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for purposes of judicial review nor
does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section
307(b)(2) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(2).) 

The OMB has exempted these actions from review under Executive Order 12866. 

Nothing in this action shall be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for a revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall
be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to
relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 

SIP approvals under 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements
that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements,
I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the
federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute federal
inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs
on such grounds.

 Direct final rule. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is approving the State of Washington's contingency measure plan as a revision to Washington's State Implementation
Plan (SIP) for carbon monoxide (CO). EPA's action is based upon a revision request which was submitted by the state
to satisfy the requirement of the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) for Vancouver, Washington.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Background 



States containing CO nonattainment areas with design values of 12.7 ppm or less were required to submit, among other
things, contingency measures to satisfy the provisions under section 172(c)(9). These provisions require contingency
measures to be implemented in the event that an area fails to reach attainment by the applicable attainment date, December
31, 1995. Contingency measures were due by November 15, 1993, as set by EPA under section 172(b) of the Act. 

Contingency measures must be implemented within 12 months after the finding of failure to attain the CO National Ambient
Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Once triggered they must take effect without further action by the state or EPA, therefore,
all contingency measures must be adopted and enforceable prior to submittal to EPA. 

The CAAA do not specify how many contingency measures are needed or the magnitude of emission reductions they must
provide if an area fails to attain the CO NAAQS. The EPA believes that one appropriate choice of contingency measures
would be to provide for the implementation of sufficient vehicle miles traveled (VMT) reductions or emissions reductions
to counteract the effect of one year's growth in VMT while the state revises its SIP to incorporate all of the new requirements
of a serious CO area. 



II. This Action 



In this action, EPA is approving Washington's SIP revision submitted to EPA on November 15, 1993 for Vancouver, Washington
because it meets the applicable requirements of the Act. 

The state of Washington held public hearings in Vancouver, Washington on November 9, 1993 to entertain public comment
on the CO contingency measure SIP revision. Following the public hearing the plan was adopted by the Department of
Ecology on November 15, 1993 and signed by the Governor's designee on November 15, 1993, becoming effective on December
15, 1993. Ecology submitted the plan to EPA on November 15, 1993 as a proposed revision to the SIP. 

The SIP revision was reviewed by EPA to determine completeness shortly after its submittal, in accordance with the
completeness criteria delineated at 40 CFR part 51, appendix V (1991), as amended by 57 FR 42216 (August 26, 1991).
The submittal was found to be complete on April 13, 1994 and a letter dated May 6, 1994 was forwarded to the Director indicating
the completeness of the submittal. 



A. Analysis of State Submission 



Washington's CO contingency plan for Vancouver calls for the early implementation of improvements to Washington
State's basic inspection and maintenance (I/M) program. These improvements are part of Vancouver's inspection
and maintenance program that began on June 1, 1993. While these technical enhancements are already being implemented,
their use as a contingency measure is consistent with EPA guidance. The early implementation of the ``improved''
vehicle inspection and maintenance program helps to ensure that the area will attain the NAAQS. Ecology anticipates
that improvements to the basic I/M program in Vancouver will reduce 1996 motor vehicle carbon monoxide emissions
by an additional four percent when compared to the EPA program. 

Washington's improved I/M program consists of the following elements: a loaded steady state test for light duty gasoline
vehicles, two-speed test for heavy duty gas vehicles, and opacity check for diesels; biennial testing of all gasoline
vehicles; tampering checks for 1981 and newer vehicles; a stringency rate of 28% for pre-1981 vehicles, a waiver rate
of 15% of failed vehicles, a compliance rate of 90%. EPA's basic I/M program consists of the following elements: idle
testing of 1968 and newer vehicles; annual testing of light duty gasoline vehicles; no tampering checks; a stringency
rate of 20% for pre-1981 vehicles; no waiver rate; and a compliance rate of 100%. 



III. Administrative Review

et seq.

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 

SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, Part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the state is already imposing. Therefore, because the federal SIP-approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its
actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. If no such comments are received, the public
is advised that this action will be effective on December 30, 1994. 

The EPA has reviewed this request for revision of the federally-approved SIP for conformance with the provisions
of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments enacted on November 15, 1990. The EPA has determined that this action conforms
with those requirements. 

Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.

Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans and Designation of 
Areas for Air Quality Planning Purposes; State of Indiana 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On July 8, 1994, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) published direct final rulemaking approving
the redesignation of St. Joseph, Elkhart, Marion, and Vanderburgh Counties, Indiana to attainment of the ozone National
Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and their accompanying maintenance plans as State Implementation Plan (SIP)
revisions. On the same day (July 8, 1994), a proposed rule was also published which established a 30-day public comment
period noting that, if adverse comments were received regarding the direct final rule, the USEPA would withdraw the
direct final rule and publish an additional final rule to address the public comments. Adverse comments were received
during the public comment period and the USEPA published a withdrawal of the direct final rule on August 26, 1994. This
final rule summarizes these comments and USEPA's responses and finalizes the approval of the redesignation of St.
Joseph, Elkhart and Marion Counties. However, due to preliminary, non-quality industrial assured ozone data recently
received from the State of Indiana for Warrick County, (which is adjacent to Vanderburgh County) indicating that
a violation of the ozone standard may have occurred in 1994, USEPA is not finalizing the approval of the redesignation
of Vanderburgh County at this time. The USEPA will address the Vanderburgh County redesignation request when an evaluation
of these monitoring data are available. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


I. Background Information 



The redesignation requests and maintenance plans discussed in this rule were submitted by the Indiana Department
of Environmental Management (IDEM) for the following ozone nonattainment areas: South Bend/Elkhart (St. Joseph
and Elkhart Counties, submitted on September 22, 1993); and Indianapolis (Marion County, submitted on November
12, 1993). On July 8, 1994, (59 FR 35044) USEPA published a direct final rule approving the redesignation requests
and maintenance plans as revisions to the Indiana ozone SIP. On the same day, USEPA published a proposed rule noting
that if adverse comments were received regarding the direct final rule, the USEPA would withdraw the direct final
rule and publish another final rule addressing the public comments (For further information refer to 59 FR 35044 and
59 FR 36731). Adverse comments were received regarding the direct final rule and USEPA, therefore, withdrew the direct
final rule on August 26, 1994, (59 FR 44040). The final rule contained in today's 

Federal Register

 addresses the comments which were received during the public comment period and announces USEPA's final action regarding
the redesignation of St. Joseph, Elkhart and Marion Counties. The State of Indiana has provided the USEPA with preliminary,
non-quality assured ozone data for Warrick County (which is adjacent to Vanderburgh County) indicating that a violation
of the ozone standard may have occurred in 1994. During four days in 1994, June 18 through June 21, ozone standard exceedances
may have been recorded at an Alcoa operated facility site (AIRS site 18-173-0002). The USEPA will defer
final rulemaking on the redesignation of Vanderburgh County until an evaluation of these monitoring data are available
for this period. Based on evaluation of these data, the redesignation of Vanderburgh County to attainment will have
to be reconsidered. USEPA will summarize and respond to the adverse comments received regarding the Vanderburgh
County redesignation in a subsequent final rulemaking action. 



II. Public Comments and USEPA Responses 



The following discussion summarizes and responds to the comments received regarding the redesignation of St. Joseph,
Elkhart, and Marion Counties. 



Comment 



A commenter notes that, in reviewing Indiana's ozone redesignation request, the USEPA should consider the transport
of ozone and ozone precursors into nonattainment areas currently part of the Lake Michigan Ozone Control Program
(LMOP) (also referred to as the Lake Michigan Ozone Study [LMOS] area). Given the ongoing concerns about the control
of transported ozone and ozone precursors as part of the attainment strategies being considered for the LMOP area,
the commenter believes the Indiana ozone nonattainment areas (as 
well as those of Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin) should not be redesignated to attainment until the Lake Michigan
Air Directors Consortium (LADCO) has conducted and completed an analysis of the ozone impacts of controlling transported
ozone precursors. 



USEPA Response 



Although the 1991 field study conducted for LMOS produced high ozone concentrations aloft near the upwind edge of
the LMOS modeling domain, implying transport of relatively high ozone concentrations into the LMOS domain, the 1991
field study did not establish the source(s) of the transported ozone. No studies have been conducted demonstrating
that the Indiana nonattainment areas are the source areas responsible for the transported ozone. As there is currently
no conclusive evidence that these Indiana areas are responsible for the transported ozone, USEPA does not believe
that it would be appropriate to continue the nonattainment classification of these areas. USEPA further notes that
these areas remain subject to obligations under sections 110(a)(2)(A) and 110(a)(2)(D) of the Clean Air Act (Act)
to deal with ozone transport even after redesignation to attainment. 

It should be noted that the LADCO States are conducting modeling analyses which will allow an assessment of the ozone
impacts of controlling emissions in attainment areas as well as in ozone nonattainment areas. In addition, the USEPA
is considering analyzing the impacts of some national controls covering both attainment areas and nonattainment
areas through the use of the Regional Oxidant Model, which can cover a larger domain than the Urban Airshed Model used
in LMOS and LMOP. The results of these modeling analyses may lead to new emission control requirements for attainment
areas. 


Comment 


A commenter notes that the State of Indiana has not fully predicted the impact of future transportation projects and
their effects on Vehicle Miles Travelled (VMT) and mobile source emissions growth. Specifically, the State of Indiana
is planning to build a new four-lane highway between Marion and Vanderburgh Counties. In addition, the City of Indianapolis
has recently proposed changes to its public transportation system, including the elimination of routes. Conformity
analyses have not been performed for either of these proposals. The commenter argues that the September 4, 1992 redesignation
guidance from USEPA's Director of the Air Quality Management Division, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards,
requires that the State prove that its State Implementation Plan (SIP) provisions are consistent with the Act's section
176(c)(4) conformity requirements.

<TEXT>
 

USEPA Response 



The USEPA conformity rule (58 FR 62218) requires the States to conduct conformity analyses for both nonattainment
areas and attainment areas subject to maintenance plans. The State is currently drafting its conformity rule to comply
with USEPA's conformity rule. Therefore, any major federally funded and State funded projects in the areas redesignated
to attainment by this action will be addressed through State conformity analyses and will be subject to the emissions
budget established by the applicable maintenance plan. The Indianapolis-Evansville highway and any major modifications
in public transportation will be subject to conformity analyses after Marion County is redesignated to attainment.
If the changes to the public transportation system are minor, they are not required to be subject to conformity analyses.




Comment 



A commenter has noted that the State has not shown that the improvements in air quality (occurring after the violation
period of 1987 through 1989) are due to permanent and enforceable emission reductions as required in section 107(d)(3)(E)(iii)
of the Act. The commenter argues that the September 4, 1992 USEPA redesignation policy guidance is clear in requiring
analysis of whether the improved air quality has resulted in part from either unique meteorological conditions or
adverse economic conditions. Air quality improvements due to these air quality impacts are not permanent, and, therefore,
are not creditable. These aspects have been neglected in both the State redesignation request and in USEPA's subsequent
rulemaking. 



USEPA Response 



The September 4, 1992 USEPA policy guidance referred to by the commenter states that ``[a]ttainment resulting from
temporary reductions in emission rates (e.g., reduced production or shutdown due to temporary adverse economic
conditions) or unusually favorable meteorology would not qualify as an air quality improvement due to permanent
and enforceable emission reductions.'' Neither the State nor the USEPA has neglected these issues in preparing and
analyzing Indiana's redesignation request. Rather, the USEPA believes that the State has adequately demonstrated
that the improvement in air quality resulting in the attainment of the ozone standard is not due to temporary economic
downturn or unusually favorable meteorology. As explained below, the State has made an adequate demonstration that
the improvement in air quality in these Counties leading to attainment of the ozone standard was not due to temporary
reductions in emission rates or to unusually favorable meteorology. 





With respect to the issue of temporary emission reductions due to economic downturn, the USEPA noted in the July 8,
1994 direct final rulemaking (59 FR 35048), that the State has shown that attainment of the ozone standard is attributable
to permanent and enforceable emission reductions that have occurred in Elkhart, Marion, and St. Joseph Counties.
These emission reductions have resulted from source closures, implementation of emission controls on stationary
sources (this included added emission reductions resulting from the correction of reasonably available control
technology regulations in response to regulation deficiencies previously noted by the USEPA), implementation
of the federal motor vehicle emission control program, and implementation of gasoline reid vapor pressure restrictions
(Indiana implemented USEPA reid vapor pressure requirements, lowering reid vapor pressure limits to 9.0 pounds
per square inch by 1992). All of these controls are permanent and enforceable. In the case of source closures, the source
permits associated with these sources have been terminated and will not be reissued. Substantial emission reductions
have occurred as a result of the imposition of permanent and enforceable emission controls, and it is USEPA's judgment
that these reductions, rather than reductions attributable to any temporary economic downturn, are primarily responsible
for the improvement in air quality that led to the attainment of the ozone standard in these Counties. The continued
attainment status of these Counties in the years since the 1990-1992 period further indicates that temporary
adverse economic conditions in the 1990-1991 period were not a significant factor in the attainment of the ozone
standard in these Counties.

With respect to the issue of unusual meteorology, the State has compared the average meteorological parameters of
maximum daily temperatures, daily mean wind speeds, percents of possible sunshine, and percents of relative humidity
for the periods of May through August, 1990 through 1992, with the 30-year (1961-1990) norms for these parameters.
In all three areas considered for redesignation, the 1990-1992 averages for these parameters agreed with those
for the 30-year norms with only minor differences. Based on averaged parameters, it can be concluded that the 1990-1992
period was not atypically nonconducive to ozone formation. Thus, the State has adequately demonstrated that the
air quality improvement was not due to unusually favorable meteorology. 


Comment 


A commenter notes that the failure to require correction of the State's part D New Source Review (NSR) program as a condition
for approval of the area redesignations is in conflict with the Act and with USEPA guidance. The commenter notes that
the USEPA rulemaking statement that part D NSR requirements are not generally applicable upon redesignation to attainment
conflicts with section 107(d)(3)(E)(v) and is not justified in the USEPA guidance. The commenter notes that, although
the USEPA September 4, 1992 policy memorandum implied that there is some flexibility in replacing part D NSR requirements
with Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) requirements, a subsequent USEPA September 17, 1993 policy
clarification memorandum eliminated this flexibility. 
The commenter also notes that the USEPA redesignation rulemaking erroneously allows the removal of existing part
D NSR requirements, such as the requirements for offsets and Lowest Achievable Emission Rates (LAER). All of these
existing programs disappear or are replaced by a part C PSD program. The commenter argues that the redesignations
to attainment are not acceptable unless the NSR part D requirements are retained as contingency measures. It is noted
that PSD for sources of ozone precursors does not require emission offsets for new sources, only requires Best Available
Control Technology (BACT) emission controls rather than LAER, and has different source emission thresholds than
does part D NSR. The implication is that shifting to PSD from part D NSR will weaken emission control requirements without
adequate safeguards. 
The commenter notes that the statement in the redesignation rulemaking that the section 175A(d) requirement (that
all SIP measures be converted to contingency measures) should not apply to part D NSR because of the differing use of
the term ``measure'' at section 161 of the Clean Air Act is irrelevant. The relevance of the part C (section 161) reference
to a part D NSR requirement is questionable. The allusion to USEPA's historical practices do nothing to negate the
explicit imperatives of the Clean Air Act and other USEPA guidance. 
The commenter goes on to state that based on USEPA's logic in eliminating the part D NSR requirement, any and all other
applicable part D requirements, including those which have been previously met and even relied upon in demonstrating
attainment, could be eliminated without an analysis demonstrating that maintenance would be protected. 




USEPA Response 


USEPA believes that the areas that are the subject of Indiana's redesignation request may be redesignated to attainment
notwithstanding the lack of a fully approved NSR program meeting the requirements of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments
and the absence of such an NSR program from the contingency plan. This view, while a departure from the past policy,
has been set forth by the USEPA as its new policy in a memorandum from Mary Nichols, Assistant Administrator for Air
and Radiation (``Part D New Source Review (part D NSR) Requirements for Areas Requesting Redesignation to Attainment,''
October 14, 1994). 
USEPA believes that its failure to insist on a fully approved NSR program as a pre-requisite to redesignation to attainment
is justifiable as an exercise of the Agency's general authority to establish 

de minimis 

exceptions to statutory requirements. See 

Alabama Power Co. v. Costle, 

636 F.2d 323, 360-61 (D.C. Cir. 1979). Under 

Alabama Power Co. v. Costle, 

the Agency has the authority to establish 

de minimis 

exceptions to statutory requirements where the application of the statutory requirements would be of trivial or
no value environmentally. 


In this context, the issue presented is whether the Agency has the authority to establish an exception to the requirement
of section 107(d)(3)(E) that USEPA has fully approved a state implementation plan meeting all of the requirements
applicable to the area under section 110 and part D of Title I of the Act. Plainly, the NSR provisions of section 110 and
part D are requirements that were applicable to the Indiana areas seeking redesignation at the times of submission
of the requests for redesignation. Thus, on its face, section 107(d)(3)(E) would seem to require that the State has
submitted and USEPA has fully approved an NSR program meeting the requirements of the Act before the areas could be
redesignated to attainment. 


Under the Agency's 

de minimis 

authority, however, it may establish an exception to an otherwise plain statutory requirement if its fulfillment
would be of little or no environmental value. In this context, it is necessary to determine what would be achieved by
insisting that there be a fully approved NSR program in place prior to the redesignation of the Indiana areas. For the
following reasons, USEPA believes that requiring the adoption and full approval of an NSR program prior to redesignation
would not be of any significant environmental value in this case. 
Indiana has demonstrated that maintenance of the ozone NAAQS will occur even if the emission reductions expected
to result from an NSR program due to emission offsets do not occur. The emission projections made by Indiana to demonstrate
maintenance of the NAAQS considered growth in point source emissions (along with growth for other source categories)
and were premised on the assumption that PSD would be in effect, rather than NSR, during the maintenance period. Under
NSR, significant point source emissions growth would not occur. Indiana assumed that NSR would not apply after redesignation
to attainment, and, therefore, assumed source growth factors based on projected growth in the economy and in the areas'
populations. (It should be noted that the growth factors assumed may be overestimates under PSD, which would restrain
source growth through the application of best available control techniques.) Thus, contrary to the assertion of
the commenters, Indiana has demonstrated that there is no need to retain NSR as an operative program in the state implementation
plan during the maintenance period in order to provide for continued maintenance of the NAAQS. (If this demonstration
had not been made, NSR would have had to have been retained in the state implementation plan as an operative program
since it would have been needed to maintain the ozone standard.)

The other purpose that requiring the full approval of an NSR program might serve would be to ensure that NSR would become
a contingency provision in the maintenance plan required for these areas by sections 107(d)(3)(E)(iv) and 175A(d).
These provisions require that, for an area to be redesignated to attainment, it must receive full approval of a maintenance
plan containing ``such contingency provisions as the Administrator deems necessary to assure that the State will
promptly correct any violation of the standard which occurs after the redesignation of the area as an attainment area.
Such provisions shall include a requirement that the State will implement all measures with respect to the control
of the air pollutant concerned which were contained in the State implementation plan for the area before redesignation
of the area as an attainment area.'' Based on this language, it is apparent that whether an approved NSR program must
be included as a contingency provision depends on whether it is considered as a ``measure'' for the control of the pertinent
air pollutants. 

As USEPA noted in the proposed rulemaking regarding these redesignation requests, the term ``measure'' is not defined
in section 175A(d) and Congress utilized that term differently in different provisions of the Act with respect to
the PSD and NSR permitting programs. For example, in section 110(a)(2)(A), Congress required State implementation
plans to include ``enforceable emission limitations and other control measures, means, or techniques * * *
as may be necessary or appropriate to meet the applicable requirements of the Act.'' In section 110(a)(2)(C), Congress
required that State implementation plans include ``a program to provide for the enforcement of the 

measures 

described in subparagraph (A), 

and 

regulation of the modification and construction of any stationary source within the areas covered by the plan as necessary
to assure that national ambient air quality standards are achieved, including a permit program as required in parts
C and D.'' (Emphasis added.) If the term ``measures'' as used in sections 110(a)(2) (A) and (C) had been intended to
include PSD and NSR there would have been no point to requiring that State implementation plans include both measures


and

 preconstruction review under parts C and D (PSD and NSR). Unless ``measures'' referred to something other than preconstruction
review under parts C and D, the reference to preconstruction review programs in section 110(a)(2)(C) would be rendered
mere surplusage. Thus, in sections 110(a)(2) (A) and (C), it is apparent that Congress distinguished ``measures''
from preconstruction review. On the other hand, in other provisions of the Act, such as section 161, Congress appeared
to include PSD within the scope of the term ``measures.'' 

Contrary to the comments in this proceeding, USEPA does not believe that the fact that Congress used the undefined
term ``measure'' differently in different sections of the Act is ``irrelevant.'' Rather, this indicates that the
term is susceptible to more than one interpretation and that USEPA has the discretion to interpret it in a reasonable
manner in the context of section 175A. Inasmuch as Congress itself has used the term in a manner that excluded PSD and
NSR from its scope, USEPA believes it is reasonable to interpret ``measure,'' as used in section 175A(d), not to include
NSR. That this is a reasonable interpretation is further supported by the fact that PSD, a program that is the corollary
of NSR for attainment areas, goes into effect in lieu of NSR.
 This distinguishes NSR from other required programs under the Act, such as enhanced inspection and maintenance and
reasonably available control technology, which have no corollary for attainment areas. Moreover, USEPA believes
that those other required programs are clearly within the scope of the term ``measure.''
 






USEPA disagrees with the commenters' suggestion that USEPA's logic in treating NSR in this manner means that other
applicable part D requirements, including those that have been previously met and previously relied upon in demonstrating
attainment, could be eliminated without an analysis demonstrating that maintenance would be protected. As noted
above, Indiana has demonstrated that maintenance would be protected with PSD in effect, rather than NSR. Thus, USEPA
is not permitting NSR to be removed without a demonstration that maintenance of the standard will be achieved. Moreover,
USEPA has not amended its policy with respect to the conversion of other State implementation plan elements to contingency
provisions, which is that they may be converted to contingency provisions only upon a showing that maintenance will
be achieved without them being in effect. Finally, as noted above, USEPA believes that the NSR requirement differs
from other requirements, and does not believe that the rationale for the NSR exception extends to other required programs.

The position taken in this action is consistent with USEPA's current national policy. That policy permits redesignations
to proceed without otherwise required NSR programs having been fully approved and converted to contingency provisions
provided that the area demonstrates, as has been done in this case, that maintenance will be achieved with the application
of PSD rather than NSR. 



III. Final Rulemaking Action 



The State of Indiana has met the requirements of the Act revising the Indiana ozone SIP. The USEPA approves the redesignation
of St. Joseph, Elkhart and Marion Counties, Indiana to attainment of the ozone NAAQS. Final determination is being
withheld for Vanderburgh County at this time. Further consideration of the Vanderburgh County redesignation will
be made upon completion of the quality assurance of the Alcoa monitoring site data. 

This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has exempted this regulatory
action from Executive Order 12866 review. 

Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to any SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq., 

USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on
a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises,
and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 

The SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D, of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply
approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does not impose
any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The Act forbids USEPA to base
its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds. 

Union Electric Co. v. USEPA, 

427 U.S. 246, 256-66 (1976). 

Under Section 307(b)(1) of the Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States
Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by December 30, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator
of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the
time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule
or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).)
