Horses From Spain; Change in Disease Status 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are proposing to amend the regulations concerning the importation of horses to remove Spain from the list of countries
in which African horse sickness exists. We believe that Spain is free of African horse sickness, and that restrictions
on the importation of horses from Spain to prevent the spread of African horse sickness into the United States are no
longer necessary. This action relieves unnecessary restrictions on the importation of horses from Spain. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


The regulations in 9 CFR part 92 (referred to below as the regulations) state the provisions for the importation into
the United States of specified animals to prevent the introduction of various animal diseases, including African
horse sickness (AHS). AHS, a fatal equine viral disease, is not known to exist in the United States. Section 92.308(a)(2)
of the regulations lists countries that the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) considers affected
with AHS, and sets forth specific requirements for horses which are imported from those countries. APHIS requires
horses intended for importation from any of the countries listed, including horses that have stopped in or transited
those countries, to enter the United States only at the port of New York and be quarantined at the New York Animal Import
Center in Newburgh, NY, for at least 60 days. 
Spain has applied to the United States Department of Agriculture to be recognized as free from AHS. Spain's last diagnosed
case of AHS was on October 29, 1990. From December 1990 through December 1992, Spain conducted an extensive AHS vaccination
program. Effective November 30, 1993, the European Union declared Spain to be free of AHS. 
APHIS has reviewed the documentation submitted by the Government of Spain in support of its request. An APHIS official
also performed an on-site inspection of two of Spain's Animal Health Ministry's laboratories. The APHIS official
inspected both the Laboratory of Animal Health and Production at Algetes and the Regional Laboratory of Animal Health
and Production at Cordoba. Both laboratories have been heavily involved in eradication, vaccination, research,
and surveillance activities for AHS. The laboratory at Algetes serves as the European Union's Reference Laboratory
for AHS and is responsible for providing verification of any suspected positive test result for the AHS virus submitted
by the 17 regional laboratories in Spain. In 1993, the regional laboratory at Cordoba tested 180 spleen samples from
horses in Spain that died of unknown causes or were killed in traffic accidents; all results were negative for the AHS
virus. The APHIS official conducting the on-site evaluation concluded that the laboratory systems are highly effective
and contributed to the eradication of AHS from Spain. 
Based on the information discussed above, we believe that Spain qualifies for removal from the list of countries,
in  92.308(a)(2) of the regulations, which APHIS considers affected with AHS. This proposed action would relieve
restrictions which require horses imported from Spain to enter the United States only at the port of New York and be
quarantined at the New York Animal Import Center in Newburgh, NY, for at least 60 days. This proposed action would allow
horses from Spain to be shipped to and quarantined at ports designated in  92.303, and would reduce the quarantine
period to an average of three days to meet the quarantine and testing requirements specified in  92.308.

Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 


This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. For this action, the Office of Management and Budget
has waived its review process required by Executive Order 12866. 
The primary impact of this proposal will be on U.S. importers of horses from Spain, none of whom can be considered a small
entity. These importers will no longer be required to quarantine horses from Spain for 60 days at the New York Animal
Import Center in Newburgh, NY. The proposed rule would allow horses from Spain to be shipped to and quarantined at ports
designated in  92.303, and would reduce the quarantine and testing period to an average of three days to meet
quarantine requirements specified in  92.308. 
The number of horses imported from Spain each year is extremely small. In 1993, the United States imported 20,715 horses,
mules, and burros, of which only nine came from Spain. Removing the requirement for a 60-day quarantine at the New York
Animal Import Center in Newburgh, NY, for horses from Spain will make the importation of these horses less expensive
and logistically easier. We anticipate that the number of horses imported from Spain may slightly increase. However,
with the very small number of horses imported from Spain, we anticipate the overall economic impact on businesses
and individuals would be minimal. 
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 


Executive Order 12778 


This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. If this proposed rule is adopted:
(1) All State and local laws and regulations that are inconsistent with this rule will be preempted; (2) no retroactive
effect will be given to this rule; and (3) administrative proceedings will not be required before parties may file
suit in court challenging this rule. 


Paperwork Reduction Act 


This proposed rule contains no information collection or recordkeeping requirements under the Paperwork Reduction
Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

). 


List of Subjects in 9 CFR Part 92 


Animal diseases, Imports, Livestock, Poultry and poultry products, Quarantine, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.




Accordingly, 9 CFR part 92 would be amended as follows: 


PART 92_IMPORTATION OF CERTAIN ANIMALS AND POULTRY AND CERTAIN ANIMAL AND POULTRY PRODUCTS; INSPECTION AND OTHER
REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTAIN MEANS OF CONVEYANCE AND SHIPPING CONTAINERS THEREON 


1. The authority citation for part 92 would continue to read as follows: 





Authority:

 7 U.S.C. 1622; 19 U.S.C. 1306; 21 U.S.C. 102-105, 111, 114a, 134a, 134b, 134c, 134d, 134f, 135, 136, and 136a;
31 U.S.C. 9701; 7 CFR 2.17, 2.51, and 371.2(d). 


 92.308 

[Amended] 


2. In  92.308, paragraph (a)(2) would be amended by removing ``Spain,''. 



Done in Washington, DC, this 26th day of October 1994.

 Farm Credit Administration.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Farm Credit Administration (FCA), by the Farm 
Credit Administration Board (Board), proposes to amend the 
regulations governing Technical Assistance and Financially 
Related Services and Member Insurance. Subpart A of the 
proposed regulation defines what constitutes technical 
assistance, financial assistance and financially related 
services and what types of activities the Farm Credit System 
(System) institutions are authorized to provide. The 
proposed regulation allows greater flexibility in this area, 
while maintaining the FCA's ability to regulate safety and 
soundness risks. The FCA's existing prior approval 
requirement is eliminated and replaced with a post-review 
process for all services, except for those that have never 
been authorized by the FCA. The FCA also proposes to amend 
the Member Insurance regulation to clarify existing rules 
and reduce regulatory burdens wherever possible.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Background and Statutory Authorities 


Under title I, section 1.12; title II, sections 2.5 and 
2.12 (15); and title III, section 3.7 of the Farm Credit Act 
of 1971, as amended (the Act), the FCA is responsible for 
promulgating regulations governing the offering and 
administering of technical assistance, financial assistance, 
and financially related services by banks and associations 
(hereinafter referred to as ``related services''). 

System institutions have offered credit life insurance 
and a variety of other credit-related services over the past 
40 years. Pursuant to regulations adopted in 1984, the FCA 
is responsible for the review and approval of bank financial 
services policies and must also approve each new related 
service program on a case-by-case basis before it is offered 
by a bank or its affiliated associations. The FCA took no 
further Systemwide action until 1993, when the Board adopted 
a policy statement (58 FR 36410, July 2, 1993) and 
subsequently issued a bookletter (366-OE, September 3, 1993) 
authorizing the providing of related services outside an 
institution's chartered territory, under certain 
circumstances. 

On December 2, 1993, FCA Board Chairman Billy Ross 
Brown completed a study entitled ``The Farm Credit System's 
Authorized Services'' and directed staff to use it as a basis 
for revising the existing regulations. The proposed 
regulation also incorporates the intent of the FCA Board's 
Policy Statement on Regulatory Philosophy published in the 


Federal Register

 on February 17, 1994 (59 FR 32189). 



II. Regulatory Burden Comments and Petitions for Rulemaking 



On June 23, 1993, the FCA Board published a ``Statement 
of Regulatory Burden'' (58 FR 34003) that requested comments 
regarding how the FCA could lessen the regulatory burden on 
System institutions. In response, the agency received three 
comment letters on related services, including one on Member 
Insurance. These comments are addressed in this proposed 
regulation and are referred to as ``Regulatory Burden 
Comments.''

Also in 1993, the Farm Credit Banks' Presidents 
Planning Committee (PPC) authorized an initiative to review 
the FCA regulations and make recommendations concerning 
those that the System believes are not directly related to 
safety and soundness or unduly restrict the full exercise of 
authorities granted by the Act. This initiative produced a 
System work group on related services (PPC work group) which 
included representatives from associations and banks in the 
AgriBank, Baltimore, Columbia, Springfield, and Western Farm 
Credit Districts. In July 1993, FCA met with the PPC work 
group to hear its concerns and objectives. 

The PPC work group completed its study on November 2, 
1993, and provided the results to the FCA Board for its 
consideration in this proposed rule. The study recommended: 

(1) Elimination of existing prior approval requirements; 

(2) revision of coordination requirements to provide for 
increased flexibility in providing intra- and inter-district 
services;

(3) revision of the requirement for bank annual 
review of service programs;

(4) increased flexibility in how 
banks and associations administer related service programs; 
and

(5) various technical and clarifying changes in subparts 
A and B. 

On April 4, 1994, the FCA received a ``Petition for 
Rulemaking to Revise 12 CFR part 618_subpart A, Concerning 
Financially Related Services'' (hereinafter referred to as 
``FRS petition''), submitted by a Washington, D.C., law firm 
on behalf of one agricultural credit association (ACA), 
three Federal land credit associations (FLCAs) and five 
production credit associations (PCAs) in California and 
Michigan. The petitioners supported the PPC work group's 
recommendations, but suggested that, in light of the FCA 
Board's February 17, 1994 Policy Statement on Regulatory 
Philosophy (59 FR 32189), the FCA should consider a broader 
rulemaking proceeding and more fundamental changes in the 
regulation than may have originally been contemplated. 

The petitioners focused on areas where expanded 
authorities could be considered and requested that the FCA: 

(1) Define related services (although no definition was 
suggested);

(2) authorize the offering of other services for 
a fee;

(3) provide for a non-exclusive list of approved 
related services;

(4) eliminate the prior approval 
requirement;

(5) eliminate the annual bank review of related 
service programs; and

(6) encourage innovative means for 
offering related services that meet borrower needs. 

On May 4, 1994, the FCA received a petition from an ACA 
in Michigan (hereinafter referred to as ``Insurance 
petition'') asking the FCA to reconsider the requirement in 
the Member Insurance regulations (subpart B) that insurance 
only be sold to members who have a debtor/creditor 
relationship. 

In addition to the above petitions and System input, 
over the past 18 months the FCA has received prior approval 
requests and technical/interpretive questions that have 
raised issues regarding what types of services are 
authorized, what types of institutions can offer services, 
and who the recipients of these services can be. Issues 
included questions about incidental authorities, sale of 
insurance out-of-territory, and sale of fee appraisals other 
than directly to members or borrowers. 



III. Proposed Regulatory Approach 



System institutions desire greater flexibility to use 
their statutory authority for providing related services in 
order to serve the evolving needs of farmers and ranchers 
and to meet competitive pressures. Although the FCA 
understands the System's desire to expand current related 
service activities, the agency's primary concerns continue 
to focus on safety and soundness issues and whether the 
System remains within the limits of current statutory 
authorities. 

Underlying these proposed regulations, is FCA's 
conclusion that, under most circumstances, it would be 
appropriate to replace the current prior approval 
requirement with specific criteria for determining what 
services can be offered and under what circumstances. 
However, the FCA, in its role as a safety and soundness 
regulator, wishes to reserve the right to review new 
services in order to ensure that they would not present 
excessive risk to the System. Because it is difficult to 
foresee what types of new services will be proposed, it is 
impracticable to prescribe specific regulations for new 
services that have yet to be offered by the System. The 
FCA, therefore, proposes to remove as much of the regulatory 
burden as possible, while maintaining its ability to apply 
the statute, achieve regulatory objectives, and preserve 
flexibility. The FCA has also reduced the role the funding 
bank is required, by regulation, to play in overseeing such 
programs. This allows the institution offering a service to 
take the primary responsibility for the related services it 
provides. 

The proposed regulation in part 618 defines terms and 
establishes specific authorizing criteria so that each 
institution can evaluate the services it would like to offer 
its customers. Thus, the proposed regulation clarifies the 
FCA's primary safety and soundness concerns and 
distinguishes between the types of services that can be 
offered and the programs for delivering these services. 

Subpart A has been rewritten and reorganized because of 
the wholesale nature of the regulatory changes proposed by 
the FCA. In proposed  618.8000, the FCA sets forth a 
definition of ``related service'' which includes insurance and 
encompasses activities previously referred to as technical 
assistance, financial assistance, or financially related 
services. The proposed regulation also details regulatory 
eligibility requirements for recipients of such services.

<TEXT>
 

In proposed  618.8010 (``Related Services Authorization 
Process''), the FCA replaces the prior approval in the 
existing regulation in part, by communicating to all 
institutions those services it has approved, which may then 
be offered without further regulatory approval. The 
proposed regulation also describes the process for the FCA's 
review of new services. 
Proposed  618.8015 (``Policy Guidelines'') requires each 
institution offering related services to adopt a policy 
addressing related services. Proposed  618.8020 
(``Feasibility Requirements'') contains criteria for the 
feasibility analysis that must be performed in conjunction 
with developing a new service program. 
Proposed  618.8025 (``Feasibility Reviews'') addresses 
the statutory requirement for the board of directors of each 
funding bank to determine that association-related service 
programs are feasible. The proposed regulation requires the 
association to perform a feasibility analysis and requires 
the bank's board of directors to verify that this analysis 
has been done, and limits the scope and frequency of reviews 
that the bank must perform. 
The final section in subpart A,  618.8030 
(``Out-of-Territory Related Services''), establishes a 
regulatory basis for providing out-of-territory related 
services. The FCA's policy statement and bookletter on 
offering services outside an institution's chartered 
territory would be superseded by these provisions. 
The proposed Member Insurance regulation in subpart B 
remains largely unchanged with two exceptions: (1) The 
requirement for a debtor/creditor relationship would no 
longer be necessary for sales of certain types of insurance; 
and (2) employee compensation for insurance sales would be 
allowed within certain limits. 


IV. Section-by-Section Analysis 


A. Subpart A_Related Services 


1. Section 618.8000_Definitions 


Section 618.8000 of the proposed regulation would 
define the term ``program'' to mean the method or procedure by 
which an institution provides a related service. The 
purpose of the definition is to distinguish between the 
concept or type of activity that will be provided, such as 
farm business consulting, and the manner in which an 
institution will provide the particular service. The 
distinction between the type of related service and the 
institution's program for providing the service will be 
addressed further in the discussion of proposed  618.8010. 
``Related services'' would be defined to mean any 
activity provided by a System bank or association that 
pertains to the recipient's on-farm, aquatic or cooperative 
operation, including control of related financial matters. 
The definition is intended to be broadly construed in order 
to encompass services, other than the making of loans, that 
an institution may want to offer to persons or entities 
eligible to borrow. It should be noted that the proposed 
definition does not rely upon whether the institution 
charges fees or makes a profit from offering a service in 
making a determination as to whether it is considered a 
``related service.'' The FCA recognizes that institutions may 
offer related services at cost or at a slight loss in order 
to increase customer satisfaction or attract new customers. 
Such decisions are considered business decisions that will 
be reviewed in the examination context. The proposed 
definition of related services is not intended to include 
advertising or purely promotional activities. 
Although other terms, such as ``technical assistance,'' 
``financial and technical assistance,'' and ``financially 
related services,'' are referenced in the Act, the 
distinction among these types of services has become 
negligible. In fact, the legislative history for the 
enactment of the Farm Credit Act of 1971
 does not 
distinguish among these terms. Therefore, in order to 
reduce any confusion, the proposed definition would include 
all services referred to above. 




The PPC work group commented that the on-farm 
requirement should not be interpreted to limit authorized 
related services to only those services that relate to the 
physical operations of the farm. The FCA agrees that 
Congress did not intend the on-farm requirement to be 
interpreted in such a restrictive manner and, historically, 
the FCA has not done so in approving related service 
programs. The FCA interprets the on-farm requirement to 
mean that related services must pertain to the farming or 
aquatic operations of the recipients or be useful in 
managing the financial matters of such operations. In fact, 
many of the services specifically mentioned by Congress when 
it enacted the related services authority in 1971 are 
related to farming and aquatic operations and controlling 
the risks associated with such operations rather than being 
a direct part of the physical operation. Those services 
specifically mentioned in the statute or legislative history 
include insurance, estate planning, and tax services.

Finally, the proposed regulation would also define 
``System banks and associations'' to include Farm Credit Banks 
(FCBs), Agricultural Credit Banks (ACBs), banks for 
cooperatives (BCs), production credit associations (PCAs), 
agricultural credit associations (ACAs), Federal land bank 
associations (FLBAs), and Federal land credit associations 
(FLCAs). The Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation and 
the Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation would not be 
included because these and other similar Farm Credit 
institutions are not authorized to provide related services. 
Although service corporations are not included within the 
term ``System banks and associations,'' these entities would 
continue to be authorized to offer related services, except 
insurance, based on section 4.25 of the Act.






2. Section 618.8005_Eligibility 


Based on the provisions of sections 1.12, 2.5, 2.12(15) 
and 3.7 of the Act, proposed  618.8005 requires that 
related services
 be offered by an institution to persons 
or entities eligible to borrow from the System. The 
proposed regulation would determine eligible recipients for 
related services by reference to persons eligible to borrow 
as defined in the lending regulations at part 613 of this 
chapter. Proposed  618.8005(a) would authorize FCBs and 
associations to offer related services to the persons 
eligible to borrow as defined in   613.3010; 
613.3020(a)(1), (a)(2), and (b); and 613.3045. For BCs, 
proposed  618.8005(b) would authorize related services to 
be provided to eligible borrowers as defined in   613.3110 
and 613.3120. Proposed  618.8005(c) would authorize ACBs 
to offer related services appropriate to on-farm and aquatic 
operations to persons eligible to borrow as specified in 
paragraph (a) of this section and to offer related services 
appropriate to cooperative operations to entities eligible 
to borrow as specified in paragraph (b) of this section. 




The FCA is currently developing proposed amendments to 
the lending eligibility regulations. Once any lending 
eligibility amendments become final,  618.8005 would be 
modified as necessary to conform to lending eligibility. 
The FCA believes that marketers and processors that 
meet the eligibility requirements of  613.3045 would also 
be included within the recipients that Congress considered 
eligible to receive related services. For any processing 
and marketing unit to be eligible to borrow, there must be a 
portion of the operation's throughput that is produced 
on-farm by the entity or its owners. The FCA believes that 
related services provided to marketing and processing units 
would be appropriate to the on-farm or aquatic operations of 
the unit or its owners. Therefore, these entities would be 
included within the eligible recipients specified in 
proposed  618.8005(a). Because rural home residents and 
farm-related businesses do not have farming or aquatic 
operations, services provided to them would not meet the 
statutory ``on-farm'' requirement and, therefore, they would 
continue to be excluded from the eligible recipients 
specified in proposed  618.8005. 
The proposed regulation would approach the eligibility 
provisions for related services offered by ACBs in the same 
manner as eligibility is treated for FCBs and BCs. An ACB 
would be authorized under proposed  618.8005(c) to provide 
related services to persons eligible to borrow from FCBs. 
Such related services would have to be appropriate to the 
on-farm and aquatic operations of the recipients. Further, 
an ACB could provide related services to its cooperative 
customers, as long as the service is appropriate to their 
cooperative operations. Therefore, although an FCB and BC 
will be combined into an ACB, the services that can be 
provided to each type of borrower under titles I, II, and 
III of the Act would not change under the proposed 
regulation. 
Recent requests from System institutions have led the 
FCA to consider whether there are situations in which 
persons eligible to borrow may be denied the ability to 
receive the benefit of related services merely because an 
intermediary or other person or entity involved would not 
meet the eligibility requirements of the Act. The FCA 
believes that all farmers, ranchers, and other eligible 
persons and entities should be able to receive the full 
benefit of the related services authorized in the Act. 
Similar requests have been received asking the FCA to 
consider allowing the System to provide fee appraisals for 
agricultural real estate to entities such as the Farmers 
Home Administration (FmHA), commercial banks, and other 
lenders in connection with loan applications from persons 
eligible to borrow, and loan servicing actions (including 
bankruptcies and foreclosures) involving agricultural 
assets. The FCA also received a letter from the FmHA 
requesting that System institutions be authorized to provide 
the appraisals. 
The FmHA and certain System institutions have stated 
that there is a shortage of qualified agricultural 
appraisers in certain areas of the country, especially 
following the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and 
Enforcement Act.
 System personnel, who have developed an 
expertise in agricultural appraisals, could help meet this 
need. The availability of qualified appraisers would 
benefit farmers and ranchers in that their property would be 
fairly valued in situations such as loan applications and 
loan servicing. Under current regulations, System 
institutions have not been able to provide the appraisals 
when they are provided directly to the FmHA or a commercial 
bank, entities not eligible to borrow from a System 
institution. Also, the FmHA procedures provide that the 
FmHA will contract for appraisals rather than having each 
borrower obtain an appraisal.

<TEXT>
 

Therefore, proposed  618.8005(d) would provide that 
related services may be offered to recipients that do not 
otherwise meet the eligibility requirements, as long as such 
service is offered in connection with loan applications, 
loan servicing, and other transactions between these 
recipients and persons or entities eligible to borrow under 
the criteria in proposed  618.8005(a), (b), or (c) 
discussed above. 

The service in question would have to be a part of or 
pertain to the transaction. For example, if a System 
institution offered a soil testing service, a natural food 
store wishing to purchase produce from a farmer could 
utilize the System institution's service to test the soil 
for pesticides. Although the eligible farmer directly 
benefits from the service and could arrange for the testing 
from the institution, the food store may wish to contract 
for the service directly in order to ensure independence of 
the testing. The System institution could not, however, 
offer tax planning services to the natural food store 
because tax planning does not pertain to the store's 
transaction with the farmer and does not directly benefit 
the eligible farmer. In addition, the authority to provide 
related services in  618.8005(d) would not depend on which 
party arranges for or pays for the related services. 
Finally, for BCs and ACBs, proposed  618.8005(d) would not 
change the requirements of  613.3120 of this chapter that a 
voting stockholder must substantially benefit from services 
provided in connection with foreign export or import 
transactions. 

One of the Regulatory Burden comments stated that 
System institutions should have the authority to provide 
related services to non-eligible entities as long as such 
services did not comprise the majority of the institution's 
program. The FCA does not believe that statutory or 
regulatory eligibility requirements depend on the percentage 
of an institution's services that are provided to the person 
or entity whose eligibility is in question, and did not 
include this suggestion in the proposed regulation. 

Finally, the FCA does not agree with the view advanced 
by the Farm Credit Council (FCC) and FRS petitioners that 
appraisals and other services could be provided to 
non-eligible entities pursuant to the institutions' 
incidental authorities under sections 1.5(21), 2.2(20), 
2.12(20), and 3.2(16) of the Act. System institutions were 
created for the express purpose of providing lending and 
related services. It is a general principle of corporate 
law that incidental powers are those powers that are 
directly and immediately appropriate to the execution of 
powers expressly granted and cannot be used to waive a 
specific limitation on an express power.
 Therefore, any 
use of incidental authorities for activities derived from 
either lending or related services express powers would 
still be subject to the limitations on those express powers. 





3. Section 618.8010_Related Services Authorization Process 



As part of its commitment to reducing the regulatory 
burden, the FCA proposes to eliminate the existing 
regulatory requirement that each System bank or association 
obtain the FCA's prior approval before providing a related 
service program. In addition, System institutions requested 
a change in the approval process to lessen the burden and 
speed up the process. A number of suggestions were made 
regarding the process; many of these have been incorporated 
into the proposed regulation. 

The proposed regulation sharply reduces the FCA's 
up-front role in two ways. First, the FCA would only 
evaluate proposals for new related services up front, that 
is, only services that have not previously been approved by 
the FCA. Second, only the service itself, not an 
institution's program, would initially be evaluated. This 
means that the FCA's evaluation of new services could occur 
before the proposing institution prepares a complete 
feasibility analysis or its funding bank completes its 
review. In fact, while the FCA would expect well-documented 
service proposals, an institution would not need to devote 
valuable resources to developing its operational program 
before submitting a new related service for the FCA's 
evaluation. Following the FCA's authorization of the 
service, any authorized institution could develop and offer 
a program based on regulatory criteria in proposed 
  618.8020 and 618.8025 without obtaining prior approval 
from the FCA. The institution's program would then be 
subject to review in the course of the examination process.

The first step in the proposed new process would be the 
compilation of related services that have been determined to 
meet the definition and other criteria specified in this 
regulation (the Related Service List or simply ``the list''). 
As provided in proposed  618.8010(c)(2), the list would 
briefly describe each related service, capturing key 
distinguishing aspects of the activity, as well as a 
designation of the types of institutions authorized to offer 
the specific services. Institutional restrictions would 
mainly be due to statutory limitations related to eligible 
recipients. Finally, any special conditions placed on 
offering a given service would be identified on the list. 
It is anticipated that these conditions would be the 
exception rather than the rule and would apply mainly to 
complex services, with readily identifiable safety and 
soundness risks. 

Appendix A contains a sample list consisting of all 
previously approved related services known to have at least 
one active program among System banks and associations and 
those services specifically mentioned in the statute. The 
sample list is included as an attachment to this

 Federal 
Register

 document for informational purposes only and will 
not become part of the final regulation. 

Although every attempt has been made to identify 
existing services, the FCA recognizes that its historical 
records may not be complete. Therefore, System banks and 
associations currently offering services that meet the 
related service definition, but are not part of the sample 
list, should submit such services during the comment period 
if they wish to continue providing them after the revised 
regulation becomes effective. Institutions should provide 
the title of the service and a brief description, including 
any previous action taken by the FCA on the related service. 
If there is no existing documentation, then the institution 
should provide sufficient information for the FCA to 
consider the service based on the provisions in proposed 
 618.8010(b). These services may be included on the 
initial list to be published concurrently with the final 
regulation. If some services require further study, they 
will be considered for inclusion on the list after the 
regulation is finalized. 

Once a service is determined to meet the regulatory 
criteria and is placed on the list, proposed  618.8010(b) 
would provide that System banks and associations could 
develop programs and subsequently offer the related service, 
subject to any special conditions and institutional 
restrictions identified on the list. This proposal would 
eliminate the requirement in existing  618.8000(c) that the 
FCA approve each institution's related services program. 
The FCA believes that an institution's program for offering 
the service and its capacity to offer that service can be 
reviewed during the examination process. Proposed 
 618.8010(c)(4) would require that when a listed service is 
first offered by an institution, the institution must notify 
the FCA's Office of Examination field office responsible for 
examining that institution. 

An institution that wishes to offer a related service 
not previously evaluated by the FCA would need to submit a 
written proposal pursuant to proposed  618.8010(b). 
Neither a formal bank review nor a detailed operational 
program (per existing regulations) would be required prior 
to requesting that the FCA review the service. In the event 
of complex or controversial proposals, proposed 
 618.8010(b)(3) acknowledges that the FCA, at its 
discretion, may publish the proposed service in the 

Federal 
Register

 for public comment. 

No later than 60 days after receipt of a complete 
proposal, including any additional information the FCA may 
require, System institutions would be notified of the FCA's 
action pursuant to  618.8010(b)(4). Although the FCA would 
normally act promptly on a proposed service, for good cause 
and prior to the expiration of the 60 days, the review 
period could be extended for up to a total of 120 days. The 
FCA would formally notify all System institutions of its 
action by bookletter or other appropriate forms of 
communication. 

Proposed new related services would be evaluated by the 
FCA based on the provisions of proposed  618.8010(b). The 
FCA would consider two key aspects in evaluating a related 
service. The first aspect is whether the service is 
authorized; that is, whether it meets the definition of a 
related service in proposed  618.8000(b). For example, a 
service provided by a title I or title II lending 
institution would have to be appropriate to on-farm 
operations and would have to be targeted to the defined 
eligible recipients. When evaluating that service, the FCA 
would also consider whether the service would be appropriate 
to cooperative operations and, if so, include BCs and ACBs 
as authorized institutions. 

The second key aspect the FCA would consider is whether 
significant risk factors are inherent in the service and 
whether they can be managed or eliminated. This evaluation 
would involve assessing the degree of risks in the areas of 
financial liability, operational matters, and conflicts of 
interest.

<PARENT> FR941031-1-00002 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Financial liability includes any liability that could 
arise as a result of offering the service. For example, 
such liability could arise if institution personnel make 
management decisions on a customer's behalf. The primary 
concern is whether such liability has the potential to 
materially impact an institution's financial condition. 
Operational risk is the risk involved in implementing a 
service. This risk could occur if an institution fails to 
properly prepare for or administer a service. Examples of 
how this could arise are: (1) If significant staff training 
is required in order to competently offer the service, but 
is not contemplated or planned; or (2) if there are 
substantial up-front costs in setting up a new service that 
may not be recouped. 
Finally, conflict of interest would include any 
conflict that might arise between the interests of the 
institution and those of the recipient as a result of 
offering the service. An example would be the conflict that 
could arise when, as part of the farm business consulting 
service, an institution employee suggests a management 
strategy that requires the recipient to borrow more money. 
If risks were identified in any of these areas but some 
modification could eliminate, minimize, or control them, the 
service could be added to the list with special conditions 
or institutional restrictions. In addition, in order to 
better evaluate risk areas, a service could be placed on the 
list subject to the condition that it only be offered on a 
pilot basis by one or more institutions. If such risks 
could not be minimized to a degree that would make the 
service appropriate for System institutions to provide, 
approval to provide the service would be denied. In 
considering the risks associated with a proposed new 
service, the FCA would evaluate the risks as they pertain to 
any System institution or the System as a whole. Program 
weaknesses would be addressed through the examination or 
enforcement functions of the FCA. 
In considering the agency's role in reviewing proposed 
related services, the FCA considered a range of options, 
including the current prior approval approach and the 
proposal by the PPC work group. Under the PPC's proposal, 
institutions would notify the FCA of their intent to offer 
an existing or new related service program. If the FCA did 
not object within specified time periods, the institution 
could offer the service. Although this suggestion would 
reduce the current regulatory burden, the FCA believes that 
because it would require every institution to submit a 
program proposal to the FCA, it would still be more 
burdensome than necessary. The FCA proposes instead to 
evaluate each new service only once. If an institution 
concludes that the service meets the criteria for 
authorization, it could then offer such service once a 
feasibility analysis was prepared in accordance with the 
regulatory requirements. The FCA believes this proposed 
process will reduce time needed for staff review and the 
regulatory burden placed on System institutions, while 
appropriately minimizing the risks of offering unauthorized 
or unsafe and unsound services. 


4. Section 618.8015_Policy Guidelines 


Existing  618.8000(b) authorizes district and bank 
boards to establish policies pertaining to related service 
programs. This section also includes general policy 
guidelines and requires that the FCA approve the policies. 
The FCA proposes to amend existing  618.8000(b) primarily 
by eliminating the requirements that a district bank 
establish a single related services policy for the district 
and that the FCA approve these policies. 
Section 618.8015 of the proposed regulation would 
require that each System institution offering related 
services formulate policies pertaining to the development, 
implementation, marketing, and offering of related services. 
This change would reduce the supervisory burden of the 
funding bank and appropriately place the responsibility on 
the offering institutions. This change would not, however, 
absolve the funding bank from providing the necessary 
guidance on districtwide issues, such as its approach for 
verifying the feasibility analyses of associations' related 
service programs. 
Proposed  618.8015 would also eliminate the 
requirement that the FCA approve district and bank policies. 
This proposed change is consistent with the FCA's intent to 
remove unnecessary prior approval functions and rely instead 
on the examination function to evaluate compliance, 
performance, and safety and soundness. 
The FCA proposes to modify the existing guidance for 
the content of the related services policy. The proposed 
regulation would require the policy to include clearly 
stated purposes, objectives, and operating parameters. In 
addition, the proposed regulation would require institutions 
to link each related service program it offers to its 
business plan and long-term strategic goals. Proposed 
 618.8015(b) and (c) retain the requirements in existing 
 618.8000(b)(1) and (2) that all related services be 
offered on an optional basis and that all fees associated 
with a service be identified and disclosed to the recipient. 
The FCA proposes to eliminate as unnecessary the 
specific requirements in existing  618.8000(b)(4) that 
banks and associations maintain detailed records because 
other regulatory provisions exist that require maintaining 
such records in order to comply with the institutions' 
internal control policies.

The FCA also proposes to eliminate the requirement in 
existing  618.8000(b)(4) that the bank annually review each service offered in the district. This change was
also supported by the PPC work group and in the FRS petition. As discussed above, the FCA has concluded that the emphasis
on accountability is at the institution level, and regularly reviewing an activity and reporting the results to the
board should be a standard part of managing an institution. 



5. Section 618.8020_Feasibility Requirements 



Sections 1.12, 2.5, 2.12, and 3.7 of the Act authorize FCBs, ACBs, PCAs, ACAs, FLBAs, FLCAs and BCs, respectively,
to offer related services. Each section specifies that there be a determination of feasibility before a related service
is offered. The FCA believes that the ultimate accountability and responsibility in offering related services rests
with the institution offering the service. Therefore, although the funding bank has a statutory role to determine
that related services are feasible, each offering institution should document the feasibility of providing a related
service. 

Neither the statute nor the existing regulation defines feasibility. Under the existing approval process for related
service programs, a definition is not critical because the feasibility determination is centralized at the bank
level and reviewed by the FCA in the prior approval process. However, the proposed rule moves to a post-review environment,
which creates a need to specify the feasibility criteria. 

Section 618.8020 of the proposed regulation would enumerate minimum feasibility requirements. The FCA proposes
that the feasibility analysis include support that a proposed related service is an FCA-authorized service. (If
a proposed service is not authorized, the institution can request that it be authorized via the process outlined in
 618.8010(b).) The feasibility analysis would also include an overall cost/benefit analysis based on the
evaluation of the market, pricing, competition, expected financial returns, operational risks, financial liability,
and conflicts of interest. This would also include an analysis to show that the service is compatible with the offering
institution's business plan and strategic goals. These requirements should not be interpreted as all-encompassing,
and in many instances there will be other issues that will also need to be addressed. 



6. Section 618.8025_Feasibility Reviews 



Section 2.5 of the Act authorizes a PCA to offer related services as determined feasible by the board of directors of
the FCB. Section 2.12(15) of the Act authorizes an FLBA to offer related services that it determines, with FCB approval,
are feasible. Therefore, the FCB has a statutory role in the determination of whether a related service program is
feasible for an association to offer. Historically, the FCB has conducted reviews of each related service, at least
annually, at both the bank and association level. Additionally, existing  618.8000(a)(5) requires that the
bank board annually determine the financial feasibility of its related service programs. 

As stated in the preceding discussion of proposed  618.8020, the FCA believes the determination of feasibility
of a proposed program should ultimately be the responsibility of the offering institution. Nonetheless, the funding
bank does have a statutory responsibility. Therefore, the FCA proposes in  618.8025 to require the funding
bank to verify that the association performed the feasibility analysis pursuant to  618.8020. It would permit
the funding bank to prevent the offering of the related service only if it determines that the feasibility analysis
is inadequate or that the analysis fails to indicate that the program can be feasibly provided by the association.
Any conclusion by the bank that the feasibility analysis is incomplete or fails to demonstrate the program's feasibility
must be fully supported and communicated to the association in writing within 60 days of its submission to the bank.


The FCA concludes that this approach creates the least amount of burden, maintains the funding bank's statutory role,
supports the bank's ability to supervise its credit, and permits greater association autonomy. The FRS petitioners
suggested making the bank's determination of feasibility automatic, in the absence of extraordinary circumstances,
for those proposed services that the FCA has authorized. The FCA does not agree that either the bank's or association's
determination of feasibility should be automatic. The FCA's determination of whether a particular service should
be authorized is fundamentally different from the determination of whether an individual service program is feasible
for a given association. Moreover, the FCA does not accept the premise that the funding bank could fulfill its statutory
role by making an automatic assumption of feasibility for those services that the FCA has already authorized.

7. Section 618.8030_Out-of-territory Related 
Services 



Proposed  618.8030 would allow a System bank or 
association to offer a related service outside of its 
chartered lending territory. It would replace guidance 
provided in FCA Bookletter 366-OE, which implemented the FCA 
Board policy statement concerning the offering of 
out-of-territory related services (58 FR 36410, July 2, 
1993). Presently, an institution is required to obtain the 
concurrence of all System banks or associations serving the 
territory before it can offer its related services. The 
other chief conditions are: (1) A common program 
requirement within a district (associated with existing 
related service regulations); and (2) a requirement that 
the service provided within the institution's territory 
remain as the primary component of its services. 

The proposed regulation eliminates the common program 
feature in  618.8000(b)(3) because the FCA recognizes that 
this feature reflects an out-of-date system structure. In 
addition, the PPC work group and FRS petition both requested 
that the FCA drop the common program requirement in favor of 
greater flexibility. 

The requirement that related services provided within 
an institution's own territory remain the institution's 
primary service component is not part of the proposed 
regulation. The FCA concludes that as long as an 
institution is able to adequately serve the needs of 
eligible borrowers in its chartered territory, there should 
not be a limit on how much business it conducts 
out of its territory. The FCA agrees with a comment made by 
the PPC work group that services can have a positive effect 
on an institution's credit program by providing diversity 
and an additional income stream. 

Under the proposed regulation, the requirement for 
consent before offering related services out-of-territory 
would be modified. In proposed  618.8030(a), an 
institution would be required to obtain the concurrence of 
at least one institution chartered to service that outside 
territory. The FCA believes it is important to preserve the 
rights of all System institutions within their chartered 
territories. The fact that some territories overlap is 
irrelevant to the right of an institution to determine what 
services it wishes to provide in its own territory. Thus, 
the FCA believes that if a bank or association wishes to 
make a related service available to its customers, it can 
arrange with any other System institution to provide the 
service in its chartered territory without any other 
institution's consent. This outcome is no different from 
the current situation in which an institution can offer a 
service itself or it can contract with a non-System entity 
to offer the service; in either case, the institution is not 
required to obtain the consent of any other institution. 

The proposed regulation also requires that for services 
provided out of its territory, the providing institution 
must meet all of the requirements of subparts A and B of 
part 618, including adopting a related services policy and 
determining feasibility. It should be noted that if the 
providing institution is expanding an existing program, a 
new feasibility analysis and bank verification would be 
needed. An institution that gives consent to another bank 
or association to provide a related service in its chartered 
territory need must meet the requirements of proposed 
 618.8030, but need not comply with the other requirements 
of subparts A and B, unless the program consented to imposes 
on the consenting institution a financial obligation, in 
which case the consenting institution must comply with 
  618.8015, 618.8020, and 618.8025. 

Another aspect to the out-of-territory issue is whether 
an institution that initially concurs in another institution 
providing related service programs in its territory can 
later withdraw its approval. One example could be a 
situation in which an institution has approved a service in 
its territory because that service is not currently offered, 
but later that institution wishes to begin exclusively 
offering the same service. The FCA believes that by 
entering into a written agreement with specific terms, 
conditions, and timeframes, the consenting institution can 
best protect its interests. One example could be that the 
institutions enter into a formal contractual arrangement 
that provides for termination by either party with proper 
notice. 



B. Subpart B_Member Insurance 



1. Section 618.8040_Authorized Insurance Services, 
Debtor/Creditor Relationship 



The PPC work group and the Insurance petition raised 
questions concerning the authority in section 4.29 of the 
Act for banks (excluding banks for cooperatives) and 
associations to provide to members and borrowers credit or 
term life and credit disability insurance appropriate to 
protect the loan commitment. When it enacted section 4.29 
of the Act, Congress stated that for System institutions to 
``sell credit or term life, there must be a debtor-creditor 
relationship and the amount of insurance should be 
appropriate to protect but not exceed the total loan 
commitment to the member-borrower.''
 Therefore, current 
regulations require that a debtor-creditor relationship 
exist for the sale of credit or term life and credit 
disability insurance. Although the Insurance petition 
requested that this requirement be removed from the 
regulations, the FCA concludes that this is a statutory 
requirement, not only a regulatory requirement. 





Questions have also arisen as to whether the 
debtor-creditor relationship must exist with the institution 
offering credit or term life or credit disability insurance. 
For example, in situations in which related services may be 
offered out-of-territory, a borrower may have a 
debtor-creditor relationship with the bank or association in 
the territory, but an out-of-territory association may be 
offering the insurance. The FCA interprets section 4.29 of 
the Act and its legislative history to mean that there must 
be a borrowing relationship with a System institution, but 
not necessarily with the institution offering the service. 
Therefore, as long as the recipient of credit or term life 
or credit disability insurance has a debtor-creditor 
relationship with a bank or association of the System, the 
insurance can be offered by any institution authorized to 
provide insurance to that recipient. Accordingly, in 
proposed  618.8040(b)(1), the FCA would add a statement 
that the debtor-creditor relationship does not necessarily 
have to be with the offering institution.

<DOCNO> FR941031-1-00013 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941031-1-00002 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Another question related to the debtor-creditor 
requirement was raised by the PPC work group. The issue 
involves situations in which a borrower relies upon a 
spouse's income for repayment of the loan and wishes to 
purchase credit or term life and disability insurance on the 
spouse, but the spouse is not a co-maker of the loan. The 
FCA considers it to be unlikely that a spouse who 
significantly contributes to the loan's repayment would not 
have signed the note. Nevertheless, because spouses may 
have contractual liability for the debt by operation of 
state law, the proposed regulation would permit the sale of 
credit insurance on a borrower's spouse. As with all other 
situations, the amount of insurance offered could not exceed 
the total amount of the loan commitment to the borrower. 

The FCA's review of the legislative history on the 
enactment of section 4.29 of the Act indicates that a 
debtor-creditor relationship is not necessary for System 
institutions to provide other insurance necessary to protect 
the member's farm or aquatic unit, such as hail and 
multiple-peril crop insurance.
 Accordingly, this 
restriction has been deleted in the proposed regulation. 
Purchasers of other insurance would, however, have to be 
either members or borrowers. Proposed  618.8040(b)(2) 
would define members (for subpart B only) to include a 
stockholder or participation certificate holder who acquired 
stock or participation certificates to obtain a loan, for 
investment purposes, or to qualify for other services of the 
association or bank. Therefore, the reference in existing 
 618.8030(b)(1) to eligibility for landlords of tenants and 
tenants of landlords having a debtor-creditor relationship 
would be removed as unnecessary. Such tenants or landlords 
would be eligible to receive hail or multiple-peril crop 
insurance upon becoming members of a bank or association. 
Similar to the debtor-creditor requirement in proposed 
 618.8040(b)(1), the purchaser of other types of insurance 
does not have be to a borrower or member of the offering 
bank or association, but can be a borrower or member of any 
System bank or association. 





2. Section 618.8040(b)(5)_Incentive Compensation for 
Sale of Insurance 



Section 618.8040(b)(5) is proposed to be amended to 
clarify how incentive compensation for sale of insurance may 
be provided to employees. The existing regulation states 
that ``Bank or association personnel shall not benefit, 
directly or indirectly, from insurance sales by receipt of 
commissions, gifts, or incentive awards.'' The proposed 
regulations would allow incentive compensation for sale of 
insurance with some limitations. 

The prohibition of compensation for insurance sales was 
included in the existing regulation to prevent conflicts of 
interest between System employees and borrowers and to 
implement the requirement in section 4.29 of the Act that 
borrowers not be coerced into buying insurance from System 
institutions. The FCA believes that unrestricted 
compensation of loan officers or other employees, based on 
volume of insurance sales can lead to abusive, high-pressure 
sales practices. In addition, other Federal financial 
regulators agree and continue to place limitations on 
employee compensation derived from insurance sales. At the 
same time, however, the FCA recognizes that if sale of 
insurance is a part of an employee's regular job, incentive 
compensation should be allowed to some extent. 
Additionally, the FCA is aware that some institutions have 
instituted bonus pools that are shared by employees who may 
not be involved in selling insurance. The proposed 
regulation accommodates those arrangements as well. 

The issue of employee compensation for insurance sales 
was raised in 1992 when it became known that some 
institutions had employee compensation programs that allowed 
direct compensation for insurance sales. On May 20, 1992, 
the FCA issued Bookletter 327-OE, which recognized that some 
System employees were compensated for insurance sales in one 
of two ways: (1) Incentive bonuses were directly tied to 
the insurance sales generated by each employee; or (2) 
incentive bonuses were tied in some way to the net income of 
the institution, part of which was derived from sales of 
insurance. The bookletter stated that compensation that is 
tied directly to insurance sales is not in compliance with 
current regulations. However, the FCA did not intend to 
apply that determination to the second type of plan where 
compensation is tied to the net income of an institution. 
Since that bookletter was issued, the FCA has received a 
number of inquiries from System institutions requesting 
clarification on whether specific compensation plans would 
be considered acceptable. In addition, the PPC work group 
requested that the FCA consider the issue of compensation 
for sale of insurance as part of its project to amend 
 618.8000. 

Proposed  618.8040(b)(6) allows for incentive 
compensation for sale of insurance in line with what is 
currently allowed in the commercial banking industry. In 
any single year, the amount of incentive compensation 
attributable to insurance sales cannot exceed 5 percent of 
the recipient's annual base salary. This limitation applies 
to individual incentive plans, as well as bonus pools or any 
other type of plan. If an employee participates in both an 
individual plan and some form of bonus pool, the amount of 
incentive compensation attributable to sale of insurance 
received from each plan must be aggregated for purposes of 
determining whether it meets the 5-percent limitation.

<TEXT>
 

It should be noted that insurance is the only related service for which there is any restriction on employee incentive
compensation. At this time, the FCA has concluded that there is no need for similar limitations on other related services
because those services are not as directly linked to the loan-making process. Furthermore, customers may be able
to more readily evaluate the benefit of other related services. 



3. Section 618.8040_Other Regulatory Changes 



The requirement in  618.8040(b)(10) that the bank review annually the individual association member insurance
services would be eliminated. This provision was originally included to be consistent with other related service
requirements in subpart A, which are now also to be removed. The proposed rule removes the annual review requirement
from both subparts A and B. As previously discussed, the FCA believes the review function is most appropriately handled
at the level of the institution offering the program. The FCA expects that each institution offering insurance will
review its program periodically to determine that it is operating in a safe and sound manner and that it remains consistent
with the institution's business plan and long-term strategic goals. 

In order to reflect the creation of Agricultural Credit Banks, the FCA clarifies that under proposed  618.8040(a)
ACBs may provide insurance to the persons eligible to borrow as identified in titles I and II of the Act and corresponding
regulations. This would not be a change from the existing regulations. 

Technical changes were also made to parts 611 and 620 in order to conform with the proposed regulatory changes in part
618, subparts A and B.

Subpart A_Related Services 



 618.8000 



Definitions. 



For the purposes of this subpart, the following definitions shall apply: 

(a) 

Program

 means the method or procedures used to deliver a related service. This distinguishes the particulars of how a related
service will be provided from the type of activity or concept. 

(b) 

Related service

 means any service or activity provided by a System bank or association that pertains to the recipient's on-farm, aquatic,
or cooperative operations, including control of related financial matters. The term ``related service'' includes,
but is not limited to, technical assistance, financial assistance, financially related services and insurance,
but does not include lending or leasing activities. 

(c) 

System banks and associations

 means Farm Credit Banks, agricultural credit banks, banks for cooperatives, agricultural credit associations,
production credit associations, Federal land bank associations and Federal land credit associations. 



 618.8005 



Eligibility. 



(a) Farm Credit Banks and associations may offer related services to persons eligible to borrow as defined in   613.3010,
613.3020(a)(1), (a)(2), (b), and 613.3045 of this chapter. 

(b) Banks for cooperatives may offer related services to entities eligible to borrow as defined in   613.3110
and 613.3120 of this chapter. 

(c) Agricultural credit banks may offer related services appropriate to on-farm and aquatic operations to the persons
eligible to borrow specified in paragraph (a) of this section and may offer related services appropriate to cooperative
operations of entities eligible to borrow as specified in paragraph (b) of this section. 

(d) System banks and associations may provide related services to recipients that do not otherwise meet the requirements
of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section in connection with loan applications, loan servicing, and other transactions
between these recipients and persons eligible to borrow as defined in paragraphs (a), (b), or (c) of this section,
as long as the service provided is a part of or pertains to the transaction between the parties. Such services include,
but are not limited to, fee appraisals of agricultural assets performed for the Farmers Home Administration, commercial
banks and other lenders. 



 618.8010 



Related services authorization process. 



(a) 

Authorities.

 (1) The Farm Credit Administration (FCA) shall authorize related services that meet the criteria specified in this
regulation. System banks and associations may only offer related services that are authorized by the FCA. 

(b) 

New service proposals.

 (1) A System bank or association that wishes to offer a related service that the FCA has not previously authorized must
submit to the FCA, in writing, a proposal that includes a description of the service, how it meets the regulatory definition
of ``related services'' in  618.8000(b), and the risk analysis cited in  618.8020(b)(3). The FCA will
evaluate the proposed service based on the information submitted, and may also consider whether there are extenuating
circumstances or other compelling reasons that justify the proposed service or support a determination that the
service is not authorized. This evaluation will focus primarily on Systemwide issues rather than on institution
or program-specific factors. 

(2) When authorizing a proposed related service, at its discretion, the FCA may impose special conditions or limitations
on any program to offer a related service. 

(3) At its discretion the FCA may, during its evaluation of a proposed related service, publish the proposed related
service in the 

Federal Register

 for public comment. 

(4) Within 60 days of the FCA receiving a completed proposal, including any additional information the FCA may require,
the FCA will act on the request. The FCA shall approve the request, deny the request, or notify the requesting institution
that the service shall be published for public comment in the 

Federal Register

. For good cause and prior to the expiration of the 60 days, the FCA may extend this period for an additional 60 days. 

(5) The FCA shall notify all System banks and associations by bookletter or other means each time it determines whether
a proposed related service is or is not authorized. 

(c) 

Previously authorized services.

 (1) For related services that have been authorized by the FCA, any System bank or association may develop a program
and subsequently offer the related service to eligible recipients, subject to any special conditions or institutional
limits placed by the FCA. These programs will be subject to review and evaluation during the examination process.


(2) The FCA shall make available to all Farm Credit institutions a list of such related services (``related services
list'' or ``list'') and will update it in accordance with paragraph (b)(5) of this section. The list will contain the
following: 

(i) A description of each related service; 

(ii) Identification of any special conditions on how the related service may be offered; and 

(iii) The types of institutions authorized to offer each type of related service. 

(3) Within 30 days of implementing a related service program already on the list, the System bank or association must
notify the FCA Office of Examination field office responsible for examining that institution.

 618.8015 

Policy guidelines. 


(a) The board of directors of each institution 
providing related services shall adopt a policy addressing 
related services. The policy should include clearly stated 
purposes, objectives, and operating parameters for offering 
related services and a requirement that each service offered 
be consistent with the institution's business plan and 
long-term strategic goals. Such policy should also be 
subject to review under the institution's internal control 
policy. 

(b) All related services must be offered to 
recipients on an optional basis. If the institution 
requires a related service as a condition to borrow, it must 
inform the recipient that the related service can be 
obtained from the institution or from any other person or 
entity offering the same or similar related services. 

(c) All fees for related services shall be separately 
identified from loan interest charges and disclosed to the 
recipient of the service. 



 618.8020 

Feasibility requirements. 



For every related service program an institution 
provides, it must document program feasibility. The 
feasibility analysis shall include the following: 

(a) Support for the determination that the related 
service is authorized; and 

(b) An overall cost-benefit analysis of offering the 
program that demonstrates its feasibility, taking into 
consideration the following items: 

(1) An analysis of how the program relates to or 
promotes the institution's business plan and strategic 
goals; 

(2) An analysis of the expected financial returns of 
the program which, at a minimum, must include an evaluation 
of market, pricing, competition issues, and whether the 
program would be expected to make a profit or if its purpose 
is to be combined with a broader objective aimed at 
contributing to the overall financial health of the 
institution or the individual borrower; and 

(3) An analysis of the risk in the program, 
including: 

(i) An evaluation of the operational costs and risks 
involved in offering the program, such as management and 
personnel requirements, training requirements, and capital 
outlays; 

(ii) An evaluation of the financial liability that 
may be incurred as a result of offering the program and any 
insurance or other measures that are necessary to minimize 
these risks; and 

(iii) An evaluation of the conflicts of interest, 
whether real or perceived, that may arise as a result of 
offering the program and any steps that are necessary to 
reduce these conflicts. 



 618.8025 

Feasibility reviews. 



Prior to an association offering a related service 
program for the first time, the board of directors of the 
funding bank must verify that the association has performed 
a feasibility analysis pursuant to  618.8020. The bank's 
review is limited to a determination that the feasibility 
analysis is complete and that the analysis establishes that 
it is feasible for the association to provide the program. 
Any conclusion by the bank that the feasibility analysis is 
incomplete or fails to demonstrate the program's feasibility 
must be fully supported and communicated to the association 
in writing within 60 days of its submission to the bank. 



 618.8030 

Out-of-territory related services. 



System banks and associations may offer related 
services outside their chartered territories subject to the 
following condition. Any System bank or association 
desiring to offer related services outside its chartered 
territory must obtain the consent of at least one 
institution chartered to serve the territory in which the 
related service is to be provided. Such consent shall be in 
the form of a written agreement with specific terms and 
conditions, including timeframes. 

(a) The providing institution must fulfill all 
requirements of subparts A and B of this part 618.

(b) An institution that consents to another bank or 
association providing a related service in its chartered 
territory must meet the requirements of this section, but 
need not comply with the other requirements of subparts A 
and B of this part 618, unless the program consented to imposes a financial 
obligation on the consenting institution. In such cases, 
the consenting institution must comply with   618.8015, 
618.8020 and 618.8025.

Subpart B_Member Insurance 


 618.8040 

Authorized insurance services. 


* * * * * 



(b) Bank and association board policies governing the 
provision of member insurance programs shall be established 
within the following general guidelines: 

(1) A System bank or association may provide credit 
or term-life or credit-disability insurance only to persons 
who have a loan or lease with a System bank or association. 
The loan or lease does not necessarily have to be with the 
institution providing the insurance. Term-life insurance 
coverage may continue after the loan has been repaid or the 
lease terminated, provided the member can reasonably be 
expected to borrow again within 2 years, and provided the 
continuation of insurance is not contrary to state law. 

(2) A debtor-creditor relationship is not required 
for the sale of other insurance specified in paragraph (a) 
of this section, as long as purchasers are members or 
borrowers of a System bank or association. For the purposes 
of this section, ``member'' means a stockholder or 
participation certificate holder who acquired stock or 
participation certificates to obtain a loan, for investment 
purposes, or to qualify for other services of the 
association or bank. 


* * * * * 



(6) Bank or association personnel shall not benefit 
from insurance sales by receipt of commissions or gifts from 
underwriting insurance companies. However, an employee may 
participate in an institution's incentive plan under which 
incentive compensation is provided for the sale of 
insurance. In any single year, such compensation shall not 
exceed an amount equivalent to more than 5 percent of the 
recipient's annual base salary.

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes to supersede 
Airworthiness Directive (AD) 83-18-03, which currently 
requires repetitively inspecting the tailplane outboard 
hinge assembly for cracks on certain de Havilland DHC-6 
series airplanes, and replacing any cracked part. The 
Federal Aviation Administration's policy on aging 
commuter-class aircraft is to eliminate, or in certain 
instances, reduce the number of certain repetitive 
short-interval inspections when improved parts or 
modifications are available. The proposed action would 
require eventually modifying the tailplane outboard 
hinge arm and tailplane hinge plate as terminating 
action for the currently required repetitive 
inspections. The actions specified in the proposed AD 
are intended to prevent tailplane failure caused by 
cracks in either the outboard hinge arm or the hinge 
plate.

Availability of NPRMs 


Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by 
submitting a request to the FAA, Central Region, Office 
of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules 
Docket No. 91-CE-46-AD, Room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, 
Kansas City, Missouri 64106. 


Discussion 


The FAA has determined that reliance on critical 
repetitive inspections on aging commuter-class 
airplanes carries an unnecessary safety risk when a 
design change exists that could eliminate, or in 
certain instances, reduce the number of those critical 
inspections. In determining what inspections are 
critical, the FAA considers (1) the safety consequences 
of the airplane if the known problem is not detected by 
the inspection; (2) the reliability of the inspection 
such as the probability of not detecting the known 
problem; (3) whether the inspection area is difficult 
to access; and (4) the possibility of damage to an 
adjacent structure as a result of the problem. 
These factors have led the FAA to establish an 
aging 
commuter-class aircraft policy that requires 
incorporating a known design change when it could 
replace a critical repetitive inspection. With this 
policy in mind, the FAA recently conducted a review of 
existing AD's that apply to de Havilland DHC-6 series 
airplanes. Assisting the FAA in this review were (1) 
Transport Canada, which is the airworthiness authority 
for Canada; (2) de Havilland, Inc.; (3) the Regional 
Airlines Association (RAA); and (4) several U.S. and 
foreign operators of the affected airplanes. 
From this review, the FAA has identified AD 83-18-
03, Amendment 39-1658, as one that should be superseded 
with a new AD that would eliminate short-interval and 
critical repetitive inspections. AD 83-18-03 currently 
requires repetitively inspecting the tailplane outboard 
hinge assembly for cracks on certain de Havilland DHC-6 
series airplanes, and replacing any cracked part. 
De Havilland, Inc. (formerly Boeing of Canada, 
Ltd.) has issued Service Bulletin (SB) No. 6/421, 
Revision B, dated November 11, 1983. This service 
bulletin specifies procedures for replacing the 
tailplane outboard hinge arm and tailplane hinge plate 
with parts of improved design. This replacement is 
known as Modification No. 6/1799. 
As a result of the previously discussed AD review, 
Transport Canada considers Modification 6/1799 
mandatory and has issued Transport Canada AD CF-83-11 
in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these 
airplanes in Canada.

This airplane model is manufactured in Canada and 
is type certificated for operation in the United States 
under the provisions of Section 21.29 of the Federal 
Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable 
bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this 
bilateral airworthiness agreement, Transport Canada has 
kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. 
Based on its aging commuter-class aircraft policy 
and after reviewing all available information including 
that received from Transport Canada, the FAA has 
determined that AD action should be taken to eventually 
eliminate the repetitive short-interval inspections 
required by AD 83-18-03, and to prevent tailplane 
failure caused by cracks in either the outboard hinge 
arm or the hinge plate. 
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that 
is likely to exist or develop in other de Havilland DHC-6 series airplanes of the same type design, the 
proposed AD would supersede AD 83-18-03 with a new AD 
that would (1) initially retain the requirement of 
repetitively inspecting the tailplane outboard hinge 
assembly for cracks, and replacing any cracked part; 
and (2) eventually require modifying the tailplane 
outboard hinge arm and tailplane hinge plate with parts 
of improved design (Modification No. 1799) as 
terminating action for the currently required 
repetitive inspections. The proposed actions would be 
accomplished in accordance with de Havilland SB No. 
6/421, Revision B, dated November 11, 1983. 
The FAA estimates that 141 airplanes in the U.S. 
registry would be affected by the proposed AD, that it 
would take approximately 35 workhours per airplane to 
accomplish the proposed action, and that the average 
labor rate is approximately $60 an hour. Parts cost 
approximately $4,400 per airplane. Based on these 
figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on 
U.S. operators is estimated to be $916,500. This 
figure is based on the assumption that no affected 
airplane owner/operator has accomplished the proposed 
action. 
The intent of the FAA's aging commuter airplane 
program is to ensure safe operation of commuter-class 
airplanes that are in commercial service without 
adversely impacting private operators. Of the 
approximately 141 airplanes in the U.S. registry that 
would be affected by the proposed AD, the FAA has 
determined that approximately 40 percent are operated 
in scheduled passenger service. A significant number 
of the remaining 60 percent are operated in other forms 
of air transportation such as air cargo and air taxi. 
The proposed AD allows 2,400 hours time-in-service 
(TIS) before mandatory accomplishment of the design 
modification. The average utilization of the fleet for 
those airplanes in commercial commuter service is 
approximately 25 to 50 hours TIS per week. Based on 
these figures, operators of commuter-class airplanes 
involved in commercial operation would have to 
accomplish the proposed modification within 12 to 24 
calendar months after the proposed AD would become 
effective. For private owners, who typically operate 
between 100 to 200 hours TIS per year, this would allow 
12 to 24 years before the proposed modification would 
be mandatory. 
The following paragraphs present cost scenarios 
for airplanes where no cracks are found and where 
cracks are found, utilizing an average remaining 
airplane life of 15 years and an average annual 
utilization rate of 1,600 hours TIS. A copy of the 
full Cost Analysis and Regulatory Flexibility 
Determination for the proposed action may be 
examined at the FAA, Central Region, Office of the 
Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 
91-CE-46-AD, Room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas 
City, Missouri. 
 No Cracks Scenario: Under the provisions of AD 
83-18-03, an owner/operator of a de Havilland DHC-6 
series airplane in scheduled service who operates an 
average of 1,600 hours TIS annually would inspect every 
1,200 hours TIS. This would amount to a remaining 
airplane life (estimated 15 years) amount of $4,769; 
this figure is based on the assumption that no cracks 
are found during the inspections. The proposed AD 
would incur the same 1,200-hour TIS inspection until 
2,400 hours TIS where the operator would have to 
replace the tailplane outboard hinge arm assembly 
(eliminating the need for further repetitive 
inspections), which would result in a present value 
cost of $6,574. The incremental cost of the proposed 
AD for such an airplane would be $1,805 ($6,574^$4,769) or $1,309 annualized over the 1.5 years it 
would take to accumulate 2,400 hours TIS. An owner of 
a general aviation airplane who operates 800 hours TIS 
annually without finding any cracks during the 1,200-hour TIS inspections would incur a present value 
incremental cost of $3,843 ($5,990^$2,507). This 
would amount to a per year amount of $1,327 over the 
three years it would take to accumulate 2,400 hours 
TIS. 
 Cracks Found Scenario: Under the provisions of 
AD 83-18-03, an owner/operator of a de Havilland DHC-6 
series airplane who found cracks during an inspection 
would have to repair the crack prior to further flight 
and resume inspections every 1,200 hours TIS. The 
proposed AD would require immediate replacement of the 
arm assembly if cracks were found as terminating action 
for the repetitive inspection requirement. The repair 
cost is the same as the replacement except that the 
repair does not terminate the inspection requirement. 
For this reason, the proposed AD would result in 
present-day cost savings, which would continue to grow 
over the remaining life of the airplane since 
repetitive inspections would not be required. Using 
the assumed 15-year remaining life, the cost savings 
would be $4,409 for scheduled service airplane 
owners/operators and $2,149 for general aviation 
airplane owners/operators.

The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was 
enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are 
not unnecessarily or disproportionally burdened by 
government regulations. The RFA requires government 
agencies to determine whether rules would have a 
``significant economic impact on a substantial number of 
small entities,'' and, in cases where they would, 
conduct a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis in which 
alternatives to the rule are considered. FAA Order 
2100.14A, Regulatory Flexibility Criteria and Guidance, 
outlines FAA procedures and criteria for complying with 
the RFA. Small entities are defined as small 
businesses and small not-for-profit organizations that 
are independently owned and operated or airports 
operated by small governmental jurisdictions. A 
``substantial number'' is defined as a number that is not 
less than 11 and that is more than one-third of the 
small entities subject to a proposed rule, or any 
number of small entities judged to be substantial by 
the rulemaking official. A ``significant economic 
impact'' is defined by an annualized net compliance 
cost, adjusted for inflation, which is greater than a 
threshold cost level for defined entity types. FAA 
Order 2100.14A sets the size threshold for 
small entities operating aircraft for hire at 9 
aircraft owned and the annualized cost thresholds, 
adjusted to 1994 dollars, at $69,000 for scheduled 
operators and $4,850 for unscheduled operators. 
Of the 141 U.S.-registered airplanes affected by 
the proposed AD, 6 airplanes are owned by the federal 
government. Of the other 135, one business owns 26 
airplanes, one business owns 9 airplanes, one business 
owns 8 airplanes, 1 business owns 7 airplanes, one 
business owns 4 airplanes, two businesses own 3 
airplanes each, thirteen business own 2 airplanes each, 
and forty-nine businesses each own 1 airplane. 

Because the FAA has no readily available means of 
obtaining data on sizes of these entities, the 
economic analysis for the proposed AD utilizes the 
worst case scenario using the lower annualized cost 
threshold of $4,850 for operators in unscheduled 
service instead of $69,000 for operators in scheduled 
service. With this in mind and based on the above 
ownership distribution, the 64 entities owning 3 or 
fewer airplanes would not experience a ``significant 
economic impact'' as defined by FAA Order 2100.14A. 
Since the remaining five entities do not constitute a 
``substantial number'' as defined in the Order, the 
proposed AD would not have a ``significant economic 
impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' 
The regulations proposed herein would not have 
substantial direct effects on the States, on the 
relationship between the national government and the 
States, or on the distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various levels of 
government. Therefore, in 
accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined 
that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism 
implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism 
Assessment. 
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that 
this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory 
action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a 
``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and 
Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if 
promulgated, will not have a significant economic 
impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number 
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory 
evaluation prepared for this action has been placed in

 Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes to supersede 
Airworthiness Directive (AD) 81-10-11, which currently 
requires repetitively inspecting the elevator root ribs 
for cracks on de Havilland DHC-6 series airplanes, and 
replacing any cracked part. The Federal Aviation 
Administration's policy on aging commuter-class 
aircraft is to eliminate or, in certain instances, 
reduce the number of certain repetitive short-interval 
inspections when improved parts or modifications are 
available. The proposed action would require modifying 
the elevator root rib as terminating action for the 
repetitive inspections that are currently required by 
AD 81-10-11. The actions specified in the proposed AD 
are intended to prevent failure of the elevator root 
rib, which could result in loss of control of the 
airplane.

Availability of NPRMs 



Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Central Region, Office of the Assistant
Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 91-CE-22-AD, Room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City,
Missouri 64106. 



Discussion 



The FAA has determined that reliance on critical repetitive inspections on aging commuter-class airplanes carries
an unnecessary safety risk when a design change exists that could eliminate or, in certain instances, reduce the number
of those critical inspections. In determining what inspections are critical, the FAA considers (1) the safety consequences
of the airplane if the known problem is not detected by the inspection; (2) the reliability of the inspection such as
the probability of not detecting the known problem; (3) whether the inspection area is difficult to access; and (4)
the possibility of damage to an adjacent structure as a result of the problem. 

These factors have led the FAA to establish an aging commuter-class aircraft policy that requires incorporating
a known design change when it could replace a critical repetitive inspection. With this policy in mind, the FAA recently
conducted a review of existing AD's that apply to de Havilland DHC-6 series airplanes. Assisting the FAA in this
review were (1) de Havilland; (2) the Regional Airlines Association (RAA); and (3) several operators of the affected
airplanes. 

From this review, the FAA has identified AD 81-10- 11, Amendment 39-4112, as one that should be superseded
with a new AD that would require a modification that could eliminate the need for short-interval and critical repetitive
inspections. AD 81-10-11 currently requires repetitively inspecting the elevator root rib for cracks
on certain de Havilland DHC-6 series airplanes, and replacing any cracked part. 

De Havilland has issued Service Bulletin (SB) No. 6/399, Revision E, dated May 25, 1984, which specifies procedures
for (1) inspecting the elevator root rib; and (2) modifying the elevator root rib (Modification No. 6/1769). Modification
No. 6/1769 consists of pulling back the elevator skins, removing the torque tube assembly, replacing the root rib
assembly and doubler, replacing the second outboard nose rib, installing a new intercostal, and reinstalling the
torque tube assembly and new skin. 

This airplane model is manufactured in Canada and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the
provisions of  21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, Transport Canada has kept the FAA informed of the
situation described above. 

Based on its aging commuter-class aircraft policy and after reviewing all available information, the FAA has determined
that AD action should be taken to eliminate the repetitive short-interval inspections required by AD 81-10-11,
and to prevent failure of the elevator root rib, which could result in loss of control of the airplane. 

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop in other de Havilland DHC-6 series
airplanes of the same type design that do not have Modification No. 6/1769 incorporated, the proposed AD would supersede
AD 81-10-11 with a new AD that would (1) retain the current requirement of inspecting the elevator root
rib for cracks, and replacing any cracked part; and (2) require modifying the elevator root rib (Modification 6/1769)
as terminating action for the repetitive inspections. The proposed actions would be accomplished in accordance
with de Havilland SB No. 6/399, Revision E, dated May 25, 1984. 

The FAA estimates that 169 airplanes in the U.S. registry would be affected by the proposed AD, that it would take approximately
54 workhours per airplane to accomplish the proposed action, and that the average labor rate is approximately $60
an hour. Parts cost approximately $4,200 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed
AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,257,360. This figure is based upon the assumption that none of the affected
airplane owners/operators have incorporated Modification 6/1769. 

The intent of the FAA's aging commuter airplane program is to ensure safe operation of commuter-class airplanes that
are in commercial service without adversely impacting private operators. Of the approximately 169 airplanes in
the U.S. registry that would be affected by the proposed AD, the FAA has determined that approximately 50 percent are
operated in scheduled passenger service. A significant number of the remaining 50 percent are operated in other forms
of air transportation such as air cargo and air taxi. 

The following paragraphs present cost scenarios for airplanes where no cracks were found and where cracks were found,
utilizing an average remaining airplane life of 15 years and an average annual utilization rate of 1,600 hours TIS.
De Havilland Models DHC-6-100 and DHC-6-200 airplanes have probably already accumulated
15,000 hours TIS; therefore, those airplanes would have 100 hours TIS after the effective date of the AD to incorporate
Modification 6/1769. Some Model DHC-6-300 airplanes have not yet accumulated 15,000 hours TIS. This
analysis is based upon the assumption that these airplanes yet to accumulate 15,000 hours TIS have 10,000 hours TIS
if operated in scheduled service and 5,000 hours TIS if operated in general aviation. A copy of the full Cost Analysis
and Regulatory Flexibility Determination for the proposed action may be examined at the FAA, Central Region, Office
of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 91-CE-22-AD, Room 1558, 601 E. 12th
Street, Kansas City, Missouri. 

 No Cracks Scenario for Models DHC-6-100 and DHC-6-200: These airplanes would be inspected
at 50 hours TIS after the effective date and modified within 100 hours TIS after the effective date. The incremental
present value cost of the proposed AD over that required by AD 81-10-11 is $5,919 for an airplane utilized
in sheduled service, and $6,642 for an airplane utilized in general aviation. 

 No Cracks Scenario for Model DHC-6-300 Airplanes: These airplanes would be inspected at 50 hours
TIS after the effective date and thereafter at 600-hour TIS intervals until the elevator root rib is replaced upon
the accumulation of 15,000 hours TIS. The incremental present value cost of the proposed AD over that required by AD
81-10-11 is $4,962 for an airplane utilized in sheduled service, and $3,099 for an airplane utilized in
general aviation. 

The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily
or disproportionally burdened by government regulations. The RFA requires government agencies to determine whether
rules would have a ``significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities,'' and, in cases where
they would, conduct a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis in which alternatives to the rule are considered. FAA Order
2100.14A, Regulatory Flexibility Criteria and Guidance, outlines FAA procedures and criteria for complying with
the RFA. Small entities are defined as small businesses and small not-for-profit organizations that are independently
owned and operated or airports operated by small governmental jurisdictions. A ``substantial number'' is defined
as a number that is not less than 11 and that is more than one-third of the small entities subject to a proposed rule, or
any number of small entities judged to be substantial by the rulemaking official. A ``significant economic impact''
is defined by an annualized net compliance cost, adjusted for inflation, which is greater than a threshold cost level
for defined entity types. FAA Order 2100.14A sets the size threshold for small entities operating aircraft for hire
at 9 aircraft owned and the annualized cost thresholds, adjusted to 1994 dollars, at $69,000 for scheduled operators
and $4,850 for unscheduled operators.

Of the 169 U.S.-registered airplanes affected by 
the proposed AD, 6 airplanes are owned by the federal 
government. Of the other 163, one business owns 26 
airplanes, two businesses own 9 airplanes each, one 
business owns 8 airplanes, one business owns 7 
airplanes, one business owns 5 airplanes, four 
businesses own 3 airplanes each, sixteen businesses own 
2 airplanes each, and fifty-five businesses own 1 
airplane each. 

Because the FAA has no readily available means of 
obtaining data on the sizes of these entities, the 
economic analysis for the proposed AD utilizes the 
worst case scenario using the lower annualized cost 
threshold of $4,850 for operators in unscheduled 
service instead of $69,000 for operators in scheduled 
service. With this in mind and based on the above 
ownership distribution, the proposed AD could have a 
significant impact on a substantial number of small 
entities. Because of this, the FAA conducted a 
regulatory flexibility analysis. A copy of this 
analysis may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket 
at the location provided under the caption 

ADDRESSES

. 

The regulations proposed herein would not have 
substantial direct effects on the States, on the 
relationship between the national government and the 
States, or on the distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various levels of 
government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive 
Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would 
not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant 
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that 
this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory 
action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a 
``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and 
Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and(3) if 
promulgated, may have a significant economic impact on 
a substantial number of small entities. The FAA has 
conducted an Initial Regulatory Flexibility 
Determination and Analysis and has considered 
alternatives to this proposal that could minimize the 
impact on small entities. A copy of this analysis may 
be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the 
location provided under the caption 

ADDRESSES

. After 
careful consideration, the FAA has determined that the 
proposed action is the best course to achieve the 
safety objective of returning the airplane to its 
original certification level of safety. 

Alternative actions and views are solicited from interested persons 
and will be considered by the FAA in the development of the final rule.

SUMMARY:

 This document proposes to supersede 
Airworthiness Directive (AD) 73-05-03, which currently 
requires repetitively inspecting the rear spar cap for 
cracks on certain de Havilland DHC-6 series airplanes, 
and replacing any cracked part. The Federal Aviation 
Administration's policy on aging commuter-class 
aircraft is to eliminate or, in certain instances, 
reduce the number of certain repetitive short-interval 
inspections when improved parts or modifications are 
available. The proposed action would require modifying 
the wing rear spar support as terminating action for 
the currently required repetitive inspections. The 
actions specified in the proposed AD are intended to 
prevent cracking of the top flange of the wing rear 
spar attachment caps, which could result in loss of 
control of the airplane.

Discussion 


The FAA has determined that reliance on critical 
repetitive inspections on aging commuter-class 
airplanes carries an unnecessary safety risk when a 
design change exists that could eliminate or, in 
certain instances, reduce the number of those critical 
inspections. In determining what inspections are 
critical, the FAA considers (1) the safety consequences 
of the airplane if the known problem is not detected by 
the inspection; (2) the reliability of the inspection 
such as the probability of not detecting the known 
problem; (3) whether the inspection area is difficult 
to access; and (4) the possibility of damage to an 
adjacent structure as a result of the problem.

These factors have led the FAA to establish an 
aging 
commuter-class aircraft policy that requires 
incorporating a known design change when it could 
replace a critical repetitive inspection. With this 
policy in mind, the FAA recently conducted a review of 
existing AD's that apply to de Havilland DHC-6 series 
airplanes. Assisting the FAA in this review were (1) 
de Havilland; (2) the Regional Airlines Association 
(RAA); and (3) several operators of the affected 
airplanes. 

From this review, the FAA has identified AD 73-05-03, Amendment 39-1658, as one that should be superseded

with a new AD that would eliminate short-interval and 
critical repetitive inspections. AD 73-05-03 currently 
requires repetitively inspecting the wing rear spar cap 
for cracks on certain de Havilland DHC-6 series 
airplanes, and replacing any cracked part. 

De Havilland, Inc. (formerly Boeing of Canada, 
Ltd.) has issued Service Bulletin (SB) No. 6/295, 
Revision D, dated December 20, 1991. This service 
bulletin specifies procedures for installing wing rear 
spar attachment caps that are manufactured from a 
material having improved stress corrosion resistant 
properties. This installation is known as Modification 

6/1301. 

As a result of the previously discussed AD review, 
Transport Canada considers Modification 6/1301 
mandatory and has issued Transport Canada AD CF-73-03R1 
in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these 
airplanes in Canada. 

This airplane model is manufactured in Canada and 
is type certificated for operation in the United States 
under the provisions of  21.29 of the Federal 
Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable 
bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this 
bilateral airworthiness agreement, Transport Canada has 
kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. 


Based on its aging commuter-class aircraft policy 
and after reviewing all available information, the FAA 
has determined that AD action should be taken to 
eliminate the repetitive short-interval inspections 
required by AD 73-05-03, Amendment 39-1658, and to 
prevent cracking of the top flange of the wing rear 
spar attachment caps, which could result in loss of 
control of the airplane. 

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that 
is likely to exist or develop in other de Havilland DHC-6 series airplanes of the same type design that do not 
have Modification No. 6/1301 incorporated, the proposed 
AD would supersede AD 73-05-03 with a new AD that would 
(1) initially retain the requirement of repetitively 
inspecting the wing rear spar cap for cracks and 
replacing any cracked part; and (2) eventually require 
installing wing rear spar attachment caps that are 
manufactured from a material having improved stress 
corrosion resistant properties (Modification 6/1301) as 
terminating action for the repetitive inspections. The 
proposed actions would be accomplished in accordance 
with de Havilland SB No. 6/295, Revision D, dated 
December 20, 1991. 


The FAA estimates that 82 airplanes in the U.S. 
registry would be affected by the proposed AD, that it 
would take approximately 22 workhours per airplane to 
accomplish the proposed modification, and that the 
average labor rate is approximately $60 an hour. Parts 
cost approximately $6,350 per airplane. Based on these 
figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on 
U.S. operators is estimated to be $629,432. This 
figure is based upon the assumption that none of the 
affected airplane owners/operators have incorporated 
Modification 6/1301. 


The intent of the FAA's aging commuter airplane 
program is to ensure safe operation of commuter-class 
airplanes that are in commercial service without 
adversely impacting private operators. Of the 
approximately 82 airplanes in the U.S. registry that 
would be affected by the proposed AD, the FAA has 
determined that approximately 45 percent are operated 
in scheduled passenger service. A significant number 
of the remaining 55 percent are operated in other forms 
of air transportation such as air cargo and air taxi. 


The following paragraphs present cost scenarios 
for airplanes where no cracks were found and where 
certain category cracks were found, utilizing an 
average remaining airplane life of 15 years and an 
average annual utilization rate of 1,600 hours TIS. A 
copy of the full Cost Analysis and Regulatory 
Flexibility Determination for the proposed action may 
be examined at the FAA, Central Region, Office of the 
Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 
91-CE-21-AD, Room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas 
City, Missouri. 


 No Cracks Scenario: Under the provisions of AD 
73-05-03, an owner/operator of an affected de Havilland 
DHC-6 series airplane in scheduled service who operates 
an average of 1,600 hours TIS annually would inspect 
every 26 weeks. This would amount to a remaining 
airplane life (estimated 15 years) cost of $14,058; 
this figure is based on the assumption that no cracks 
are found during the inspections. The proposed AD 
would incur the inspection at one 1,200-hour TIS 
interval and then, at 2,400 hours TIS, the operator 
would have to replace the top flange of the wing spar 
attachment caps (eliminating the need for further 
repetitive inspections). This would result in a 
present value cost of $8,331, which would be a present 
value cost savings of $5,727 or $4,154 annualized over 
the 1.5 years it would take to accumulate 2,400 hours 
TIS. An owner of a general aviation airplane who 
operates 800 hours TIS annually without finding any 
cracks during the 1,200-hour TIS inspection would incur 
a present value cost savings of $6,430. This would 
amount to a per year savings of $2,450 over the 1.5 
years it would take to accumulate 2,400 hours TIS. 


 Category I cracks found scenario: These are 
spanwise cracks that are inboard of the third rivet, or 
spanwise cracks that exceed 50 inches, or any chordwise 
cracks: Under the provisions of AD 
73-05-03, an owner/operator who found cracks under this 
scenario would have to immediately repair the cracked 
part and repetitively inspect every 26 weeks. The 
proposed AD would require immediate replacement as 
terminating action for the repetitive inspections, 
which would result in present value compliance costs of 
$8,355. The present value cost savings for this 
scenario would be $6,300 for airplanes in scheduled 
service and $6,295 per general aviation airplane.

 Category II cracks found scenario: These are spanwise cracks that are outboard of the 10th rivet and within
the limits of paragraph (b) of the service bulletin: Under the provisions of AD 73-05-03, an owner/operator
who found cracks under this scenario would have to repetitively inspect every 13 weeks. This would result in present
value compliance costs of $27,625. The proposed AD would require repetitive inspections every 600 hours TIS until
replacement of the top flange of the wing rear spar attachment caps at 2,400 hours TIS as terminating action for the
repetitive inspections. This would result in present value compliance costs of $9,700. Immediate replacement of
the top flange would be more economical; present value costs would be $8,355. The present value cost savings for this
scenario would be $19,272 per airplane in scheduled service and $19,269 per general aviation airplane. 

 Category III cracks found scenario: These are spanwise cracks that are outboard of the 10th rivet and within
the limits of paragraph (c) of the service bulletin: Under the provisions of AD 73-05-03, an owner/operator
who found cracks under this scenario would have to repetitively inspect every 2 weeks. This would result in present
value compliance costs of $175,000. The proposed AD would require repetitive inspections every 100 hours TIS until
replacement of the top flange of the wing rear spar attachment caps at 2,400 hours TIS as terminating action for the
repetitive inspections. This would result in present value compliance costs of $13,965. Immediate replacement
of the top flange would be more economical; present value costs would be $8,355. The present value cost savings for
this scenario would be $166,075 per airplane in scheduled service and $166,784 per general aviation airplane. 

 Category IV cracks found scenario: These are spanwise cracks that are outboard of the 10th rivet and exceed
the limits of paragraph (b) or (c) of the service bulletin. Also included are cracks in the splice plates of the vertical
and horizontal legs of the rear spar or elongated rivet holes: Under the provisions of AD 73-05-03, an owner/operator
who found cracks under this scenario would have to immediately repair any crack and then repetitively inspect every
26 weeks. This would result in present value costs of $14,500. The proposed AD would require immediate crack repair,
an inspection at 1,200 hours TIS, and replacement of the top flange of the wing rear spar attachment caps at 2,400 hours
TIS as terminating action for the repetitive inspections. This would result in present value compliance costs of
$8,929. Immediate replacement of the top flange would be more economical; present value costs would be $8,355. The
present value cost savings for this scenario would be $6,040 per airplane in scheduled service and $6,430 per general
aviation airplane. 

 Category V cracks found scenario: These are spanwise cracks that are between the third and tenth rivet: Under
the provisions of AD 73-05-03, an owner/operator who found cracks under this scenario would have to immediately
repair any crack, repetitively inspect every 2 weeks, replace the top flange of the wing rear spar attachment caps,
and repetitively inspect every 26 weeks. This would result in present value compliance costs of about $30,000. The
proposed AD would require immediate crack repair, repetitive inspections every 50 hours TIS, and replacement of
the top flange of the wing rear spar attachment caps at 2,400 hours TIS as terminating action for the repetitive inspections.
This would result in present value compliance costs of $38,988. Immediate replacement of the top flange would be more
economical; present value costs would be $8,355. The present value cost savings for this scenario would be $19,356
per airplane in scheduled service and $26,367 per general aviation airplane. 

 Category VI cracks found scenario: These are spanwise cracks that have a total length exceeding 30 inches but
not exceeding 50 inches: Under the provisions of AD 73-05-03, an owner/operator who found cracks under
this scenario would have to immediately repair any crack, replace the top flange of the wing rear spar attachment caps
at 26 weeks, and repetitively inspect thereafter every 26 weeks. This results in present value compliance costs of
about $21,200. The proposed AD would require immediate crack repair, repetitive inspections every 600 hours TIS,
and replacement of the top flange of the wing rear spar attachment caps at 2,400 hours TIS as terminating action for
the repetitive inspections. This would result in present value compliance costs of $10,289. Immediate replacement
of the top flange would be more economical; present value costs would be $8,355. The present value cost savings for
this scenario would be $12,707 per airplane in scheduled service and $13,028 per general aviation airplane. 

The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily
or disproportionally burdened by government regulations. The RFA requires government agencies to determine whether
rules would have a ``significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities,'' and, in cases where
they would, conduct a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis in which alternatives to the rule are considered. FAA Order
2100.14A, Regulatory Flexibility Criteria and Guidance, outlines FAA procedures and criteria for complying with
the RFA. Small entities are defined as small businesses and small not-for-profit organizations that are independently
owned and operated or airports operated by small governmental jurisdictions. A ``substantial number'' is defined
as a number that is not less than 11 and that is more than one-third of the small entities subject to a proposed rule, or
any number of small entities judged to be substantial by the rulemaking official. A ``significant economic impact''
is defined by an annualized net compliance cost, adjusted for inflation, which is greater than a threshold cost level
for defined entity types. FAA Order 2100.14A sets the size threshold for small entities operating aircraft for hire
at 9 aircraft owned and the annualized cost thresholds, adjusted to 1994 dollars, at $69,000 for scheduled operators
and $4,850 for unscheduled operators. 

Of the 82 U.S.-registered airplanes affected by the proposed AD, three airplanes are owned by the federal government.
Of the other 79, one business owns 24 airplanes, one business owns 7 airplanes, one business owns 6 airplanes, one business
owns 3 airplanes, 6 businesses own 2 airplanes each, and twenty-seven businesses own 1 airplane each. 

As presented in the crack scenario discussion, replacing the top flange of the wing rear spar attachment caps immediately
or within 2,400 hours TIS is more economical in all scenarios than continuing to repetitively inspect the part for
the life of the airplane. Therefore, the proposed AD would not have a ``significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities.''

The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and(3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Microbial Products of Biotechnology; Proposed Regulation Under the Toxic Substances Control Act; Extension of
Comment Period



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Extension of comment period.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

EPA is extending the comment period for a proposed rule under section 5 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA),
to screen microorganisms before they are introduced into commerce. The proposed rule is designed to prevent unreasonable
risk to human health and the environment without imposing unnecessary regulatory burdens on the biotechnology industry.
The proposed regulation describes notification procedures and microorganisms that would be exempt from notification.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In the 

Federal Register

 of September 1, 1994 (59 FR 45526), EPA issued a proposed rule under section 5 of TSCA, TSCA authorizes EPA to regulate
any chemical substance, except for certain substances covered by other Federal agencies. The Act defines chemical
substance broadly enough to cover microorganisms. TSCA section 5 establishes a 90-day process for EPA to screen certain
chemical substances before they are produced. Section 5(a) allows EPA to require submission of a notification for
microorganisms that are considered ``new'' chemical substances and those that will be made for a ``significant new
use.'' Section 5(h) provides for certain exemptions from the 90-day screening process. In the proposed rule, a 60-day
comment period was provided. In response to requests by interested parties, EPA is extending the comment period on
its proposed rule by 60 days. Comments must now be received by December 31, 1994. 




As part of an interagency ``streamlining'' initiative, EPA is making this proposed rule and certain support documents
available electronically. They may be accessed through the Internet at: gopher.epa.gov.

EPA is very interested in learning whether persons have obtained these documents electronically and what their experiences
were in doing so. Persons who comment on this proposed rule are encouraged to provide feedback on this electronic availability
with their comments.



To obtain further information or to provide feedback on the electronic availability of these documents, please contact
Juanita Geer (Telephone: 202-260-1532; FAX: 202-260-1657; Internet: geer.juanita@epamail.epa.gov).
Please be advised that Ms. Geer will accept only feedback on the electronic availability of these documents; all comments
on the substance of the proposed rule must be submitted to the docket above.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Energy (DOE) proposes to amend its Acquisition Regulation to effect changes to Independent Research
and Development (IR&D) and Bid and Proposal Costs (B&P); reflect Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)
changes to the Cost Accounting Standards (CAS); and incorporate travel policy revisions resulting from Public Law
and FAR changes. Additionally, there are technical changes updating references, correcting editorial errors,
and clarifying language.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


I. Background 

II. Public Comments 

III. Procedural Requirements 



A. Review Under Executive Order 12866 

B. Review Under Executive Order 12778 

C. Review Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act 

D. Review Under the Paperwork Reduction Act 

E. Review Under the National Environmental Policy Act 

F. Review Under Executive Order 12612 



I. Background 



Pursuant to section 644 of the Department of Energy Organization Act, Public Law 95-91 (42 U.S.C. 7254), the
Secretary of Energy is authorized to prescribe such procedural rules and regulations as may be deemed necessary or
appropriate to accomplish the functions vested in the Secretary. In accordance with this authority, the Department
of Energy Acquisition Regulation (DEAR), 48 CFR chapter 9, was promulgated with an effective date of April 1, 1984
(49 FR 11922, March 28, 1984). 

The purpose of this rule is to amend the DEAR to formally establish policies, procedures, and contract provisions
that reflect the DOE position relative to the allowability of IR&D/B&P costs and IR&D/B&P advance
agreements and travel costs. Additionally, it reflects the recodification of the CAS into 48 CFR chapter 99, and its
incorporation into FAR, Appendix B. Concomitant with these changes, there are several revisions which delete references
to outdated policies or activities. 

A detailed list of changes follows: 

1. The authority citation for parts 915, 931, 942, 951, and 952 is restated. 

2. Subsection 915.805-5 is amended to delete the requirement in paragraph (c)(1) that a copy of the audit request
be sent to the DOE Inspector General (IG). Pursuant to interagency agreements, the DOE contract audit agency is the
Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA); the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has audit cognizance for
most educational institutions. 

3. Subparagraph 915.970-8(d)(1) is revised to add a reference to the relocation of the CAS to FAR Appendix B (Federal
Acquisition Circular (FAC) 90-12, August 31, 1992). 

4. Subsection 931.205-18 is revised to add the acronyms ``IR&D'' and ``B&P'' to the title. The DEAR
reference to the FAR is changed from (c)(3) to (c)(2), because the FAR amendment (FAC 90-13, September 24, 1992)
deleted FAR (c)(3). Paragraph (c)(4) is deleted in its entirety, except for a portion of the first sentence of (c)(4)
which was moved to (c)(2). Also, FAC 90-13 replaced the requirement for separate advance agreements with temporary
limits (for a 3-year period) on allowable IR&D/B&P costs. DOE has chosen not to institute the temporary limits,
but rather to allow for full recovery, immediately. Thus, the text was amended to reflect the DOE policy that generally
IR&D costs are allowable if reasonable, allocable, and they have a potential benefit or relationship to the DOE
program. B&P costs are generally allowable if they are reasonable and allocable. 

5. Section 942.003, paragraph (a) is revised to delete references to the Department of Defense (DOD) services; the
services no longer have individual plant residencies. This revision reflects the current DOD structure for contract
administration. 

6. Section 942.101 is amended by deleting the reference to the Air Force Contract Management Division (AFCMD) and
the DOE IG in paragraphs (a)(2) and (c), respectively. The AFCMD no longer exists and the Office of Procurement and
Assistance Management now negotiates the interagency agreements with DCAA and HHS. Paragraph (a)(3) is redesignated
as (a)(2) to accommodate the deletion of AFCMD. 

7. Subsection 942.705-1 is revised at paragraph (a)(3) by deleting the statement that a listing of business
units, for which DOE has final indirect cost rate negotiation responsibility, is published in the DOE Order System.
The listing is no longer published in the DOE Order System. The revised paragraph (b)(1) clarifies the proscription
that contractors shall neither be required nor directed to submit final indirect cost rate proposals to the auditor.


8. Subsection 942.705-3 is revised to correct the statement that negotiated rates are ``centrally maintained''
when, in fact, they are only ``distributed'' by the Office of Policy. 

9. Subsection 942.705-4 is revised to correct the statement that negotiated rates are maintained by the Office
of Policy, when, in fact, they are only distributed by the Office. 

10. Subsection 942.705-5 is revised to correct the statement that negotiated rates are maintained by the Office
of Policy, when, in fact, they are only distributed by the Office. 

11. Subpart 942.10 is removed as a result of concomitant changes to the IR&D/B&P advance agreements (see
item 4, foregoing). There is no longer a requirement to negotiate advance agreements; thus, the coverage is removed
in its entirety. 

12. Subsection 942.7003-6 is revised to add the word ``Administration'' to the title of FAR Part 30, which was
changed as a result of FAC 90-12, August 31, 1992. Additionally, the reference to Public Law 91-379, which
established the CAS, is deleted due to the subsequent incorporation of the CAS in FAR Appendix B and their application
to civilian agencies pursuant to Public Law 100-679.

13. Subsection 942.7004 is revised at paragraph (a) to incorporate the results of the interagency agreements between
the Office of Procurement and Assistance Management and DCAA and HHS. References to the DOE IG are deleted. Paragraphs
(b), (c), and (d) are deleted as they describe internal operating procedures that, in large part, are no longer valid.

14. Subsection 951.7000 is revised to delete the reference to outdated General Services Administration (GSA) Bulletin
A-95. The reference to the Federal Property Management Regulations (FPMRs) is sufficient. 
15. Subsection 951.7001 is revised to delete the reference to outdated GSA Bulletin A-95 in the introductory
paragraph. Paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) are deleted as they duplicate information contained in clause 952.251-70.

16. Subsection 952.251-70 is amended to correct a referenced citation at paragraph (a) from ``Property Management
Regulation (FPMR), Temporary Regulation A-30'' to ``Travel Regulation (FTR), Part 301-15, Travel Management
Programs.'' 
17. The authority citation for part 970 is restated. 
18. Subsection 970.3001-1 is revised to reflect the relocation of the CAS, within the FAR, from part 30 to appendix
B. 
19. Subsection 970.3001-2 is revised to correct the cross reference from ``970.3102-10'' to ``970.3102-3.''

20. Subsection 970.3102-17 is amended by revising paragraph (c)(2)(i) and adding new paragraphs (c)(6) and
(c)(7). In (c)(2)(i), line 1, the letter ``s'' is deleted from the word ``Regulations'' to reflect the new title. New
subparagraph (c)(6) is added to reflect changes in FAR 31.205-46, ``Travel costs'' as a result of FAC 90-7
which provided for downward adjustments to the maximum per diem rates when no lodging costs are incurred or on partial
travel days. A new paragraph (c)(7) is added which refers to the incorporation of the Public Law 100-679 requirements
in 970.5204-13 and 970.5204-14. Public Law 100-679, which amended the Office of Federal Procurement
Policy Act, states that, for State and nonprofit institutions performing federally sponsored research, travel
costs shall be considered reasonable and allowable only to the extent that such costs do not exceed charges normally
allowed by the respective institution in its regular operations as a result of an institutional policy. In the absence
of institutional policies, rates and amounts shall be determined by either subchapter I of chapter 57 of title 5, United
States Code, or by the General Services Administration, or the President, or his designee. 
21. Subsection 970.5204-13 is amended by revising paragraph (e)(35) to add a ``NOTE'' directing the Contracting
Officer to use the alternate clause for contracts with State and nonprofit institutions. The ``NOTE'' reflects that,
pursuant to Public Law 100-679, which amended the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act, travel costs of
State and nonprofit institutions performing federally sponsored research shall be considered reasonable and allowable
only to the extent that such costs do not exceed charges normally allowed by the respective institution in its regular
operations as a result of an institutional policy. In the absence of institutional policies, rates and amounts shall
be determined by either subchapter I of chapter 57 of title 5, United States Code, or by the General Services Administration,
or the President, or his designee. 
22. Subsection 970.5204-14 is amended by revising paragraph (e)(33) to add a ``NOTE'' directing the Contracting
Officer to use the alternate clause for contracts with State and nonprofit institutions. The ``Note'' reflects that,
pursuant to Public Law 100-679, which amended the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act, travel costs of
State and nonprofit institutions performing federally sponsored research shall be considered reasonable and allowable
only to the extent that such costs do not exceed charges normally allowed by the respective institution in its regular
operations as a result of an institutional policy. In the absence of institutional policies, rates and amounts shall
be determined by either subchapter I of Chapter 57 of Title 5, United States Code, or by the General Services Administration,
or the President, or his designee. 
23. Subsection 970.7104-33 is revised to reflect the relocation of the Cost Accounting Standards, within the
FAR, from part 30 to appendix B. 


II. Public Comments 


Interested persons are invited to participate by submitting data, views, or arguments with respect to the proposed
Department of Energy Acquisition Regulation amendments set forth in this notice. Three copies of written comments
should be submitted to the address indicated in the ADDRESSES 

section of this notice. All comments received will be available for public inspection in the DOE Reading Room, Room
1E-190, Forrestal Building, 1000 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, D.C. 20585, between the hours of 9 a.m.
and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. All written comments received by the date indicated in
the 

DATES 

section of this notice and all other relevant information in the record will be carefully assessed and fully considered
prior to publication of the final rule. Any information considered to be confidential must be so identified and submitted
in writing, one copy only. DOE reserves the right to determine the confidential status of the information and to treat
it according to our determination (See 10 CFR 1004.11). 
The Department has concluded that this proposed rule does not involve a substantial issue of fact or law and that the
proposed rule should not have substantial impact on the nation's economy or a large number of individuals or businesses.
Therefore, pursuant to Public Law 95-91, the DOE Organization Act, and the Administrative Procedure Act (5
U.S.C. 553), the Department does not plan to hold a public hearing on this proposed rule. 


III. Procedural Requirements 


A. Review Under Executive Order 12866 


Today's regulatory action has been determined not to be a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order
12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review,'' (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993). Accordingly, this action was not subject
to review under that Executive Order by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB). 


B. Review Under Executive Order 12778 


Section 2 of Executive Order 12778 instructs agencies to adhere to certain requirements in promulgating new regulations
and reviewing existing regulations. These requirements, set forth in Sections 2(a) and (b), include eliminating
drafting errors and needless ambiguity, drafting the regulations to minimize litigation, providing clear and certain
legal standards for affected conduct, and promoting simplification and burden reduction. Agencies are also instructed
to make every reasonable effort to ensure that the regulation: Specifies clearly any preemptive effect; describes
any administrative proceedings to be available prior to judicial review and any provisions for the exhaustion of
such administrative proceedings; and defines key terms. DOE certifies that today's proposal meets the requirements
of sections 2(a) and (b) of Executive Order 12778.

C. Review Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act 


This proposed rule was reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, Public Law 96-354, which requires
preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis for any rule which is likely to have significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities. DOE certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities, and, therefore, no regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared.



D. Review Under the Paperwork Reduction Act 


No new information or recordkeeping requirements are imposed by this rulemaking. Accordingly, no OMB clearance
is required under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501, 

et seq

.). 


E. Review Under the National Environmental Policy Act 


DOE has concluded that promulgation of this rule falls into a class of actions which would not individually or cumulatively
have significant impact on the human environment, as determined by DOE's regulations (10 CFR part 1021, subpart D)
implementing the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 

et seq

.). Specifically, this rule is categorically excluded from NEPA review because the proposed amendments to the DEAR
do not change the environmental effect of the rule being amended (categorical exclusion A5). Therefore, this rule
does not require an environmental impact statement or environmental assessment pursuant to NEPA. 


F. Review Under Executive Order 12612 


Executive Order 12612, (52 FR 41685, October 30, 1987), requires that regulations, rules, legislation, and any other
policy actions be reviewed for any substantial direct effects on States, on the relationship between the National
Government and the States, or in the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of Government.
If there are sufficient substantial direct effects, then the Executive Order requires the preparation of a federalism
assessment to be used in all decisions involved in promulgating and implementing a policy action. This proposed rule,
when finalized, will revise certain policy and procedural requirements. States which contract with DOE will be subject
to this rule. However, DOE has determined that this rule will not have a substantial direct effect on the institutional
interests or traditional functions of the States.

contract management and administration of contracts for major defense contractors has been established. DOD has
organized plant residencies of contract management specialists for specific DOD contractors and their various
business units. The Defense Logistics Agency performs contract management functions both at onsite residencies
of contractors and on a mobile basis from centrally located management areas for other defense contractors. A complete
listing of the DOD contract administration service components is contained in the Defense Directory cited in (FAR)
48 CFR 42.102.
