<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Corps of Engineers published in the 

Federal Register

, on June 17, 1993, its intent to prepare a supplemental draft Environmental Impact Statement (sdEIS) relevant to
an application for a Section 404 permit to place fill material into wetlands adjacent to East Brush Creek, Eagle County,
Colorado, for the construction of commercial/residential development attendant to a four-season resort. This
sdEIS is a prelude for preparing a Final EIS prior to a permit decision on the proposed development. The applicant,
Kummer Development Corporation dba Adam's Rib Recreation Area, has applied for a permit to fill approximately 25
acres of montane wetlands pursuant to the development which would include 250,000 square feet of commercial space,
4,281 residential units, and 1,440 lodging rooms, employee housing, golfing and skiing for 9,000 skiers-at-one-time
on Adam Mountain and Mount Eve.



The USDA-Forest Service, as a Cooperating Agency, through this Notice, intends to directly participate with the
Corps of Engineers to include analyses for impacts to wetlands and waters of the U.S. for the ski mountain and a potential
Federal land exchange with the applicant for NEPA compliance. Any additional analyses shall tier into this sdEIS.
Also, the sdEIS will disclose environmental effects to public lands regarding development of the ski area portion
of the Adam's Rib Recreation Area. Kummer Development Corporation dba Adam's Rib Recreation Area was issued a special
use permit by the Forest Supervisor, White River National Forest, December 15, 1983 to occupy approximately 2,920
acres of National Forest System lands. The special use permit authorities construction of the ski area portion of
the Adam's Rib Recreation Area upon acceptance of a detailed development plan. The impacts of the detailed development
plan will be disclosed in the sdEIS. The existing special use permit is still in effect and will not be available in the
sdEIS.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The applicant proposes to fill approximately 25 acres of montane wetlands dominated by various species of willow,
sledge and rush. Nearly all wetland fill would be located on private land in Vassar Meadow; additional development
would occur in Joe Goode Meadow, Woodrun, No Name drainage, adjacent to Brush Creek (i.e., golf course and residences)
and on the ski mountain. The U.S. Forest Service issued a special use permit for the ski mountain in 1983. On March 3,
1987, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers published a Notice of Intent in the 

Federal Register

 to prepare a draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). A draft titled ``Adam's Rib Recreation Area, Eagle, Colorado''
was published in October 1989. A Notice of Availability for this document was published in the 

Federal Register

 on November 3, 1989. The applicant's preferred alternative resulted in a request for a permit to fill approximately
70 acres of wetlands in the project area. This acreage of wetland fill was later reduced to approximately 46 acres.
This permit was denied in February 1993.



The applicant has since modified the proposal to fill approximately 25 acres of wetland. To avoid wetlands, the applicant's
preferred alternative has resulted in a relocation of the base area to the west. A lateral moraine known as Adam's Rib
would be excavated, with the excavated material placed in the adjacent No Name drainage and portions of Vassar meadow.
The reduced Adam's Rib and the No Name drainage would be the location of the base area. Part of the applicant's preferred
alternative includes a land exchange with the Forest Service. This sdEIS will supplement and supplant information
currently available in the draft EIS.



Alternatives (Section 404 Permit and Federal Land Exchange)



Alternatives that will be considered for detailed evaluation will include:

(1) Base area development on Adam's Rib and No Name drainage with a land exchange with the Forest Service (applicant's
preferred alternative).

(2) Same as alternative 1, but no land exchange.

(3) Base area development in Vassar Meadow.

(4) Reasonable variations to the applicant's preferred alternative that would reduce adverse impacts, for example,
to wetlands.

(5) No Action.



Alternatives (Ski Mountain Development)



(1) Ski Area Master Development Plan as proposed to the Forest Service, December, 1993.

(2) Reasonable variations to the applicant's proposal that would reduce adverse impacts to natural resources on
National Forest System lands.



Scoping (Section 404 permitting)



The Corps issued a scoping notice in conjunction with the Notice of Intent to prepare the draft EIS in 1987. Additionally,
the Corps accepted comments on the draft EIS, conducted a Public Hearing in February, 1990 in Gypsum, Colorado, and
has coordinated closely with resource agencies and the interested public. The Corps believes that additional scoping
concerning wetlands is unnecessary at this time. However, any additional substantive information and new issues
arising from comments to the sdEIS shall be thoroughly addressed in the Final EIS.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941031-2-00008 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941031-2-00005 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Army Corps of Engineers' decisions to be made will include WHETHER OR NOT a Section 404 permit will be issued to the
applicant.



Scoping (Land Exchange and Ski Mountain Development)



The Forest Service, in cooperation with the Corps, will conduct scoping in conjunction with, and subsequent to, this
Notice of Intent. The Forest Service previously scoped for ski area development issues as a part of the ``Adam's Rib
Recreation Area Final Environmental Impact Statement'' in 1982. It is believed that additional scoping is needed
to gather information regarding a potential Federal land exchange associated with the permittee's current base
development proposal, and the specific development proposal (detailed development plan) on the ski mountains.
The existing special use permit is still in effect and will not be revisited in the sdEIS.

Public participation will be fully incorporated into preparation of the supplemental draft EIS through public notices
in local papers and brief information packets to known interested people, groups, local government, and resource
agencies. Public meetings will be held in the Eagle and Denver, Colorado areas throughout the public involvement
process. The exact dates and locations of these meetings will be published two weeks in advance in local newspapers.

Forest Service decisions to be made will include HOW the ski mountains will be developed within applicable laws and
guidelines, and WHETHER OR NOT a Federal Land Exchange will occur.



Preliminary Issues



(1) Impacts to wetlands, 
(2) Impacts to water quality,
(3) Impacts to fish and wildlife resources,
(4) Socio-economic effects,
(5) Cumulative impacts of developing a new ski area, 
(6) Impacts on outdoor recreation,
(7) Visual impacts,
(8) Exchange of Federal lands,
(9) Installation of power transmission lines.

Proposed Foreign-Trade Zone; Anniston, AL 
(Birmingham Customs Port of Entry); 
Application and Public Hearing 



An application has been submitted to the Foreign-Trade Zones Board (the Board) by the Anniston-Calhoun County Airport
Commission (an Alabama public corporation), requesting authority to establish a general-purpose foreign-trade
zone in Anniston, Alabama, adjacent to the Birmingham Customs port of entry. The application was submitted pursuant
to the provisions of the Foreign-Trade Zones Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a-81u), and the regulations of the Board
(15 CFR part 400). It was formally filed on October 18, 1994. The applicant is authorized to make the proposal under
Act No. 77-498, Section 33-1-30 of the Code of Alabama, 1975, as amended. 

The proposed zone would be the second general-purpose zone in the Birmingham Customs port of entry area. The existing
zone, 

FTZ 98, 

Birmingham, was authorized in 1984 (Grantee: City of Birmingham, Alabama, Board Order 247, 49 F.R. 19367, 5/7/84).


The proposed foreign-trade zone site covers the Anniston Metropolitan Airport complex (563 acres), which is 90 miles
west of Atlanta and 60 miles east of Birmingham. The airport complex includes air cargo facilities and an industrial
park. It is owned by the City of Anniston and operated by the Airport Commission. 

The application contains evidence of the need for zone services in the Anniston area. Several firms have indicated
an interest in using zone procedures for warehousing/distribution of such items as automotive equipment, electrical
and electronic supplies, food and related products, and machinery. Specific manufacturing approvals are not being
sought at this time. Requests would be made to the Board on a case-by-case basis. 

In accordance with the Board's regulations (as revised, 56 FR 50790-50808, 10-8-91), a member of
the FTZ Staff has been designated examiner to investigate the application and report to the Board. 

As part of the investigation, the Commerce examiner will hold a public hearing on November 15, 1994, 2:00 p.m., at the
Offices of Anniston Executive Aviation, Anniston Metropolitan Airport, 2500 Talladega Highway (Highway 21), Oxford,
Alabama 36203. 

Public comment on the application is invited from interested parties. Submissions (original and 3 copies) shall
be addressed to the Board's Executive Secretary at the address below. The closing period for their receipt is December

Certain Carbon Steel Butt-Weld Pipe Fittings From Japan; Initiation of Anti-Circumvention Inquiry on Antidumping
Duty Order 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 International Trade Administration/Import Administration, Department of Commerce.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of initiation of anti-circumvention inquiry.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On the basis of a petition filed with the Department of Commerce, we are initiating an anti-circumvention inquiry
to determine whether producers of carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings from Japan are circumventing the antidumping
duty order on carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings. 




Effective Date:

 October 31, 1994.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



On March 22, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) received a petition filed by the U.S. Fittings Group
(the petitioner) requesting that the Department conduct an anti-circumvention inquiry on the antidumping duty
order on Certain Carbon Steel Butt-Weld Pipe Fittings from Japan (52 FR 4167 (February 10, 1987)). The U.S. Fittings
Group is an 

ad hoc 

trade association of domestic producers of carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings (pipe fittings) whose members currently
consist of Hackney, Inc., Ladish Co., Mill Iron Works, Inc., and Tube Forgings of America, Inc. 

Petitioner alleges that unfinished pipe fittings from Japan are being finished in Thailand by Awaji Sangyo (Thailand)
Co. (AST), and thereafter imported into the United States free of any antidumping duties. Petitioner asserts that
all the elements necessary for an affirmative determination under Section 781(b) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended,
(the Tariff Act) are present. 

The Department received a letter from AST on March 31, 1994, stating that petitioner's request should be denied because
unfinished pipe fittings from Japan, as imported by AST, are not included in the scope of the Japanese order. 



Initiation of Anti-Circumvention Proceeding 



Section 781(b) of the Tariff Act allows the Department to include merchandise within the scope of an existing order
if the following conditions are met: (1) The merchandise entering the United States must be of the same class or kind
as the merchandise subject to the antidumping duty order; (2) prior to importation into the United States, the merchandise
must be completed or assembled in a third country from subject merchandise or merchandise produced in the country
subject to the order; and (3) the difference in value of the imported merchandise and the value of such merchandise
completed or assembled in a third country must be ``small.'' 

Our analysis of petitioner's submission according to the above criteria leads us to conclude that: (1) there is evidence
that the merchandise entered into the United States is of the same class or kind as that covered by the Japanese order;
(2) there is public evidence that AST imported unfinished pipe fittings from Japan, performed finishing operations,
and then exported these finished pipe fittings to the United States; and (3) the difference in value between the imported
finished pipe fittings and the unfinished Japanese pipe fittings finished by AST is most likely ``small.'' In addition
to the criteria discussed above, the statute also lists other factors to consider in determining whether to include
such merchandise in the antidumping duty order. These are: (1) The pattern of trade; (2) whether a relationship exists
between the manufacturer or exporter and the third-country assembler of the product; and (3) whether imports into
the foreign country of the product have increased after the issuance of the order. Our analysis of the information
in the petitioner's submission leads us to conclude that: (1) U.S. import statistics evidence a shift in the pattern
of trade subsequent to the Japanese order; (2) there is no relationship between the manufacturer or exporter and the
third-country assembler; and (3) the data with respect to any increase of imports into the foreign country are inconclusive.
For further analysis, see Memorandum from Joseph A. Spetrini to Susan G. Esserman, dated October 21, 1994. Based on
this information, we are initiating an anti-circumvention inquiry on carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings from
Japan, case number A-588-602. 
The Department will not suspend liquidation at this time. However, the Department will instruct the U.S. Customs
Service to suspend liquidation in the event of an affirmative preliminary determination of circumvention. 
This notice is published in accordance with section 781(b) of the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. 1677j(b)) and 19 CFR 353.29.

 We disallowed additional transportation and land-leasing expenses for western honeybee beekeeping because
they are based on U.S. costs, and are either inadequately supported or are based on incomplete methodology (

i.e., 

with regard to transportation, petitioners have failed to take into account the increase in yield associated with
migratory beekeeping).

 We adjusted beekeeping costs to offset the costs associated with beekeeping services and products other than
honey.

 We valued packing costs associated with steel drums using Indian import statistics rather than U.S. costs.

 We have revised the FMV calculation for the eastern bee using a higher yield, as derived from the supporting
data for the eastern bee presented in the petitioners' foreign market research.



Fair Value Comparisons



Based on a comparison of USP and FMV, petitioners' alleged dumping margins, as revised by the Department, range from
30.95 to 49.24 percent.



Initiation of Investigation



We have examined the petition on honey and have found that the petition meets the requirements of section 732(b) of
the Act. Therefore, we are initiating an antidumping duty investigation to determine whether imports of honey from
the PRC are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value.



International Trade Commission (ITC) Notification



Section 732(d) of the Act requires us to notify the ITC of this action and we have done so.



Preliminary Determination by the ITC



The ITC will determine by November 17, 1994, whether there is a reasonable indication that an industry in the United
States is materially injured, or is threatened with material injury, by reason of imports of honey from the PRC. A negative
ITC determination will result in a termination of the investigation; otherwise, the investigation will proceed
according to statutory and regulatory time limits.

This notice is published pursuant to section 732(c)(2) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.13(b).

In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's
(Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR Part 380 (Order 486, 52 FR 47897, December 17, 1987), the Office of Hydropower
Licensing has undertaken preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the application for Non-project
Use of Project Lands and Waters at the Gaston and Roanoke Rapids Project (FERC No. 2009), located on the Roanoke River.
The proposed water intake and pipeline would be located in Brunswick, Greenville, Sussex, Southhampton and Isle
of Wight Counties, Virginia.

On July 1, 1994, the Commission issued a Notice of Intent to Prepare an EIS and to conduct Scoping Meetings. Public scoping
meetings were held at the following dates and locations:

 July 14, 1994, Scoping Meeting held in Raleigh, NC.

 July 18, 1994, Scoping Meeting held in South Hill, VA.

 July 20, 1994, Scoping Meeting held in Virginia Beach, VA.

The period for providing written comments on scoping closed on August 19, 1994. Comments on scoping were received
from federal, state, and local government entities, private organizations, and individuals. At this time, the process
of reviewing and analyzing comments received during scoping is complete.

As part of the process of scoping the EIS, the Office of Hydropower Licensing has produced a Scoping Document Two (SD2).
The SD2 summarizes the following elements: the scoping process, scoping comments received during public meetings,
and scoping comments received from written testimony. Further, the SD2 provides a general overview of issues that
will be evaluated in the EIS as well as issues that do not warrant further evaluation. The SD2 also includes a schedule

<DOCTITLE>Florida Gas Transmission Co.; Notice of Compliance Filing</DOCTITLE>




October 25, 1994.



Take notice that on October 21, 1994, Florida Gas Transmission Company (FGT) tendered for filing to become part of
its FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1, the following tariff sheets, with a proposed effective date of December
1, 1994:




Sixth Revised Sheet No. 8B
First Revised Sheet No. 8D
Second Revised Sheet No. 18
Third Revised Sheet No. 46A
Second Revised Sheet No. 47
First Revised Sheet No. 206
Fifth Revised Sheet No. 207




FGT states that it is proposing tariff provisions modifying fuel retainage for its Western Division transportation
services. Specifically, FGT is proposing to modify its FTS-1 and ITS-1 Rate Schedules to provide that
FGT will charge Western Division forwardhaul shippers a fuel percentage based on the number of compressors utilized
in providing the service. FGT states that it believes this modification is necessary to make FGT's Western Division
service competitive with other transporters.

FGT's FTS-1 and ITS-1 Rate Schedules provide that FGT may charge individual shippers for Western Division
transportation service less than the maximum rates set forth on the currently effective Sheet No. 8B applicable to
such service. FGT states that it has routinely discounted its maximum facility and service charges for Western Division
transportation to compete with the large number of interestate and intrastate pipelines operating in the area served
by FGT. Many potential Western Division transportation opportunities involve ``short hauls'' on FGT's supply area
laterals and mainline that require the use of little, if any, compression. However, operation of the provisions of
the Fuel Reimbursement Charge of Section 27 of FGT's General Terms and Conditions would result in FGT absorbing any
discount of the Fuel Reimbursement Charge. These provisions would result in FGT losing money on almost any transaction
where FGT discounted fuel.

Therefore, FGT is proposing to modify its Fuel Reimbursement Charge to provide that Western Division transportation
service will be charged a fuel retainage percentage on a per compressor basis.

Specifically, FGT is proposing a Western Division fuel percentage of 0.50% per compressor up to a maximum percentage
not to exceed the effective maximum Fuel Reimbursement Charge as defined in Section 27 of FGT's General Terms and Conditions.

Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Sections 385.214
and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before November
1, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate actions to be taken, but will
not serve to make protestants parties to the proceedings. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to
intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.

MMBtu equivalent on an annual basis. It is estimated that the cost of construction would be $1,400, for which NorAm
would be reimbursed by ARKLA. It is asserted that NorAm has sufficient capacity to accomplish the deliveries without
detriment or disadvantage to its other customers and that NorAm's tariff does not prohibit the addition of new delivery
points. It is further asserted that the deliveries would be within ARKLA's certificated entitlement from NorAm.

Any person or the Commission's staff may, within 45 days after issuance of the instant notice by the Commission, file
pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission's Procedural Rules (18 CFR 385.214) a motion to intervene or notice of intervention

Peer Review of the Technical Bases for the Suitability Evaluation Process</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM), Energy.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of inquiry.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Through this Notice of Inquiry (Notice) and as part of the on-going process of public participation in the development
of the Site Suitability Evaluation Process begun in an April 1994 

Federal Register

 Notice (59 FR 19680), the Department of Energy (DOE) desires to elicit the views of members of the general public on
the proposed methodology for utilizing the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Board on Radioactive Waste Management
(BRWM) for implementation and management of peer reviews of the technical bases for the suitability evaluation process.
The DOE is committed to ensuring the quality of its technical work. One approach to ensuring technical quality is the
use of an independent, impartial peer review for the technical work. To ensure a peer review that is independent, impartial,
and of the highest technical quality, the DOE intends to request that the (BRWM): (1) Oversee the required peer reviews,
including setting up the review committees and (2) establish a standing committee to review OCRWM's analysis of long
term repository performance.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background




OCRWM has proposed a restructured repository program consistent with the recent Fiscal Year 1995 Administrative
Funding Proposal. Under the program site characterization and engineering activities would focus initially on
the evaluation of the suitability of Yucca Mountain. Because the broad credibility of the suitability determination
is so critical to the success of the program, DOE proposes to make a technical determination of suitability as an independent
program milestone as the result of an incremental and open process that features rigorous, independent external
peer review of the technical work and focused, effective public involvement.

The proposed suitability evaluation process calls for the separate and sequential evaluation of individual technical
issues or groups of related technical issues. Evaluations of technical issues would be conducted as site characterization
data and analyses become available. For each issue or group of issues, DOE would first develop the technical basis
that will be used for the assessment of regulatory compliance. DOE desires to have peer reviews of the manner in which
scientific information has been collected, analyzed and interpreted in the development of the technical bases.
Toward this end, DOE proposes to contract with the NAS to manage a process of external expert peer review of this aspect
of the technical bases. This approach would address only the technical or scientific analyses and not address regulatory
compliance.



II. Proposed Methodology



A. Oversee the Required Peer Review Process



OCRWM considers the peer review process to have three important steps: (1) Select the peer review committees (2) manage
the peer reviews, and (3) oversee development of the peer review reports.

(1) Select the peer review committee: For a peer review of a given technical basis report, the BRWM would determine
the expertise needed and the size of the committee, establish and make available to the public minimum qualifications
for peer reviewers, solicit nominations for qualified peer reviewers from the public, and recommend a slate of nominees
for selection through the established National Research Council process, including the following: Minimize the
potential for bias on the review committee; ensure that diverse scientific views on the technical issues central
to the material are encompassed; consider minority representation and geographic sensitivities including the
unique interest the citizens of Nevada have in the process; and ensure the availability of committee members to meet
a predetermined schedule. The BRWM would be prepared to discuss with the public how the process addresses these concerns.

The size and technical composition of the committee would be determined by the BRWM according to the nature and complexity
of the information to be reviewed. To the extent possible, peer review committees would be established well in advance
of the availability of the documents for review.

DOE would provide recommendations regarding the size of the peer review committees and length of time required for
each review, but the BRWM shall make the final decisions of these parameters within the following limits: Maximum
committee size_ten members, maximum time to deliver peer review report_six months.

(2) Manage the review: Reviewers would evaluate the validity of the data and interpretations and the adequacy of the
treatment of uncertainties in describing the current state of understanding. Reviewers would address, at a minimum
the following questions: (a) Has the data been collected and analyzed in a technically acceptable manner? (b) Does
the data, given the associated error and analytical and conceptual uncertainties, support the technical interpretations
and conclusions made within the report? (c) Are there credible alternative interpretations that would significantly
alter the conclusions reached? (d) What testing, if any, would discriminate between alternative technical interpretations?
(e) If such testing is recommended, how effective would it be at reducing significant uncertainties?

In accordance with BRWM policy, all interactions between the peer review committees, report authors and OCRWM would
occur in open session and all documents submitted to the committees would be publicly available. The review committee
would request that the public provide information on relevant technical issues that they determine should be brought
to the attention of the committee. As is standard practice for National Research Council committees, however, Executive
Sessions of the committee, when only committee members and NAS staff are present, may precede and/or follow all public
meetings. In these sessions the committee would attend to internal administrative and ``housekeeping'' details,
deliberations and discussions about the issues and information, plans for future meetings, development of report
outlines, and writing of the reports. On occasion, full-day executive session meetings would take place. No private
meetings with federal, state, or other parties external to the NAS would ever be held. This is standard practice for
the BRWM.

The length of time required for peer review would depend on the nature and complexity of the information being reviewed.
Because OCRWM is accountable for measurable progress, all reviews would be completed in four to six months.

(3) Oversee development of the report: The report would include responses to the five questions listed in (2) above,
and relevant technical issues raised by the public. The BRWM would advise the committee to avoid or at least to differentiate
between recommendations for additional technical work that is not justified by a reduction of uncertainty, and recommendations
that are not purely technical such as recommendations that relate to DOE policy, management or decisions. Reports
would be reviewed through the usual NAS independent blind-review process.



B. Establish a Standing Review Committee for OCRWM's Assessments of Postclosure Performance of the Repository



The relevant analyses of repository performance produced in the next several years are expected to be complex and
lengthy and to cross-cut many technical disciplines. For this reason, a standing peer review committee would be formed
to (1) review all analysis work as it progresses, (2) review the analysis that would be the primary basis for DOE assessment
of conformance with the postclosure system guidelines and (3) review conclusions on qualifying conditions of the
postclosure technical guidelines that are inextricably linked to the conclusion on system performance.



C. Proposed Schedule for Initiating Peer Review of the Technical Basis Reports



The schedule for initiating peer reviews is as follows:

(1) Surface Processes_TBD/95

(2) Interim analysis of long-term system performance I1_9/95

(3) Preclosure Rock Characteristics_4/96

(4) Tectonics_10/96 or

(4a) Volcanic Hazard_3/96

(4b) Seismic Hazard_10/96


(5) Geochemistry/Postclosure Rock Characteristics_5/96


(6) Interim analysis of long-term system performance II
_10/96




(7) Geohydrology/Transport_2/97


(8) Preclosure Radiological Safety
_8/97





(9) Final analysis of long-term system performance1_11/97

<USBUREAU>Office of Hearings and Appeals</USBUREAU>


<DOCTITLE>Notice of Issuance of Decisions and Orders; Week of August 22 Through August 26, 1994</DOCTITLE>




During the week of August 22 through August 26, 1994, the decisions and orders summarized below were issued with respect
to appeals and applications for other relief filed with the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the Department of Energy.
The following summary also contains a list of submissions that were dismissed by the Office of Hearings and Appeals.


 


Appeals 





Brian P. Conlon,

 8/25/94, 

LFA-0400

 


Brian P. Conlon filed an Appeal from a determination issued by the Idaho Operations Office (Idaho) of the Department
of Energy (DOE) in response to a request from Mr. Conlon under the Privacy Act (Privacy Act). Mr. Conlon sought copies
of investigative material contained in the Personnel Security Clearance System of Records. In considering the Appeal,
the Office of Hearings and Appeals found that the Privacy Act Officer properly withheld the information contained
in a ``system of records,'' the release of any part of which would reveal the identity of a confidential source. Accordingly,
the Appeal was denied.

 


Dr. Robert Sanchez,

 8/26/94, 

LFA-0407




Dr. Robert Sanchez filed an Appeal from a determination issued to him by the Albuquerque Operations Office (AOO) of
the Department of Energy (DOE). The determination partially denied a Request for Information which Dr. Sanchez submitted
under the Freedom of Information Act. Dr. Sanchez requested various documents relating to Solicitation for Offers
No. TU-0050 (SFO) and an amendment to that solicitation. In its determination letter, the AOO provided Dr. Sanchez
various documents responsive to his Freedom of Information Act request. However, Dr. Sanchez, in his Appeal, argued
that additional responsive documents must exist because of various requirements listed in the SFO. In considering
the Appeal, the DOE found that an adequate search had been conducted in response to Dr. Sanchez's request. Accordingly,
Dr. Sanchez's Appeal was denied. 




National Security News Service,

 8/22/92, 

LFA-0402




The National Security News Service (NSNS) filed an Appeal from a determination issued by the Deputy Assistant Secretary
for Military Application and Stockpile Support, Defense Programs (DP), in response to a request for information
under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). NSNS sought documents relating to ``Exercise Midnight Trail,'' a 1991
military training exercise sponsored by the Department of Defense (DOD). In considering the Appeal, the DOE found
that: (1) DP properly invoked Exemption 6 in withholding the names of individuals and identifying information from
documents released to NSNS because the privacy interests of the individuals outweighed the minimal contribution
of disclosure to the public understanding of government operations and activities; (2) DP did not provide a sufficient
basis for its application of Exemption 6 to the other information withheld from the appellant; and (3) DP's search
for responsive documents should have included the DOE's Albuquerque Operations Office (DOE/AL). In addition, DP
agreed to forward the appellant's request to seven other offices at DOE Headquarters. The matter was therefore remanded
to DP for a new determination releasing the information not protected by Exemption 6 or providing additional justification
for its withholding, and providing to NSNS responsive documents located at DOE/AL and the other DOE Headquarters
offices. In all other respects, the Appeal was denied. 




William H. Payne,

 8/22/94, 

 LFA-0405




William H. Payne (Payne) filed an Appeal from two determinations issued to him on July 26, 1994, by the Deputy Director,
Office of Intergovernmental and External Affairs (Authorizing Official). In those determinations, the Authorizing
official denied requests for information submitted by Payne under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). In the first
determination, the Authorizing Official denied Payne's request for documents. In the second determination, the
Authorizing Official denied a request for a waiver of fees in connection with another series of FOIA requests that
Payne filed. In his Appeal, Payne challenged the adequacy of search conducted by the Office of Intergovernmental
and External Affairs. He also asked that the Office of Hearings and Appeals reverse the second determination, and
grant him a fee waiver. In considering the Appeal, the DOE found that Payne's request for documents was subjected to
a search sufficient to meet the established standard of reasonableness. The DOE also found that Payne did not demonstrate
that he was entitled to a fee waiver since he did not show that disclosure of the requested information was in the public
interest. Accordingly, Payne's Appeal was denied. 



Requests for Exception



Farmco, Inc.,

 8/23/94,

 LEE-0125




Farmco, Inc., (Farmco) filed an Application for Exception from the provisions of the Energy Information Administration
(EIA) reporting requirements in which the firm sought temporary relief from filing Form EIA-782B, entitled
``Resellers'/Retailers' Monthly Petroleum Product Sales Report.'' The DOE determined that a limited form of exception
relief_to extend until September Farmco's filing deadline for the Forms for the months of May and June_would be appropriate.
However, Farmco had filed the forms before a Decision had been issued. Accordingly, the Application for Exception
was consequently dismissed.

Kadane Corporation, 

8/24/94, 

LEE-0103 




Kadane Corporation filed an Application for Exception from the requirement that it file Form EIA-23, the ``Annual
Survey of Domestic Oil and Gas Reserves.'' Kadane Corporation claimed that it lacked the necessary technical personnel
to provide the information requested in Form EIA-23 and that it no longer obtains that information for its own
purposes. In considering the request, the DOE found that there were no technical personnel required to complete the
form other than those already employed by Kadane. The DOE also concluded that the firm was not suffering a serious hardship
and was not adversely affected by the reporting requirement in a way that was significantly different from the burden
borne by similar reporting firms. Therefore, the DOE denied Kadane Corporation's Application for Exception. 



Remedial Order 


Economic Regulatory Administration, 

8/23/94, 

LCX-0012

 



The DOE issued a Decision and Order modifying a 1987 Remedial Order issued to Storey Oil Company, Inc. See Storey Oil
Co., Inc., 

16 DOE  83,007 (1987) (1987 RO). The 1987 RO had been remanded by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)
for a recalculation of the retail overcharges based on new evidence introduced in the FERC proceeding. 

See Storey Oil Co., Inc., 

65 FERC  61,216 (1993). In response to the remand, the DOE's Economic Regulatory Administration submitted
a recalculation of the retail overcharges for inclusion in a modified Remedial Order. In considering the ERA's recalculation,
the DOE rejected Storey's various arguments in opposition to the issuance of a revised remedial order, including
Storey's argument that the recalculation was inconsistent with the reseller-retailer price rule, l 10 CFR 212.93.
Accordingly, the DOE modified the 1987 RO to reduce the retail overcharges from $61,071.48 to $47,549.90. 



Refund Applications 




Enron Corporation/Aristech Chemical Corporation, 

8/24/94, 

RF340-152 




Aristech Chemical Corporation (Aristech) submitted an application for refund in the Enron Corporation refund proceeding.
The DOE determined that Aristech had acquired the assets, including the right to refund, of USS Chemicals. The DOE
found that USS Chemicals used Enron propane as a feedstock to produce certain olefins, primarily ethylene, and therefore
that Aristech was entitled to a refund for USS Chemical's purchases from Enron under the presumption of injury for
end-users of Enron products. The total refund granted to Aristech, including interest, is $820,193. 




Enron Louisiana Energy Co., 

8/26/94, 

RF272-92434 




The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning the Application for Refund of Enron Louisiana Energy Co. in the Subpart
V crude oil overcharge refund proceeding. The Application for Refund was based on purchases of petroleum products
the applicant used in the processing of natural gas liquid products (NGLPs). Enron failed to prove it was injured by
crude oil overcharges because it made no demonstration that it was unable to pass on those overcharges to its customers
in its sales of NGLPs. Accordingly, the Application for Refund was denied. 




Texaco, Inc./J&J Oil Co., Inc., 

8/22/94, 

RF321-7211 




The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning an Application for Refund filed by J&J Oil Co., Inc. (J&J),
a petroleum products reseller, in the Texaco, Inc. special refund proceeding. J&J requested a refund above the
volumetric presumption level of $0.0011 per gallon on the grounds that it had been disproportionately overcharged
by Texaco during the refund period. In considering the firm's claim, the DOE found that J&J was likely overcharged
by Texaco in the amount of $0.02778 per gallon of propane purchased during the period September 1, 1973 through December
31, 1978. This determination was based upon the findings in a Remedial Order issued to Texaco. Although the total amount
of the likely overcharges was $193,277, the DOE found that the firm's maximum potential refund was $21,440 since its
banks of increased costs indicated that it had passed through the remainder of the overcharges. The firm also established
through the competitive disadvantage methodology that it was injured by Texaco's likely overcharges. The DOE also
determined that the interest that accrued on the likely overcharges prior to the effective date of the Texaco Consent
Order should be considered in determining J&J's refund. After prorating the firm's maximum potential refund
plus pre-settlement interest by the ratio which the Texaco consent order amount bears to the aggregate overcharge
amount alleged by the DOE in all enforcement proceedings settled by the Texaco Consent Order, the DOE found that J&J
is entitled to a refund of $67,895 (including a pro rata share of the interest that has accrued since the Texaco settlement
funds were deposited with the DOE).

 



J.E. Dewitt, Inc., 

8/23/94, 

RF321-17022 




The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning an Application for Refund filed in the Texaco Inc. special refund proceeding
on behalf of J.E. Dewitt, Inc. (Dewitt), a reseller of Texaco products. Dewitt sought a refund equal to 60 percent of
its full allocable share based on its purchases of Texaco motor gasoline. In support of its claim of injury above the
medium-range presumption level, the firm submitted reconstructed cumulative banked gasoline costs. However,
rather than demonstrating inquiry by the competitive disadvantage methodology, as would typically be the case,
the firm attempted to show that it failed to achieve a historic profit margin based on its average margin in 1971. The
DOE determined that Dewitt's inability to sell gasoline at its 1971 margin during a portion of the refund period may
have resulted from a variety of factors unrelated to Texaco's alleged overcharges. Thus, Dewitt's profit margin
data did not constitute a conclusive showing of injury. However, because the evidence did not show that the firm was
not injured, Dewitt was granted a refund based on the medium-range presumption of injury.

<DOCTITLE>Issuance of Decisions and Orders; Week of September 12 Through September 16, 1994 </DOCTITLE>



During the week of September 12 through September 16, 1994 the decisions and orders summarized below were issued with
respect to appeals and applications for other relief filed with the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the Department
of Energy. The following summary also contains a list of submissions that were dismissed by the Office of Hearings
and Appeals. 


Appeals 





David W. Loveless, 09/13/94, LFA-0410

 


David W. Loveless filed an Appeal from a determination issued by the Robotics Technology Development Program (Robotics
Program) of the DOE's Office of Technology Development in response to a Request for Information submitted under the
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Mr. Loveless sought information regarding the Westinghouse Idaho Nuclear Company
(WINCO) Remote Tank Inspection (RTI) robot, as well as other Westinghouse robotics programs. In considering the
Appeal, the DOE found that there was an inadequate search for materials. Accordingly the Appeal was granted and the
request was remanded for a further search.


 

William D. Lawrence, 09/14/94, LFA-0409




William D. Lawrence filed an Appeal from a determination issued to him by the Deputy Director of the Office of Intergovernmental
Affairs of the DOE's Albuquerque Operations Office (Albuquerque Operations) in response to a Request for Information
submitted under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Albuquerque Operations had withheld in its entirety an Equal
Employment Opportunity (EEO) counseling file under the deliberative process privilege of Exemption 5 and under
Exemption 6 of the FOIA. 

In considering the Appeal, the DOE found that most of the withheld material contained little or no deliberative material.
Accordingly, the DOE found that this material could not be withheld pursuant to Exemption 5 without some further justification
and reference to the policies articulated in the 1993 Memorandum of Attorney General Janet Reno concerning the FOIA.
The DOE did find that some of the material related to a potential settlement was correctly withheld under the ``executive''
privilege of Exemption 5. In considering withholdings under Exemption 6, the DOE found that Albuquerque Operations
had correctly withheld the identities, personal identifiers (such as names, home addresses, phone numbers, and
social security numbers), and information which would identify the EEO Complainant and witnesses on the grounds
that such information would be a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy without any offsetting public
interest. The DOE determined that Albuquerque Operations should either release the remaining material or explain
the basis for withholding. Finally, the DOE agreed with Albuquerque Operations that the EEO Counselor notes were,
in this case, not ``agency records'' because they were not placed in DOE files nor shown to other DOE personnel and were
kept or destroyed at the sole discretion of the EEO Counselor. Accordingly, the Appeal was granted in part, denied
in part, and remanded to Albuquerque Operations for a new determination in accordance with the guidance set forth
in the Decision and Order.

Implementation of Special Refund Procedures 



Sunset Boulevard Car Wash,

 09/12/94, 

LEF-0112




The DOE issued a Decision and Order implementing procedures for the distribution of $52,093.73, plus accrued interest,
in alleged overcharges obtained from Sunset Boulevard Car Wash (Sunset). These funds were remitted by Sunset to the
DOE to settle possible pricing violations with respect to Sunset's sales of refined petroleum products during the
period August 1, 1979 through January 27, 1980. The DOE determined that the funds will be distributed in accordance
with the DOE's Subpart V refund procedures. Applications for Refund will be accepted from customers who purchased
controlled refined petroleum products from Sunset during the period covered by the settlement. The specific information
to be included in the Applications for Refunds, which must be submitted by June 1, 1995, is included in the Decision.




Refund Application 



Charter Company/California,

 09/15/94, 

RM23-270




The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting a Motion for Modification filed by the State of California in the Charter
Company second stage refund proceeding. In its Motion, California proposed to reallocate $850,000 of previously
disbursed Charter monies to fund four transportation-related energy conservation projects. In accordance with
prior Decisions, where we have noted the benefits of similar plans involving public transit and traffic synchronization
systems, the DOE approved California's Motion.

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Issuance of Decisions and Orders; Week of September 19 Through September 23, 1994 </DOCTITLE>



During the week of September 19 through September 23, 1994, the decisions and orders summarized below were issued
with respect to appeals and applications for other relief filed with the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the Department
of Energy. The following summary also contains a list of submissions that were dismissed by the Office of Hearings
and Appeals. 




Appeal 






Consultec Inc., 9/22/94, LFA-0415




Consultec Inc. filed an Appeal from a determination issued by the Office of Placement and Administration of the Department
of Energy in response to a request from Consultec under the Freedom of Information Act. Consultec sought the names
of subcontractors to a DOE contract as well as a copy of any subcontracts that DOE possessed in its files. In considering
the Appeal, the Office of Hearings and Appeals found that the Office of Placement properly withheld the names of subcontractors
under Exemption 4 and performed an adequate search for subcontracts. Accordingly, the Appeal was denied. 

 



Refund Applications 



Enron Corp./Dilts Gas Service, Butane Gas Company, Novak Enterprises, Inc., 9/21/94, RF340-146, RF340-185,
RF340-192




The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning refund applications that Dilts Gas Service (Dilts), Butane Gas Company
(BGC), and Novak Enterprises, Inc. (Novak) had submitted in the Enron Corporation (Enron) special refund proceeding.
The DOE found that those firms were retailers of Enron products who qualified for refunds under the small claim or 60
percent mid-range presumption of injury. However, the DOE found that Energy Refunds, Inc. (ERI) had submitted completely
unrealistic and conflicting gallonage figures for Dilts and had failed to revise these estimates when it submitted
ledger pages documenting the actual gallonage figures for that firm. Accordingly, the DOE found that ERI violated
the terms of its reinstatement order. Energy Refunds, Inc., 24 DOE  85,016 at 88,034 (1994). The DOE granted
Dilts, BGC and Novak a total refund of $44,115.




Telum Inc./Salt River Project Agricultural Improvement and Power District, 9/20/94, RF353-1




The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting an Application for Refund filed by Salt River Project Agricultural Improvement
and Power District (Salt River Project) in the Telum Inc. Subpart V special refund proceeding. In the Implementation
Order establishing the Telum Inc. Subpart V special refund proceeding, the DOE determined that Salt River Project,
a regulated public utility, was the only firm affected by the alleged overcharges that were the subject of the Telum
consent order. Therefore, in the present Decision, Salt River Project was granted a refund equal to the entire collected
amount of the Telum consent order ($56,149.35) plus all interest that has accrued since the Telum consent order funds
were placed in a DOE escrow account. In compliance with the requirements of the Telum Inc. Subpart V Implementation
Order, Salt River Project (i) certified that it will pass the refund it receives through to its customers, (ii) provided
DOE with a full explanation of how it plans to accomplish this restitution, and (iii) certified that it will notify
the appropriate regulatory body of the receipt of the refund.

During the week of September 26 through September 30, 1994, the proposed decision and order summarized below was issued
by the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the Department of Energy with regard to an application for exception. 

Under the procedural regulations that apply to exception proceedings (10 CFR Part 205, Subpart D), any person who
will be aggrieved by the issuance of a proposed decision and order in final form may file a written notice of objection
within ten days of service. For purposes of the procedural regulations, the date of service of notice is deemed to be
the date of publication of this Notice or the date an aggrieved person receives actual notice, whichever occurs first.


The procedural regulations provide that an aggrieved party who fails to file a Notice of Objection within the time
period specified in the regulations will be deemed to consent to the issuance of the proposed decision and order in
final form. An aggrieved party who wishes to contest a determination made in a proposed decision and order must also
file a detailed statement of objections within 30 days of the date of service of the proposed decision and order. In
the statement of objections, the aggrieved party must specify each issue of fact or law that it intends to contest in
any further proceeding involving the exception matter. 

Copies of the full text of this proposed decision and order are available in the Public Reference Room of the Office
of Hearings and Appeals, Room 1E234, Forrestal Building, 1000 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, D.C. 20585,

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Senate report accompanying the FY 1995 Energy and Water Development Appropriation Bill (S. Rep. No. 484, 103rd
Cong., 2nd Sess., pg. 90) recommended that $7 million be committed to continuing the DOE/EPSCoR Program. In accordance
with 10 CFR 600.7(b)(1), and to continue to enhance the competitiveness of states and territories identified for
participation in the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) at the National Science Foundation
(NSF), DOE has decided to continue to restrict eligibility to the following states and territory: Alabama, Arkansas,
Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South
Carolina, South Dakota, Vermont, West Virginia, Wyoming, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. 




Awards issued under this Notice will implement plans formulated under the previously awarded DOE/EPSCoR planning
grants. New awards will provide funding for state management and coordination, human resource development activities,
and research collaboration including student research activities. Approximately two to three new awards will be
issued for a two-year period and up to a maximum of $1.25 million each for activities described above. In addition,
DOE anticipates providing support for three to four renewal awards for projects begun under the DOE/EPSCoR initiative
in FY 1993. Renewal awards will be issued for a one-year period and up to a maximum of $1.25 million. Any remaining balance
of the estimated $7 million will be used to award funds to enable unsuccessful DOE/EPSCoR state committees to upgrade
and refine state energy-related plans. 


In addition, as a tangible measure of an applicant's commitment to the objectives of the DOE/EPSCoR Program, cost-sharing
on a one-to-one ratio is a requirement of this program. Therefore, each application submitted requesting support
from DOE under this Notice must provide, from non-Federal funds, an amount equal to the amount awarded by the DOE; i.e.
for every dollar provided by DOE, the recipient must provide a dollar from non-Federal sources for the project. 


General information about development and submission of applications, eligibility, limitations, evaluation,
and selection processes, and other policies and procedures are contained in the Application Guide for the Office
of Energy Research Financial Assistance Program and in 10 CFR part 605. The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance
number of this program is 81.049.

<DOCTITLE>Banco Santander, S.A.; Application to Engage in Nonbanking Activities</DOCTITLE>




Banco Santander, S.A.

, Madrid Spain, has applied pursuant to section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8)) (``BHC
Act'') and  225.23(a)(3) of the Board's Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.23(a)(3)), to engage 

de novo

 through its subsidiary, Santander Investment Securities, Inc., New York, New York, in the following activities:
(1) Underwriting and dealing in obligations of the United States and Canada, general obligations of states and their
political subdivisions, other obligations that state member banks of the Federal Reserve System may be authorized
to underwrite and deal in, and money market instruments (``bank-eligible securities''); (2) underwriting and dealing,
to a limited extent, in all types of debt securities; (3) underwriting and dealing, to a limited extent, in all types
of equity securities; (4) acting as agent for issuers in the private placement of all types of securities and acting
as a riskless principal with respect to all types of securities; (5) engaging in ``full service brokerage'' by providing
investment and financial advisory services in combination with securities brokerage services; (6) making and servicing
loans; and (7) buying and selling futures and forwards for, options on futures and forwards for, and options on, bank
eligible and ineligible securities solely for hedging purposes, and in the case of instruments based on ineligible
securities, solely as an incident to the proposed underwriting and dealing activities. Applicant proposes to conduct
these activities throughout the United States and the world.
Section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act provides that a bank holding company may, with Board approval, engage in any activity
that the Board, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, has determined by order or regulation to be so closely
related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. This statutory test requires
that two separate tests be met for an activity to be permissible for a bank holding company. First, the Board must determine
that the activity is, as a general matter, closely related to banking. Second, the Board must find in a particular case
that the performance of the activity by the applicant bank holding company may reasonably be expected to produce public
benefits that outweigh possible adverse effects.
A particular activity may be found to meet the ``closely related to banking'' test if it is demonstrated that banks
generally have provided the proposed activity, that banks generally provide services that are so operationally
or functionally similar to the proposed activity as to equip them particularly well to engage in the proposed activity,
or that banks generally provide services that are so integrally related to the proposed activity as to require their
provision in a specialized form. 

National Courier Ass'n v. Board of Governors

, 516 F.2d 1229, 1237 (D.C. Cir. 1975). In addition, the Board may consider any other basis that may demonstrate that
the activity has a reasonable or close relationship to banking or managing or controlling banks. Board Statement
Regarding Regulation Y, 49 FR 806 (1984).
Banco Santander states that the Board previously has determined by regulation that some of the proposed activities,
when conducted within limitations established by the Board, are closely related to banking for purposes of section
4(c)(8) of the BHC Act. 

See

 12 CFR 225.25(b)(1) (making and servicing loans); 12 CFR 225.25 (b)(15) (full-service brokerage services); 12 CFR
225.25(b)(16) (underwriting and dealing in bank-eligible securities).
Banco Santander also states that the Board has determined by order that the remaining proposed activities, when conducted
within limitations established by the Board in previous orders, are closely related to banking.

Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank

, 77 Federal Reserve Bulletin 184 (1991) (trading in derivatives of bank-ineligible securities for hedging purposes
as an incident to approved underwriting and dealing activities).
Banco Santander maintains that it and Santander Investment Securities would conduct these previously approved
activities in conformance with the conditions and limitations established by the Board in prior cases, including
the Board's 10 percent revenue limitation on underwriting and dealing activities. For this reason, Banco Santander
contends that approval of the application would not be barred by section 20 of the Glass-Steagall Act (12 U.S.C. 377),
which prohibits the affiliation of a state member bank with any company principally engaged in the underwriting,
public sale, or distribution of securities.
In order to approve the proposal, the Board must determine that the proposed activities ``can reasonably be expected
to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency, that
outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition,
conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices.'' 12 U.S.C.  1843(c)(8). Banco Santander states that the proposal
will produce public benefits that outweigh any potential adverse effects. In particular, Banco Santander maintains
that the proposal will enhance competition and enable it to offer its customers a broader range of products. In addition,
Banco Santander states that the proposed activities will not result in adverse effects such as an undue concentration
of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, or unsound banking practices.
In publishing the proposal for comment, the Board does not take a position on issues raised by the proposal. Notice
of the proposal is published solely to seek the views of interested persons on the issues presented by the application
and does not represent a determination by the Board that the proposal meets, or is likely to meet, the standards of the
BHC Act.
Any comments or requests for hearing should be submitted in writing to William W. Wiles, Secretary, Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, D.C. 20551, not later than November 15, 1994. Any request for a hearing
on this application must, as required by  262.3(e) of the Board's Rules of Procedure (12 CFR 262.3(e)), be accompanied
by a statement of reasons why a written presentation would not suffice in lieu of a hearing, identifying specifically
any questions of fact that are in dispute, summarizing the evidence that would be presented at a hearing, and indicating
how the party commenting would be aggrieved by approval of the proposal.
This application may be inspected at the offices of the Board of Governors or the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

Definitions



For purposes of this Order, the following definitions shall apply:

``Volatile Organic Compound'' (``VOC'') means any compound of carbon which participates in atmospheric photochemical
reactions as defined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency at 40 CFR 51.100(s), and as subsequently amended.
When the final rule was promulaged, 57 FR 3941 (February 3, 1992), the EPA definition excluded carbon monoxide, carbon
dioxide, carbonic acid, metallic carbides or carbonates, ammonium carbonate and certain listed compounds that
EPA has determined are of negligible photochemical reactivity.

``Class I ozone-depleting substance'' means a substance that harms the environment by destroying ozone in the upper
atmosphere and is listed as such in Title 6 of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-549, and any
other substance which may in the future be added to the list pursuant to Title 6 of the Act. Class I substances currently
include chlorofluorocarbons, halons, carbon tetrachloride, and 1,1,1-trichloroethane.

``Class II ozone-depleting substance'' means a substance that harms the environment by destroying ozone in the upper
atmosphere and is listed as such in Title 6 of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-549, and any
other substance which may in the future be added to the list pursuant to Title 6 of the Act. Class II substances currently
include hydrochlorofluorocarbons.

``Product or package'' means any product or package that is offered for sale, sold or distributed to the public by respondent,
its successors and assigns, under the Funny Color Foam brand name or any other brand name of respondent, its successors
and assigns; and also means any product or package sold or distributed to the public by third parties under private
labeling agreements with respondent, its successors and assigns.

``Competent and reliable scientific evidence'' means tests, analyses, research, studies or other evidence based
on the expertise of professionals in the relevant area, that has been conducted and evaluated in an objective manner
by persons qualified to do so, using procedures generally accepted in the profession to yield accurate and reliable
results.

Analysis of Consent Order To Aid Public Comment


The Federal Trade Commission has accepted an agreement, subject to final approval, to a proposed consent order from
respondent Creative Aerosol Corporation, a Delaware corporation. 
The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
and take other appropriate action, or make final the agreement's proposed order. 
This matter concerns the labeling and advertising of the respondent's Funny Color Foam soap. The Commission's complaint
in this matter alleges that Funny Color Foam soap is sold in an aluminum aerosol can with a plastic cap which is made from
high-density polyethylene. The product contained the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) isobutane and propane
and was then reformulated by substituting for the VOCs hydrochlorofluorocarbon_chlorodifluoromethane (HCFC-22).
The Commission's complaint charges that the respondent made the following advertising claims while the product
contained VOCs: ``ENVIRONMENTALLY SAFE Contains no fluorocarbons. Non-Irritant. Non-toxic.'' The complaint
alleges that through such claims, the respondent represented without substantiation that Funny Color Foam does
not contain any ingredients that harm or damage the environment. In fact, Funny Color Foam contained VOCs_chemicals
that under many atmospheric conditions contribute to the formation of ground level ozone, a major component of smog.

The complaint also charges that the respondent claimed that its reformulated product contains ``NO FLUOROCARBONS.''
The complaint alleges that through this claim, the respondent falsely represented that because Funny Color Foam
contains no fluorocarbons, it will not deplete the earth's ozone layer or otherwise harm or damage the atmosphere.
In fact, Funny Color Foam contains the harmful ozone-depleting ingredient chlorodifluoromethane (HCFC-22),
which harms or causes damage to the atmosphere by contributing to the depletion of the earth's ozone layer. 
In addition, the complaint charges that the respondent falsely represented that Funny Color Foam's aluminum aerosol
can and plastic cap are recyclable. In fact, the complaint alleges, while the aluminum can and plastic cap are capable
of being recycled, the vast majority of consumers cannot recycle them because there are virtually no collection facilities
that accept aluminum aerosol cans for recycling and only a few collection facilities nationwide that accept the high-density
polyethylene cap for recycling.

<DOCNO> FR941031-2-00073 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941031-2-00054 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The proposed consent order contains provisions designed to remedy the violations charged and to prevent the respondent
from engaging in similar acts and practices in the future. 

The term ``volatile organic compound'' (VOC) is defined in the consent order in accordance with the definition adopted
by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in a February 3, 1992, rulemaking. To assist the public and the industry
in understanding the coverage of this order, those compounds that EPA expressly excluded from the definition of VOC
at the time the definition was promulgated are listed in the order. Because EPA could in the future modify the definition
based on evolving scientific evidence, the term VOC as used in the order will vary depending upon EPA's definition
of the term. Those compounds that EPA may decide should be excluded from the definition of VOC because of negligible
photochemical reactivity will thus be excluded under the consent order. Likewise any compounds that EPA may decide
should be defined as VOCs will be covered by the order. 

The proposed order also defines Class I and Class II ozone-depleting substances, incorporating the definitions
established in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. Class I substances currently listed under the Act include CFCs,
halons, carbon tetrachloride, and 1,1,1-trichloroethane. Class II substances currently consist of HCFCs. 

Part I of the proposed order requires the respondent to cease and desist from representing that any product or package
containing volatile organic compounds is ``environmentally safe,'' ``environmentally safe, contains no fluorocarbons,''
contains ``no fluorocarbons,'' or through the use of any other term or expression, that any such product or package
will not harm the environment or the atmosphere, unless the respondent possesses competent and reliable evidence,
which when appropriate must be competent and reliable scientific evidence, that substantiates the representation.


Part II of the proposed order requires the respondent to cease and desist from representing that any product or package
containing any Class I or Class II ozone-depleting substance contains ``no fluorocarbons'' or representing, in
any manner, that any such product or package will not deplete, destroy, or otherwise adversely affect ozone in the
upper atmosphere or otherwise harm the atmosphere. 

Under the Clean Air Act Amendments, the EPA has authority to add new chemicals to the Class I and Class II lists. In fact,
EPA has added methyl bromide and hydrobromofluorocarbons (HBFCs) to the list of Class I substances. Thus, the order's
definitions of Class I and Class II ozone-depleting substances include these and any other substances that may be
added to the lists. If additional substances are added to the Class I or II lists, Part II of the order becomes applicable
to claims made for products containing those substances after the substances are added to the lists. 

Part III of the proposed order requires that the respondent cease and desist from misrepresenting, in any manner,
directly or by implication, with respect to any product or package the extent to which it is capable of being recycled
or the extent to which recycling collection programs are available. Part III also contains a proviso that allows the
respondent to advertise high-density polyethylene caps and aluminum aerosol cans as recyclable without violating
Part III of the order. The respondent may do so if it truthfully represents that such packaging is capable of being recycled;
discloses clearly, prominently and in close proximity to such claim (a) that such packaging is recyclable in the few
communities with recycling collection programs for high-density polyethylene caps or aluminum aerosol cans; or
(b) the approximate number of U.S. communities with recycling collection programs for such packaging; or (c) the
approximate percentage of U.S. communities or the U.S. population to which recycling collection programs for such
packaging is available; and in addition, in the case of the high-density polyethylene cap, the cap itself bears a clear
identification of the specific plastic resin(s) from which it is made. 

Part IV of the proposed order provides that if the respondent represents in advertising or labeling that any product
or package offers any environmental benefit, it must have a reasonable basis consisting of competent and reliable
evidence, which when appropriate must be competent and reliable scientific evidence, that substantiates the claims.


The proposed order also requires the respondent to maintain materials relied upon to substantiate the claims covered
by the order, to distribute copies of the order to certain company officials, to notify the Commission of any changes
in corporate structure that might affect compliance with the order, and to file one or more reports detailing compliance
with the order. 

The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed order. It is not intended to constitute
an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed order or to modify in any way their terms.

Analysis of Proposed Consent Order To Aid Public Comment 



The Federal Trade Commission has accepted an agreement to a proposed consent order from respondents Notations, Inc.,
and Kurt Erman, individually and as an officer of the corporation. 

The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
or make final the agreement's proposed order. 

The complaint alleges that respondents misbranded certain textile fiber products by using the trade name Micro Silk,
thereby implying that silk, a fiber not present in the products, was present. These acts and practices are in violation
of the Textile Fiber Products Identification Act, 15 U.S.C. 70; the Commission's Rules and Regulations Under the
Textile Fiber Products Identification Act, 16 CFR 303; and Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C.
 45. 

The proposed order requires that the company cease and desist (1) Mentioning or implying fiber content without using
the generic fiber names in a manner consistent with the Act and Rules, and (2) mentioning or implying fiber content
for a fiber that is not present in a textile fiber product. 

The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed order, and it is not intended to constitute
an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed order or to modify in any way their terms.

 Notice. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Secretary has determined_(1) A 2.8 percent cost-of-living increase in Social Security benefits under title
II, effective for December 1994; 


(2) An increase in the Federal Supplemental Security Income (SSI) monthly benefit amounts under title XVI for 1995
to $458 for an eligible individual, $687 for an eligible individual with an eligible spouse, and $229 for an essential
person;

(6) The dollar amounts (``bend points'') used in the benefit formula for workers who become eligible for benefits
in 1995 and in the formula for computing maximum family benefits; 
(7) The amount of earnings a person must have to be credited with a quarter of coverage in 1995 to be $630; 
(8) The ``old-law'' contribution and benefit base to be $45,300 for 1995; and 
(9) The OASDI fund ratio to be 116.6 percent for 1994.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
The Secretary is required by the Social Security Act (the Act) to publish within 45 days after the close of the third
calendar quarter of 1994 the benefit increase percentage and the revised table of ``special minimum'' benefits (section
215(i)(2)(D)). Also, the Secretary is required to publish on or before November 1 the national average wage index
for 1993 (section 215(a)(1)(D)), the OASDI fund ratio for 1994 (section 215(i)(2)(C)(ii)), the OASDI contribution
and benefit base for 1995 (section 230(a)), the amount of earnings required to be credited with a quarter of coverage
in 1995 (section 213(d)(2)), the monthly exempt amounts under the Social Security retirement earnings test for 1995
(section 203(f)(8)(A)), the formula for computing a primary insurance amount for workers who first become eligible
for benefits or die in 1995 (section 215(a)(1)(D)), and the formula for computing the maximum amount of benefits payable
to the family of a worker who first becomes eligible for old-age benefits or dies in 1995 (section 203(a)(2)(C)). 


Cost-of-Living Increases 


General


The cost-of-living increase is 2.8 percent for benefits under titles II and XVI of the Act. 
Under title II, OASDI benefits will increase by 2.8 percent beginning with the December 1994 benefits, which are payable
on January 3, 1995. This increase is based on the authority contained in section 215(i) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 415(i)).

Under title XVI, Federal SSI payment levels will also increase by 2.8 percent effective for payments made for the month
of January 1995 but paid on December 30, 1994. This is based on the authority contained in section 1617 of the Act (42
U.S.C. 1382f). The percentage increase effective January 1995 is the same as the title II percentage increase and
the annual payment amount is rounded, when not a multiple of $12, to the next lower multiple of $12. 


Automatic Benefit Increase Computation


Under section 215(i) of the Act, the third calendar quarter of 1994 is a cost-of-living computation quarter for all
the purposes of the Act. The Secretary is, therefore, required to increase benefits, effective with December 1994,
for individuals entitled under section 227 or 228 of the Act, to increase primary insurance amounts of all other individuals
entitled under title II of the Act, and to increase maximum benefits payable to a family. For December 1994, the benefit
increase is the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers from the
third quarter of 1993 through the third quarter of 1994. 
Section 215(i)(1) of the Act provides that the Consumer Price Index for a cost-of-living computation quarter shall
be the arithmetic mean of this index for the 3 months in that quarter. The Department of Labor's Consumer Price Index
for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers for each month in the quarter ending September 30, 1993, was: For July 1993,
142.1; for August 1993, 142.4; and for September 1993, 142.6. The arithmetic mean for this calendar quarter is 142.4
(after rounding to the nearest 0.1). The corresponding Consumer Price Index for each month in the quarter ending September
30, 1994, was: for July 1994, 145.8; for August 1994, 146.5; and for September 1994, 146.9. The arithmetic mean for
this calendar quarter is 146.4. Thus, because the Consumer Price Index for the calendar quarter ending September
30, 1994, exceeds that for the calendar quarter ending September 30, 1993 by 2.8 percent, a cost-of-living benefit
increase of 2.8 percent is effective for benefits under title II of the Act beginning December 1994. 


Title II Benefit Amounts 


In accordance with section 215(i) of the Act, in the case of insured workers and family members for whom eligibility
for benefits (i.e., the worker's attainment of age 62, or disability or death before age 62) occurred before 1995,
benefits will increase by 2.8 percent beginning with benefits for December 1994 which are payable on January 3, 1995.
In the case of first eligibility after 1994, the 2.8 percent increase will not apply. 
For eligibility after 1978, benefits are generally determined by a benefit formula provided by the Social Security
Amendments of 1977 (Pub. L. 95-216), as described later in this notice.

For eligibility before 1979, benefits are determined by means of a benefit table. In accordance with section 215(i)(4)
of the Act, the primary insurance amounts and the maximum family benefits shown in this table are revised by (1) Increasing
by 2.8 percent the corresponding amounts established by the last cost-of-living increase and the last extension
of the benefit table made under section 215(i)(4) (to reflect the increase in the OASDI contribution and benefit base
for 1994); and (2) by extending the table to reflect the higher monthly wage and related benefit amounts now possible
under the increased contribution and benefit base for 1995, as described later in this notice. A copy of this table
may be obtained by writing to: Social Security Administration, Office of Public Inquiries, 4100 Annex, Baltimore,
MD 21235. 
Section 215(i)(2)(D) of the Act also requires that, when the Secretary determines an automatic increase in Social
Security benefits, the Secretary shall publish in the 

Federal Register

 a revision of the range of the primary insurance amounts and corresponding maximum family benefits based on the dollar
amount and other provisions described in section 215(a)(1)(C)(i). These benefits are referred to as ``special minimum''
benefits and are payable to certain individuals with long periods of relatively low earnings. To qualify for such
benefits, an individual must have at least 11 ``years of coverage.'' To earn a year of coverage for purposes of the special
minimum, a person must earn at least a certain proportion (25 percent for years before 1991, and 15 percent for years
after 1990) of the ``old-law'' contribution and benefit base. In accordance with section 215(a)(1)(C)(i), the table
below shows the revised range of primary insurance amounts and corresponding maximum family benefit amounts after
the 2.8 percent benefit increase. 


 

Section 227 of the Act provides flat-rate benefits to a worker who became age 72 before 1969 and was not insured under
the usual requirements, and to his or her spouse or surviving spouse. Section 228 of the Act provides similar benefits
at age 72 for certain uninsured persons. The current monthly benefit amount of $183.40 for an individual under sections
227 and 228 of the Act is increased by 2.8 percent to obtain the new amount of $188.50. The present monthly benefit amount
of $91.80 for a spouse under section 227 is increased by 2.8 percent to $94.30. 


Title XVI Benefit Amounts 


In accordance with section 1617 of the Act, Federal SSI benefit amounts for the aged, blind, and disabled are increased
by 2.8 percent effective January 1995. Therefore, the yearly Federal SSI benefit amounts of $5,352 for an eligible
individual, $8,028 for an eligible individual with an eligible spouse, and $2,676 for an essential person, which
became effective January 1994, are increased, effective January 1995, to $5,496, $8,244, and $2,748, respectively,
after rounding. The corresponding monthly amounts for 1995 are determined by dividing the yearly amounts by 12, giving
$458, $687, and $229, respectively. The monthly amount is reduced by subtracting monthly countable income. In the
case of an eligible individual with an eligible spouse, the amount payable is further divided equally between the
two spouses. 


National Average Wage Index for 1993 


General 


Under various provisions of the Act, several amounts are scheduled to increase automatically for 1995. These include
(1) The OASDI contribution and benefit base, (2) the retirement test exempt amounts, (3) the dollar amounts, or ``bend
points,'' in the primary insurance amount and maximum family benefit formulas, (4) the amount of earnings required
for a worker to be credited with a quarter of coverage, and (5) the ``old law'' contribution and benefit base (as determined
under section 230 of the Act as in effect before the 1977 amendments). These amounts are based on the annual increase
in the average of the total wages. Section 321(e) of the ``Social Security Independence and Program Improvements
Act of 1994'' (Pub. L. 103-296), enacted August 15, 1994, provided the name ``national average wage index''
for the average of the total wages. This new designation will be used throughout this notice. 
Section 321(g) of the new legislation also revised the formula used to determine the OASDI contribution and benefit
base, the retirement test exempt amounts, and the old-law contribution and benefit base. Under the old formula, the
determination in a given year of the next year's amount was the product of the current year's amount and the ratio of
(1) The prior year's national average wage index to (2) the second prior year's average wage index. (For example, the
determination of the 1995 contribution and benefit base under the old formula would have been the product of the 1994
base times the ratio of the 1993 national average wage index to the 1992 average wage index.) 
The revised formula differs from the old formula in that the current year's amount is replaced by the amount in effect
for 1994 and the national average wage index for the second prior year is replaced by the 1992 national average wage
index. Thus, the revised formula can be stated as follows: the determination in a given year of the next year's amount
is the product of the 1994 amount and the ratio of (1) The prior year's national average wage index to (2) the 1992 national
average wage index. 
Under both the old and the revised formula, the resulting dollar amounts are rounded_to the nearest multiple of $300
in the case of each of the two types of contribution and benefit bases, and to the nearest $10 in the case of the monthly
retirement test exempt amounts. By using fixed amounts in the revised formula, cumulative rounding distortions
are eliminated. 
For the first determinations under the revised formula, the resulting amounts are the same as those that would have
been determined under the old formula. For subsequent determinations, this may not be the case. 


Computation 


The determination of the national average wage index for calendar year 1993 is based on the 1992 national average wage
index of $22,935.42 announced in the Federal Register

 on October 28, 1993 (58 FR 58004), along with the percentage increase in average wages from 1992 to 1993 measured by
annual wage data tabulated by the Social Security Administration (SSA). The wage data tabulated by SSA include contributions
to deferred compensation plans, as required by section 209(k) of the Act. The average amounts of wages calculated
directly from this data were $22,001.92 and $22,191.14 for 1992 and 1993, respectively. To determine the national
average wage index for 1993 at a level that is consistent with the national average wage indexing series for 1951 through
1977 (published December 29, 1978, at 43 FR 61016), we multiplied the 1992 national average wage index of $22,935.42
by the percentage increase in average wages from 1992 to 1993 (based on SSA-tabulated wage data) as follows (with the
result rounded to the nearest cent): 



Amount 


The national average wage index for 1993 is $22,935.42 times $22,191.14 divided by $22,001.92, which equals $23,132.67.
Therefore, the national average wage index for calendar year 1993 is determined to be $23,132.67. 


OASDI Contribution and Benefit Base 


General 


The OASDI contribution and benefit base is $61,200 for remuneration paid in 1995 and self-employment income earned
in taxable years beginning in 1995. 
The OASDI contribution and benefit base serves two purposes: 
(a) It is the maximum annual amount of earnings on which OASDI taxes are paid. The OASDI tax rate for remuneration paid
in 1995 is set by statute at 6.2 percent for employees and employers, each. The OASDI tax rate for self-employment income
earned in taxable years beginning in 1995 is 12.4 percent. (The Hospital Insurance tax is due on remuneration, without
limitation, paid in 1995, at the rate of 1.45 percent for employees and employers, each, and on self-employment income
earned in taxable years beginning in 1995, at the rate of 2.9 percent.) 
(b) It is the maximum annual amount used in determining a person's OASDI benefits.

Computation


Section 321(g) of the ``Social Security Independence and Program Improvements Act of 1994'' amended section 230(b)
of the Act. As noted above, the amendment provided a technical change to the formula used to determine the OASDI contribution
and benefit base. Under the revised formula, the base for 1995 shall be equal to the larger of the current base ($60,600)
or the 1994 base of $60,600 multiplied by the ratio of the national average wage index for 1993 to that for 1992. If the
amount so determined is not a multiple of $300, it shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of $300. 


Amount 


The ratio of the national average wage index for 1993, $23,132.67 as determined above, compared to that for 1992, $22,935.42,
is 1.0086002. Multiplying the 1994 OASDI contribution and benefit base amount of $60,600 by the ratio of 1.0086002
produces the amount of $61,121.17 which must then be rounded to $61,200. Accordingly, the OASDI contribution and
benefit base is determined to be $61,200 for 1995. 


Retirement Earnings Test Exempt Amounts 


General 


Social Security benefits are withheld when a beneficiary under age 70 has earnings in excess of the retirement earnings
test exempt amount. A formula for determining the monthly exempt amounts is provided in section 203(f)(8)(B) of the
Act. The 1994 monthly exempt amounts were determined by the formula to be $930 for beneficiaries aged 65-69 and
$670 for beneficiaries under age 65. Thus, the annual exempt amounts for 1994 were set at $11,160 and $8,040, respectively.
For beneficiaries aged 65-69, $1 in benefits is withheld for every $3 of earnings in excess of the annual exempt
amount. For beneficiaries under age 65, $1 in benefits is withheld for every $2 of earnings in excess of the annual exempt
amount. 


Computation 


Section 321(g) of the ``Social Security Independence and Program Improvements Act of 1994'' also amended the indexing
formula provided in section 203(f)(8)(B) of the Act. Under the revised formula, each monthly exempt amount for 1995
shall be the larger of the corresponding 1994 monthly exempt amount or the corresponding 1994 monthly exempt amount
multiplied by the ratio of the national average wage index for 1993 to that for 1992. The ratio of the national average
wage index for 1993, $23,132.67 as determined above, compared to that for 1992, $22,935.42, is 1.0086002. Section
203(f)(8)(B) further provides that if the amount so determined is not a multiple of $10, it shall be rounded to the nearest
multiple of $10. 


Exempt Amount for Beneficiaries Aged 65 Through 69 


Multiplying the 1994 retirement earnings test monthly exempt amount of $930 by the ratio of 1.0086002 produces the
amount of $938.00. This must then be rounded to $940. The retirement earnings test monthly exempt amount for beneficiaries
aged 65 through 69 is determined to be $940 for 1995. The corresponding retirement earnings test annual exempt amount
for these beneficiaries is $11,280. 


Exempt Amount for Beneficiaries Under Age 65 


Multiplying the 1994 retirement earnings test monthly exempt amount of $670 by the ratio 1.0086002 produces the amount
of $675.76. This must then be rounded to $680. The retirement earnings test monthly exempt amount for beneficiaries
under age 65 is thus determined to be $680 for 1995. The corresponding retirement earnings test annual exempt amount
for these beneficiaries is $8,160. 


Computing Benefits After 1978 


General 


The Social Security Amendments of 1977 provided a method for computing benefits which generally applies when a worker
first becomes eligible for benefits after 1978. This method uses the worker's ``average indexed monthly earnings''
to compute the primary insurance amount. The computation formula is adjusted automatically each year to reflect
changes in general wage levels, as measured by the national average wage index. 
A worker's earnings are adjusted, or ``indexed,'' to reflect the change in general wage levels that occurred during
the worker's years of employment. Such indexation ensures that a worker's future benefits reflect the general rise
in the standard of living that occurs during his or her working lifetime. A certain number of years of earnings are needed
to compute the average indexed monthly earnings. After the number of years is determined, those years with the highest
indexed earnings are chosen, the indexed earnings are summed, and the total amount is divided by the total number of
months in those years. The resulting average amount is then rounded down to the next lower dollar amount. The result
is the average indexed monthly earnings. 
For example, to compute the average indexed monthly earnings for a worker attaining age 62, becoming disabled before
age 62, or dying before attaining age 62, in 1995, the national average wage index for 1993, $23,132.67, is divided
by the national average wage index for each year prior to 1993 in which the worker had earnings. The actual wages and
self-employment income, as defined in section 211(b) of the Act and credited for each year, is multiplied by the corresponding
ratio to obtain the worker's indexed earnings for each year before 1993. Any earnings in 1993 or later are considered
at face value, without indexing. The average indexed monthly earnings is then computed and used to determine the worker's
primary insurance amount for 1995. 


Computing the Primary Insurance Amount 


The primary insurance amount is the sum of three separate percentages of portions of the average indexed monthly earnings.
In 1979 (the first year the formula was in effect), these portions were the first $180, the amount between $180 and $1,085,
and the amount over $1,085. The dollar amounts in the formula which govern the portions of the average indexed monthly
earnings are frequently referred to as the ``bend points'' of the formula. Thus, the bend points for 1979 were $180
and $1,085.

<PARENT> FR941031-2-00063 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The bend points for 1995 are obtained by multiplying the corresponding 1979 bend-point amounts by the ratio between
the national average wage index for 1993, $23,132.67, and for 1977, $9,779.44. These results are then rounded to the
nearest dollar. For 1995, the ratio is 2.3654391. Multiplying the 1979 amounts of $180 and $1,085 by 2.3654391 produces
the amounts of $425.78 and $2,566.50. These must then be rounded to $426 and $2,567. Accordingly, the portions of the
average indexed monthly earnings to be used in 1995 are determined to be the first $426, the amount between $426 and
$2,567, and the amount over $2,567. 
Consequently, for individuals who first become eligible for old-age insurance benefits or disability insurance
benefits in 1995, or who die in 1995 before becoming eligible for benefits, we will compute their primary insurance
amount by adding the following: 
(a) 90 percent of the first $426 of their average indexed monthly earnings, plus 
(b) 32 percent of the average indexed monthly earnings over $426 and through $2,567, plus 
(c) 15 percent of the average indexed monthly earnings over $2,567. 
This amount is then rounded to the next lower multiple of $.10 if it is not already a multiple of $.10. This formula and
the adjustments we have described are contained in section 215(a) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 415(a)). 


Maximum Benefits Payable to a Family 


General 


The 1977 amendments continued the long established policy of limiting the total monthly benefits which a worker's
family may receive based on his or her primary insurance amount. Those amendments also continued the then existing
relationship between maximum family benefits and primary insurance amounts but did change the method of computing
the maximum amount of benefits which may be paid to a worker's family. The Social Security Disability Amendments of
1980 (Pub. L. 96-265) established a new formula for computing the maximum benefits payable to the family of a
disabled worker. This new formula is applied to the family benefits of workers who first become entitled to disability
insurance benefits after June 30, 1980, and who first become eligible for these benefits after 1978. The new formula
was explained in a final rule published in the 

Federal Register

 on May 8, 1981, at 46 FR 25601. For disabled workers initially entitled to disability benefits before July 1980, or
whose disability began before 1979, the family maximum payable is computed the same as the old-age and survivor family
maximum. 


Computing the Old-Age and Survivor Family Maximum


The formula used to compute the family maximum is similar to that used to compute the primary insurance amount. It involves
computing the sum of four separate percentages of portions of the worker's primary insurance amount. In 1979, these
portions were the first $230, the amount between $230 and $332, the amount between $332 and $433, and the amount over
$433. The dollar amounts in the formula which govern the portions of the primary insurance amount are frequently referred
to as the ``bend points'' of the family-maximum formula. Thus, the bend points for 1979 were $230, $332, and $433. 
The bend points for 1995 are obtained by multiplying the corresponding 1979 bend-point amounts by the ratio between
the national average wage index for 1993, $23,132.67, and the average for 1977, $9,779.44. This amount is then rounded
to the nearest dollar. For 1995, the ratio is 2.3654391. Multiplying the amounts of $230, $332, and $433 by 2.3654391
produces the amounts of $544.05, $785.33, and $1,024.24. These amounts are then rounded to $544, $785, and $1,024.
Accordingly, the portions of the primary insurance amounts to be used in 1995 are determined to be the first $544, the
amount between $544 and $785, the amount between $785 and $1,024, and the amount over $1,024. 
Consequently, for the family of a worker who becomes age 62 or dies in 1995 before age 62, the total amount of benefits
payable to them will be computed so that it does not exceed: 
(a) 150 percent of the first $544 of the worker's primary insurance amount, plus 
(b) 272 percent of the worker's primary insurance amount over $544 through $785, plus 
(c) 134 percent of the worker's primary insurance amount over $785 through $1,024, plus 
(d) 175 percent of the worker's primary insurance amount over $1,024. 
This amount is then rounded to the next lower multiple of $.10 if it is not already a multiple of $.10. This formula and
the adjustments we have described are contained in section 203(a) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 403(a)). 


Quarter of Coverage Amount 


General


The 1995 amount of earnings required for a quarter of coverage is $630. A quarter of coverage is the basic unit for determining
whether a worker is insured under the Social Security program. For years before 1978, an individual generally was
credited with a quarter of coverage for each quarter in which wages of $50 or more were paid, or an individual was credited
with 4 quarters of coverage for every taxable year in which $400 or more of self-employment income was earned. Beginning
in 1978, wages generally are no longer reported on a quarterly basis; instead, annual reports are made. With the change
to annual reporting, section 352(b) of the Social Security Amendments of 1977 (Pub. L. 95-216) amended section
213(d) of the Act to provide that a quarter of coverage would be credited for each $250 of an individual's total wages
and self-employment income for calendar year 1978 (up to a maximum of 4 quarters of coverage for the year). 


Computation 


Under the prescribed formula, the quarter of coverage amount for 1995 shall be equal to the larger of the current amount
of $620 or the 1978 amount of $250 multiplied by the ratio of the national average wage index for 1993 to that for 1976.
The national average wage index for 1976 was previously determined to be $9,226.48. This was published in the 

Federal Register

 on December 29, 1978, at 43 FR 61016. The average wage index for 1993 is $23,132.67 as determined above. Section 213(d)
further provides that if the amount so determined is not a multiple of $10, it shall be rounded to the nearest multiple
of $10. 


Quarter of Coverage Amount


The ratio of the national average wage index for 1993, $23,132.67, compared to that for 1976, $9,226.48, is 2.5072043.
Multiplying the 1978 quarter of coverage amount of $250 by the ratio of 2.5072043 produces the amount of $626.80, which
must then be rounded to $630. Accordingly, the quarter of coverage amount is determined to be $630 for 1995. 


``Old-Law'' Contribution and Benefit Base 


General 


The 1995 ``old-law'' contribution and benefit base is $45,300. This is the base that would have been effective under
the Act without the enactment of the 1977 amendments. The base is computed under section 230(b) of the Act as it read
prior to the 1977 amendments. 





</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941031-2-00089 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941031-2-00063 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The ``old-law'' contribution and benefit base is used by: 
(a) the Railroad Retirement program to determine certain tax liabilities and tier II benefits payable under that
program to supplement the tier I payments which correspond to basic Social Security benefits, 
(b) the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to determine the maximum amount of pension guaranteed under the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act (as stated in section 230(d) of the Act), 
(c) Social Security to determine a year of coverage in computing the special minimum benefit, as described earlier,
and 
(d) Social Security to determine a year of coverage (acquired whenever earnings equal or exceed 25 percent of the ``old-law''
base for this purpose only) in computing benefits for persons who are also eligible to receive pensions based on employment
not covered under section 210 of the Act. 


Computation



The base is computed using the automatic adjustment formula in section 230(b) of the Act as it read prior to the enactment
of the 1977 amendments, but with the revised indexing formula introduced by section 321(g) of the ``Social Security
Independence and Program Improvements Act of 1994.'' Under the formula, the ``old-law'' contribution and benefit
base shall be the larger of the current ``old-law'' base ($45,000) or the 1994 ``old-law'' base ($45,000) multiplied
by the ratio of the national average wage index for 1993 to that for 1992. If the amount so determined is not a multiple
of $300, it shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of $300. 


Amount


The ratio of the national average wage index for 1993, $23,132.67 as determined above, compared to that for 1992, $22,935.42,
is 1.0086002. Multiplying the 1994 ``old-law'' contribution and benefit base amount of $45,000 by the ratio of 1.0086002
produces the amount of $45,387.01 which must then be rounded to $45,300. Accordingly, the ``old-law'' contribution
and benefit base is determined to be $45,300 for 1995. 


OASDI Fund Ratio 


General 


Section 215(i) of the Act provides for automatic cost-of-living increases in OASDI benefit amounts. This section
also includes a ``stabilizer'' provision that can limit the automatic OASDI benefit increase under certain circumstances.
If the combined assets of the OASI and DI Trust Funds, as a percentage of annual expenditures, are below a specified
threshold, the automatic benefit increase is equal to the lesser of (1) The increase in the national average wage index
or (2) the increase in prices. The threshold specified for the OASDI fund ratio is 20.0 percent for benefit increases
for December of 1989 and later. The law also provides for subsequent ``catch-up'' benefit increases for beneficiaries
whose previous benefit increases were affected by this provision. ``Catch-up'' benefit increases can occur only
when trust fund assets exceed 32.0 percent of annual expenditures. 



Computation



Section 215(i) specifies the computation and application of the OASDI fund ratio. The OASDI fund ratio for 1994 is
the ratio of (1) the combined assets of the OASI and DI Trust Funds at the beginning of 1994 to (2) the estimated expenditures
of the OASI and DI Trust Funds during 1994, excluding transfer payments between the OASI and DI Trust Funds, and reducing
any transfers to the Railroad Retirement Account by any transfers from that account into either trust fund. 


Ratio 



The combined assets of the OASI and DI Trust Funds at the beginning of 1994 equaled $378,285 million, and the expenditures
are estimated to be $324,516 million. Thus, the OASDI fund ratio for 1994 is 116.6 percent, which exceeds the applicable
threshold of 20.0 percent. Therefore, the stabilizer provision does not affect the benefit increase for December
1994. Although the OASDI fund ratio exceeds the 32.0-percent threshold for potential ``catch-up'' benefit increases,
no past benefit increase has been reduced under the stabilizer provision. Thus, no ``catch-up'' benefit increase
is required.

<DOCTITLE>Willow Beach Development Concept Plan Amendment; Lake Mead National Recreation Area, Arizona and Nevada; Notice
of Actions Proposed to be Located in or Impact a Floodplain and Notice of Availability of Final Supplemental Environmental
Impact Statement </DOCTITLE>



<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Pursuant to section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (Pub. L. 91-190 as amended),
the National Park Service has prepared a supplemental environmental impact statement (SEIS), to the General Management
Plan/Final Environmental Impact Statement (GMP/FEIS) for the Lake Mead National Recreation Area, in conjunction
with an amended Development Concept Plan (DCP) for Willow Beach on the Arizona side of Lake Mohave. Pursuant to Executive
Order 11988, Floodplain Management, the National Park Service has prepared a 

Statement of Findings

 for the proposed plan. 



The DCP Amendment/SEIS describes and analyzes four alternative development concept plans for Willow Beach. The
final proposal, Alternative C in the SEIS, differs in some minor respects from the draft proposal because of revisions
in response to public comment. The proposal focuses on enhancement of visitor experience along the riverfront at
Willow Beach with the addition of picnic areas, fishing piers, walkways, small docks, and additional parking. Parking
spaces would be increased to 510 spaces from the existing 330. The existing trailer village, motel, a dry boat storage
and restaurant/store, currently located within high hazard floodplain areas, would be eliminated. A new building
consolidating retail, restaurant, visitor contact, restrooms, and fuel service functions would be constructed
on the northern side of Willow Beach Wash, which would allow the launch ramp to be shifted to the north, moving these
facilities farther from the main flood flows along the south side of the drainage. A 125-slip marina would be retained
and consolidated in one area on the north end of Willow Beach Wash. A new campground would be constructed above Willow
Beach Wash approximately one-half mile from the riverfront. Park and concession support facilities would be relocated.
Flood mitigation would consist of a combination of flood warning system and evacuation plan, structural protection,
and relocation or elimination of some existing facilities. All overnight facilities would be located outside of
the main flood flows and structurally protected to the probable maximum flood level. Day use facilities would be located
outside of the floodplains or structurally protected to the 100-year flood level. Alternative A, the no action alternative,
would continue present conditions and uses within the floodplain, and flood protection would consist of non-structural
measures limited to an early warning system and evacuation plan. Alternative B would retain existing uses in the floodplain
but would add structural flood protection and relocate some facilities. Parking would be reduced to 224 spaces. Alternative
D would allow for continued provision of a variety of visitor services at Willow Beach except that the motel and trailer
village would be eliminated. A campground would be added, as in the proposal, and flood protection measures would
be similar to the proposal and Alternative B. The proposal and alternatives were analyzed for impacts on public safety
and property in floodplains, desert plant communities, water and air quality, species of special concern, visitor
experience, trailer village occupants, concession operations, and cultural resources. 
The 

Statement of Findings

 addresses floodplain aspects of the proposed plan, including mitigation and measures to minimize exposure of life
and property. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The no-action period on the development concept plan will extend for 30 days after the notice of its availability is
published by EPA in the 

Federal Register

. Inquiries on the document should be addressed to: Superintendent, Lake Mead National Recreation Area, 601 Nevada
Highway, Boulder City, NV 89005, or by calling the Park at (702) 293-8986. 


Review of the 

Statement of Findings

 will also conclude 30 days after the Notice is published by the EPA. Comments on this document should be sent to the Superintendent
at the above address. 
For copies of the DCP Amendment/SEIS or the 

Statement of Findings,

 or further information on the documents, please contact: Superintendent, Lake Mead National Recreation Area at
the above address or telephone number. Copies of the documents are available at park headquarters, libraries in the
area and at the Western Regional Office, National Park Service, Division of Planning, Grants and Environmental Quality,
600 Harrison Street, Suite 600, San Francisco, CA.

 Information collection clearance package; expedited review under the Paperwork Reduction Act. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Employment and Training Administration (ETA), Department of Labor, in carrying out its responsibilities under
the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. chapter 35, 5 CFR part 1320 (53 FR 16618, May 10, 1988)), is submitting an information
collection clearance package to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The information collection is required
due to amendments to section 258 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 

et seq.

) (INA). The amendments created an Alaska exception to the general prohibition on the performance of longshore work
by alien crewmembers in U.S. ports. Under the Alaska exception, before any employer may use alien crewmembers to perform
longshore work in the State of Alaska, it must submit an attestation to ETA containing the elements prescribed by the
INA.

Appendix A_Supporting Statement Attestation by Employers Seeking To Utilize Alien Crewmembers To Perform Longshore
Activities 



(1) The Employment and Training Administration (ETA) and the Employment Standards Administration (ESA) of the Department
of Labor (DOL or Department) are promulgating regulations governing the filing and enforcement of attestations
by employers seeking to use alien crewmembers to perform longshore activities at locations in the State of Alaska.


The attestation process is to be administered by ETA; complaints and investigations regarding attestations are
the responsibility of ESA. 

The Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1993, Public Law 103-206, 107 Stat. 2419 (Act), was enacted on December
20, 1993. Among other things, the Act amended section 258 of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1101 

et seq.

) by creating an Alaska exception to the general prohibition on the performance of longshore work by alien crewmembers
in U.S. ports. 

An employer seeking to employ alien crewmembers at locations in the State of Alaska under the Alaska exception shall
submit an attestation. An attestation must be filed by each individual employer but may apply to multiple vessels
and multiple locations within the State of Alaska. 

(2) The Department proposes to review an attestation to ensure that it is received at least 30 days before the date of
the first performance of the longshore activity, unless the employer could not have reasonably anticipated the need
to file an attestation for that location at that time. In no case, however, will ETA accept an attestation received
less than 24 hours prior to the date of the first performance of the activity. 

The Department will review an attestation to assure that it is signed, completed, contains no obvious inaccuracies,
and is not, on its face, inconsistent with the documentation submitted in support thereof. In addition, the Department
proposes that it will review attestations to determine the following: (1) Whether the Administrator, Wage and Hour
Division, has notified ETA of a determination that an employer has misrepresented or failed to comply with an attestation
previously submitted and accepted for filing, barring the employer from entry to any U.S. port for up to one year; (2)
whether the Administrator has issued a cease and desist order that would affect the attesting employer and location
at which longshore work is to be performed; and (3) whether the Administrator has advised ETA that the employer has
failed to comply with any penalty or remedy assessed. 

If the attestation is properly filled out and includes accompanying documentation for the requirement at  

XXX

.537 of the subpart, and does not fall within one of the categories set forth at paragraph (b) of  

XXX

.538, ETA shall accept the attestation for filing, notify the INS in writing of the filing, and return to the employer
one copy of the attestation form submitted, with ETA's acceptance indicated thereon. The employer may then utilize
alien crewmembers for the longshore work at the locations cited in the attestation in accordance with subpart F of
part 655 and with INS regulations. 

ETA shall make available for public examination in Washington, D.C., a list of employers which have filed attestations,
and for each such employer, a copy of the employer's attestation and accompanying documentation it has received.


(3) It is anticipated that the documentation required to satisfy the attestation elements is available from existing
data sources, and that the burden will be considerably less in the second and subsequent years in which the employer
submits an attestation.

<DOCNO> FR941031-2-00097 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941031-2-00069 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(4) The procedures and documentation requirements are sufficiently specific to avoid duplication of activities.
At the same time, the procedures establish a process that will facilitate investigations of complaints against employers
and enforcement of sanctions where necessary. The regulations set forth a process which: (1) requires attestations
that are specific with respect to employer statements and promises; (2) limits the Department's review of an attestation
to a simple check to assure that it is signed, completed, contains no obvious inaccuracies, and is not, on its face,
inconsistent with the documentation submitted in support thereof; (3) describes the information that employers
must retain to document the validity of their statements; and (4) establishes a system for the receipt of complaints,
and their investigation and disposition, including the imposition of penalties where warranted. 

(5) Section 258 of the INA prohibits the use of alien crewmembers to perform longshore activity in U.S. ports with five
exceptions as follows: 

(a) Where the vessel's country of registration does not prohibit U.S. crewmembers from performing longshore work
in that country's ports and nationals of a country which does not prohibit U.S. crewmembers from performing longshore
work in that country's ports hold a majority of the ownership interest in the vessel; 

(b) Where there is in effect in a local port one or more collective bargaining agreement(s), each covering at least
30 percent of the longshore workers at a particular port and each permitting the activity to be performed by alien crewmembers;


(c) Where there is no collective bargaining agreement covering at least 30 percent of the longshore workers and an
attestation has been filed with the Department which states that the use of alien crewmembers to perform longshore
work is permitted under the prevailing practice of the port, that the use of alien crewmembers is not during a strike
or lockout, that such use is not intended or designed to influence the election of a collective bargaining representative,
and that notice has been provided to longshore workers at the port; 

(d) Where the activity is performed with the use of automated self-unloading conveyor belts or vacuum-actuated systems;


provided that,

 the Secretary of Labor (Secretary) has not found that an attestation is required because it was not the prevailing
practice to utilize alien crewmembers to perform the activity or because the activity was performed during a strike
or lockout or in order to influence the election of a collective bargaining representative; and 

(e) Where the longshore work is to be performed at a particular location in the State of Alaska and an attestation with
accompanying documentation has been filed with the Department of Labor attesting that, among other things, before
using alien crewmen to perform the activity specified in the attestation, the employer will make a bona fide request
for and employ United States longshore workers who are qualified and available in sufficient numbers from contract
stevedoring companies, labor organizations recognized as exclusive bargaining representatives of United States
longshore workers, and private dock operators. 

In developing the joint interim final regulations to implement Section 258 of the INA at 20 CFR part 655, subparts F
and G, and at 29 CFR part 505, subparts F and G, the Department has carefully considered the issues pertinent to the filing
of attestations by employers to use alien crewmembers to perform longshore activities in the State of Alaska. 

The Department proposes to review an attestation only to ensure that it is timely, completed properly, includes the
required documentation, and that the documentation is not, on its face, inconsistent with the attestation. 

This interim final rule does not include an administrative appeals process within ETA for attestations. When an attestation
is returned because it is untimely, improperly completed, or lacking proper documentation, an employer may resubmit
another attestation to the Department. 

Attestations which are accepted by ETA may be objected to by any aggrieved party through the complaint process under
subpart G, and procedures for investigation, hearing and appeal are provided therein. In the event a complaint is
filed with the Department, the employer must have sufficient documentation available on file at the place of business
of its U.S. agent to meet the burden of proof for the validity of each attestation element. Documentation submitted
or retained pursuant to this part shall either be in English or be accompanied by an English translation. 

The Department believes that this is consistent with the statute's intent for a streamlined attestation system for
filing and a complaint-driven process for the enforcement of the law's sanctions for violators. 

(6) The Department has notified the Chief Counsel for Advocacy, Small Business Administration, and made the certification
pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act at 5 U.S.C. 605(b), that the rule does not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities.

<TEXT>
 

Nevertheless, interested parties are requested to submit, as part of their comments on this rule, information on
the potential economic impact of the rule. 
(7) The Department would be in direct violation of the law and regulations if this information were not collected.

(8) This data collection is consistent with 5 CFR 1320.6. 
(9) Efforts to consult with persons outside the agency to obtain their views on data availability, collection and
reporting will involve consideration of comments and responses on the interim final regulations published in the


Federal Register

 and the rule-related notice. All comments will be considered in developing final regulations. 
(10) Documentation is not exempt from disclosure under the FOIA. Public law requires that all attestations be available
for public inspection at the Department. 
(11) Does not involve sensitive questions. 
(12) 

Federal Government Cost_$16,162.50.
The average Federal Government cost for the year of operation is estimated at $16,162.50 as follows:

 

Estimated Hours 


Data Entry/Review_.75 hour 
Process/transmittal_.25 hour 


Staff Cost Per Attestation

_$14.75 


Professional (11 level, step 5)_




Clerical (5 level, step 5)_






Estimated Total Cost

_$16,162.50





(13) ETA estimates that approximately 350 attestations per year will be submitted. The public reporting burden for
this collection of information is estimated to average 3 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions,
searching existing information/data sources, gathering and maintaining information, completing and reviewing
the application, and providing the notice of filing. 

The overall hours needed for each respondent to produce the required information: 





The estimated time for information collection, processing, review and maintenance is based on the Department's
operating experience under the existing program governing attestations under the prevailing practice exception.
The estimate is further derived through experience and testing of forms completion and information collection activities.


The estimated level of attestations for the year is based upon the Department's operational experience under the
existing program governing attestations under the prevailing practice exception. At present the Department has
no information basis for projecting employer burden for subsequent years. This is a new program and it is not clear
how the following variable will impact program workload: 

(1) The attestation may be filed for multiple locations in the State of Alaska. Under the existing program governing
the performance of longshore work by alien crewmembers under the prevailing practice exception, an attestation
must be filed for each port at which an employer intends to utilize alien crewmembers. 
(14) This is a new data collection request. This data collection will count as a +1,050 hour program change towards
ETA's Information Collection Budget. 
(15) No collection of information will be published for statistical use.

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>






Indiana Michigan Power Company; Donald C. Cook Nuclear Power Plant, Units 1 and 2; Environmental Assessment and Finding
of No Significant Impact



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering the approval of the licensee's request to
leave approximately 942 cubic meters of slightly contaminated sludge in place underneath the upper parking lot on
the D.C. Cook site. This was proposed by Indiana Michigan Power Company (the licensee) for the D.C. Cook Plant, located
in Berrien County, Michigan.



Environmental Assessment 



Identification of Proposed Action 



The proposed action by the NRC would approve the disposal of contaminated sludge by leaving it in place at the facility,
as proposed by the licensee's request dated October 9, 1991, as supplemented October 23, 1991, September 3, 1993,
and September 29, 1993. The request for approval is submitted pursuant to 10 CFR 20.2002. The total volume of contaminated
sludge is estimated to be 942 cubic meters. 



The Need for the Proposed Action



In 1982, approximately 942 cubic meters of slightly contaminated sludge were removed from the turbine room sump absorption
pond and pumped to the upper parking lot located within the exclusion area of the D.C. Cook plant. The contaminated
sludge was spread over an area approximately 4.7 acres. The sludge contains a total radionuclide inventory of 8.86
millicuries (mCi) of Cesium-137, Cesium-136, Cesium-134, Cobalt-60, and Iodine-131. 



Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action



The licensee in 1982 evaluated the following potential exposure pathways to members of the general public from the
radionuclides in the sludge: (1) external exposure caused by groundshine from the disposal site, (2) internal exposure
caused by inhalation of resuspended radionuclide, and (3) internal exposure from ingesting ground water. The staff
has reviewed the licensee's calculational methods and assumptions and finds that they are consistent with NUREG-1101,
``Onsite Disposal of Radioactive Waste,'' Volumes 1 and 2, November 1986 and February 1987, respectively. The staff
finds the assessment methodology acceptable. The table below lists the doses calculated by the licensee for the maximally
exposed member of the public based on a total activity of 8.89 mCi disposed in that year. 






For perspective, the radiation from the naturally occurring radionuclides in soils and rocks plus cosmic radiation
gives a person in Michigan a whole-body dose rate of about 89 mrem per year outdoors, which may be altered as much as 20
mrem per year by the type of construction of the person's residence (e.g., wood frame or brick) and the amount of time
spent in it.

On July 5, 1991, the licensee re-sampled the onsite disposal area to assure that no significant impacts and adverse
effects had occurred. A counting procedure based on the appropriate environmental low limit detection was used by
the licensee; however, no activity above background was detected during the re-sampling. The 1991 re-sampling process
used by the licensee confirms that the environmental impact of the 1982 disposal was very small. The staff finds the
licensee's methodology acceptable. 

The staff has evaluated the impacts of leaving the contaminated sludge in place, and finds that the potential environmental
impacts are insignificant.

With regard to the nonradiological impacts, the staff has determined that leaving the soil in place has the smallest
impact when compared to the principal alternatives discussed below. 



Alternatives to the Proposed Action



The principal alternative to leaving the contaminated sludge in place would be to dig it up, package it in 55-gallon
drums or other suitable containers, and ship it to a disposal facility licensed to dispose of low-level radioactive
waste. This would be costly, requiring, for example, the removal of the parking surface over the disposal area, and
would not provide environmental benefits in that no measurable radioactivity has been detected from the material.
On the basis of the above analysis and evaluations and after weighing the environmental, technical, and other benefits
against the environmental costs, the staff concludes that the action called for under NEPA and 10 CFR Part 51 is the
issuance of an approval of the proposed waste disposal.

Alternative Use of Resources



The principal result of this action does involve the use of resources beyond the scope anticipated in the Environmental
Impact Statement issued August 1973, for normal plant operations; however, this additional use of land is not significant,
as the area involved is located underneath the upper parking lot. This action involves no other critical materials
or resources.



Agenices and Persons Consulted



The staff consulted with the State of Michigan regarding the environmental impact of the proposed action. The State
had no comments.



Finding of No Significant Impact



The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed action. Based upon
the foregoing environmental assessment, the staff concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant
effect on the quality of the human environment.

For further details with respect to this proposed action, see the licensee's letters dated October 9, 1991, October
23, 1991, September 3, 1993, and September 29, 1993. These letters are available for public inspection at the Commission's
Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, N.W., Washington, DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the
Maud Preston Palenske Memorial Library, 500 Market Street, St. Joseph, Michigan 49085.

<DOCTITLE>Power Authority of the State of New York; Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact</DOCTITLE>



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an exemption from certain requirements
of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J, Paragraph III.D.3, Type C Tests, to the Power Authority of the State of New York (the licensee)
for the Indian Point Nuclear Generating Unit No. 3 (IP3), located in Westchester County, New York.



Environmental Assessment



Identification of Proposed Action



The licensee would be exempt from the requirement of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J, Paragraph III.D.3, to the extent that
a one-time schedular extension would be allowed for performing Type C local leak rate tests (LLRTs) on Residual Heat
Removal (RHR) containment isolation valves AC-732, AC-741, AC-MOV-743, AC-MOV-744,
and AC-MOV-1870. These LLRTs are currently required to be performed at intervals no greater than 30 months.
The one-time schedular exemption would allow Type C LLRTs of the above listed valves to be deferred until the 9/10 refueling
outage, which is currently scheduled for the spring of 1996.

By letter dated September 29, 1994, the licensee applied for a Technical Specifications (TSs) amendment and requested
an Exemption from the Code of Federal Regulations requirements to allow Type C LLRTs to be deferred for the above listed
RHR system valves until the 9/10 refueling outage. 



The Need for the Proposed Action



The licensee commenced operating on 24-month fuel cycles, instead of the previous 18-month fuel cycles, starting
with fuel cycle 9. Fuel cycle 9 started in August 1992. The requirements of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J, Paragraph III.D.3,
indicate that Type C LLRTs must be performed during each reactor shutdown for refueling at intervals no greater than
2 years (24 months). On January 12, 1993, the NRC staff issued an exemption to the licensee that allowed Type C LLRTs
to be performed at intervals up to 30 months, thus, permitting operation on a 24-month fuel cycle.

Approximately 6 months after startup from the 8/9 refueling outage, IP3 began an extended unplanned non-refueling
outage. Startup from the outage is currently expected for early 1995. After startup from the current outage, the plant
will run until its next scheduled refueling outage (RFO 9/10) which is scheduled to begin in spring of 1996. In November
and December of 1994 the RHR containment isolated valves AC-732, AC-741, AC-MOV-743, AC-MOV-744,
and AC-MOV-1870 are due for their Type C LLRTs. Currently, the interval for Type C testing of these valves
is 30 months. These LLRTs are normally performed during a refueling outage when the reactor is defueled and the RHR
system is not providing a source of cooling water. The current outage is a non-refueling outage, therefore, the reactor
is not defueled and RHR system is providing core cooling water. The licensee's procedure and the system design require
the RHR system to be out-of-service in order to perform the LLRTs. If the RHR system is taken out-of-service to perform
the LLRTs the reactor would not have a reliable source of cooling water to remove decay heat. Therefore, the licensee
is requesting a one-time schedular exemption to allow Type C LLRTs of the above listed valves to be deferred until the
9/10 refueling outage, which is currently scheduled for the spring of 1996. 



Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action



The proposed one-time exemption does not increase the probability or consequences of accidents previously analyzed
and the proposed one-time exemption does not affect facility radiation levels or facility radiological effluents.
The licensee has analyzed the results of previous LLRTs performed at IP3, and has provided the methodology used in
extrapolating the previous LLRT data to the proposed one time increase in the surveillance interval. The licensee
has provided a sound basis for concluding that the containment leakage rate would be maintained within acceptable
limits with the one time extension of the LLRT interval to the refueling outage 9/10. Therefore, the Commission concludes
that there are no significant radiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed exemption.

With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed exemption only involves LLRTs on containment penetrations
and isolation valves. They do not affect nonradiological plant effluents and have no other environmental impact.
Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant nonradiological environmental impacts associated
with the proposed exemption.



Alternatives to the Proposed Action



Since the Commission has concluded that there are no significant environmental effects that would result from the
proposed exemption, any alternatives with equal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated. The principal
alternative would be to deny the licensee's request for exemption. Such action would not reduce the environmental
impacts of plant operations. 



Alternative Use of Resources



This action does not involve the use of resources not previously considered in the ``Final Environmental Statement
Related to the Operation of Indian Point Nuclear Generating Plant Unit No. 3,'' dated February 1975.



Agencies and Persons Consulted



The NRC staff consulted with the New York State official regarding the environmental impact of the proposed action.
The State official had no comments.



Finding of No Significant Impact



Based on the foregoing environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have
a significant effect on the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the Commission has determined not to prepare
an environmental impact statement for the exemption under consideration.

For further details with respect to this action, see the licensee's application for exemption dated September 29,
1994. This document is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW.,
Washington, DC 20555 and at the White Plains Public Library, 100 Martine Avenue, White Plains, New York 10610.

<DOCTITLE>Regulatory Guide; Issuance, Availability</DOCTITLE>



The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has issued for public comment a proposed revision to a guide in its Regulatory Guide
Series. This series has been developed to describe and make available to the public such information as methods acceptable
to the NRC staff for implementing specific parts of the Commission's regulations, techniques used by the staff in
evaluating specific problems or postulated accidents, and data needed by the staff in its review of applications
for permits and licenses.
The draft guide, temporarily identified by its task number, DG-8014 (which should be mentioned in all correspondence
concerning this draft guide), is a proposed revision to Regulatory Guide 8.13, ``Instruction Concerning Prenatal
Radiation Exposure.'' This guide is being revised to provide guidance on instructions that must be provided concerning
prenatal radiation exposure. In particular, the instructions described in this guide are intended to provide the
information needed by women who became pregnant to help them make an informed decision on whether or not to formally
declare their pregnancy in accordance with regulations.
This draft guide is being issued to involve the public in the early stages of the development of a regulatory position
in this area. It has not received complete staff review and does not represent an official NRC staff position.
Public comments are being solicited on the draft guide. Comments should be accompanied by supporting data. Written
comments may be submitted to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications
Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555. Comments will be
most helpful if received by March 17 1995.
Although a time limit is given for comments on this draft, comments and suggestions in connection with (1) items for
inclusion in guides currently being developed or (2) improvements in all published guides are encouraged at any time.
Regulatory guides are available for inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW., Washington,
DC. Requests for single copies of draft guides (which may be reproduced) or for placement on an automatic distribution
list for single copies of future draft guides in specific divisions should be made in writing to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Director, Distribution and Mail Services Section. Telephone requests
cannot be accommodated. Regulatory guides are not copyrighted, and Commission approval is not required to reproduce
them.

<USDEPT>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION</USDEPT>






Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change by National Association
of Securities Dealers, Inc. Relating to Transmittal of Forms T



October 24, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on October 3, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'')
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') a proposed rule change providing
for technical amendments to the NASD's transaction reporting rules.

The NASD has designated this proposal as constituting a stated policy, practice or interpretation with respect to
the administration and enforcement of existing reporting rules, permitting it to become effective upon filing pursuant
to Section 19(b)(3)(A)(i) of the Act and subparagraph (e) of Rule 19b-4 under the Act. The Commission is publishing
this notice to solicit comments from interested persons.



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The NASD is proposing a rule change that effects a technical amendment to the existing transaction reporting rules.
The amendatory language specifies that transaction data reported via Form T shall be sent to the NASD's Market Surveillance
Department of Rockville, Maryland. Specifically, the reporting provisions of Parts X, XI, XII and XIII of Schedule
D, and Section 2 of Schedule G to the NASD By-Laws are amended to reflect that transaction data reported via Form T shall
be reported to the NASD's Market Surveillance Department in Rockville, Maryland, rather than to the Market Operations
Department in Trumbull, Connecticut.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



On August 11, 1994, the Commission approved a series of parallel changes to the NASD rules governing transaction reporting
in Nasdaq National Market

 

 securities, Nasdaq SmallCap

SM

 securities, Nasdaq convertible debt securities, over-the-counter equity securities, and exchange-listed securities
eligible for inclusion in the Consolidated Quotations Service.
 Essentially, these amendments eliminated the manually prepared Form T as the principal means of reporting transactions
in the foregoing categories of securities when such transactions are executed outside normal market hours (9:30
a.m. to 4:00 p.m. E.T.) or outside the hours of the Automated Confirmation Transaction Service (``ACT'') (currently
9:00 a.m. to 5:15 p.m. E.T.). Instead, the covered transactions will be reported electronically through ACT either
on trade date or the next business day. Nevertheless, the amended rules still permit the use of Form T in the event of
a system outage or other unusual circumstance that precludes electronic entry of trade reports by a member firm.





The sole purpose of this rule change is to specify that the Forms T be directed to the NASD's Market Surveillance Department
in Rockville, Maryland rather than the Market Operations Department in Trumbull, Connecticut. The Market Surveillance
Department compiles and utilizes Form T data for regulatory purposes. At this point, there is no longer any operational
reason for the Market Operations Department to be the initial recipient of Form T data.

The NASD believes that this proposed rule is consistent with Section 15A(b)(2) and (b)(6) of the Act. Section 15A(b)(2)
requires that a national securities association be appropriately organized and have the capacity to enforce member
firms' compliance with all applicable provisions of the Act as well as its own rules. Section 15A(b)(6) requires,
among other things, that the association's rules be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices,
promote just and equitable principles of trade and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. The
instant rule change is consistent with these statutory provisions because it will expedite the receipt of Form T transaction
data, which is collected and analyzed for regulatory purposes, by the department responsible for that regulatory
function. Hence, the end result is greater efficiency in the processing of Forms T by the NASD's Market Surveillance
staff.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The NASD believes that the proposed rule change will not result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or
appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others



Comments were neither solicited nor received.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A)(i) of the Act and subparagraph (e)
of Securities Exchange Act Rule 19b-4 because the proposal has been filed as constituting a stated policy, practice
or interpretation with respect to the meaning, administration, or enforcement of an existing rule. At any time within
60 days of the filing of such proposed rule change, the Commission may summarily abrogate such rule change if it appears
to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors,
or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submission should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth
Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Room. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office
of the NASD. All submissions should refer to the file number in the caption above and should be submitted by November
21, 1994.




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Privacy Act of 1974; Computer Matching Programs</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
agency: 

Small Business Administration.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
action: 

Notice of computer matching programs.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

Pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974, the Small Business Administration (SBA) is giving notice of its intent to participate
in two computer matching programs. The matches will compare records of delinquent SBA disaster home loan debtors
against records of United States Postal Service employees and against records of Federal employees and military
members, active or retired. If matches are found, SBA will use the information to collect the delinquent debt through
salary offset or administrative offset.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information: 

Pursuant to subsection (0) of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, (5 U.S.C. 552a), the SBA has entered into agreements
to conduct computer matching programs with two recipient agencies, the Department of Defense, Defense Manpower
Data Center (DoD, DMDC) and the United States Postal Service (USPS). The purpose of the matches is to compare SBA delinquent
loan data with personnel records stored at the DoD, DMDC and USPS to determine whether SBA can proceed with salary or
administrative offset against the salaries or other benefits of delinquent debtors pursuant to the Debt Collection
Act of 1982. The DoD records contain information on Federal personnel, civilian and military, employed and retired.
The USPS records contain information on USPS employees.



SBA will provide tapes or other magnetic media containing delinquent debtor data to DoD and USPS. DoD and USPS will
perform the matches, return SBA's data, and report any ``hits''. A DoD ``hit'' will show that a delinquent debtor is
a Federal employee, a retired Federal employee, an active member of the military, or a retired member of the military.
A USPS hit will show that the delinquent debtor is a USPS employee.

The records to be matched are contained in Privacy Act Systems in each agency. SBA, the source agency, will extract
names and Social Security numbers from ``Litigation and Claims Files SBA-070'' and ``Loan Case Files SBA 075''
published in the 

Federal Register

 on February 26, 1991, and revised on May 14, 1992 at 57 FR 20726. DoD DMDC will match the SBA information against ``Federal
Creditor Agency Debt Collection Data Base, S322.11 DMDC'' published at 58 FR 10875 on February 22, 1993. USPS will
match the SBA data against ``Finance Records_Payroll System, USPS 050.020,'' published at 57 FR 57515 on December
4, 1992. The matching program will begin on the effective date of this notice and be effective for 18 months. It may be
extended for 12 months after that.

SBA will learn the debtor's service or agency, category and current work or home address. SBA will use the information
to collect the delinquent debt through administrative or salary offset as provided by the Debt Collection Act of 1982
and SBA regulations.

The parties to these agreements have determined that a computer matching program is the most efficient, effective
and expeditious method of obtaining and processing the information needed to determine whether SBA delinquent debtors
are receiving salaries or other benefits that can be offset. Computer matching also appears to be the manner to accomplish
this task with the least amount of intrusion into the personal privacy of the individuals concerned. The principal
alternative to using a computer matching program for identifying such employees would be a manual comparison of all
records of SBA delinquent debtors with the records of all military members and all Federal civilian employees and
all Federal retirees.

Copies of the computer matching agreements between DoD and SBA and between USPS and SBA are available to the public
upon request. Requests should be submitted to the Chief, Freedom of Information/Privacy Acts Office, 409 Third Street,
SW., Washington, DC 20416.

The matching agreements and an advance copy of this notice must be submitted to the Committee on Government Operations
of the House of Representatives, the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate, and the Administrator of the
Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget. These matching programs are subject
to review by OMB and Congress and shall not become effective until that review period has elapsed.

Shipping Coordinating Committee; Subcommittee on Safety of Life at Sea; Working Group on Lifesaving, Search and
Rescue; Notice of Meeting



The Working Group of Lifesaving, Search and Rescue of the Subcommittee on Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) will conduct
an open meeting at 9:30 AM on Friday, November 18, 1994 in Room 5303 at Coast Guard Headquarters, 2100 Second Street
S.W., Washington, DC.

The purpose of the meeting is to prepare and coordinate U.S. positions for the 26th Session of the International Maritime
Organization (IMO) Sub-Committee on Lifesaving, Search and Rescue (LSR), to be held March 27-31, 1995, at the
IMO Headquarters in London. Specific items to be discussed include:




_Review of SOLAS Chapter III Amendments approved by the LSR Sub-Committee at its last session for forwarding to the
Maritime Safety Committee (MSC) for circulation

_Draft revisions to the Recommendation on Testing and Evaluation of Life-Saving Appliances, particularly new sections
on marine evacuation systems and ``anti-exposure suits,'' and a draft proposal for inflatable liferaft fabric performance
requirements

_A draft U.S. proposal for standardized reporting formats for prototype testing of lifesaving equipment

_Shipboard safety emergency plans, and guidelines for emergency escape arrangements on passenger ships

_Matters concerning Search and Rescue (SAR), including harmonization of aeronautical and maritime SAR procedures




The IMO LSR Sub-Committee works to develop international agreements, guidelines, and standards for Search and Rescue
and for lifesaving equipment installed on commercial ships. Because of the potential impact of the Sub-Committee's
work on U.S. regulations and standards, the U.S. SOLAS Working Group serves as an excellent forum for the U.S. maritime
industry to express their ideas in the areas under the Sub-Committee's purview. Members of the public may attend this
meeting up to the seating capacity of the room.

For further information contact Mr. Kurt J. Heinz at (202) 267-1444, U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters (G-MVI-3/1404),

Policy for Letter of Intent Approvals Under the Airport Improvement Program 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of policy; request for comments. 


 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The FAA is clarifying its policies on reviewing and analyzing requests for Letters of Intent (LOIs) under the Airport
Improvement Program (AIP) or successor programs. The FAA will consider three factors in reviewing requests for LOIs:
the project's effect on overall national air transportation system capacity; project benefit and cost; and the airport
sponsor's financial commitment, including project timing. The FAA also solicits comments on the new policy. Following
review of the comments, the FAA may revise this policy. 


 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Request for Comments 



Comments are invited on this notice of policy and all communications received on or before the closing date for comments
will be considered by the FAA. FAA may subsequently issue a change to this policy after considering the comments. 



Background 



In 1987, legislation was enacted authorizing the issuance of LOI's. The Codification of Certain U.S. Transportation
Laws as Title 49, United States Code, Public Law No. 103-272, (July 5, 1994), section 47110(e)(2)(C) states:


The provisions of this subsection applies to a project the Secretary decides will enhance system-wide airport capacity
significantly and meets the criteria of section 47115(d) of this title. 

Section 47115(d) states: 

In selecting a project for a grant to preserve and enhance capacity as described in subsection (c)(1) of this section,
the Secretary shall consider_(1) the effect the project will have on the overall national air transportation system
capacity; (2) the project benefit and cost; and (3) the financial commitment from non-United States Government sources
to preserve or enhance airport capacity. 



General 



The FAA is authorized to issue an LOI for certain airport development projects when current obligating authority
is not timely or adequate to meet a sponsor's desired timing for a project. Under this provision, a sponsor may notify
the FAA of an intention to carry out a project without Federal funds and request that the FAA issue an LOI. The FAA evaluates
the proposal and, if approved, issues a letter stating that reimbursement will be made according to a given schedule,
as funds become available. A sponsor who has received an LOI, therefore, may proceed with a project without waiting
for an AIP grant, is assured that all allowable costs related to the approved project remain eligible for reimbursement,
and may receive more favorable financing to pay related costs on the basis of announced Federal support for the project.




Discussion 



Since FY 1987, the FAA has issued 48 LOI's (43 at primary airports and 5 at reliever airports). The total payments contemplated
in these LOI's total nearly $2 billion ($1.5 billion of discretionary and $0.5 billion of entitlements). Of this,
$0.9 billion has been granted to airports. The balance of $1.1 billion would be granted to airports through the year
2005. These LOIs include $0.8 billion discretionary and $0.3 billion entitlements. The following chart summarizes
this information.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941031-2-00111 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941031-2-00080 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 




At the beginning of each fiscal year, the FAA, in its administration of the AIP, sets aside the amounts of discretionary
funds to ``cover'' the LOI payment schedules. For the primary airports, the main sources of the discretionary funds
are the ``capacity, safety, security, noise (CSSN)'' set aside and the remaining discretionary. For reliever airports,
the source is the 5 percent ``reliever'' set aside.

In the first 5 years of administering the LOI component of the AIP, the overall level of the AIP increased from $1.2687
billion in FY 1988 to $1.9 billion in FY 1992, and then decreased to $1.8 billion in FY 1993, $1.69 billion in FY 1994,
and $1.45 billion in FY 1995. The amount of CSSN and remaining discretionary likewise increased from $205.1 million
to $524.8 million in FY 1992, and decreased to $299.9 million in FY 1993 but has now stabilized at $325 million annually
in current legislation. During these years, the FAA initially established an administrative policy that no more
than 50 percent of the available CSSN discretionary would be committed to LOI's. In FY 1992, this policy was amended
to include both CSSN and remaining discretionary. The FAA worked closely with airport sponsors to develop work programs
and LOI payout schedules which maintained the 50 percent rule. We expect to maintain this policy. Reliever LOI's were
not routinely used as a funding vehicle since most reliever sponsors cannot ``up front'' the construction costs.

The convergence of growing demand and reduced availability of AIP discretionary funds dictates a new strategy for
approval of LOI's. For the foreseeable future, the overall level of the AIP may not increase. This is primarily the
result of budgetary pressures. Secondly, the amount of available discretionary funds has diminished from the level
available in FY 1992 to the current level of no less than $325 million annually. Against this discretionary level,
numerous airport sponsors are requesting LOI's for many important projects. The FAA, therefore, has developed this
policy to consider competing LOI requests.

Policy

_The FAA intends to consider requests for Letters of Intent (LOI) under the Airport Improvement Program (AIP) (or
successor programs) at primary or reliever airports only for airside development projects with significant capacity
benefits. This focus is intended to maximize the systemwide impact of capacity projects, especially given the limited
amounts of funds available for LOI projects. The FAA will use this policy in considering all future LOI requests.

The FAA's decision to approve an LOI will be made based primarily on a benefit-cost analysis. This analysis will consider
local and systemwide benefits in terms of annual aircraft delay savings, measured as the avoided costs of operating
delayed aircraft and the value of passenger time associated with avoided delays. In addition, the net value to airlines,
the airport, and the public from additional air transportation service will be considered. Project costs will be
apportioned among Federal AIP discretionary funds, Federal AIP entitlement funds, and nonfederal funds. Financially
sound projects will be selected for LOI approval in a manner that leverages Federal AIP discretionary funds to the
maximum extent feasible, consistent with rational investment decisionmaking.

The best candidates for approval will be those projects for a new airport, new runway, or major runway extension at
cities or metropolitan areas where the primary airport exceeds or is expected to exceed 20,000 hours of annual air
carrier delay. Apron development in support of terminal work is considered airside development. Federal environmental
findings must be complete and the project work must be imminent.

Starting in fiscal year (FY) 1995, applications for LOI's are to be submitted to the local FAA office no later than March
1 of the current FY for FAA decisionmaking during that FY. Applications received after March 1 may not be decided upon
until the following FY.

This policy does not apply to outstanding LOI's already issued to airport sponsors. The FAA will apply this policy
to all other LOI requests.



FAA Review of LOI Requests



The FAA will consider each proposed project in accordance with the following selection criteria. Each of the following
three items will be reviewed for an LOI request.



1. Project Effect on Overall National Air Transportation System Capacity



The FAA will analyze the project(s) effect on overall national air transportation system capacity in accordance
with agency methodology and modeling capabilities. To do this, FAA will analyze the airport for which the LOI is requested
and estimate the current hours of annual flight delay. The FAA will then determine the systemwide impact of the project(s)
in terms of reduced annual aircraft and passenger delays at current and future airport activity levels. The FAA may
request information from sources at the airport or may visit the site to collect data needed to model the proposed airport
improvement. The FAA will also review any capacity analysis conducted by the airport and submitted with the application.

The data requirements will be airport/terminal airspace specific and will be collected by the FAA. The data required
will include, but are not limited to: The approved airport layout plan; type of operations; fleet mix; peak hour airfield
mix by class; runway occupancy times; taxiway exit percentages; noise, obstruction, terrain, aircraft departure,
and aircraft arrival constraints; air traffic arrival and departure streams; minimum vectoring altitudes; aircraft
separation by aircraft type; length of and approach speeds on common approach by aircraft type and weather; converging
and/or parallel runway dependencies; aircraft arrival and departure dependencies; and the different runway use
configurations in the various wind and weather conditions. The data available or to be collected are very similar
to those data assembled for FAA Airport Capacity Task Force and Capacity Design Teams studies.

Many of the proposed capacity improvements have already been modeled and calibrated during FAA Airport Capacity
Design Team studies and would only require updating. The updating would include any new national air traffic approach
procedures, separation standards, and capacity initiatives implemented by the specific airport traffic control
tower or airport authority.



2. Project Benefit and Cost



Analysis will involve a detailed review of future benefits and costs for each year of the project's expected life,
discounted to present value at an appropriate discount rate. The FAA will measure benefits in terms of annual cost
savings attributable to reduced delays, to be measured as the avoided costs of operating delayed aircraft (e.g.,
fuel and oil, crew, and maintenance savings) and the monetary value of saved passenger time. In addition, the net value
to airlines, the airport, and the public from additional air transportation service made possible by the capacity
project will be considered. Costs will be estimated for planning, construction, operation, and maintenance of the
project, and will be apportioned according to origin of funding_Federal AIP discretionary funds, Federal AIP entitlement
funds, and nonfederal funds.

To be eligible for further consideration, the proposed project must have present value benefits that exceed present
value costs and must have appropriate sponsor financial commitment (see section 3 below). The FAA will select among
eligible projects with the object that Federal AIP discretionary funds will attract funding from other sources to
the maximum extent feasible, consistent with rational investment decisionmaking. To accomplish this objective,
the FAA will consider various measures of project financial viability (e.g., net present values, benefit-cost ratios,
and rates of return) relative to the amount of Federal AIP discretionary funds requested. Eligible projects to be
funded entirely with Federal AIP entitlement funds will be approved for LOI's if FAA concludes that entitlement funds
will be available.



3. Financial Commitment, Including Project Timing



The FAA will determine the airport sponsor's financial commitment in terms of the airport capital improvement plan
and associated financial plan over the lesser of the life of the LOI of 5 years. The plan should include by FY a list of
the projects to be implemented, both LOI and non-LOI; and, for each project, the total project cost with a cost breakdown
by source of funds (AIP entitlement, AIP discretionary, passenger facility charges (PFC), sponsor, State, and other,
including available cash reserve accounts). The amount of funds to be obtained through selling bonds should also
be indicated along with the bond rating, if available, and status of issuance.

In making its determination, the FAA will consider the sponsor's commitment of entitlement funds to the proposed
project or to higher priority projects, whether PFC's are being applied, the contribution of nonfederal funding
sources, diversion of airport revenue off the airport, and whether the sponsor plans to proceed with the project in
accordance with all applicable statutory and administrative requirements, with the LOI payments to be used as reimbursements
for advance expenditures.

<DOCTITLE>Policy Regarding Revision of Selection Criteria for Discretionary Airport Improvement Program Grant Awards</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration; Department of Transportation.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of policy.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is revising the process used to evaluate applications for Airport Improvement
Program (AIP) grants awarded at the discretion at the discretion of the Secretary of Transportation. The new process
represents an evolution of past practice. Airport safety and security projects will continue to be accorded the highest
priority in AIP investments. They will be followed in order of priority by projects to preserve existing airport infrastructure;
bring airports into compliance with standards (including noise mitigation); upgrade service; and increase airport
system capacity. The changes described below are intended to assure uniform levels of airport system safety, quality,
and performance for passengers, shippers, and aircraft operators throughout the Nation and to improve the effectiveness
of AIP investments in meeting critical needs of the national airport system.



Changes in the AIP grant award selection process are based on Executive Order 12893, ``Principles for Federal Infrastructure
Investments,'' and guidance provided in Congressional hearings regarding the use of national priority and economic
analysis in evaluating Federal investment in airport infrastructure. Revised procedures involve: establishment
of national airport investment objectives; consistent ranking of grant applications among FAA regions by type of
project; use of national threshold Priority System scores for award consideration; and application of benefit-cost
analysis to any project intended to preserve or enhance capacity for which the total value of requested discretionary
capacity grants is expected to equal or exceed $10 million over the life of the project. All procedural changes are
consistent with existing statutory requirements for program administration and will be incorporated into FAA Order
5100.38A, ``Airport Improvement Program (AIP) Handbook.'' Applications of the procedures will be described by
the FAA each year in its ``Annual Report of Accomplishments Under the Airport Improvement Program.'' The new criteria
described in this policy apply to all new projects to be considered for AIP grant awards in FY 1995 and subsequent years.
On a case-by-case basis, the FAA may apply the new criteria to ongoing projects approved for AIP grant awards in prior
years.

In addition to improvements in the discretionary AIP grant award selection process described herein, the effectiveness
of Federal AIP investments will also be reinforced by implementation of a new policy on the issuance of Letters of Intent
(LOI's). The FAA recognizes that, as experience is gained by using these procedures, additional improvements may
be needed in the criteria used to evaluate applications for discretionary AIP grants.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Secretary of Transportation and the Administrator of the FAA are charged with promoting and maintaining a national
aviation system that operates safely and efficiently. The Federal Government pursues this objective in part by investing
Federal funds, via AIP grants-in-aid, in modern airport facilities sufficient to handle current and future air traffic
and by facilitating local investment in such facilities.



The AIP was first authorized by the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982 (the AAIA). On July 5, 1994, the President
signed Public Law 103-272, Codification of Certain U.S. Transportation Laws as Title 49, United States Code
(the Codification), which now contains the statutory authority for the AIP (the AIAA was repealed by enactment of
the Codification). The Codification provides guidance for the award of grants-in-aid by formula and by discretionary
authority granted the Secretary. Section 47115 of the Codification authorizes the Secretary to make AIP discretionary
funds available in a manner that the Secretary considers most appropriate for carrying out the purposes of chapter
471, subchapter 1, of the Codification (i.e., Airport Improvement). Section 47115(d) specifies that in selecting
projects for discretionary grants to preserve and enhance capacity at airports, ``the Secretary shall consider_(1)
The effect the project will have on the overall national air transportation system capacity; (2) the project benefit
and cost; and (3) the financial commitment from non-United States Government sources to preserve or enhance airport
capacity.''

The FAA implemented guidance for administering the AIP in its Order 5100.38A, ``Airport Improvement Program (AIP)
Handbook'' (October 24, 1989). Order 5100.38A defines a structured local airport planning process from which projects
are identified and entered into the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems (NPIAS). The NPIAS is the national
airport system plan (submitted to Congress on a biennial basis) that identifies potential public-use airport development
projects in the United States which are eligible for AIP assistance. The FAA uses a ranking process, titled the Priority
System, to award discretionary grants to sponsors of eligible NPIAS projects for which AIP monies are sought. The
Priority System assigns numerical values to airport projects based on the type of project and the size and role of the
airport. Grants-in-aid are awarded to high priority projects, subject to funding availability (established in
annual obligation limitations and program authorizations) and consideration of sponsor financial commitment.

The process defined in Order 5100.38A has been used successfully to evaluate several thousand AIP grant requests
each year and annually award as many as 1,500 grants-in-aid. Most of these grants-in-aid are for amounts of less than
one million dollars. However, recent developments have led the FAA to revise the existing award process. These developments
include: the need to improve the effectiveness of Federal airport infrastructure investments in light of an expected
lack of growth in Federal AIP budgets; issuance of Executive Order 12893, ``Principles for Federal Infrastructure
Investments'' (January 26, 1994); and guidance from Congress citing the need for economic airport investment criteria.

After steady growth in the late 1980's and early 1990's, Federal AIP budgets are projected to remain at or near current
levels for the next several years. At the same time, the cost and number of major airport capacity projects is expected
to increase significantly to accommodate forecast growth in the volume of aircraft operations. Effective Federal
investment of discretionary AIP funds will become increasingly important.

Executive Order 12893 is intended to promote more effective infrastructure investments. The Order instructs agencies
to conduct systematic economic analysis of these investments. The Order permits consideration of market and non-market
benefits and costs in the economic analysis. In addition, it directs that benefits and costs be quantified and monetized
to the maximum extent practicable and appropriately discounted over the full life-cycle of each project.

In May 1993, the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation released a report identifying investment
criteria that the subcommittee believes should be established for evaluating the merits of infrastructure investments
in transportation. The report recommended analysis of project life-cycle costs and benefits. One set of criteria
was formulated for each transportation mode, including air transportation. Similarly, the General Accounting
Office (GAO) has testified to Congress that the FAA needs to better target AIP funds to the needs of the system.

To improve the effectiveness of AIP investment decisions, the FAA will immediately implement a number of revisions
to the project selection criteria identified in Order 5100.38A. These changes are limited to the evaluation of applications
for discretionary AIP grants. They are designed to strengthen those features of the current award process that enable
the prompt and fair evaluation of large numbers of grant applications, but at the same time permit the FAA to establish
investment priorities and conduct economic evaluations of projects that require disproportionately large amounts
of discretionary capacity funds. The new criteria described in this policy apply to all new projects to be considered
for AIP grant awards in FY 1995 and subsequent years. On a case-by-case basis, the FAA may apply the new criteria to ongoing
projects approved for AIP grant awards in prior years.

Several of the changes that the FAA is implementing are administrative, designed to ensure accountable and consistent
applications of the Priority System to all competing airport project proposals. The FAA will establish specific
national performance goals at the beginning of each fiscal year. In FY 1995, the goals relate to five factors of the
airport system: safety; security; infrastructure preservation; capacity; and environmental compatibility.
Performance targets with regard to capacity-enhancing development at congested airports, good pavement conditions
at airports, and relocation or insulation of homes and public buildings currently located in 75 DNL noise zones are
now under development. Specific time frames for accomplishing these and other goals will be established in conjunction
with an evaluation of the current airport system now being conducted. Establishment of specific numerical goals
ensures that essential improvements are being implemented in a systematic and measurable manner.

Under new guidance, AIP-eligible projects in all FAA regions must be consistently ranked according to the Priority
System and must meet national threshold scores to be considered for AIP discretionary funding. These threshold scores
will be determined by comparing the value of total grant applications to the amount of money available for discretionary
grants at the national level (based on annual obligation limitations and program authorization requirements).
These reforms will assure uniform levels of airport system safety, quality, and performance for passengers, shippers,
and aircraft operators throughout the Nation.

The FAA will strengthen its selection criteria by the application of benefit-cost analysis (BCA) to projects intended
to preserve or enhance capacity for which sponsors are seeking large amounts of AIP discretionary funds. Included
would be projects to add new capacity or reconstruct existing capacity. Grant award will be contingent on demonstrating
that a project's benefits will exceed its costs. Initially, FAA staff will conduct the BCA to ensure the consistent
application of BCA methodologies among different projects. Until further notice, application of BCA will be limited
to those capacity projects for which the total value of requested discretionary capacity grants is expected to equal
or exceed $10 million over the life of the project. This limit assures that costs likely to be incurred in preparing
a BCA are reasonable with respect to the value of the application(s) being evaluated. The $10 million threshold is
also the same value at which the FAA must notify Congress prior to the issuance of LOI awards.

The FAA will amend Order 5100.38A to incorporate the criteria described in this notice of policy. The FAA will also
publish summary information about the application of the grant selection process in its ``Annual Report of Accomplishments
Under the Airport Improvement Program.'' This report will help to keep interested parties informed of the FAA's progress
in implementing the reforms described in this policy statement.

The FAA is committed to continuous improvement of its selection criteria. As the FAA gains experience with applying
national priorities and BCA to airport projects, it will consider additional refinements of its selection criteria.
These refinements may include: adjustment of the $10 million threshold value for BCA (perhaps establishing different
thresholds dependent on type of project or airport size); application of BCA to discretionary projects other than
capacity projects; publication of detailed guidance on appropriate BCA methodologies; and assignment of some or
all BCA responsibilities to project sponsors (subject to FAA review).


The FAA's effort to improve the effectiveness of its investments in the airport system will be reinforced by a new policy
in which the FAA will apply BCA to LOI applications. The FAA will also estimate anticipated aggregate benefits and
costs of AIP authorization requests beginning with FY 1996.


The FAA will be responsive to concerns of Congress, State and local governments, airlines, airports, interest groups,
and the public as it improves its selection criteria. To facilitate interaction with these groups, the FAA has initiated
an outreach process to solicit advice from interested parties and experts in airport investment. At the FAA's request,
the Research, Engineering, and Development Advisory Committee established a working group on selection criteria.
The working group produced a report which was made available to the FAA in early 1994 and which influenced the development
of this policy. Future outreach activities will include a conference under the auspices of the Transportation Research
Board (scheduled for October 27, 1994); informal meetings between the FAA and interested parties; and systematic
assessment of comments received by the FAA in the course of its administration of the revised selection process.



Policy Regarding Revision of Selection Criteria for Discretionary Airport Improvement Program Grant Awards



Introduction



The process by which the FAA selects airport projects for Federal funding is defined in Order 5100.38A, ``Airport
Improvement Program (AIP) Handbook.'' The following developments have contributed to the need to revise this process
with respect to grants awarded at the discretion of the Secretary of Transportation: the need to improve the effectiveness
of Federal airport infrastructure investments in light of an expected lack of growth in Federal AIP budgets; issuance
of Executive Order 12893, ``Principles for Federal Infrastructure Investments'' (January 26, 1994); and guidance
from Congress citing the need for economic investment criteria.


The following selection criteria for discretionary AIP grant awards comply with statutory requirements. They retain
the basic processes of FAA Order 5100.38A while implementing new requirements designed to improve performance and
effectiveness. The new criteria described in this policy apply to all new projects to be considered for AIP grant awards
in FY 1995 and subsequent years. On a case-by-case basis, the FAA may apply the new criteria to ongoing projects approved
for AIP grant awards in prior years. As appropriate, the FAA will make additional adjustments to the selection process.



Preliminary Project Selection Screen



1. Projects must conform to several basic eligibility requirements before they will be considered for AIP funding.


1.1 A sponsor of a public use airport is eligible to apply for AIP grants if the airport meets at least one of the
criteria for inclusion in the National Plan of Integrated Airport systems (NPIAS). These criteria are specified
in Order 5090.3B, ``Field Formulation of the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems (NPIAS)'' (September 9,
1985), and are summarized as follows:


1.1.1 The airport enplanes (or is forecast to enplane within 10 years) 2,500 or more revenue passengers per
year and receives scheduled passenger service;


1.1.2 The airport handles at least 25,000 itinerant operations, or 35,000 local operations, of general aviation
aircraft per year and relieves a congested airport with at least 250,000 annual enplaned passengers;

1.1.3 The airport has (or is forecast to have within 5 years) at least 10 based aircraft, is publicly owned,
and is located 30 minutes or more (average ground travel time) from the nearest alternative airport eligible for AIP
funds (special conditions apply to heliports);


1.1.4 The airport serves as a scheduled mail stop of an air carrier transporting mail pursuant to a contract
with the U.S. Postal Service;

1.1.5 The airport serves as a permanent base for the Air National Guard or a reserve component of the U.S. Armed
Forces; or

1.1.6 The airport meets a significant national interest (established by special written justification
or by a benefit-cost analysis).


1.2 Airport sponsors must also satisfy statutory and administrative application and grant condition requirements,
including environmental review, public hearings where applicable, airport layout plan and airspace approval,
and financial capability. Proposed airport projects should be supported by comprehensive master planning studies.
A full exposition of these and other requirements is provided in Chapter 3, ``Project Eligibility, Allowable Costs,
and Donations,'' of Order 5100.38A.

1.3 Airports meeting the above criteria are eligible and their sponsors may apply for AIP discretionary grants.
AIP funds apportioned to sponsors by formula in accordance with statutory criteria will be granted for eligible work.


Prioritization of Projects Seeking Discretionary Grants



2. Projects meeting the eligibility requirements in section 1 above are ranked for funding priority.
2.1 FAA regional offices rank all grant applications according to the Priority System defined in Chapter
3 or Order 5100.38A. Projects are scored and ranked in the Priority System based on type of project and airport size
(lowest overall scores have highest priority). Development project types include (in descending order of priority):
Special Programs (safety and security items required by regulation or congressional mandate); reconstruction
(infrastructure preservation); standards (including noise mitigation); upgrade; new capacity; and new airport
construction. Airport size classes include (in descending order of priority): primary airports and relievers in
large and medium hubs; primary airports and relievers outside of large and medium hubs; commercial service airports
other than primary airports; and noncommercial airports. Priority System scores by project type and airport role
and size are shown in Figure 1.

2.2 On an annual basis, the FAA will establish performance goals for the AIP. In FY 1995, goals will be related
to five factors of the airport system: Safety; security; infrastructure preservation; capacity; and environmental
compatibility.
2.3 The FAA will ensure consistent application of current and future selection criteria at the regional FAA
office level.
2.4 FAA headquarters will use threshold Priority System scores to ensure that only the highest priority projects
from a national perspective are funded.

Benefit-Cost Analysis of Discretionary Capacity Projects


3. To ensure that AIP monies are invested wisely, the FAA will apply benefit-cost analysis (BCA) to eligible high priority
projects intended to preserve or enhance capacity for which the total value of requested discretionary capacity
grants is expected to equal or exceed $10 million over the life of the project. Included would be projects to add new
capacity or reconstruct existing capacity.

3.1 For each such project at or above the $10 million threshold, the FAA will simulate traffic flow at the existing
airport to determine the hours of annual flight delay that would be prevented by the capacity project in question.
Most reductions in delay attributable to capacity projects can be measured at the project airport level.

3.2 The FAA may utilize assessments of broader system delay reduction when investments at an airport are intended
to relieve congestion at neighboring airports or when there is the likelihood that capacity improvements at a project
airport will contribute significantly to delay reductions elsewhere in the regional or national system. The FAA
will continue to improve its modeling procedures and capabilities to capture more fully the effects of projects on
the national air transportation system.

3.3 Capacity benefits expected to result from the proposed project will be quantified using methodology
developed for the FAA's Airport Capacity Design Team studies. Annual delay savings will be modeled for three airport
activity levels: current operations levels; intermediate-term operations levels (5 to 10 years out); and long-term
operations levels (10 to 20 years out). Delay savings will be measured in hours and converted to monetary terms using
aircraft operating costs and the value of air passenger time. Benefits for years in which activity levels fall between
these three reference levels will be estimated through interpolation. Data on future activity levels will be taken
from the FAA Terminal Area Forecast or an FAA-approved forecast in the Airport Master Plan or Draft/Final Environmental
Impact Statement (whichever is most recent).

3.4 The FAA will collect data specific to airport/terminal airspace. Required data will include (but will
not be limited to): the approved Airport Layout Plan; type of aircraft operations; fleet mix; peak-hour airfield
mix by class; runway occupancy times; percentages of aircraft exiting at each taxiway; noise, obstruction, terrain,
departure, and arrival constraints; air traffic arrival and departure streams; minimum vectoring altitudes; aircraft
separation by aircraft type; length of and approach speeds on common approaches by aircraft type and weather; converging
and/or parallel runway arrival and departure dependencies; and the different runway use configurations in the various
wind and weather conditions.

3.5 The FAA will consider project capacity and operational efficiency benefits other than delay reduction.
Benefits that cannot be quantified will be considered in a qualitative sense. In the future, the FAA may broaden the
scope of its capacity benefit measure to include value of producer and consumer surplus (or another measure of benefits).
Adoption of new measures of capacity benefits will depend on development of methodologies for accurately quantifying
these benefits.

3.6 The FAA will measure total costs of project panning, construction, land acquisition, and operations
and maintenance over a 20 year project life. Where appropriate, the FAA will include costs to airlines and the public
due to operating delays caused by construction of the project and any costs to the community stemming from environmental
impacts resulting from the project.

3.7 Project benefits and costs will be compared using standard discounted cash flow techniques as enunciated
by the Office of Management and Budget in Circular No. A-94, ``Guidelines and Discount Rates for Benefit-Cost
Analysis of Federal Programs.'' Circular No. A-94 currently mandates a discount rate of 7 percent in real terms.

3.8 On an annual basis, the FAA will re-evaluate the threshold value for total discretionary capacity grants
at or above which a capacity project must subjected to BCA. Greater experience and improved modeling capabilities
may allow the threshold to be reduced to capture a greater number of discretionary capacity projects. Different thresholds
could be established for airport size categories identified in the Priority System.

3.9 In the future, the FAA will look to expand the application to BCA to non-capacity projects funded through
discretionary funds. The FAA will consider the publication of detailed guidance on appropriate BCA methodologies
and the assignment of some or all BCA responsibilities to project sponsors (subject to FAA review).



Implementation of Selection Criteria



4. The FAA will publish materials describing the implementation of the revised selection criteria.

4.1 By December 1995, the FAA will issue an amended Order 5100.38A that will incorporate the selection criteria
described in this notice of policy.

4.2 The FAA will incorporate information describing its AIP grant award decisions into its ``Annual Report
of Accomplishments Under the Airport Improvement Program.'' The report will explain the application of project
selection criteria. The first annual report including project selection information will be published by April
1, 1995.



Other AIP Selection Criteria Initiatives


5. The FAA's effort to improve the effectiveness of its investments in the airport system will be reinforced by other
agency initiatives.

5.1 Concurrently with the issuance of this notice, the FAA is issuing a new policy on Letters of Intent (LOI)
which will become effective in FY 1995. Under this new policy: LOI's will be limited to airside development projects
which significantly enhance systemwide airport capacity; BCA will be applied to all LOI's; and the FAA will consider
the financial commitment of the project sponsor to the project to be financed by the LOI.

5.2 Consistent with Executive Order 12893, ``Principles for Federal Infrastructure Investments,'' the
FAA will estimate anticipated aggregate benefits and costs of AIP authorization requests beginning with FY 1996.



Outreach Program



6. The FAA has established an outreach program to solicit advice from Congress, State and local governments, airports,
airlines, interest groups, and the public on how to improve AIP selection criteria.

6.1 The FAA will arrange for the Transportation Research Board to host an industry/academia/government
symposium to solicit comments on the FAA's AIP project selection process and the use of BCA. The symposium will take
place in Washington, DC, on October 27, 1994. A summary of the symposium proceedings will be available to interested
parties upon request to the individuals named under the heading ``For Further Information Contact:''.

6.2 The FAA will host informal meetings as requested with interested parties on the application of the new
selection criteria to airport projects.

6.3 The FAA will conduct a systematic assessment of and be responsive to comments it receives in the course
of its administration of the revised selection process.

ACTION: 

Cancellation of Notice of Intent to prepare an environmental impact statement. Reference: 

Federal Register, 

Volume 54, Number 90, Thursday, May 11, 1989.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The FHWA is issuing this notice to inform the public that an environmental impact statement (EIS) will not be prepared
for the proposed upgrading of the Ketchikan transportation system from Ward Cove to Deermount Street. The scope of
the proposed improvements has been significantly reduced. An EIS will not be prepared because significant environment
impacts should not result from this project.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The new project scope involves improvements along Tongass Avenue between the Airport Ferry Terminal and Deermount
Street, rehabilitation and reconstruction of viaduct sections along Tongass Avenue including realignment of the
S-Curve, and installation of traffic signals and underground utilities. In addition to the improvements on Tongass
Avenue, the project would construct a two lane road connecting the existing Third Avenue with Schoenbar Road. This
will enable drivers and bicyclists to avoid a portion of Tongass Avenue, which will relieve congestion.


This revised proposal is based on written comments and the results of public meetings held from May, 1989, to March
1993 regarding the proposed project. Members of the public and agency representatives discussed potential alternatives
and identified relevant issues at these meetings. Input received indicates that there is not strong support at this
time for additional improvements to Tongass Avenue and North Tongass Highway. The revised scope adequately meets
the stated need. And Environmental Assessment/Draft Section 4(f) Evaluation will be available for review in late
1994.

Federal laboratory.


Qualifying Work


The award will recognize work that has substantially improved domestic motor vehicle research and development in
the areas of motor vehicle safety, motor vehicle energy savings, or environmental impacts of motor vehicles. The
work may be a singular one time accomplishment or it may be a series of accomplishments that have had substantial effect
over time. Examples of the types of achievements that fall into the three categories are:


1. Safety Improvement


Vehicular technology that reduces the likelihood of crashes (crash avoidance) or the likelihood of serious injury
when a crash occurs (crashworthiness) or otherwise improves the changes of post-crash survival/recovery of crash
victims. This could include research and development of instrumentation of biomechanics.


2. Energy Savings


Technology that saves energy in the production or operation of motor vehicles by such means as light weight structures,
engine and drive train improvements, reductions in tire rolling resistance or aerodynamic drag, and modifications
of fuel characteristics.


3. Improvements in Environmental Quality


Motor vehicle technology that reduces emissions, reduces solid waste, reduces hazardous waste, reduces noise (e.g.
tire noise), as well as technology that reduces waste byproducts of motor vehicle production, operation, or scrappage.

Evaluation Process and Criteria






NHTSA and other Federal agency staff will make an initial screening of all nominations received on or before December
16, 1994 to ensure that they contain the required information and meet the statutory requirements for eligibility
and field of work. Subsequently, a special panel will evaluate the nominations. NHTSA intends that the evaluation
panel will include experts in the fields of energy savings and environmental impact in addition to motor vehicle safety.
The panel will make its evaluations according to the following criteria:




1. Quality of cited work.


2. Contribution of cited work to improved safety, energy savings or environmental quality.


3. Involvement of nominees with cited work.




The Secretary of Transportation will then select the awardee from among the nominees receiving high evaluations
from the evaluation panel. The Secretary may also decide not to make an award. His decision is final.

Proposed Finding for Federal Acknowledgment of the Jena Band of Choctaw Indians 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Bureau of Indian Affairs, Interior. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed finding. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Pursuant to 25 CFR 83.10(h), notice is hereby given that the Assistant Secretary proposes to acknowledge that the
Jena Band of Choctaw Indians, c/o Jerry D. Jackson, P.O. Box 14, Jena, Louisiana, 71342, exists as an Indian tribe within
the meaning of Federal law. This notice is based on a determination that the tribe meets the seven mandatory criteria
set forth in 25 CFR 83.7. Therefore, the Jena Band of Choctaw Indians meets the requirements necessary for a government-to-government
relationship with the United States. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Jena Band of Choctaw Indians directly descends from a community of Choctaws who resided in western Catahoula Parish,
now LaSalle Parish, in the vicinity of Jena, Louisiana, since first identified by the census of 1880. The linguist
Albert Gatschet reported finding three Choctaw families on Trout Creek, Catahoula Parish in 1886. The Trout Creek
settlement lived in log huts on land owned by Thomas Whatley. They were known locally as the Eden Indians, the Choctaw
Indians on Trout Creek, and the Whatley Indians in reference to their residences or to the landowners with whom they
were associated. After World War II, most of the tribe moved into the nearby town of Jena, Louisiana. They formally
incorporated in 1974, as the Jena Band of Choctaw Indians, but usually refer to themselves as the Jena Choctaws. 


Aboriginal Choctaw territory lay east of the Mississippi River, but the Choctaws also hunted west of the river. Although
wandering Choctaws had been observed in Louisiana before 1800, there is no evidence to connect any of the Jena Choctaws
with the earliest Choctaw inhabitants of Louisiana. There is some evidence that they had attempted to go north to the
Choctaw Nation, but returned to Louisiana from there. Gatschet's interviews, the Federal censuses, and the testimony
of ancestors before the 1902 U.S. Commission to the Five Civilized Tribes, known as the Dawes Commission, all substantiate
that the Jena Choctaws came from Scott and Newton counties in Mississippi and probably arrived in the vicinity of Jena,
Louisiana during the 1870's. 
Several of the Choctaws from the Jena vicinity removed to Oklahoma between 1903 and 1920, but the remnants of four families
remained, t
