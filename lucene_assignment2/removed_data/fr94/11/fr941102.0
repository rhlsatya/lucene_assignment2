Prevailing Rate Systems; Abolishment of Detroit Special Wage Schedules for Printing Positions



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Personnel Management.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Interim rule with request for comments.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Office of Personnel Management is issuing interim regulations to abolish the Federal Wage System special wage
schedule for printing positions in the Detroit, Michigan, wage area. Printing and lithographic employees in Detroit
will now be paid rates from the regular Detroit, Michigan, wage schedule.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Department of Defense recommended to the Office of Personnel Management that the Detroit, Michigan, Printing
and Lithographic wage schedule be abolished and that the regular Detroit, Michigan, wage schedule apply to printing
employees in Detroit. This recommendation was based on the fact that the Detroit special printing wage survey would
produce special schedule rates lower than the regular schedule rates for the area. Because regulations provide that
the special printing schedule rates may not be lower than the regular schedule rates for an area, special printing
schedule rates for Detroit are currently based on the Detroit regular wage schedule rates.


In addition, the Detroit special printing wage survey has become impractical due to the declining number of printing
and lithographic employees available to serve as data collectors in the Detroit wage area. There are only nine covered
employees. No employee's wage rate will be reduced upon conversion to the regular schedule. The Federal Prevailing
Rate Advisory Committee has reviewed this recommendation and by consensus has recommended approval.
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B), I find that good cause exists for waiving the general notice of proposed rulemaking.
Also, pursuant to section 553(d)(3) of title 5, United States Code, I find that good cause exists for making this rule
effective in less than 30 days. The notice is being waived and the regulation is being made effective in less than 30
days because preparations for the January 1995 Detroit survey must begin immediately.


Regulatory Flexibility Act


I certify that these regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
because they affect only Federal agencies and employees.


Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Review


This rule has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget in accordance with Executive Order 12866.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) amends its regulations regarding the handling of U.S. Treasury Checks and
U.S. Savings Bonds. This action is necessary to update information regarding the disposition of checks and savings
bonds in various circumstances. The intended effect is to identify the proper procedures for handling U.S. Treasury
Checks and U.S. Savings Bonds. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
This action is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12866 since it only involves internal agency management.
It is the policy of 
this Department that rules relating to public property, loans, 
grants, benefits, or contracts shall be published for comments, not 
withstanding the exemption in 5 U.S.C. 553 regarding such rules. This action is not published for proposed rulemaking
because it involves only internal Agency management and publication for comment is unnecessary. 



Discussion 




The FmHA issues FmHA Instruction 2018-D, Policy and Procedure for Handling U.S. Treasury Checks and U.S. Savings
Bonds, to replace FmHA 
Instruction 102.1, Handling of Loan Checks, Salary Checks, and U.S. Savings Bonds. The purpose of FmHA Instruction
2018-D is to identify the internal Agency procedures necessary for the proper handling of U.S. Treasury Checks
and U.S. Savings Bonds. Published references to FmHA Instruction 102.1 contained in 7 CFR Parts 1902, 1941, 1942,
1943, 1944, and 1945 are being revised to reference FmHA Instruction 2018-D. 



Environmental Impact Statement 



This document has been reviewed in accordance with 7 CFR part 1940, subpart G, ``Environmental Program.'' FmHA has
determined that this action does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the
human environment and in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, Public Law 91-190,
and environmental impact statement is not required.

Securities Offering Disclosure Rules 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Treasury. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is amending its regulations governing the disclosure requirements
for offers and sales of national bank securities. This final rule replaces regulations detailing the contents of
offering documents covering national bank securities and requires that offering documents conform to the information
requirements set forth in the appropriate Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) registration form. The final
rule also cross-references certain provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and SEC rules. 


The purpose of the final rule is to reduce unnecessary regulatory burdens on national banks and enhance their ability
to raise capital, while maintaining the quality of disclosures provided to investors. The final rule generally treats
national bank securities comparably to those of other corporations and eliminates a duplicative and potentially
confusing system of regulations and forms. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


The OCC's securities offering regulations protect the purchasers of national bank securities by ensuring that investors
receive full disclosure of all material facts when purchasing such securities, and also protect the integrity of
national bank capital. The OCC determined, however, that revisions to these regulations were needed to reduce unnecessary
burdens that the requirements imposed on national banks.

The OCC published a notice of proposed rulemaking (proposal), on October 15, 1992, seeking public comment on proposed
revisions to the OCC's regulations governing the offer and sale of national bank securities (57 FR 47,280). The proposal
replaced the OCC's former regulations with a series of regulations based, to the extent appropriate for national
banks, on the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) (15 U.S.C. 77a through 77aa) and the SEC's rules (17 CFR part 230).
The deadline for submitting comments on the proposal originally was December 14, 1992. The OCC extended that deadline
to February 1, 1993 (58 FR 4600), after several potential commenters requested additional time to prepare and submit
comments. 


Overview of Final Rule 


The OCC is issuing this final rule pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1 

et seq

 and 93a. The final rule generally requires national bank securities offering documents to conform to the form for
registration that the bank would use if it had to register the securities under the Securities Act. Accordingly, the
final rule cross-references a number of provisions of the Securities Act and a number of SEC rules. The OCC's former
regulations generally required the disclosure of similar information but in a different format than used by the SEC.
And, unlike the SEC, the OCC did not provide for incorporation by reference of filings made under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) (15 U.S.C. 78a through 78jj). 
By conforming its securities disclosure rules to those of the SEC, the OCC believes it can reduce significantly unnecessary
regulatory burden. Banks, bank counsel, and investors are familiar with SEC disclosure requirements. In addition
to being well-known in the marketplace, the interpretation of SEC disclosure requirements is well established and
benefits from a significant body of precedent. Moreover, because the OCC rules will now actually reference the SEC
rules, rather than parallel or copy them, the OCC rules will automatically remain current. Thus, the OCC's adoption
of the SEC registration requirements, while reducing regulatory burden through the elimination of a duplicate (yet
sometimes slightly dissimilar) set of disclosure rules, will maintain the quality of disclosure received by investors.

Similar to the OCC's former regulations, the final rule generally prohibits the offer or sale of bank-issued securities
unless: (1) A registration statement for those securities has been filed with and declared effective by the OCC and
the securities are sold through a prospectus that was filed as a part of that registration statement, or (2) the transaction
is subject to an exemption. The final rule incorporates various SEC exemptions from registration requirements and
adds an exemption for offers and sales of certain large denomination high-grade debt securities to accredited investors.

For example, the final rule incorporates through cross-reference the SEC's Regulation A (17 CFR 230.251 through
230.263), which sets forth the small issues exemption from registration requirements. Regulation A provides a simplified
disclosure system for offerings of up to $5 million in any 12-month period. The OCC's former regulations included
a similar exemption, but it was limited to offerings of up to $2 million in a 12-month period. 
The final rule also includes an abbreviated registration system for offers and sales of large denominations of nonconvertible
debt to accredited investors (defined in 17 CFR 230.501). This abbreviated registration system reduces unnecessary
regulatory burden on offers and sales of such debt in situations where purchasers do not need the more extensive disclosures
provided by the full part 16 registration process.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941102-0-00008 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941102-0-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The OCC originally developed the abbreviated registration system through a series of interpretive and no-objection
letters issued under the former part 16. While the SEC rules do not provide for this abbreviated approach, the OCC believes
it is appropriate for several reasons. The market for such debt is well-developed and has not presented particular
disclosure concerns. The requirements that the securities have a specified large denomination, be highly- rated,
and that purchasers must meet the accredited investor criteria further ensure that the debt will only be offered and
sold by a bank in situations when an abbreviated disclosure system is appropriate. Inclusion of this abbreviated
approach in the final rule clarifies its criteria and provides better notice that such a system is available. 
The final rule also cross-references the SEC's Rule 415 (17 CFR 230.415) on shelf registration. This enables banks
to register securities for future sale and then to sell those securities when market conditions are favorable. Under
the OCC's former regulations, shelf registration was not permitted. This imposed additional and unnecessary costs
on national banks and put them at a disadvantage with respect to other issuers seeking to raise capital. 
The final rule provides that nonpublic offerings of securities generally may be made in accordance with the SEC's
Regulation D (17 CFR 230.501 through 230.508). The final rule permits sales to an unlimited number of investors who
meet certain requirements (accredited investors), and up to 35 other sophisticated purchasers, or to any number
of sophisticated purchasers subject to a limitation on the aggregate offering price. 
Cross-reference of the SEC's Regulation D increases the number of allowable purchasers in a nonpublic offering.
The former regulation allowed banks to make nonpublic offerings to only 15 sophisticated purchasers (and an unlimited
number of accredited investors) in a 12-month period, unless the bank received OCC permission to increase the number
of purchasers. 
The revised rule makes certain conforming changes to   5.46 and 5.47 to enable banks to use the SEC's Rule
415 (17 CFR 230.415) on shelf registration. The final rule further provides that a bank need not obtain prior OCC approval
for a cash sale of preferred stock or an issuance of subordinated debt unless the OCC has notified the bank that prior
approval is necessary. The OCC's former regulations required prior OCC approval for all cash sales of preferred stock
and issuances of subordinated debt. 
The Interagency Statement on Retail Sales of Nondeposit Investment Products (February 15, 1994) applies to retail
sales of nondeposit investment products including bank securities. Thus, if bank securities are sold to retail customers,
banks must ensure that such customers are fully informed that the securities are not insured by the FDIC, are not deposits
or other obligations of the bank and are not guaranteed by the bank, and are subject to investment risks including possible
loss of the principal invested. 


Section-By-Section Discussion 


The OCC received 13 comments on the proposal. The commenters generally supported the OCC's plan to incorporate through
cross-reference certain sections of the Securities Act and the SEC's rules thereunder, and to adopt the SEC's forms.
The commenters focused on specific aspects of the revisions that they believed needed modification. The OCC has carefully
considered each of the comment letters and has made a number of changes in response to them.

Definitions (Section 16.2) 


The proposal cross-referenced a number of definitions in the Securities Act. One such definition was the Securities
Act definition of ``underwriter.'' The proposal's cross-reference to the ``underwriter'' definition brought
sales of stock by control persons and affiliates within the coverage of part 16. The former version of part 16 had covered
those sales as indirect sales by a bank. By adopting the Securities Act underwriter definition, the proposal clarified
the coverage of part 16. The final rule adopts the cross-reference to the definition of ``underwriter'' as proposed.

The proposal also defined ``security'' to conform with the definition in the Securities Act. The proposed definition
was more detailed than the definition in the former part 16, specifying that all bank debt, not just debt subordinated
to the claims of general creditors was considered a security. The definition in the former part 16 was unclear as to
what debt instruments were covered. 
The OCC received six comments on this issue. One commenter favored specifically covering senior debt in the definition
while five commenters were opposed. Several commenters also stated that the definition of ``security'' should exclude
specific traditional bank products and deposits. 
The final rule includes a cross-reference to the Securities Act definition of ``security.'' That definition clearly
includes senior debt. While a number of banks interpreted the definition of ``security'' in the former part 16 as excluding
senior debt and opposed a change in the definition that they viewed as expanding the coverage of part 16, the OCC believes
there is no reason to treat senior debt differently from subordinated debt for purposes of this definition. Purchasers
of both types of debt should receive the information necessary to make informed investment decisions. 
In fact, the passage of the depositor preference provisions of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1993 (12 U.S.C. 1821(d)(11))
has strengthened the need for purchasers of senior debt to receive disclosure materials. The depositor preference
provisions require the FDIC to pay the claims of uninsured depositors prior to paying the claims of any other general
creditors of a bank. Senior debt, therefore, is not equivalent to uninsured deposits. Purchasers of senior debt now
are less likely than they were prior to the passage of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act to receive full payment in the
event of a bank's insolvency. 
The definition of ``security'' in the final rule does not specifically exclude traditional bank products. Nevertheless,
the OCC does not intend that the definition cover insured or uninsured deposits or other traditional bank products,
including letters of credit, banker's acceptances, or repurchase agreements. Judicial precedents have generally
found these instruments 

not

 to be securities. Providing an exhaustive list of exceptions in the definition of ``security'' would be unwieldy
and detract from the benefits of cross-referencing the SEC definition. 


Registration Statement and Prospectus Requirements (Section 16.3) 


Section 16.3 of the proposal set forth the general prohibitions on offers and sales of bank securities. Under the proposal,
no person could offer or sell bank securities unless a registration statement for the securities had been filed with
and declared effective by the OCC and the offer or sale was accompanied or preceded by a prospectus filed as a part of
that registration statement, or an exemption was available under part 16. The OCC would keep on file and make available
for public inspection the information that was included in the registration statement but not included in the prospectus
provided to shareholders.

The OCC's proposed requirements on the use of a preliminary prospectus and the delivery of a final prospectus differed
from the comparable SEC requirements. The OCC proposal simply incorporated the former part 16 requirements. The
proposal required prior OCC authorization to use a preliminary prospectus. The proposal also required that, except
in a situation where the OCC has authorized the use of a preliminary prospectus, offers must be made through the use
and delivery of a prospectus that has been declared effective by the OCC. Unlike the SEC rules, the proposal did not
generally permit a bank to provide the final prospectus to purchasers with the confirmation. 

Five commenters addressed the OCC's proposed requirements on the use of a preliminary prospectus and the delivery
of a final prospectus. All five commenters agreed that the OCC should follow the Securities Act requirements and SEC
rules. Upon further consideration, the OCC agrees and has revised  16.3 of the final rule to more clearly follow
the requirements in the Securities Act and the SEC rules. The final rule provides that a preliminary prospectus may
be used if (1) a registration statement including the preliminary prospectus has been filed with the OCC; (2) the preliminary
prospectus includes the information required in a final prospectus (except for omission of certain information
dependent on the offering price); and (3) a copy of the final prospectus is furnished to each purchaser prior to or simultaneously
with the sale of the security. 



Communications Not Deemed an Offer (Section 16.4) 



The proposal listed a number of communications that the OCC did not deem to be offers and which therefore did not violate
the prohibitions on making offers in  16.3. The list included communications that comply with SEC Rule 134 or
135 (17 CFR 230.134 or 230.135). SEC Rules 134 and 135 govern advertisements used prior and subsequent to the filing
of a registration statement. The proposal also provided that supplemental sales literature could be used after a
registration statement has been declared effective if the sales literature was accompanied or preceded by a prospectus.
In addition, the proposal provided that advertisements only had to be filed with the OCC upon the OCC's request. 

The proposal also eliminated certain restrictions on advertisements that were in the former part 16. Former part
16 permitted the use of only extremely limited information in advertisements, such as the name of the bank and the amount
of securities being offered, did not provide for the use of sales literature, and required all advertisements to be
cleared by the OCC prior to use. 

The OCC received no comments on this section of the proposal. However, the final rule adds to the list of permissible
communications four types of communications that were not in the proposal, but which are permissible under SEC rules.
Those communications include an oral offer of securities covered by a registration statement that has been filed
with the OCC, a summary prospectus that satisfies the requirements of SEC Rule 431 (17 CFR 230.431), a notice of a proposed
unregistered offering that satisfies the requirements of SEC Rule 135c (17 CFR 230.135c), and a communication that
satisfies the requirements of SEC Rules 138 or 139 (17 CFR 230.138 or 230.139_Definition of ``offer for sale'' and
``offer to sell'' in sections 2(10) and 5(c) of the Securities Act in relation to certain publications). 



Exemptions (Section 16.5) 



Under the proposal, the registration and prospectus requirements did not apply to an offer or sale of securities exempt
under certain sections of the Securities Act or the rules promulgated thereunder. The registration and prospectus
requirements did not apply if the securities were exempt from registration under section 3 of the Securities Act (15
U.S.C. 77c) by reason of an exemption other than those contained in section 3(a)(2) (for securities issued by banks)
or section 3(a)(11) (for intrastate offerings). The proposed registration and prospectus requirements also did
not apply to transactions exempt from registration under section 4 of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77d). Section
4 of the Securities Act exempts transactions by any person other than an issuer, underwriter or dealer, transactions
by an issuer not involving a public offering, transactions involving offers or sales by an issuer solely to accredited
investors, and other transactions that meet certain specified requirements.

The proposal generally exempted from the  16.3 registration statement and prospectus requirements offers
and sales of bank securities to sophisticated purchasers that satisfy the requirements of SEC Regulation D (17 CFR
230.501 through 230.508). SEC Regulation D sets forth rules governing the limited offer and sale of securities without
registration under the Securities Act, providing a safe harbor for compliance with sections 3(b) and 4(2) of the Securities
Act (15 U.S.C. 77c(b) and 77d(2)). 

The proposal also exempted from the  16.3 registration statement and prospectus requirements offers and sales
of bank issued securities in transactions that satisfy the abbreviated disclosure requirements of certain SEC rules.
Those rules require only limited disclosure to purchasers because of the particular circumstances of the types of
transactions. The rules include Rules 144 (17 CFR 230.144_Persons deemed not to be engaged in a distribution and therefore
not underwriters), 144A (17 CFR 230.144A_Private resales of securities to institutions), 236 (17 CFR 230.236_Exemption
of shares offered in connection with certain transactions), and Regulation S (17 CFR 230.901 through 230.904_Rules
governing offers and sales made outside the United States without registration under the Securities Act of 1933).
In addition, the proposal exempted transactions that complied with the requirements of SEC Rules 701, 702T, and 703T
(17 CFR 230.701, 230.702T, and 230.703T), which cover offers and sales of securities pursuant to certain compensatory
benefit plans and contracts relating to compensation. 

The commenters largely agreed with the OCC's approach. Two commenters recommended that the OCC also exempt transactions
that comply with the SEC's Regulation A (17 CFR 230.251 through 230.263). Regulation A permits unregistered, public
offerings of up to $5 million in securities under certain specified conditions. 

The final rule adopts the exemptions from the registration and prospectus requirements included in the proposal,
and also includes an exemption for transactions that comply with Regulation A. (This exemption is discussed further
under ``Small Issues (16.8)'' of this preamble). This approach treats banks comparably to other corporations when
issuing small quantities of securities. 



Sales of Nonconvertible Debt (Section 16.6) 



The proposal provided an optional abbreviated registration system for offers and sales of nonconvertible debt if
those transactions met certain requirements. Offers and sales that met those requirements were deemed to be in compliance
with the Registration statement and prospectus (16.3), Form and content (16.15), and Periodic and current reports
(16.20) provisions of part 16. 

In particular, the proposal specified that: (1) The bank issuing the nonconvertible debt must have securities registered
under the Exchange Act or must be a subsidiary of a bank holding company that has securities registered under the Exchange
Act; (2) The insured depository institution subsidiaries of the registered bank holding company must constitute
at least 80% of the bank holding company's assets; (3) The debt must be offered and sold only to accredited investors
(defined in 17 CFR 230.501(a)); (4) The debt must be offered and sold by a reputable and experienced underwriter, not
affiliated with the bank; (5) The debt must be sold in minimum denominations of more than $100,000 and the notes cannot
be exchanged for notes in smaller denominations; (6) The debt must be rated investment quality; (7) Each purchaser
must receive an offering document describing the terms of the debt and incorporating the bank's latest Call Reports
and the bank or holding company's Exchange Act filings; (8) The offering document and any amendments must be filed
with the OCC within five days after first use; and (9) Any required filing fees must be submitted. 

The OCC designed the requirements of the abbreviated registration system to ensure that potential purchasers of
debt subject to the abbreviated registration system had access to necessary information on the issuing bank and commonly
controlled depository institutions, as well as the appropriate knowledge and experience to evaluate that information.


The OCC requested comment on whether this abbreviated registration system was necessary or appropriate. The OCC
received 11 comments on this issue. Although the commenters generally favored the abbreviated registration system,
they expressed different perspectives about the specific requirements of the system. A number stated that the OCC
should eliminate the requirement that nonconvertible debt be sold by an underwriter unaffiliated with the bank.
Several commenters agreed that the OCC needed to revise the abbreviated registration system to address the special
circumstances of federal branches and agencies of foreign banks.

<PARENT> FR941102-0-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The OCC agrees with the commenters that the underwriter requirement is unnecessary. The underwriter requirement
imposes additional costs on banks and limits their flexibility without necessarily improving the quality of the
disclosure materials provided to investors. The final rule therefore does not require that the debt be offered and
sold by an underwriter, not affiliated with the bank, as part of an underwritten offering.

In addition, the OCC has determined that it is unnecessary to require that the insured depository subsidiaries of
a registered bank holding company constitute at least 80% of the bank holding company's assets. This asset-based
requirement does not ensure that the holding company's Exchange Act filings would be more meaningful to investors
than the filings would be without the requirement. Accordingly, it has been eliminated from the final rule.

Further, the final rule requires that the debt be sold in minimum denominations of $250,000, rather than more than
$100,000, in order to provide additional protections to purchasers of debt. Requiring larger denomination notes,
and preventing them from being broken into smaller denominations, helps ensure that the purchasers of the notes are
sophisticated, high net worth individuals or entities, for whom abbreviated disclosure is appropriate.

The final rule also takes into account the special circumstances of federal branches of foreign banks. Because foreign
banks and their holding companies generally are not reporting companies under the Exchange Act, federal branches
and agencies often would be unable to comply fully with the requirements on Exchange Act filings in the abbreviated
registration system. Federal branches and agencies usually do not have securities registered under the Exchange
Act and are not subsidiaries of holding companies registered under the Exchange Act. Therefore, federal branches
and agencies also cannot incorporate Exchange Act filings into offering documents.

Accordingly, the final rule provides that federal branches and agencies of foreign banks need not have securities
registered under the Exchange Act or be subsidiaries of holding companies that have securities registered under
the Exchange Act to take advantage of the abbreviated registration system. Instead, these entities may make information
about themselves available to purchasers by filing with the OCC the information specified in SEC Rule 12g3-2(b)
(17 CFR 240.12g3-2(b)) and providing purchasers with the information specified in SEC Rule 144A(d)(4)(i)
(17 CFR 230.144A(d)(4)(i)). The OCC believes that this information is adequate for the sophisticated purchasers
who are eligible investors under the abbreviated disclosure system. Such purchasers also are able to determine whether
they have sufficient information to make informed investment decisions, and if they do not, can request additional
information.



Nonpublic Offerings (Section 16.7)



The proposal permitted offers and sales without compliance with the registration statement and prospectus requirements
of  16.3 if the offers and sales were made in accordance with SEC Regulation D (17 CFR 230.501 through 230.508)
and the purchasers were either accredited investors or ``sophisticated'' investors. SEC Regulation D sets forth
rules governing the limited offer and sale of securities without registration under the Securities Act and provides
a safe harbor for compliance with sections 3(b) and 4(2) of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77c(b) and 77d(2)). SEC Regulation
D does not require that in all circumstances purchasers be sophisticated.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941102-0-00013 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941102-0-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The proposal's cross-reference of Regulation D increased the number of purchasers permitted in a nonpublic offering
over the number allowed under the former part 16. Former part 16, as interpreted by the OCC, permitted sales to only
15 sophisticated purchasers (and an unlimited number of accredited investors), unless the seller received OCC permission
to increase the number of purchasers. The proposal permitted sales to 35 sophisticated purchasers and an unlimited
number of accredited investors, or to any number of sophisticated purchasers subject to a limitation on the aggregate
offering price.

The proposal required the filing of a notice of sales no later than 15 days after the first sale of securities in accordance
with SEC Rule 503 of Regulation D. Under the former part 16, nonpublic offering notices had to be filed 20 days prior
to the time any security was offered or sold. This proposed change gave banks added flexibility in the timing of sales
of securities.

Under the proposal, securities subject to the limitations on resale of Regulation D must be sold pursuant to SEC Rule
144 or 144A, another exemption from registration under the Securities Act, or in accordance with the part 16 registration
and prospectus requirements. The former part 16 did not permit any securities sold in a nonpublic offering to be resold
for two years. The proposed change in resale limitations would improve the marketability of bank securities.

The OCC received two comments on this section of the proposal. One commenter supported the cross-reference of Regulation
D. The other commenter believed that by including the notice requirement in the nonpublic offering section, the OCC
was making the filing of a notice a condition to the availability of the nonpublic offering exemption. The commenter
stated that while the SEC does provide for the filing of a notice, it is not a condition of any of the exemptions in Regulation
D.

The final rule adopts this section as proposed with certain clarifying changes. The final rule indicates more clearly
that although the filing of a notice is required, failure to file a notice does not result in the loss of the nonpublic
offering exemption. Thus, the notice is not a condition of any of the exemptions in Regulation D. The final rule also
clarifies that offers and sales made in reliance on Regulation D must only be made to sophisticated purchasers.



Small Issues (Section 16.8)



The proposal did not cross-reference the SEC's Regulation A (17 CFR 230.251 through 230.264), which permits the unregistered,
public offering of securities under specified conditions. The OCC requested comment as to whether it should cross-reference
Regulation A and received two comments in response. Both commenters believed that the OCC should cross-reference
Regulation A. 

In light of these comments, the OCC has decided to cross-reference Regulation A in the final rule. Given the criteria
for use of the rule, the OCC does not believe its use reduces purchaser safeguards. Moreover, the OCC believes that
the Regulation A small issues exemption from registration should be available to banks, as it is to other issuers,
to prevent imposing unnecessary burdens on banks in connection with small securities issuances.

In order to use the Regulation A exemption, an issuer's offering documents must be filed with and reviewed by the OCC.
The final rule states that filers should consult the SEC's Securities Act Industry Guide 3_Statistical Disclosure
by Bank Holding Companies (17 CFR 229.801(c) and 231) for guidance on the appropriate disclosures to be included in
the offering document. The Guide 3 disclosures consist of information that potential purchasers of bank securities
need in order to evaluate their investments. 



Form and Content (Section 16.15) 



The proposal required all registration statements filed with the OCC to be on the form for registration that the bank
would use were it required to register the securities under the Securities Act. Which form a bank uses depends, among
other things, on whether the bank is subject to the registration and reporting requirements of section 12 or 15(d)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78

l

 and 78o(d)) and on the amount of the offering.

Several commenters suggested that the OCC clarify whether a national bank may use the SEC's Form S-3 (Form for
registration under the Securities Act of securities of certain issuers offered pursuant to certain types of transactions)
in connection with the offer and sale of its securities if its parent company meets the requirements set forth in Instruction
I.C. to Form S-3 and the other requirements set forth in Instruction I.C. are met.

The final rule permits national banks to use Form S-3 in such situations. Pursuant to Instruction I.C. to the
SEC's Form S-3, if the parent of a registrant meets the registration requirements for the use of Form S-3,
the registrant may use Form S-3 for offers and sales of nonconvertible debt or nonconvertible preferred stock
provided the registrant is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the parent and the securities being issued by the registrant
are investment grade securities (or are fully guaranteed by the qualifying parent as to principal and interest).

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941102-0-00014 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941102-0-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

A national bank may establish an Exchange Act disclosure base for the Form S-3 by registering its common stock
on Form 10 (General form for registration of securities pursuant to section 12(b) or 12(g) of the Exchange Act) prior
to the effectiveness of its offering document and incorporating by reference the form pursuant to Item 12(a)(1) of
Form S-3 in lieu of a Form 10-K (General form of annual report). 

The proposal also required that the registration statement must meet the requirements of the SEC regulations referred
to in the registration form. Those regulations include Regulation S-X (17 CFR part 210), which applies to financial
statements, and Regulation S-K (17 CFR part 229), which applies to the nonfinancial statement portion of the
registration statement. The OCC expects that, consistent with SEC requirements and practice, filers will prepare
registration statements for bank securities in accordance with Securities Act Industry Guide 3_Statistical Disclosure
by Bank Holding Companies (17 CFR 229.801(c) and 231). 

Because the proposal required registration statements to satisfy the requirements of the SEC regulations referred
to in the applicable registration form, the financial statements in the registration statements must be audited.
The OCC sought comment on whether it should limit the requirement for audited financial statements to banks of a certain
size and whether that size should be the cut-off for the requirement for annual independent audits that was established
pursuant to section 112 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) (12 U.S.C.
1831m). Several commenters stated that the OCC should limit the audited financial statements requirement to banks
of a certain size, although they disagreed as to what that size should be. 

After considering the comments, the OCC has decided not to limit the audited financial statements requirement to
banks of a certain size. The final rule requires audited financial statements from national banks to the same extent
that the SEC requires audited financial statements of other corporations. Requiring banks to provide audited financial
statements in their registration statements helps ensure that purchasers of bank stock receive the same quality
of disclosure and the same protections as do purchasers of stock of other types of issuers. 

Because the proposal required registration statements to comply with the SEC regulations referenced in the applicable
registration form, banks that were subsidiaries of holding companies had to include audited bank financial statements,
rather than bank holding company statements, in their registration statements. However, a number of commenters
felt that banks that are subsidiaries of holding companies that have securities registered under the Exchange Act
should not have to include audited bank financial statements in their registration statements. The commenters stated
that these banks should instead be allowed to include in their registration statements the audited financial statements
contained in the holding companies' Exchange Act filings and the banks' Call Reports. 

The OCC disagrees, and the final rule requires banks that are subsidiaries of holding companies to include audited
bank financial statements in registration statements for bank securities. The OCC believes that purchasers of bank
securities that are not subject to any sophistication requirements should be provided with bank, not merely holding
company, financial statements. Those purchasers need bank level financial statements in order to make informed
investment decisions about bank securities. 

The proposal cross-referenced the requirements of Rule 400 and Articles 1-3 of the SEC's general rules on registration
in SEC Regulation C (17 CFR 230.400 through 230.439). Regulation C includes the SEC rule on shelf registration in Rule
415 (17 CFR 230.415_Delayed or continuous offering and sale of securities). Shelf registration enables banks to
register securities that are to be sold in the future and then to sell those securities when the market conditions are
most favorable. Regulation C also includes SEC Rule 430A (17 CFR 230.430A_Prospectus in a registration statement
at the time of effectiveness). Rule 430A allows an issuer to file a prospectus that omits certain information dependent
on the offering price. The former part 16 did not contain any provisions comparable to Rule 415 or Rule 430A, so price
and other information had to be set at the time an offering document was filed. 

The final rule, like the proposal, cross-references the requirements of Rule 400 and Articles 1-3 of the SEC's
general rules on registration in SEC Regulation C (17 CFR 230.400 through 230.439). However, the final rule also cross-references
the other articles of Regulation C (17 CFR 230.445 through 230.497). The OCC is cross-referencing the remaining articles
of Regulation C in order to adopt the SEC's rules and procedures governing when registration statements and amendments
become effective. (For a discussion of this matter 

see

 ``Effectiveness ( 16.16)'' in this preamble). These remaining articles include rules on delaying amendments
and acceleration of the effective date that are integral to the procedures under which registration statements and
amendments become effective.

Effectiveness (Section 16.16)



The proposal did not provide for the adoption of the Securities Act provisions or the SEC's rules pertaining to when
registration statements become effective. The proposal retained the requirement in former part 16 that no registration
statement, prospectus, or amendment was effective until declared effective by the OCC.

Only one commenter discussed this issue. That commenter urged that the OCC follow the SEC's procedures in this area.
The OCC agrees and the final rule adopts the Securities Act provisions and the SEC's rules on effectiveness. (

See

 discussion under ``Form and Content ( 16.15)'' in this preamble.)

Under the cross-referenced provisions of the Securities Act, registration statements automatically become effective
20 days after they are filed unless a delaying amendment is filed with the OCC. However, consistent with SEC practice,
the OCC expects all filers to file delaying amendments with their registration statements to prevent the registration
statements from becoming automatically effective. The delaying amendments will ensure that the OCC has adequate
time to review and comment upon filings.




Filing Requirements and Inspection of Documents (Section 16.17)



This section of the proposal specified that issuers must file four copies of all documents with the OCC and required
the OCC to make those documents available for public inspection. The former part 16 required issuers to submit six
copies of most documents. The proposal also specified that all notices or other documents required to be filed by any
section of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, or a rule of the SEC cross-referenced in part 16, be filed with the OCC.
The final rule adopts this section generally as proposed, with a few technical clarifying changes.




Use of Prospectus (Section 16.18)



Under the proposal, a prospectus or amendment declared effective by the OCC may not be used more than nine months after
its effective date unless the information contained therein is as of a date not more than 16 months prior to the date
of use. This section of the proposal was based on the requirement in section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C.
77j(a)(3)) pertaining to the age of information in a prospectus. The proposal provided more time for an offering to
be completed than did former part 16. Former part 16 allowed an offering circular to be effective for a period of only
six months, although the OCC could extend the six month period for two consecutive 90 day periods upon request. In the
event there was a material change after a prospectus has been declared effective, the proposal prohibited use of the
prospectus until an amendment reflecting the change had been filed with and declared effective by the OCC.

The final rule adopts this section generally as proposed, with minor clarifying changes.



Withdrawal or Abandonment (Section 16.19)



The proposed rule allowed filers to withdraw a registration statement and amendments prior to the effective date.
It also stated that the OCC could determine that a registration statement and amendments had been abandoned if they
had been on file for nine months and not become effective. Documents withdrawn or declared abandoned would be so marked
but would remain in the OCC files. The final rule adopts this section as proposed, with minor clarifying changes.

Current and Periodic Reports (Section 16.20) 



The proposal required banks that had filed registration statements declared effective pursuant to part 16 to file
with the OCC periodic and current reports until the banks were eligible to suspend the filing of those reports. This
requirement was based on that imposed by section 15(d) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78o(d)) on corporations filing
Securities Act registration statements with the SEC. The filing of periodic and current reports ensures that current
information about an issuer is available for a period after an offering of securities is made. The periodic and current
reporting requirements cease the year after the registration statement becomes effective, if the issuer is not otherwise
required to register its securities under the Exchange Act. 

The proposal further provided that a bank need not comply with the periodic and current reports requirements if the
bank was a subsidiary of a one-bank holding company and the bank's parent bank holding company filed current and periodic
reports pursuant to section 13 of the Exchange Act. 


Five commenters stated that all banks that are subsidiaries of holding companies that have securities registered
under the Exchange Act should be able to rely on holding company Exchange Act filings and bank Call Reports to fulfill
the current and periodic report requirements. 

The final rule permits banks that are subsidiaries of holding companies that have securities registered under the
Exchange Act to rely on holding company Exchange Act filings and bank Call Reports to fulfill the current and periodic
reports requirements in specified circumstances. A bank need not file current and periodic reports if the bank is
a subsidiary of a one-bank holding company, the financial statements of the bank and the parent bank holding company
are substantially the same, and the bank's parent bank holding company files periodic and current reports pursuant
to section 13 of the Exchange Act. 


The OCC believes that when these conditions are met, the holding company's current and periodic reports will provide
the marketplace with information equivalent to what would be provided if the holding company's subsidiary bank made
separate reports. The OCC concluded that any broader exception would not be appropriate because the information
provided is used in markets including both sophisticated and unsophisticated investors. In the case of the latter,
they may not have sufficient financial expertise to evaluate information that differs substantially from the type
and scope of disclosure that would have been contained in current and periodic reports filed by the bank itself.

Request for Interpretive Advice or No Objection Letter (Section 16.30) 




The proposal set forth the requirements that a person must meet to obtain interpretive advice or a no-objection letter
under part 16. Although these requirements are not detailed in former part 16, the OCC based them on Banking Circular
205, OCC Staff No-Objection Positions, which has been in effect since July 26, 1985. The final rule adopts this section
as proposed, with minor clarifying changes. 



Escrow Requirement (Section 16.31) 



The proposal required the use of an independent escrow account if the funds received in an offering were to be certified
as capital or if there was a minimum amount to be sold in an offering. One commenter opposed this requirement. 

The final rule modifies the escrow requirements. Section 16.31 of the final rule allows the OCC to require any funds
received through an offer or sale of securities to be held in an independent escrow account at an unrelated insured
depository institution when the OCC determines it is in the best interest of the shareholders. A bank does not have
to use an independent escrow account unless the OCC has notified the bank that an escrow account is necessary. However,
the OCC generally expects banks to use independent escrow accounts. 



Fraudulent Transactions and Unsafe and Unsound Practices (Section 16.32) 



The proposal prohibited untrue statements of material fact, omissions of material fact, and acts or practices that
operate as a fraud in the offer or sale of a bank security. The language in this section of the proposal was substantially
similar to the language in section 17(a) of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77q). The section 17(a) prohibitions apply
to offers and sales of bank securities regardless of whether the prohibitions are restated in part 16. The OCC believed
that restating the prohibitions in part 16 furnished warning that the prohibitions apply. The proposal further provided
that violations of the fraudulent transactions section also constitute unsafe or unsound practices under 12 U.S.C.
1818. This section of the final rule is adopted as proposed.

Conforming Amendments to Part 5 



Merger, Consolidation, Purchase and Assumption (Section 5.33(b)(6)) 



The proposal included a conforming amendment to 12 CFR 5.33(b)(6)(ii) which requires that all shareholders in a merger
or consolidation transaction be adequately informed of all aspects of the transaction. The proposal amended  5.33(b)(6)(ii)
to add that a bank required to file a registration statement with the OCC may use that registration statement to comply
with the proxy statement requirements set forth in  5.33(b)(6)(ii). In addition, a bank subsidiary of a holding
company required to file a registration statement with the SEC may use that registration statement to comply with
OCC proxy statement requirements. The final rule adopts the conforming amendment to  5.33(b)(6)(ii) as proposed,
with minor technical clarifying changes. 



Changes in Equity Capital (Section 5.46) and Subordinated Debt as Capital (Section 5.47) 



The proposal did not include any changes to 12 CFR 5.46 and 5.47. Former  5.46 required OCC preliminary approval
for a change in capital due to a sale of preferred stock. Former  5.46 further specified that changes in equity
capital must occur within 12 months of seeking preliminary approval. Former  5.47 required OCC approval for
subordinated debt that is to be considered part of a bank's capital structure; a bank must receive preliminary approval
prior to the issuance of subordinated debt and the subordinated debt must be issued within 12 months of the preliminary
approval. 

The OCC requested comment on whether   5.46 and 5.47 needed to be modified in order to enable banks to use
the SEC rule on shelf registration in Rule 415 (17 CFR 230.415_Delayed or continuous offering and sale of securities).
Shelf registration permits banks to register securities that are to be sold in the future and then to sell those securities
when the market conditions are most favorable. 

The OCC received four comments on this issue. All of the commenters stated that because of the delays caused by the preliminary
approval requirements in   5.46 and 5.47, the OCC needed to amend those requirements in order for banks
to take advantage of SEC Rule 415. The OCC agrees and has adopted a final rule that includes changes to   5.46
and 5.47. The changes will enable most banks to use the SEC's rule on shelf registration and thereby reduce unnecessary
regulatory burden. 

As adopted in the final rule,  5.46 no longer requires a bank to obtain preliminary approval of cash sales of preferred
stock unless the OCC has notified the bank that preliminary approval is necessary. After selling preferred stock,
a bank still must obtain final approval and certification. 

The final rule also changes the approval procedures in  5.47 for the issuance of subordinated debt. Under the
new procedures, a bank need not obtain prior approval to issue subordinated debt unless the OCC has notified the bank
that prior approval is necessary. A bank that has not been notified that it must obtain prior approval to issue subordinated
debt must notify the OCC after issuing debt that is to be counted as tier 2 capital. Subordinated debt will qualify as
tier 2 capital if it meets the requirements set forth in 12 CFR part 3, Appendix A section 2(b)(4) and complies with the
OCC Guidelines for Subordinated Debt Instruments in the Comptroller's Manual for Corporate Activities. 

The OCC may solicit comments on  5.46 and  5.47 in connection with its proposed comprehensive revisions
to Part 5 of the OCC's regulations.

Regulatory Flexibility Act 



Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Comptroller of the Currency certifies that this
final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 



Executive Order 12866 



The OCC has determined that this document is not a significant regulatory action as defined in Executive Order 12866.

The collections of information contained in this final regulation have been reviewed and approved by the Office of
Management and Budget in accordance with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)) under
control number 1557-0120. The estimated annual burden per respondent varies from two to 100 hours, depending
on individual circumstances, with an estimated average of 19 hours.

Comments concerning the accuracy of this burden estimate and suggestions for reducing this burden should be directed
to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Legislative, Regulatory, and International Activities Division,
250 E Street, SW, Washington, DC 20219 and to the Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project (1557-0120),

Preferred stock.

 A bank need not submit a letter of intent and obtain preliminary approval prior to selling preferred stock for cash
unless the Office has notified the bank that preliminary approval is necessary. Any bank selling preferred stock
must submit a letter of notification pursuant to paragraph (g)(2) of this section to obtain final approval and certification.
The Office must review and may approve provisions in articles of association concerning preferred stock dividends,
voting and conversion rights, retirement, and rights to exercise control over management. A bank may submit those
provisions for review and approval with the letter of notification.


* * * * *


(g) 

Procedures.

 (1) A bank must submit to the appropriate District office by hand or by mail, return receipt requested, a letter of intent
to change capital. The bank must receive preliminary approval for any change in capital except for a stock dividend,
a cash sale of common stock, a cash sale of preferred stock where the bank has not been notified by the Office that preliminary
approval is required, or a reduction in par value of common stock that does not change the sum of capital and capital
surplus. Stock dividends, cash sales of common stock, cash sales of preferred stock where the bank has not been notified
by the Office that preliminary approval is required, or reductions in par value of common stock that do not change the
sum of capital and capital surplus are subject only to the notification process described in paragraphs (g)(2) and
(g)(3) of this section. For other changes in equity capital, the bank must submit a letter of intent describing the
type and amount of the proposed change, and state if the bank is subject to a capital plan with the Office. If the bank
is subject to a capital plan or if a capital plan is required in connection with the proposed change in equity capital,
the bank must state how the proposed change conforms to the plan. The bank may consider its proposed change preliminarily
approved 30 days after the day on which the Office receives the letter of intent, unless the bank is notified that preliminary
approval is delayed, conditioned, or denied. The bank should submit the letter of intent and receive preliminary
approval prior to seeking shareholder approval. The bank may proceed with an increase in capital after preliminary
approval is received; however, it may not reduce its capital or make a distribution until it has received final Office
approval as specified in paragraphs (g)(2) and (g)(3) of this section.

Licensing requirements.

 Unless the OCC has previously notified a national bank that prior approval is required, or unless prior approval is

must notify the OCC after issuing subordinated debt that is to be counted as Tier 2 capital.
(c)

 This section sets forth the procedures for OCC review and approval of applications to issue or prepay subordinated
debt.

this chapter and a capital restoration plan filed with the OCC under 12 U.S.C. 1831o and  6.5 of this chapter.
(2) 

Tier 2 capital

 has the same meaning as set forth in  3.2(d) of this chapter.
(e) 

Qualification as regulatory capital.

 (1) A national bank's subordinated debt qualifies as Tier 2 capital if the subordinated debt meets the requirements

Debt Instruments'' in the Comptroller's Manual for Corporate Activities (Manual).
(2) If the OCC notifies a national bank that it must obtain OCC approval before issuing subordinated debt, the subordinated
debt will not qualify as Tier 2 capital until the bank obtains OCC approval for its inclusion in capital.
(f) 

Prior approval procedure.

 (1) 

Application.

 A national bank required to obtain OCC approval before issuing or prepaying subordinated debt must submit an application
to the appropriate district office. The application must include:

Debt Instruments'' in the Manual.
(2) 

Approval.

 (i) 

General.

 The OCC approves, conditionally approves, or denies an application to issue or prepay subordinated debt on or before
the 30th day after the complete application is received by the OCC. The application is deemed approved by the OCC as
of the 30th day after the filing is received by the OCC unless the OCC notifies the bank prior to that date that the filing
presents significant supervisory or compliance concerns, or raises significant legal or policy issues.
(ii) 

Notification.

 When the OCC notifies the bank that the OCC approves the bank's application to issue or prepay the subordinated debt,
it also notifies the bank whether the debt qualifies as Tier 2 capital.
(iii) 

Expiration of approval.

 Approval expires if a national bank does not complete the sale of the subordinated debt within one year of approval.
(g) 

Notice procedure.

 If a national bank is not required to obtain approval before issuing subordinated debt, the bank must notify the appropriate

The notice must include:
(1) The terms of the issuance;
(2) The amount and date of receipt of funds;
(3) A copy of the final subordinated note format and note agreement; and
(4) A statement that the issue complies with all laws, regulations, and the ``OCC Guidelines for Subordinated Debt
Instruments'' in the Manual.

(i) 

Issuance of subordinated debt.

 A national bank must comply with the Securities Offering Disclosure Rules in part 16 of this chapter when issuing subordinated
debt even if the bank is not required to obtain prior approval to issue subordinated debt.

the OCC pursuant to Regulation A. 


 16.15 

Form and content. 


(a) Any registration statement filed pursuant to this part must be on the form for registration (17 CFR part 239) that
the bank would be eligible to use were it required to register the securities under the Securities Act and must meet
the requirements of the Commission regulations referred to in the applicable form for registration. A filer should
consult the Commission's Securities Act Industry Guide 3_Statistical Disclosure by Bank Holding Companies (17

Applications Under Regulation Y 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim rule with request for comments.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 These rules are intended to implement the simplified notice 
procedures recently established under section 346 of the Riegle Community 
Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 for bank holding 
companies proposing to engage 

de novo

 or through an acquisition in 
nonbanking activities. Because Section 346 implements this procedure 
immediately, the Board has proposed the following as an interim rule that will 
take effect immediately and will apply to all notices filed subsequent to 
enactment of Section 346. The Board also is seeking comments on the interim 
rule, and will amend the rule as needed to address the comments received. The 
Board is currently developing additional initiatives to reduce the regulatory 
burden associated with its application and notice procedures, and the Board 
invites comment on any suggestions in furtherance of these initiatives.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 4 of the Bank Holding 
Company Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C. 1843) (BHC Act) prohibits bank holding 
companies from acquiring or retaining shares of any company that is not a bank 
or engaging in any activity other than managing and controlling banks, except 
under certain circumstances. The primary exception permits bank holding 
companies to conduct activities and acquire companies engaged solely in 
activities the Board has determined to be closely related to banking and a 
proper incident thereto. See 12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8). 


Section 346 of the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory 
Improvement Act of 1994 (Pub. L. No. 103-325, section 346, 108 Stat. 2160, 2239 (1994)(``Section 346'')) amends
section 4 of the BHC Act to establish a new notice procedure for obtaining Board approval under sections 4(a)(2) and
4(c)(8) of the BHC Act.
 Under Section 346, a proposal requiring Board approval under section 4(a)(2) or 4(c)(8) may be consummated 60 days
after providing the Board with a complete written notice of the proposal, unless the notice period is extended as provided
in the statute. Section 346 also permits proposals to be consummated at anytime during this notice period if approved
by the Board during this period. 





The proposed interim rule would replace the current application 
procedure of section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act with the new notice procedure.
 The rule would streamline the current procedure for obtaining Board approval for nonbanking proposals in several
respects. In particular, the proposed revisions would:



 Establish a simplified notice procedure for action on proposals to 
engage 

de novo

 or through an acquisition in a listed activity (i.e., an 
activity on the Regulation Y list of permissible nonbanking activities
) 
within 30 days of receipt of the notice by the Reserve Bank; 




 Establish a notice procedure for action on proposals to engage 

de novo

 or through an acquisition in an un-listed activity or a new 
activity within 60 days of filing of a complete notice;

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941102-0-00030 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941102-0-00005 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 Eliminate the current 28 day pre-acceptance period for notices 
involving nonbanking proposals; 
 Reduce from 30 days to 15 days the public comment period for 
proposals involving listed activities; and 
 Specify in the regulation the core information that bank holding 
companies must provide for a nonbanking proposal.



These revisions to the current application procedures should result in an 
overall reduction in the total period of time involved in reviewing nonbanking 
proposals, and in a reduction in the paperwork burden associated with proposals 
to engage in nonbanking activities. Comment is invited on all aspects of this 
proposal. 


Notice Procedure Under Interim Rule 


To implement these statutory changes, the Board proposes to amend 
Regulation Y to replace the application procedures for obtaining approval to 
engage in nonbanking activities with a notice procedure. The interim rule 
contemplates action by the Reserve Bank on nonbanking proposals involving 
listed activities within 30 days after a notice containing all of the information 
required in the rule has been received by the Reserve Bank, in cases that 
qualify for Reserve Bank action, and within 60 days of that date in cases 
involving any previously approved activity that are subject to Board action. 
While the rule also indicates that the Board will seek to act on notices involving 
new activities within 60 days of receipt of the notice by the Reserve Bank, 
proposals that involve activities that have not been previously approved by the 
Board often require substantial information and may continue to require a 
greater processing period. 
The interim rule specifies the different types of information required for 
proposals to engage 

de novo 

in listed activities, proposals to acquire a company 
engaged in listed activities, and proposals to engage in activities not previously 
approved by regulation (``unlisted activities''). 


Listed Activities 


The proposed rule contemplates that proposals to engage 

de novo 

or to 
acquire a company engaged in a listed activity will be approved within 30 days 
of the original date of filing of the notice, even if additional information is 
subsequently requested by the Reserve Bank or the Board. Upon receipt of a 
notice to engage in or to acquire a company engaged in a listed activity (or an 
activity previously approved by order), the Reserve Bank shall immediately 
notify the Board, and the Board will publish notice of the proposal in the 


Federal Register

 inviting public comment for a period of 15 days. Within 30 
calendar days after receipt by the Reserve Bank of a notice filed under the 
interim rule, the Reserve Bank must approve the notice, extend the notice 
period for 15 calendar days, or refer the notice to the Board for decision 
because a substantive comment on the proposal has been received or action on 
the notice by the Reserve Bank is not appropriate. The Reserve Bank also 
may, within 15 calendar days of receipt of the notice, return the notice if it is 
informationally incomplete. Under the interim rule, the return of a notice by a 
Reserve Bank under such circumstances is deemed action on the notice. 




Unlisted Activities 


As is the practice under the current rules, proposals to engage in 
activities not previously approved by the Board by regulation or order will be 
published by the Board in the 

Federal Register

 within 10 business days of 
acceptance by the Reserve Bank, unless the Board determines to extend this 10-
day period for an additional 30 days. Public notice of proposals to engage in 
such new activities shall invite comment for a period of generally 30 days, or if 
the Board determines that the notificant has not adequately demonstrated that 
the proposed activity is so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident 
thereto, the Board may return the notice and explain the reasons for its 
determination. 
The interim rule provides that the Board will attempt to act on all cases 
referred for Board action within 60 days of the date the notice is received by 
the Reserve Bank. As noted above, proposals that involve new activities that 
have not been previously approved by the Board are likely to require a greater 
processing period. In the event the Board does not act on the notice within 60 
days of receipt by the Reserve Bank, the Board will notify the bank holding 
company, and explain the reasons for needing additional time as well as provide 
an anticipated date by which the Board expects to act on the notice. 


Elimination of Pre-Acceptance Review Period 


As noted above, the interim rule eliminates the pre-acceptance review 
procedure currently contained in Regulation Y for proposals to engage in 
nonbanking activities. This procedure established a defined period of up to 28 
days during which an applicant and the Reserve Bank could identify and 
address significant issues prior to the filing of a final application. This 
procedure has been particularly beneficial to the processing of complex 
proposals and applications to engage in activities not previously approved by the 
Board by regulation or order, where information requests often must be tailored 
to the specific proposal. 
While the elimination of pre-acceptance procedures should shorten the 
review process, the Board recognizes the utility of a pre-acceptance procedure 
and anticipates that there will be certain proposals that could benefit from some 
form of pre-acceptance review. The Board invites comments as to whether 
some form of pre-notice review procedure should be reinstated in the final 
regulations. 


Public Notice 


Regulation Y currently provides that (with the exception of proposals 
processed under the abbreviated procedure for small acquisitions) all proposals 
to engage in previously approved nonbanking activities must be published in the 


Federal Register

 and provide for a public comment period of not more than 
30 days. Under the interim rule, the public comment period has been shortened 
from 30 days to 15 days for proposals to engage in activities previously 
approved by the Board by regulation or order. The interim rule also provides 
that the Reserve Bank may not act on a notice before the fifth business day 
following the close of the public comment period unless an emergency exists 
requiring expedited or immediate action. 
Section 346 authorizes the Board to prescribe shorter notice periods by 
regulation for particular activities or transactions. The Board invites comment 
on whether further shortening of the comment period is appropriate, particularly 
for notices to engage in activities previously approved by the Board. In 
particular, the Board requests comment on a proposal to reduce the public 
comment period to 5 calendar days for proposals that involve listed activities 
and/or activities that have been previously approved by Board order. This 
would enable the Reserve Banks to act on proposals that raise no substantive 
issues well within the 30-day target.

Statutory Period


The interim rule incorporates the provisions of Section 346 that establish the permissible length of the notice period.
Under the interim rule, a notice is deemed approved by operation of law 60 days after receipt of a complete notice, unless
extended as provided in Section 346. As provided in the statute, the interim rule provides that a notice is deemed complete
when it contains all information required in the interim rule and all other information requested by the Board or the
Reserve Bank in connection with the notice. The Board may extend the notice period for an additional 30 days upon notice
to the bank holding company. If the proposal involves an unlisted activity, the Board may extend the notice period
for a 90-day period in addition to the 30-day extension, provided the Board notifies the bank holding company and explains
the reasons for this additional extension. Further extensions are only permissible in the event the Board determines
to conduct a hearing on the proposal, or the notificant has consented to an extension or tolling of the notice period.
The interim rule adopts the provision in Section 346 that permits the Board to request additional information about
a proposal at any time during the notice period. The rule also includes the provision of Section 346 that provides that
the Board may deny any notice if the notificant neglects, fails, or refuses to furnish the Board all the information
required by the Board.


Abbreviated Notice Procedure for Small Acquisitions


The interim rule retains the current abbreviated notice procedure contained in Regulation Y for small acquisitions
of assets or shares of companies engaged in activities previously approved by the Board by regulation.
 Currently, this abbreviated notice procedure may be used for acquisitions where neither the book value of the assets
to be acquired nor the gross consideration to be paid for the securities or assets exceeds the greater of (i) $15 million
or (ii) 5 percent of the consolidated assets of the acquiring company up to a maximum of $100 million. The interim rule
retains this abbreviated notice procedure for small acquisitions of companies engaged in laundry list activities,
and increases the size limitation for acquisitions that qualify for this procedure from a maximum of $100 million
to a maximum of $300 million.




The primary benefit of the abbreviated notice procedure for small acquisitions is the shortened approval process
realized by opting to publish public notice of the proposal in local newspapers in the communities affected by the
proposal. Since this provision of Regulation Y was adopted, notificants have increasingly opted to publish notice
of the proposed acquisition in the 

Federal Register

 in order to conduct the nonbanking activity nationwide or throughout a geographic area so large that public notice
of the proposal by means of local newspaper publication is unduly expensive or impracticable. Moreover, the streamlined
notice procedure established by the interim rule would effectively shorten the notice period for all acquisitions
involving listed activities.

In light of this, the Board invites comment as to whether the abbreviated notice procedure for small acquisitions
should be retained, eliminated, or amended.


Simplified Notice Procedures


The Board believes that these proposals will substantially reduce the burden associated with the approval requirement
under section 4 of the BHC Act without resulting in unsafe and unsound banking practices. Because the provisions of
Section 346 are implemented immediately, the Board is proposing to adopt the following regulation as an interim rule
in connection with nonbanking activities conducted pursuant to section 4 of the BHC Act. The Board invites comments
on all aspects of this interim rule, and will amend this rule as needed to reflect the comments received. The Board also
invites suggestions on other means of reducing the regulatory burden associated with the System's application and
notices procedures.


Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis


Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

), the Board does not believe that these changes will have a significant adverse economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities. This interim rule will reduce the regulatory burden on bank holding companies imposed by the Board's
procedures, and the Board is inviting public comment on additional ways to reduce regulatory burden.


Paperwork Reduction Act Analysis


No collections of information pursuant to section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

) are contained in these changes, and comment is invited on a proposal that would reduce the current information collection
requirements imposed in connection with certain applications.

(g) 

Notice to expand or alter nonbanking activities_

(1) 

De novo 
expansion. 

A notice under paragraph (a)(1) of this section is required to 
open a new office or to form a subsidiary to engage in, or to relocate an 
existing office engaged in, a nonbanking activity that the Board has 
previously approved for the bank holding company under this regulation, 
only if: 
(i) The Board's prior approval was limited geographically; 
(ii) The activity is to be conducted in a country outside of 
the United States and the bank holding company has not previously 
received prior Board approval under this regulation to engage in the 
activity in that country; or 
(iii) The Board or appropriate Reserve Bank has notified the 
company that a notice under paragraph (a)(1) of this section is 
required. 
(2) 

Activities outside United States. 

With respect to activities to be 
engaged in outside the United States that require approval under this 
subpart, the procedures of this section apply only to activities to be 
engaged in directly by a bank holding company that is not a qualifying 
foreign banking organization or by a nonbank subsidiary of a bank holding 
company approved under this subpart. Regulation K (12 CFR part 211) 
governs other international operations of bank holding companies. 
(3) 

Alteration of nonbanking activity. 

A notice under 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section is required to alter a nonbanking activity in 
any material respect from that considered by the Board in acting on the 
application or notice to engage in the activity. 
(h) 

Emergency thrift institution acquisitions. 

In the case of a notice to 
acquire a thrift institution, the Board may modify or dispense with the public 
notice and hearing requirements of this section if the Board finds that an 
emergency exists that requires the Board to act immediately and the primary 
Federal regulator of the institution concurs. 


 225.24 

Factors considered in acting on nonbanking proposals. 


(a) 

In general. 

In evaluating a notice under  225.23, the Board shall 
consider whether the performance by the notificant of the activities can 
reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public (such as greater 
convenience, increased competition, and gains in efficiency) that outweigh 
possible adverse effects (such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or 
unfair competition, conflicts of interest, and unsound banking practices). 
(b) 

Financial and managerial resources. 

Consideration of the factors in 
paragraph (a) of this section includes an evaluation of the financial and 
managerial resources of the notificant, including its subsidiaries, and any 
company to be acquired, and the effect of the proposed transaction on those 
resources. 
(c) 

Competitive effect of de novo proposals. 

Unless the record 
demonstrates otherwise, the commencement or expansion of a nonbanking 
activity 

de novo 

is presumed to result in benefits to the public through increased 
competition. 
(d) 

Denial for lack of information. 

The Board may deny any notice 
submitted under this subpart if the notificant neglects, fails, or refuses to furnish 
all information required by the Board. 



By order of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 
effective October 26, 1994.

Applications Under Regulation Y 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim rule with request for comments. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 These rules implement the streamlined notice procedure recently enacted in Section 319 of the Riegle Community Development
and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 (``Riegle Act'') for the formation of a new bank holding company that results
from a corporate reorganization of a bank by the current shareholders of the bank. These rules also implement section
321 of the Riegle Act, which amends the Bank Holding Company Act and the Bank Merger Act to authorize the Board to shorten
the post-approval waiting period for bank acquisitions and mergers (during which time the United States Attorney
General may review the competitive effects of a proposal approved by the Board) from 30 to 15 days with the consent of
the United States Attorney General. Because the procedures prescribed by section 319 and section 321 are effective
immediately, the Board has proposed the following as an interim rule that will take effect immediately. The Board
is seeking comments on this interim rule, and will amend the rule as needed to address the comments received. The Board
also is currently developing additional initiatives to reduce the regulatory burden associated with its application
and notice procedures, and invites comment on any suggestions in furtherance of these initiatives. 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 3(a) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C. 1842(a)) (``BHC Act'') requires Federal Reserve Board
approval prior to consummating certain transactions resulting in the formation of a bank holding company, or in the
acquisition by a bank holding company of shares or control of a bank, subject to certain exceptions. Section 319 of
the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 (Pub. L. No. 103-325, section 319,
108 Stat. 2160, 2224 (1994)(``Section 319'')) amends section 3 of the BHC Act to establish a notice procedure for the
formation of a new bank holding company resulting from a corporate reorganization that involves substantially the
same shareholders.
 In connection with section 319, section 320 of the Riegle Act provides an exemption from the registration requirements
of the Securities Act of 1933 for securities issued by a bank holding company pursuant to such a reorganization. 




In addition, section 321 of the Riegle Act (Pub. L. No. 103-325, section 321, 108 Stat. 2160, 2226 (1994)(``Section
321'') permits the Board, with the consent of the U.S. Attorney General, to shorten the post-approval waiting period
for bank acquisitions and mergers from 30 days to 15 days. The interim rule implement the provisions enacted in sections
319 and 321 of the Riegle Act. Comment is invited on all aspects of these proposals. 



Formation of a New Bank Holding Company Under Section 319 


By its terms, the notice procedure added by section 319
 applies only if certain conditions are met. Specifically, the formation of a new bank holding company may be consummated
30 days after providing written notice to the appropriate Federal Reserve Bank if: (1) The shareholders of the bank
will acquire, as a result of the reorganization, the shares of the newly formed bank holding company in substantially
the same proportional interest as they held in the bank; (2) the bank holding company would meet, and its resulting
subsidiary bank would meet, certain financial and capital standards; (3) the bank holding company would not, as a
result of the reorganization, acquire other banking or nonbanking interests; and (4) during the 30-day notice period,
the Reserve Bank or the Board does not object to the proposal.

Substantially the Same Shareholders 



Under the interim rule, the requirement that shareholders of the bank acquire ``substantially the same share interest''
in the newly formed bank holding company would be met by proposals in which the shareholder or shareholders who lawfully
control at least 80 percent of the shares of the bank at the time the notice is filed would acquire, immediately after
the reorganization, at least 80 percent of the shares of the holding company in substantially the same proportion.


By the terms of Section 319, allowance is made for changes in shareholders' interests resulting from the exercise
of dissenting shareholders' rights under State or Federal law. Accordingly, under the interim rule, a shareholder
of the bank will be considered to have substantially the same proportional interest in the holding company (notwithstanding
a change in the percentage of shares controlled by the shareholder) if the shareholder interest increases, on a 

pro rata

 basis, as a result of either the redemption by the bank or bank holding company of shares from dissenting shareholders,
or as a result of the acquisition of shares of dissenting shareholders by the remaining shareholders. 

However, this notice procedure would not be available in cases in which any shareholder or group of shareholders acting
in concert would, following the reorganization, own or control 10 percent or more of any class of voting shares of the
bank holding company unless that shareholder or group of shareholders was authorized, after review under the Change
in Bank Control Act of 1978 (12 U.S.C. 1817(j)) by the appropriate Federal banking agency for the bank, to own or control
10 percent or more of any class of voting shares of the bank. Similarly, this procedure is not available in cases in which
the exercise of dissenting shareholders' rights would cause a company that is not a bank holding company (other than
the company in formation) to be required to register as a bank holding company. This procedure also is not available
for the formation of a bank holding company organized in mutual form. 

The Board seeks comment on other alternative formulations consistent with the statutory mandate that the reorganization
involve substantially the same shareholders. 



Financial Standards 



Section 319 also establishes certain financial thresholds that must be satisfied to qualify for the abbreviated
notice procedure. In particular, the bank to be reorganized must, at the time the notice is filed, be ``adequately
capitalized,'' as this term is defined in section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. See 12 U.S.C. 1831o. In addition,
Section 319 requires that the bank holding company resulting from the reorganization meet any ``capital and other
financial standards'' established by the Board. 

In the interim rule, the Board has established three requirements designed to identify reorganization proposals
that do not raise financial or supervisory concerns that would benefit from review and explanation through an application
process rather than an abbreviated notice procedure. Under the interim rule, a proposal to form a new one-bank holding
company would qualify for the abbreviated notice procedures established in Section 319 if: (1) The bank has received
at least a composite ``satisfactory'' rating at its most recent examination, in the event that the bank has been subject
to examination; (2) the amount of debt that the bank holding company would assume at the time of the reorganization,
and the proposed means of retiring this debt, would not place undue burden on the holding company or its subsidiary
on a 

pro forma

 basis;
 and (3) at the time of the reorganization, neither the bank nor any of its officers, directors or shareholders is involved
in any unresolved supervisory or enforcement matters with any appropriate Federal banking agency. 





Section 319 provides that this abbreviated notice procedure is only available to a bank holding company that would
not acquire any additional banks or any nonbanking interests as part of the reorganization.

Contents of Notice 



To begin the notice period under the interim rule, the notificant organization must submit to the appropriate Reserve
Bank a written notice that includes: (1) Certification that the requirements of Section 319 and the Board's implementing
rule are met by the proposal; (2) a list of the shareholders of the bank prior to the reorganization and of the holding
company following the reorganization, identifying the percentage of shares held by each shareholder in the bank
and proposed to be held in the new holding company; (3) a description of the resulting management of the proposed bank
holding company and its subsidiary bank, including (i) biographical information regarding any officers, directors
or shareholders of the resulting bank holding company who were 

not

 senior officers or directors of the bank prior to the reorganization, and (ii) a detailed history of the involvement
of any officer, director or shareholder of the resulting bank holding company in any administrative or criminal proceeding;
(4) 

pro forma

 financial statements for the bank holding company, and a description of the amount, source and terms of debt, if any,
that the bank holding company proposes to incur, and information regarding the sources and timing for debt service
and retirement; and (5) verification that notice of the proposal has been published in a newspaper of general circulation
in the community in which the bank is located that provides an opportunity for interested persons to comment on the
notice for a period of at least 15 calendar days. 

As indicated above, the interim rule requires that the applicant publish notice of the proposed reorganization and
invite public comment for a period of at least 15 days. This request for public comment is consistent with the Board's
practice of publishing notice of all bank holding company formations and bank expansion proposals so that the public
may comment in particular on the bank's record of serving the convenience and needs of the community under the Community
Reinvestment Act. 



Objections to Notices 



Within 7 calendar days of receipt of a notice containing all the information required under this interim regulation,
the appropriate Reserve Bank will provide a written acknowledgement of receipt of the notice indicating that the
transaction may be consummated following the 30th calendar day after the date the notice was received by the Reserve
Bank unless the Reserve Bank or the Board objects to the proposal during that time. The Reserve Bank may provide written
notice of approval of the reorganization at an earlier time during the notice period. 

If during the notice period the Board or the Reserve Bank objects to the proposal, the bank holding company must file
an application under section 3 of the BHC Act.
 In this case, the notificant will immediately be notified of the reason for the objection, and of any additional information
that may be needed to complete an application. 





Shortening of Post-Approval Waiting Period Under Section 321 



Currently, section 11(b)(1) of the BHC Act (12 U.S.C. 1849(b)(1)) prohibits a bank holding company that has received
approval for a transaction under section 3 of the BHC Act (other than transactions involving a probable bank failure
or an emergency) from consummating the transaction prior to the thirtieth day following Board approval of the proposal
in order to provide the United States Attorney General time to review the transaction for any adverse effects on competition
in banking or the concentration of banking resources. The Bank Merger Act contains a similar provision applying post-approval
waiting period to bank merger proposals. See 12 U.S.C. 1828(c)(6). 

Because Section 319 creates an exception from the application and approval process established by section 3 of the
BHC Act, a notificant who has met the criteria of Section 319 and the interim rule does not appear to be subject to the
post-approval waiting period established under section 11 of the BHC Act. 

With regard to other acquisitions under section 3 of the BHC Act or under the Bank Merger Act, section 321 of the Riegle
Act (``Section 321'') authorizes the Board to shorten the post-approval waiting period in any case to a period of not
less than 15 days, provided the Board has received no adverse comment from the Attorney General relating to competitive
factors and the Attorney General concurs with the Board's decision to shorten the waiting period. Section 321 does
not affect processing of applications involving probable bank failures or emergencies. The interim rule incorporates
these revisions to the Board's Regulation Y. The Board is currently discussing with the U.S. Department of Justice
the types of cases that may qualify for this shortened post-approval waiting period, and invites public comment on
the types of cases where this would be appropriate. 

As described above, the Board has adopted the following interim rule which shall be effective immediately, and invites
public comment on all aspects of this interim rule. The Board also invites suggestions on other means of reducing the
regulatory burden associated with its application and notices procedures. 



Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis 



Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq

.), the Board does not believe that these changes will have a significant adverse economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. This interim rule will reduce the regulatory burden imposed by the Board's procedures on
small bank holding companies in formation, and the Board is inviting public comment on additional ways to reduce regulatory
burden.

Paperwork Reduction Act Analysis 



No collections of information pursuant to section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501

) are contained in these changes, and comment is invited on a proposal that would reduce the current information collection
requirements imposed in connection with certain applications.

<USDEPT>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</USDEPT>






Deceptive Advertising as to Sizes of Viewable Pictures Shown by Television Receiving Sets



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Trade Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of final, non-substantive amendments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Trade Commission (``Commission'') is issuing final, non-substantive amendments to its Rule on Deceptive
Advertising as to Sizes of Viewable Pictures Shown by Television Receiving Sets, known as the Picture Tube Rule. The
Commission solicited comments on the Rule as part of the agency's periodic review of rules and guides. Having considered
all of the issues raised during the comment period, the Commission is amending the Rule. These amendments add the metric
equivalents for measurements stated in inches in the examples used in the Rule, and clarify some of the illustrations.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Introduction



The Commission has determined, as part of its oversight responsibilities, to review rules and guides periodically.
These reviews seek information about the costs and benefits of the Commission's rules and guides and their regulatory
and economic impact. The information obtained assists the Commission in identifying rules and guides that warrant
modification or recision. On April 19, 1993, the Commission published in the 

Federal Register

 a request for public comments on its Trade Regulation Rule on Deceptive Advertising as to Sizes of Viewable Pictures
Shown by Television Receiving Sets, 16 CFR part 410 (``The Picture Tube Rule'' or ``The Rule'').

This Rule, like the other trade regulation rules issued by the Commission, ``define[s] with specificity acts or practices
which are unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce. Such rules may include requirements prescribed
for the purpose of preventing such acts or practices. A violation of a rule shall constitute an unfair or deceptive
act or practice in violation of section 5(a)(1) of (the Federal Trade Commission Act), unless the Commission otherwise
expressly provides in its rule.'' 16 CFR 1.8. The Commission may initiate a trade regulation rule proceeding ``upon
its own initiative or pursuant to written petition filed with the Secretary by any interested person stating reasonable
grounds therefor,'' 16 CFR 1.9.



II. The Regulation



The Picture Tube Rule sets forth the appropriate means for disclosing the method by which the dimensions of television
screens are measured, when the measurement is included in any advertisement or promotional material for the television
set. Under the Rule, the method used to measure the size of a television screen must be clearly and conspicuously disclosed
in close proximity to the size designation. However, the Rule provides a safe harbor for measurements based on the
horizontal dimensions, which may be given without disclosing that the dimensions were measured horizontally. The
Rule notes that the measurement must not take into account any curvature of the tube. Further, disclosing the method
of measurement in a footnote rather than in the body of the ad does not constitute a disclosure in close proximity to
the size designation.

The Rule includes examples of both proper and improper representations of size descriptions. Previously, these
examples were expressed in terms of inches. Under Executive Order 12770 of July 25, 1991 (56 FR 35801), and the Metric
Conversion Act, as amended by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act, (15 U.S.C. 205) all federal agencies are
required to use the SI metric system of measurement in all procurements, grants and other business-related activities
(which include rulemakings), except to the extent that such use is impractical or is likely to cause significant inefficiencies
or loss of markets to United States firms. To comply with these provisions, the examples in the Rule have been altered
to include the metric equivalent in parentheses beside the English measurements. Thus, the measurements in the examples
have been revised to read: 15 inches (38.10 cm); 19 inches (48.26 cm); 20 inches (50.80 cm); 21 inches (53.34 cm); and
262 square inches (1,690.32 sq. cm). This is a technical amendment to an illustrative example in the Rule rather than
a substantive amendment to the Rule. It is not intended to create any new requirement under the Rule to use metric measurements
or to use them in any particular fashion (for example, in hundredths of centimeters). A new note has been added to the
Rule providing that the metric measurements are included for information purposes only, and are not required to be
included in any of the disclosures.

The Commission received five comments, four of which supported retaining the Rule in its current form or with minor
modifications, and one which supported repeal of the Rule. Most of the comments indicated that the Rule continues
to provide a benefit to the industry and consumers, while imposing no significant costs on the industry members.
 The one comment opposing the regulation maintained that it imposed an unreasonable burden on the Federal Trade Commission
in administering and enforcing the regulation.
 In the 

Federal Register

 notice, the Commission requested public comments on the following questions:







(1) Has this trade regulation rule had a significant impact (cost or benefit) on entities subject to its requirements?

(2) Is there a continuing need for this rule?

(3) What burdens does adherence with this rule place on entities subject to its requirements?


(4) What changes should be made to this rule to minimize the economic effect on such entities?

(5) Does this rule overlap or conflict with other federal, state, or local government laws or regulations?

(6) Have technology or economic conditions changed since this rule was issued, and, if so, what effect do these changes
have on the rule?





The public comments on these six issues are discussed below.




1. Has This Trade Regulation Rule Had A Significant Impact (Cost or Benefit) on Entities Subject to Its Requirements?




The majority of the comments indicated that the Picture Tube Rule has provided significant benefits to the public
and the consumer electronics industry, and imposed very little costs on entities subject to the Rule's requirements.
One comment noted that the Rule did impose economic costs on television manufacturers in 1966 when the Rule was first
promulgated.
 At that time, manufacturers had to prepare and produce new advertising and promotional materials to comply with the
Rule. Further, the United States was, and is to this day, the only country that requires screen measurements to be limited
to the viewable picture area.
 After the initial modifications, however, the Rule does not appear to have imposed any further burdens on the industry.
One manufacturer noted that the Rule has had ``virtually no cost impact'' on the company.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941102-0-00043 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941102-0-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

It appears that the Rule has also provided significant benefits. The comments indicated that by establishing a uniform
system of measurement, the Rule enabled consumers to compare various products from different manufacturers.
 One comment concluded, ``the rule and industry standard have virtually eliminated the possibility of consumer deception
regarding television screen size.''
 The Rule's uniform system of measurement has also served the consumer electronics industry. A television manufacturer
indicated that the rule has provided a significant benefit to the company and the industry, and created ``a legal framework
in which a standard industry practice of planar, diagonal-dimension measurement of the viewable screen area has
emerged.''
 After reviewing these comments, the Commission believes the Rule has provided a clear public benefit, as well as a
service to the industry, while imposing minimal costs on the industry.







2. Is There A Continuing Need for This Rule?



Just as the comments generally maintain that the Rule has provided significant benefits, most of the comments also
support retaining the Rule. A trade association maintained that the Rule is still needed to ensure the consistency
in screen measurements that is relied upon by both consumers and industry members.
 One manufacturer expressed concern that if the Federal Trade Commission repealed the Rule, then other manufacturers
would return to using deceptive measurements in their advertisements.
 Based upon these comments, the Commission finds that there is a continuing need for the Picture Tube Rule.







3. What Burdens Does Adherence With This Rule Place on Entities Subject to Its Requirements?



As noted above, while the Picture Tube may have imposed a burden on advertisers and manufacturers when it was first
promulgated, it appears that the Rule does not impose any current significant burden on any entities subject to the
Rule. A trade association noted that the industry has incorporated the regulation's requirements into common business
practice, and thus, the Rule is no longer a burden on industry members.
 A manufacturer also indicated that the Rule ``places virtually no burden whatsoever on entities subject to it.''
 One comment, however, suggested that the Rule did impose a burden on the Federal Trade Commission through administration
and enforcement of the Rule.
 The Commission has found that enforcing the Rule has entailed relatively little administrative burden on the agency,
given the industry's general compliance with the Rule. Further, in seeking public comment, the Commission was soliciting
information concerning the burden on other entities rather than the agency itself.







4. What Changes Should Be Made to This Rule to Minimize the Economic Effect on Such Entities?



Although most of the comments supported preserving the Picture Tube Rule, a few comments from industry members suggested
changes to the Rule. The Electronic Industries Association urged the Commission to eliminate the horizontal dimension
as the default measurement.
 Currently, the advertised dimensions must reflect the horizontal measurement unless the alternative method of
measurement is clearly and conspicuously disclosed in close proximity to the size designation. According to the
Association, however, the prevailing practice within the industry is to use the diagonal plane to measure the screen,
and this is the measurement that is most familiar to consumers. Thus, the comment urges the Commission to amend the
Rule to reflect current industry practice. A manufacturer, however, recommended that the Commission retain the
existing provision concerning the disclosure of the method of measurement, suggesting that methods of measuring
picture tubes are still not likely to be instinctively understood by consumers.

When the Commission initially promulgated the Picture Tube Rule in 1966, most television manufacturers measured
the dimensions of their sets diagonally, just as they do today. Thus, the horizontal dimension was not chosen to be
the default setting based on a belief that it was the industry norm. Rather, the Commission found that almost all rectangular
objects, such as blankets and rugs, were measured horizontally and vertically. Television screens were the only
rectangular-shaped commodities that were measured diagonally. Thus, the Commission reasoned, if a rectangular
screen was measured in the usual manner for similarly-shaped objects, then no disclosure of the method of measurement
was necessary.
 Moreover, the television industry has adopted the Rule's disclosure requirements as part of its routine business
practice. Reversing the provision, to require a disclosure when a measurement other than the diagonal dimension
is used, will provide no tangible benefit, and may cause confusion in the industry and among consumers. Finally, as
one television manufacturer noted in its comment, identifying the method of measurement is useful to consumers because
many would not instinctively understand the diagonal measurement.
 Thus, the Commission sees no reason to revise the Rule's disclosure requirements at this time.





Another comment suggested amending Note 2 of the Rule to provide that a disclosure in a footnote or asterisk would constitute
a disclosure in ``close connection and conjunction'' to the measurement, as required by the Rule.
 However, footnotes or other fine-print disclosures separated from the body of an advertisement may not be adequate
to qualify statements in the text.
 Thus, the Commission has declined to amend the Rule to allow the disclosure of the method of measurement in a footnote
or asterisk.






One comment urged the Commission to add an additional Note to the text of the Rule providing that advertisers need not
identify the method of measurement every time an advertisement indicates a television's dimensions, as long as the
method is disclosed in close connection to the most prominent indication of screen size in the given advertisement.
 The Commission does not believe there is a sufficient basis to justify this amendment. Many advertisements for televisions
promote multiple television sets of different sizes, and a single disclosure of the method of measurement may not
be noticed by consumers. The commenter provided no evidence that multiple disclosures were burdensome. Under the
Rule, advertisers can comply simply by stating ``X inches'' for picture tubes measured horizontally, or ``X inches
diagonal'' for diagonal measurements. Further, almost all of the comments the Commission received indicated that
the current provisions of the Picture Tube Rule are not a burden to manufacturers or advertisers. Thus, the Commission
has decided not to adopt the proposed Note, or otherwise provide exceptions to the requirement that the method of measurement
accompany each measurement other than a horizontal description.





In 1972, the staff of the Federal Trade Commission issued an opinion letter to the Consumer Electronics Group of the
Electronic Industries Association concerning various methods of disclosing the method of measurement used for
television screens.
 In the letter, staff approved a number of proposed disclosures, including ``20 inch diagonal.'' One comment maintained
that the staff opinion letter approving the use ``20 inch diagonal'' is inconsistent with the Rule listing the disclosure
``21 inch diagonal set'' as inappropriate.
 The examples in the Rule apply to a television screen measuring 19 inches horizontally, 15 inches vertically, and
20 inches diagonally. Thus, the example states that the disclosure ``21 inch diagonal set'' is inappropriate not
because of the description of the method of measurement, but because the 21 inch measurement is not accurate for the
set used in the example. The disclosure approved in the opinion letter used the correct 20 inch measurement. While
the current Rule would permit ``20 inch diagonal,'' that phrase is not included in the list of permitted disclosures.
While this list is intended to be illustrative rather than exhaustive, the Commission has decided to include this
disclosure in the examples provided to remove any uncertainly that may exist.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941102-0-00045 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941102-0-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

One comment suggested adding language to the text of the Rule that introduces the examples of improper disclosures
to provide that these examples are only improper absent disclosures elsewhere in the advertisement that clearly
indicate the method of measurement utilized to obtain the given dimensions.
 The Commission would be concerned that combining improper and proper disclosures in the same advertisement could
engender consumer confusion or deception. Thus, the Commission has determined not to amend the Rule as suggested
by this comment.






One of the examples identified in the Rule as being unacceptable is ``21 inch over-all diagonal_262 square inch picture.''
One comment suggested deleting the second half of the example that refers to square inch measurements, so as to permit
such measurements for wide-screen televisions.
 While the Commission has no information on the likelihood of manufacturers of wide-screen televisions using square
inch dimensions rather than the more traditional forms of measurement, the Rule does not prohibit measurements based
on square inches. Rather, the example cited above is intended only to convey that the term, ``overall'' is inappropriate,
regardless of whether it is accompanied by the square inch dimensions of the viewable picture screen. To avoid confusion
and to emphasize the phrase that causes concern, the Commission has determined to modify the example ``21 inch over-all
diagonal_262 square inch picture'' in the list of unacceptable disclosures to read ``21 inch over-all diagonal.''






5. Does This Rule Overlap or Conflict With Other Federal, State, or Local Government Laws or Regulations?



None of the commenters were aware of any law or regulation that conflicted or overlapped with the Picture Tube Rule.



6. Have Technology or Economic Conditions Changed Since This Rule Was Issued, and, If So, What Effect Do These Changes
Have on the Rule?



The Picture Tube Rule was first promulgated in 1966. Since then, both technology and economic conditions have changed
significantly. A much greater percentage of households owns one or more televisions. Television sets have become
more complex and offer an array of features. The television industry itself has expanded considerably, with the advent
of cable and satellite television, and the introduction of interactive television combined with personal computers
and telecommunications. However, none of these changes require any modification of the Picture Tube Rule.

The technological change with the closest nexus to the Picture Tube Rule is the introduction of high definition television
(HDTV), and the new, wider screens used to display these enhanced digital pictures. Most television screens today
have horizontal/vertical dimensions in a 5:3 proportion, or aspect ratio, but the screens for the HDTV have a 16:9
aspect ratio.
 The new ratio, however, does not necessitate any changes to the Rule, because the existing provisions can easily be
applied to the new screens. HDTVs may be advertised as ``46 inch diagonal'' sets. Most consumers are familiar with
this type of measurement for televisions, and will be able to use this measurement to compare different brands of HDTVs,
as well as between high definition and more traditional screens. 

TV Digest

, a trade industry publication, has suggested adding a ``W'' (for wide-screen) to the diagonal measure of the new 16:9
television screens.
 Nothing in the existing Rule would prohibit this designation. However, the Commission does not believe the designation
is necessary to avoid consumer deception or confusion because the ``46 inch diagonal'' or any other measurement allowed
under the Rule should provide consumers with adequate information as to the size of the HDTV. Consequently, no additional
designation such as ``W'' is required under the Rule for wide-screen televisions.






One commenter suggested that the Picture Tube Rule be expanded to encompass video display terminals for computer
monitors. He indicated that he had purchased a monitor advertised as measuring 14 inches, but discovered that the
actual dimensions of the viewable area were 13 inches.
 Currently, the Rule is limited to ``television receiving sets'' and does not encompass computer monitors. The Commission
is considering measurement problems with regard to computer monitors, but has determined not to initiate a rulemaking
proceeding to amend the Picture Tube Rule at this time. Rather, the Commission is reviewing the extent of problems
in this area, and is exploring other possible options for addressing such problems.

Exemption of the Securities of the Kingdom of Spain Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for Purposes of Trading
Futures Contracts on Those Securities 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Securities and Exchange Commission.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Securities and Exchange Commission adopts an amendment to Rule 3a12-8 [17 CFR 240.3a12-8] under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that would designate debt obligations issued by the Kingdom of Spain as ``exempted
securities.'' The purpose of this amendment is to permit the marketing and trading of futures contracts on those securities
in the United States or to U.S. persons. This change is not intended to have any substantive effect on the operation
of the Rule.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Introduction 



Under the Commodity Exchange Act (``CEA''), it is unlawful to trade a futures contract on any individual security,
unless the security in question is an exempted security (other than a municipal security) for the purposes of the Securities
Act of 1933 (``Securities Act'') or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act'').
 Debt obligations of foreign governments are not exempted securities under either of these statutes. The Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC''), however, has the authority to designate securities as exempted
securities for purposes of the Exchange Act. 





In order to facilitate the trading of futures contracts on debt securities of certain foreign governments by U.S.
persons, the Commission has adopted Rule 3a12-8 under the Exchange Act (``Rule'')

2

 to designate debt obligations issued by certain foreign governments as exempted securities under the Exchange Act
solely for the purpose of marketing and trading futures contracts on those securities in the United States or to U.S.
persons.

3

 Currently, the foreign governments listed in the Rule are Great Britain, Canada, Japan, Australia, France, New Zealand,
Austria, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany, Ireland, and Italy (the ``fourteen designated
countries''). As a result, futures contracts on the debt obligations of these countries may be sold to U.S. persons,
so long as the other terms of the Rule are satisfied.

4

 






On May 5, 1993, the Commission issued a release proposing to amend Rule 3a12-8 to designate the debt obligations
of the Kingdom of Spain (``Spain'') as exempt securities, solely for the purpose of futures trading.

5

 The Commission received two comment letters concerning the proposal from the same commenter.

6

 





The Commission is adopting this amendment to the Rule, adding Spain to the list of countries whose debt obligations
are exempted by Rule 3a12-8. In order to qualify for the exemption, futures contracts on debt obligations of
Spain would have to meet all the other existing requirements of the Rule.

II. Background 


Section 2(a)(1)(B)(v) of the CEA,

7

 which was adopted as part of the Futures Trading Act of 1982,

8

 provides that it is unlawful to trade a futures contract on an individual security unless that security is an exempted
security under Section 3 of the Securities Act or Section 3(a)(12) of the Exchange Act.

9

 These sections of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act explicitly designate certain securities, including government
securities and municipal securities, as exempted securities. Securities issued by foreign governments, however,
are not ``government securities'' within the meaning of the federal securities laws.

10

 Therefore, securities issued by foreign governments are not deemed to be exempted securities under the statutory
language. 







Section 3(a)(12) of the Exchange Act, however, provides the Commission with the authority to designate other securities
as exempted securities, either unconditionally or for specified purposes.

11

 Rule 3a12-8 was adopted in 1984

12

 pursuant to this exemptive authority in order to facilitate the trading of futures contracts on securities of foreign
governments by U.S. persons.

13

 As originally adopted, the Rule provided that debt obligations of Canada and the United Kingdom would be deemed to
be exempted securities, solely for the purpose of permitting the offer, sale, and confirmation of ``qualifying foreign
futures contracts'' on such securities, so long as the securities in question were neither registered under the Securities
Act nor the subject of any American Depositary Receipt so registered. A futures contract on such a debt obligation
is deemed under the Rule to be a ``qualifying foreign futures contract'' if delivery under the contract is settled
outside the United States and is traded on a board of trade.

14









The conditions imposed by the Rule were intended to facilitate the trading of futures contracts on foreign government
securities without sacrificing the longstanding policy under the federal securities laws of requiring foreign
government securities to comply with the basic requirements of the federal securities laws in order to be marketed
and traded in the United States. Accordingly, the conditions set forth in the Rule were designed to ensure that, absent
registration, a domestic market in unregistered foreign government securities would not develop, and that markets
for futures on these instruments would not be used to avoid the registration requirements and other provisions of
the federal securities laws.

When the Commission originally proposed Rule 3a12-8, it recognized that the Rule might require amendment in
the future to extend its provisions to debt obligations of other foreign governments.

15

 Subsequently, the Commission amended the Rule to include within its coverage debt obligations issued by Japan, Australia,
France, New Zealand, Austria, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany, Ireland, and Italy.

16

 






Rule 3a12-8 has not been amended since 1992. Futures overlying Spanish government bonds originally were, and
currently are, only traded on the Mercado de Futuros Financieros (``Meff''), a Spanish financial futures exchange
located in Barcelona, Spain. For several months in 1993, the London International Financial Futures and Options
Exchange (``LIFFE'') traded a futures contract based on Spanish government bonds denominated in Pesetas.

17

 The Commission has been informed that U.S. citizens may be interested in derivative products based on securities
issued by foreign governments, including Spain, and has received a request that Rule 3a12-8 be amended to facilitate
such trading.

18

 






The Commission is amending Rule 3a12-8 to add Spain to the list of countries whose debt obligations are deemed
to be ``exempted securities'' under the terms of the Rule. Under this amendment, the existing conditions set forth
in the Rule (

i.e.,

 that the underlying securities not be registered in the United States, that the futures contracts require delivery
outside the United States, and that the contracts be traded on a board of trade) would continue to apply. This should
ensure that a domestic market in the unregistered foreign sovereign debt of Spain does not develop. Therefore, the
amendment should pose no risk for investors in the U.S. securities market. 



III. Discussion 



The Commission received two comment letters from the Finance Ministry of Spain in response to the proposal.

19

 The first letter objected to the rating of Aa2 by Moody's Investors Service (``Moody's'') and AA by Standard and Poor's
(``S&P''), stating that such debt obligations should receive the same rating as two public Spanish companies:
Red Nacional de Ferrocarriles Espanoles (``RENFE'') and Instituto Nacional de Industria (``INI'').

20

 The letter also voiced concerns about the possible effects the rule proposal might have on Spain's debt management
and policies, and requested further time to study such effects.

21

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941102-0-00050 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941102-0-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The second comment letter stated that further study indicated that designating Spain's debt obligations as ``exempted
securities'' would be positive for Spain's debt management and policies. However, the letter reasserted the first
concern relating to the assigned rating for Spain's debt obligations.

22






For the reasons discussed below, and in light of the comment letters received, the Commission has determined that
Rule 3a12-8 should be amended to include the debt obligations of Spain. The Commission believes that the debt
obligations of Spain should be subject to the same regulatory treatment under the Rule as those of the fourteen designated
countries for purposes of trading futures contracts on such debt obligations by U.S. persons. Like the debt obligations
of the fourteen designated countries,

23

 the long-term debt obligations of Spain are rated in one of the two highest rating categories by at least two nationally
recognized statistical rating organizations.

24

 For purposes of the Rule, the Commission is aware of no material differences between the debt obligations of Spain
and those of the fourteen designated countries. Although the commenter believed the assigned rating for Spain's
debt obligations should be in the highest rating category, that issue is not relevant to the Commission's determination
to amend the Rule.





Additionally, the Commission believes that there are no valid legal or policy reasons for denying U.S. investors
the ability to trade futures on debt obligations of Spain. Moreover, the availability to U.S. investors of these hedging
vehicles will allow such investors to take advantage of the growing globalization of the securities markets.


IV. Regulatory Flexibility Act Consideration


Former Chairman Breeden certified in connection with the Release proposing the amendment to the Rule

25

 that this amendment, if adopted, would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
The Commission received no comments on this certification.

V. Effects on Competition and Other Findings


Section 23(a)(2) of the Exchange Act

26

 requires the Commission, in adopting rules under the Exchange Act, to consider the competitive effects of such rules,
if any, and to balance any impact with the regulatory benefits gained in terms of furthering the purposes of the Exchange
Act. The Commission has considered the amendments to the Rule in light of the standards cited in Section 23(a)(2) and
believes that adoption of the amendments will not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in
furtherance of the purposes of the Exchange Act. As stated above, the amendment is designed to assure the lawful availability
in this country of Spanish government bond futures that otherwise would not be permitted to be marketed under the terms
of the CEA. The amendment thus serves to expand the range of financial products available in the United States and enhances
competition in financial markets. Insofar as the Rule contains limitations, they are designed to promote the purposes
of the Exchange Act by ensuring that futures trading on Spanish government securities is consistent with the goals
and purposes of the federal securities laws by minimizing the impact of the Rule on securities trading and distribution
in the United States.




The Commission finds, in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act,

27

 that the amendments to the rule are exemptive in nature. Accordingly, the Commission has determined to make the foregoing
action effective immediately upon publication in the 

Federal Register

.




VI. Statutory Basis


The amendments to Rule 3a12-8 are being adopted pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 78a

 Final rule; update of Federal land use fees. 


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On May 8, 1987, the Commission issued its final rule amending Part 11 of its regulations (Order No. 469, 52 FR 18201,
May 14, 1987). The final rule revised the billing procedures for annual charges for administering Part I of the Federal
Power Act, the billing procedures for charges for Federal dam and land use, and the methodology for assessing Federal
land use charges. 



In accordance with the Commission's regulations, the Commission by its designee, the Executive Director, is updating
its schedule of fees for the use of government lands. The yearly update is determined by adapting the most recent schedule
of fees for the use of linear rights-of-way prepared by the United States Forest Service. Since the next fiscal year
will cover the period from October 1, 1994, through September 30, 1995, the fees in this notice will become effective
October 1, 1994. The fees will apply to fiscal year 1995 annual charges for the use of government lands.

Extension of Import Restrictions on Maya Artifacts From the Peten Region, Guatemala


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Customs Service, Treasury.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document amends the Customs Regulations to reflect the extension of the import restrictions on Maya artifacts
from the Peten Region, Guatemala which were imposed by T.D. 91-34. The Deputy Director of the United States Information
Agency has determined that the emergency conditions which originally warranted the imposition of import restrictions
still exist. Accordingly, the restrictions will continue to be in effect for an additional three years, and the Customs
Regulations are being amended to indicate this extension.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background


Pursuant to the provisions of the Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act, the Deputy Director of the
United States Information Agency (USIA), after consultation with the Secretaries of State and Treasury, determined
that Maya artifacts from the Peten Region, Guatemala were in danger of pillage and looting, and that an emergency condition
existed which warranted the imposition of a prohibition on the importation of such articles into the United States.
In T.D. 91-34, the Customs Service announced the imposition of import restrictions and identified the types
of articles covered by the restrictions.
The Deputy Director of the USIA has considered the recommendations of the Cultural Property Advisory Committee and
determined that the emergency conditions which warranted imposition of the initial restrictions still exist and
has decided to extend the import restrictions for another three years. (See 59 FR 50038, September 30, 1994.)
Accordingly, Customs is amending  12.104g (19 CFR 12.104g) to reflect the extension of the import restriction.


Regulatory Flexibility Act


Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required, the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.

Executive Order 12866


This amendment does not meet the criteria for a ``significant regulatory action'' as specified in E.O. 12866. 


Inapplicability of Notice and Delayed Effective Date 


Because this amendment reflects the extension of emergency import restrictions on cultural property which is currently
subject to pillage and looting, pursuant to  553(b)(B) of the Administrative Procedure Act, no notice of proposed
rulemaking or public procedure is necessary. For the same reason, a delayed effective date is both impracticable
and contrary to the public interest. 


Drafting Information 


The principal author of this amendment was Peter T. Lynch, Regulations Branch, Office of Regulations and Rulings,
U.S. Customs Service. However, personnel from other offices participated in its development.

Pesticide Tolerance for Metalaxyl




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This rule establishes a tolerance for combined residues of the fungicide metalaxyl [

N

-(2,6-dimethylphenyl)-

N

-(methoxyacetyl) alanine methyl ester] and its metabolites containing the 2,6-dimethylaniline moiety, and 

N

-(2-hydroxymethyl-6-methyl)-

N

-(methoxyacetyl)-alanine methylester, each expressed as metalaxyl, in or on the raw agricultural commodity leafy
vegetables (except Brassica) group (except spinach). Ciba-Geigy Corp. petitioned for this regulation to establish
the maximum permissible levels for residues of the fungicide.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 EPA issued a notice of filing, published in the 

Federal Register

 of December 13, 1991 (56 FR 29767), which announced that Ciba-Geigy Corp., P.O. Box 18300, Greensboro, NC 27419, had
submitted pesticide petition PP 0F3893 to EPA requesting that the Administrator, pursuant to section 408(d) of the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a(d), establish a tolerance for combined residues of the
fungicide metalaxyl [

N

-(2,6-dimethylphenyl)-

N

-(methoxyacetyl) alanine methyl ester] and its metabolites containing the 2,6-dimethylaniline moiety, and 

N

-(2-hydroxymethyl-6-methyl)-

N

-(methoxyacetyl)-alanine methylester, each expressed as metalaxyl, in or on the raw agricultural commodity leafy
vegetables (except Brassica) group (except spinach) at 5.0 ppm.


There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the notice of filing.
By way of public reminder, this notice also reiterates the registrant's responsibility under section 6 (a)(2) of
FIFRA to submit additional factual information regarding adverse effects on the environment and to human health
by the pesticide. The scientific data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have been evaluated.
The toxicological data considered in support of the tolerance include:
1. A 3-month dietary study in rats with a no-observed-effect level (NOEL) at 17.5 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg)
body weight (bwt)/day (250 parts per million (ppm)).
2. A developmental toxicity study in rats with a NOEL of 50 mg/kg bwt for developmental toxicity and maternal toxicity.
3. A developmental toxicity study in rabbits with a NOEL of 300 mg/kg bwt, the highest dose tested (HDT). Metalaxyl
did not cause developmental toxicity, even in the presence of maternal toxicity.
4. Metalaxyl was negative in bacterial and mammalian gene mutation. The fungicide also did not increase the frequency
of reverse mutations in yeast. Metalaxyl was negative in an 

in vivo

 cytogenetics assay (hamsters) and a dominant-lethal assay (mice). Metalaxyl did not increase unscheduled DNA synthesis
in rat primary hepatocytes or in human fibroblasts. These results suggest that metalaxyl is not genotoxic.
5. A three-generation rat reproduction study with a NOEL of 63 mg/kg bwt/day (1,250 ppm).
6. A 6-month dog feeding study with a NOEL of 6.3 mg/kg bwt/day (250 ppm). Effects found at 25 mg/kg were increased serum
alkaline phosphatase activity and increased liver weight and liver-to-brain weight ratios without histological
changes.
7. A 2-year rat chronic feeding/carcinogenicity study with no compound-related carcinogenic effects under the
conditions of the study at dietary levels up to 1,250 ppm. The NOEL is 13 mg/kg bwt/day (250 ppm). The lowest-observed-effect
level (LOEL) is 63 mg/kg/day based upon slight increases in liver weight to body weight ratios and periacinar vacuolation
of hepatocytes.
8. A 2-year mouse oncogenic study with no compound-related carcinogenic effects under the conditions of the study
at dietary levels up to 190 mg/kg/day.
Because of concerns raised over some equivocal increases in tumor incidences in the male mouse liver and the male rat
adrenal medulla, and the female rat thyroid, the two chronic feeding studies were submitted to the Environmental
Pathology Laboratories (EPL) for an independent reading of the microscopic slides. The new pathological evaluation
by EPL and the original reports of the rat and mouse oncogenicity studies were then both submitted for review to EPA's
Carcinogen Assessment Group (CAG). A final review of the carcinogenicity studies and related material was performed
by the Peer Review Committee of the Toxicology Branch (TB) of the Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP).
The four major issues evaluated by CAG and the peer review group included: (1) Perifollicular cell adenomas in the
thyroid of female rats; (2) adrenal medullary tumors (pheochromocytomas) in male rats; (3) liver tumors in male mice;
and (4) whether the HDT (1,250 ppm) in the rat and mouse oncogenicity studies represented a maximum-tolerated dose
(MTD).
Regarding the thyroid tumors in female rats, the peer review group concluded that the increased incidences of thyroid
tumors in females of treated groups were not compound related. This conclusion was based on the following: (1) There
was no progression of benign tumors (adenomas) to malignancy (carcinomas); (2) there was no increase in hyperplastic
changes; (3) there was no dose-response relationship; and (4) the two reevaluations of the microscopic slides by
the pathologists at EPL and TB in OPP further did not confirm any apparent effects observed in the original report.
The issue of a possible treatment-related increase of adrenal medullary gland tumors, namely, pheochromocytomas,
in the male rat was also reassessed by both CAG and the Peer Review Committee. Both concluded that the data, especially
in view of the reevaluation of the microscopic slides performed by EPL, did not support a compound-related increase
of adrenal medullary tumors; the incidence of pheochromocytomas more accurately represented spontaneous variations
of a commonly occurring tumor in the aged rat.
The analysis of the significance of the equivocal increase in the incidence of liver tumors in male mice was very similar
to that performed for the rat thyroid and adrenal gland tumors. The original pathological reading of the tissue slides
reported an elevated increase of tumors in some treatment groups; however, these increases were not evident after
a reevaluation of the microscopic slides was performed by an independent pathologist at EPL and by the reading of a
CAG pathologist. The Peer Review Committee concurred that the reevaluation of the slides is reliable and does not
show any compound-related increase in the incidence of liver tumors in the mouse.
The Agency believes that the data from the rat and mouse long-term studies are sufficient to support the conclusion
that metalaxyl does not show a carcinogenic potential in laboratory animals. This conclusion is supported by the
following: (1) The doses tested in both the rat and mouse long-term studies approached an MTD based upon compound-related
changes in liver weight and/or liver histology; (2) extensive available mutagenic evidence indicates no potential
genotoxic activity which correlates with the negative carcinogenic potential demonstrated in long-term testing;
(3) metalaxyl is not structurally related to known carcinogens; and (4) under the conditions of the rat and mouse tests,
no indication of compound-related carcinogenic effects was noted at any of the treatment doses, sexes, or species.

The chronic dietary exposure analysis used a reference dose (RfD) of 0.08 mg/kg bwt/day, based on a NOEL of 7.8 mg/kg
bwt/day and an uncertainty factor of 100. The NOEL is taken from a 6-month dog feeding study which demonstrated increased
alkaline phosphatase activity and an increase in relative liver weights at 30.63 mg/kg bwt/day. The RfD was taken
from actual dose values and has thus changed from 0.06 mg/kg bwt/day to the 0.08 used in the analysis.

Food uses evaluated in the residue analysis were the published uses of metalaxyl listed in 40 CFR 180.408 and 185.4000
and the proposed use on leafy vegetables (except Brassica) group (except spinach). In a memo of June 21, 1991, Chemistry
Branch Tolerance Support recommended for a tolerance reassessment for metalaxyl on leafy vegetables (except Brassica)
group (except spinach). In 40 CFR 180.408 tolerances exist for metalaxyl on leafy vegetables (0.1 ppm), spinach (10
ppm), and head lettuce (5 ppm). Data submitted lead to the proposed new tolerance of 5 ppm for the crop group leafy vegetables
(except Brassica) group (except spinach) for metalaxyl.

The nature of the residue is adequately understood, and adequate analytical methods (GLC and AFID) are available
for enforcement purposes in the Pesticide Analytical Manual, Vol. II.

A chronic exposure analysis was performed using tolerance level residues and 100-percent-crop-treated information
to estimate the Theoretical Maximum Residue Contribution (TMRC) for the general population and 22 subgroups. Percent-crop-treated
data were used to calculate the Anticipated Residue Contribution (ARC) for the Dietary Risk Evaluation System (DRES)
population subgroups for certain commodities.

The anticipated residue contribution (ARC) for the overall U. S. population from published uses is 6.5 x 10

-3

 mg/kg bwt/day, which represents 8% of the RfD. The proposed use on leafy vegetables (except Brassica) group (except
spinach) contributes an exposure of 4.7 x 10

-4

 mg/kg bwt/day, representing less than 1% of the RfD. When the proposed exposure is added to the public exposure for
metalaxyl the ARC is 6.9 x 10

-3

 mg/kg bwt/day, or 9% of the RfD.

The subgroup most highly exposed, children (1 to 6 years old), has an ARC from existing uses of 1.2 x 10

-2

 mg/kg bwt/day, representing 16% of the RfD. The proposed use contributes an additional 6.1 x 10

-4

 mg/kg bwt/day and raises the overall ARC 1.3 x 10

-2

 mg/kg bwt/day, still representing 16% of the RfD.

Based on the exposure and risk estimates arrived at through this analysis, the Agency believes that the proposed use
for metalaxyl does not pose a chronic dietary risk that is of concern.

There are presently no actions pending against the continued registration of this chemical.

Based on the information and data considered, the Agency has determined that the tolerance established by amending
40 CFR part 180 will protect the public health. Therefore, the tolerance is established as set forth below.

Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the Federal
Register, file written objections to the regulation and may also request a hearing on those objections. Objections
and hearing requests must be filed with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20). A copy of the objections
and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket for this rulemaking. The
objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds for the
objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR 180.33(i). If a hearing
is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing is requested, the
requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector (40 CFR 178.27).
A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted shows the following:
There is genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available evidence identified
by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor, taking into account
uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner sought by the requestor
would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).

Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order (i.e., Regulatory Impact
Analysis, review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant''
as those actions likely to lead to a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely
and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health
or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant''); (2)
creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or
policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive
Order.

Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the Federal Register of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).

Pesticide Tolerances for Myclobutanil 




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document extends the time-limited tolerances for residues of the fungicide myclobutanil and certain of its
metabolites in or on the raw agricultural commodities cherries (sweet and sour), nectarines, and peaches until April
1, 1995. This extension will allow EPA adequate time to evaluate studies conducted by Rohm & Haas Co. required
to support permanent tolerances for this chemical in or on these commodities.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 EPA issued a notice, published in the 

Federal Register

 of January 9, 1990 (55 FR 779), which announced that the Rohm & Haas Co. of Independence Mall West, Philadelphia,
PA 19105, had submitted pesticide petition (PP) 9F3811 to EPA proposing to establish tolerances under section 408
of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 346a) for the fungicide myclobutanil (

alpha

-butyl-

alpha

-(3-hydroxybutyl)-1

H

-1,2,4-triazole-1-propanenitrile) and both the free and bound forms of its metabolite 

alpha

-(3-hydroxybutyl)-

alpha

-(4-chlorophenyl)-1

H

-1,2,4-triazole-1-propanenitrile in or on stone fruits group (except cherry) at 2.0 parts per million (ppm) and
cherry at 5.0 ppm. 

Subsequently, Rohm & Haas amended the petition by deleting the request for the stone fruit group and requesting
tolerances for peaches and nectarines at 2.0 ppm and cherries (sweet and sour) at 5.0 ppm. 
Additionally, the Agency requested that Rohm & Haas amend the petition by proposing a tolerance of 4.0 ppm in/on
cherries. The petition was amended by requesting that the tolerance for cherries be reduced to 4.0 ppm.

In the 

Federal Register

 of February 5, 1992 (57 FR 4368), EPA established tolerances, on an interim basis, in 40 CFR 180.443 for residues of
this chemical in or on the raw agricultural commodities cherries (sweet and sour), nectarines, and peaches. An expiration
date of October 1, 1994, was imposed for the tolerances. The interim tolerances were established based upon the condition
that data be submitted to the Agency to fully support permanent tolerances for these commodities.

The conditions imposed by the establishment of the interim tolerances were that the chronic/oncogenicity feeding
studies in the mouse and the rat be repeated. Both studies need to be repeated because a maximum-tolerated dose (MTD)
had not been achieved. However, no preneoplastic lesions were observed in either study to suggest possible carcinogenic
activity, and myclobutanil did not induce either genotoxic effects or chromosomal aberrations in a series of mutagenicity
tests. In addition, no strong structural activity correlation to other carcinogens has been found. Under these circumstances,
EPA concluded that no significant carcinogenic risk was posed by these tolerances for the timeframe involved in receiving
and reviewing the repeated studies.

The Agency evaluated dietary exposure to the fungicide residues for the commodities which have established permanent
or interim tolerances. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) based on the 2-year rat chronic feeding study (NOEL of 2.49
mg/kg body weight/ day), using a hundredfold uncertainty factor, was calculated to be 0.025 mg/kg bwt/day. The theoretical
maximum residue contribution (TMRC) from previously established tolerances and interim tolerances is 0.002217
mg/kg bwt/day and utilizes 8.865 percent of the ADI.

The data submitted in support of the tolerances and other relevant material have been reviewed. The toxicological
data considered in support of these tolerances are discussed in detail in the document establishing the interim tolerances
which was published in the 

Federal Register

 of February 5, 1992 (57 FR 4369).

Based upon the above dietary risk estimate, the Agency believes that an extension of the interim tolerances would
not pose a significant public health risk for the period of time indicated and would allow the Agency sufficient time
to review the final reports on all the required data. EPA does not expect that the required data will significantly
change the above risk estimate.

On the basis of the available studies on myclobutanil, the Agency has concluded that the human risk posed by the use
of myclobutanil on cherries, nectarines, and peaches does not raise significant concerns. The Agency has determined
that extending the tolerances will protect the human health. Therefore, as set forth below, the tolerances are extended
to April 1, 1995. Based upon the reviews of the rat and mouse oncogenicity studies, the Agency will determine whether
establishing permanent tolerances is appropriate.

Residues remaining in or on the above raw agricultural commodities after expiration of these tolerances will not
be considered actionable if the pesticide is legally applied during the term, and in accordance with, provisions
of the conditional registrations.


Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register

, file written objections to the regulation and may also request a hearing on those objections. Objections and hearing
requests must be filed with the Hearing Clerk at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20). A copy of the objections and/or
hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket for this rulemaking. The objections
submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds for the objections
(40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR 180.33(i). If a hearing is requested,
the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing is requested, the requestor's contentions
on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector (40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will
be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted shows the following: There is genuine and
substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available evidence identified by the requestor
would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor, taking into account uncontested
claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issues(s) in the manner sought by the requestor would
be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).

Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order (i.e., Regulatory Impact Analysis,
review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant'' as those
actions likely to lead to a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or
policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive
Order.

Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).

Pesticide Tolerances for Metalaxyl 




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This rule establishes tolerances for combined residues of the fungicide metalaxyl [

N

-(2,6-dimethylphenyl)-

N

-(methoxyacetyl) alanine methyl ester] and its metabolites containing the 2,6-dimethylaniline moiety and 

N

-(2-hydroxymethyl-6-methyl)-

N

-(methoxyacetyl)-alanine methylester, each expressed as metalaxyl, in or on the raw agricultural commodities
cereal grains (except wheat, barley, and oats) [replacing grain crops] and forage, fodder, and straw of the cereal
grains group (except wheat, barley, and oats). Ciba-Geigy Corp. petitioned to establish the maximum permissible
levels for residues of the fungicide.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 EPA issued a notice of filing, published in the 

Federal Register

 of December 13, 1991 (56 FR 29767), which announced that Ciba-Geigy Corp., P.O. Box 18300, Greensboro, NC 27419, had
submitted pesticide petition PP 1F3993 to EPA requesting that the Administrator, pursuant to section 408(d) of the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a(d), establish tolerances for combined residues of the
fungicide metalaxyl [

N

-(2,6-dimethylphenyl)-

N

-(methoxyacetyl) alanine methyl ester] and its metabolites containing the 2,6-dimethylaniline moiety, and 

N

-(2-hydroxymethyl-6-methyl)-

N

-(methoxyacetyl)-alanine methylester, each expressed as metalaxyl, in or on the raw agricultural commodities
cereal grains (except wheat, barley, and oats) at 0.1 part per million (ppm) (replacing grain crops at 0.1 ppm) and
forage, fodder, and straw of cereal grains group (except wheat, barley, and oats) at 1.0 ppm.


There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the notice of filing.
By way of public reminder, this notice also reiterates the registrant's responsibility under section 6 (a)(2) of
FIFRA to submit additional factual information regarding adverse effects on the environment and to human health
by the pesticide. 
The scientific data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have been evaluated. The toxicological
data considered in support of the tolerances include:
1. A 3-month dietary study in rats with a no-observed-effect level (NOEL) at 17.5 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg)
body weight (bwt)/day (250 parts per million (ppm)).
2. A developmental toxicity study in rats with a NOEL of 50 mg/kg bwt for developmental toxicity and maternal toxicity.
3. A developmental toxicity study in rabbits with a NOEL of 300 mg/kg bwt, the highest dose tested (HDT). Metalaxyl
did not cause developmental toxicity, even in the presence of maternal toxicity.
4. Metalaxyl was negative in bacterial and mammalian gene mutation. The fungicide also did not increase the frequency
of reverse mutations in yeast. Metalaxyl was negative in an in vivo cytogenetics assay (hamsters) and a dominant-lethal
assay (mice). Metalaxyl did not increase unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat primary hepatocytes or in human fibroblasts.
These results suggest that metalaxyl is not genotoxic.

5. A three-generation rat reproduction study with a NOEL of 63 mg/kg bwt/day (1,250 ppm).

6. A 6-month dog feeding study with a NOEL of 6.3 mg/kg bwt/day (250 ppm). Effects found at 25 mg/kg were increased serum
alkaline phosphatase activity and increased liver weight and liver-to-brain weight ratios without histological
changes.

7. A 2-year rat chronic feeding/carcinogenicity study with no compound-related carcinogenic effects under the
conditions of the study at dietary levels up to 1,250 ppm. The NOEL is 13 mg/kg bwt/day (250 ppm). The lowest-observed-effect
level (LOEL) is 63 mg/kg/day based upon slight increases in liver weight to body weight ratios and periacinar vacuolation
of hepatocytes.

8. A 2-year mouse oncogenic study with no compound-related carcinogenic effects under the conditions of the study
at dietary levels up to 190 mg/kg/day.

Because of concerns raised over some equivocal increases in tumor incidences in the male mouse liver and the male rat
adrenal medulla, and the female rat thyroid, the two chronic feeding studies were submitted to the Environmental
Pathology Laboratories (EPL) for an independent reading of the microscopic slides. The new pathological evaluation
by EPL and the original reports of the rat and mouse oncogenicity studies were then both submitted for review to EPA's
Carcinogen Assessment Group (CAG). A final review of the carcinogenicity studies and related material was performed
by the Peer Review Committee of the Toxicology Branch (TB) of the Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP).

The four major issues evaluated by CAG and the peer review group included: (1) Perifollicular cell adenomas in the
thyroid of female rats; (2) adrenal medullary tumors (pheochromocytomas) in male rats; (3) liver tumors in male mice;
and (4) whether the HDT (1,250 ppm) in the rat and mouse oncogenicity studies represented a maximum-tolerated dose
(MTD).

Regarding the thyroid tumors in female rats, the peer review group concluded that the increased incidences of thyroid
tumors in females of treated groups were not compound related. This conclusion was based on the following: (1) There
was no progression of benign tumors (adenomas) to malignancy (carcinomas); (2) there was no increase in hyperplastic
changes; (3) there was no dose-response relationship; and (4) the two reevaluations of the microscopic slides by
the pathologists at EPL and TB in OPP further did not confirm any apparent effects observed in the original report.

The issue of a possible treatment-related increase of adrenal medullary gland tumors, namely, pheochromocytomas,
in the male rat was also reassessed by both CAG and the Peer Review Committee. Both concluded that the data, especially
in view of the reevaluation of the microscopic slides performed by EPL, did not support a compound-related increase
of adrenal medullary tumors; the incidence of pheochromocytomas more accurately represented spontaneous variations
of a commonly occurring tumor in the aged rat.

The analysis of the significance of the equivocal increase in the incidence of liver tumors in male mice was very similar
to that performed for the rat thyroid and adrenal gland tumors. The original pathological reading of the tissue slides
reported an elevated increase of tumors in some treatment groups; however, these increases were not evident after
a reevaluation of the microscopic slides was performed by an independent pathologist at EPL and by the reading of a
CAG pathologist. The Peer Review Committee concurred that the reevaluation of the slides is reliable and does not
show any compound-related increase in the incidence of liver tumors in the mouse.

The Agency believes that the data from the rat and mouse long-term studies are sufficient to support the conclusion
that metalaxyl does not show a carcinogenic potential in laboratory animals. This conclusion is supported by the
following: (1) The doses tested in both the rat and mouse long-term studies approached an MTD based upon compound-related
changes in liver weight and/or liver histology; (2) extensive available mutagenic evidence indicates no potential
genotoxic activity which correlates with the negative carcinogenic potential demonstrated in long-term testing;
(3) metalaxyl is not structurally related to known carcinogens; and (4) under the conditions of the rat and mouse tests,
no indication of compound-related carcinogenic effects was noted at any of the treatment doses, sexes, or species.

The reference dose (RfD) based on the 6-month dog feeding study (NOEL 7.8 mg/kg bwt/day), and using a hundredfold safety
factor, is calculated to be 0.08 mg/kg bwt/day. The anticipated residue contribution from previously established
tolerances and food additive regulations and the tolerances and food additive regulations established here are
0.006465 mg/kg bwt/day and utilize 8% of the RfD.

The anticipated residue contribution from previously established tolerances and food additive regulations and
the tolerances and food additive regulations established here for the subgroup most highly exposed, children (1
to 6 years old), have an anticipated residue contribution (ARC) from existing uses of 1.2 x 10

-2

 mg/kg bwt/day, representing 16% of the RfD.

The nature of the residue is adequately understood, and adequate analytical methods (N/P GLC) are available for enforcement
purposes in the Pesticide Analytical Manual, Vol. II.

There are presently no actions pending against the continued registration of this chemical.

Based on the information and data considered, the Agency has determined that the tolerances established by amending
40 CFR part 180 will protect the public health. Therefore, the tolerances are established as set forth below.

Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the Federal
Register, file written objections to the regulation and may also request a hearing on those objections. Objections
and hearing requests must be filed with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20). A copy of the objections
and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket for this rulemaking. The
objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds for the
objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR 180.33(i). If a hearing
is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing is requested, the
requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector (40 CFR 178.27).
A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted shows the following:
There is genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available evidence identified
by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor, taking into account
uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner sought by the requestor
would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).

Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order (i.e., Regulatory Impact
Analysis, review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant''
as those actions likely to lead to a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely
and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health
or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant''); (2)
creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or
policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive
Order.

Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of July 27, 1994 (59 FR 38149), EPA issued a proposed rule that gave notice that the Asgrow Seed Co., Kalamazoo, MI 49004,
had submitted pesticide petition (PP) 4E4310 to EPA under section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,
21 U.S.C. 346a, to exempt from the requirement of a tolerance the residues of the plant-pesticides watermelon mosaic
virus-2 coat protein and zucchini yellow mosaic virus coat protein as expressed in Asgrow line ZW20 of 

Cucurbita pepo

 L., and subsequent generations obtained through normal sexual reproduction. An amendment to this petition was received
on April 4, 1994, which changed the proposed exemption by including the genetic material necessary for the production

Poly(vinylpyrrolidone); Tolerance Exemption




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of poly(vinylpyrrolidone)
(CAS Reg. No. 9003-39-8) when used as an inert ingredient (surfactant, related adjuvants of surfactant) in pesticide
formulations applied to growing crops or to raw agricultural commodities after harvest. International Specialty
Products requested this regulation.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of August 31, 1994 (59 FR 44956), EPA issued a proposed rule that gave notice that International Specialty Products,
1361 Alps Rd., Wayne, NJ 07470, had submitted pesticide petition (PP) 4E4308 to EPA requesting that the Administrator,
pursuant to section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a(e), propose to amend
40 CFR 180.1001(c) by revising the currently listed exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of
poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (CAS Reg. No. 9003-39-8) when used as an inert ingredient (surfactant, related adjuvants
of surfactant) in pesticide formulations applied to growing crops or to raw agricultural commodities after harvest
to include poly(vinylpyrrolidone) polymers of molecular weights greater than 4,000. The current molecular weight
limit is 40,000 or over. 


Inert ingredients are all ingredients that are not active ingredients as defined in 40 CFR 153.125, and include, but
are not limited to, the following types of ingredients (except when they have a pesticidal efficacy of their own):
solvents such as alcohols and hydrocarbons; surfactants such as polyoxyethylene polymers and fatty acids; carriers
such as clay and diatomaceous earth; thickeners such as carrageenan and modified cellulose; wetting, spreading,
and dispersing agents; propellants in aerosol dispensers; microencapsulating agents; and emulsifiers. The term
``inert'' is not intended to imply nontoxicity; the ingredient may or may not be chemically active. 
There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the proposed rule.

The data submitted relevant to the proposal and other relevant material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed
rule. Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that the tolerance exemption will protect
the public health. Therefore, the tolerance exemption is established as set forth below.
Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register,

 file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
or recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing

to 60 ppm, and leafy vegetables (except brassica vegetables) group from 80 ppm to 100 ppm. There were no comments or
requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the notice of filing.


The data submitted in the petitions and all other relevant material have been evaluated. The toxicology data considered
in support of the tolerances include:
1. A rat acute oral study with an LD

50

 of 5.4 grams (g)/kilogram (kg).
2. A mouse acute oral study with an LD

50

 of 3.5 gm/kg.
3. A 90-day rat feeding study with a no-observed-effect level (NOEL) of 5,000 ppm (250 milligrams (mg)/kg/day).
4. A 90-day dog feeding study with a NOEL of 10,000 ppm (250 mg/kg/day).
5. A 21-day rabbit dermal study with a NOEL of 1.5 g/kg/day [the highest dose tested (HDT)].
6. A carcinogenicity study in mice with no carcinogenic effects observed at any dose level under the conditions of
the study (the HDT was 2,857/4,286 mg/kg body weight (bwt)/day).
7. A rat chronic feeding/carcinogenicity study with a NOEL of 2,000 ppm (100 mg/kg bwt/day) for systemic effects (carcinogenic
effects observed are discussed below).
8. A 2-year dog feeding study with a NOEL of 10,000 ppm (250 mg/kg bwt/day) and a lowest effect level (LEL) of 20,000 ppm
(500 mg/kg bwt/day) based on a slight degenerative effect on the testes.
9. A reproduction study in rats with a NOEL of 300 mg/kg bwt/day for systemic toxicity and an LEL of 600 mg/kg bwt/day
based on effects on animal weights in some groups and urinary tract changes in some groups. No reproductive effect
was seen.
10. Teratology studies in rabbits and rats with teratogenic NOELs of 500 mg/kg/day and 1,000 mg/kg/day, respectively.
11. Ames mutagenicity assays, E. coli phage induction tests, micronucleus tests in mice, DNA repair tests using 

E. coli

, and 

Saccharomyces cervisiae

 yeast assay that were negative.

As stated in a notice, published in the 

Federal Register

 of November 2, 1983 (48 FR 50532), carcinogenic effects were noted in the rat chronic feeding/carcinogenicity study.
In this study, Charles River CD rats were dosed with aluminum tris (

O

-ethylphosphonate) at levels of 0, 2,000, 8,000, and 40,000/30,000 ppm (0, 100, 400, and 2,000/1,500 mg/kg bwt/day).
The 40,000-ppm dose was reduced to 30,000 ppm after 2 weeks following observations of staining of the abdominal fur
and red coloration of the urine at 40,000 ppm (2,000 mg/kg bwt/day).
The highest dose level of the chemical tested in the male Charles River CD-1 rats (2,000/1,500 mg/kg bwt/day) in this
study appears to approximate a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) based on the finding of urinary bladder hyperplasia at
this dose. Similarly, an MTD level appeared to be satisfied in the female Charles River CD-1 rats at the high-dose level
of 2,000 mg/kg bwt/day, during the first 2 weeks of the carcinogenicity/chronic feeding study, before the dose level
was reduced to 1,500 mg/kg bwt/day.
The study demonstrated a significantly elevated incidence of urinary bladder tumors (adenomas and carcinomas combined)
at the highest dose level tested (2,000/1,500 mg/kg) in male Charles River CD-1 rats. The tumors were mainly seen in
surviving males at the time of terminal sacrifice. The original pathological diagnosis of these tumors was independently
confirmed by another consulting pathologist, who also reported an elevated incidence of urinary bladder hyperplasia
in high-dose male rats. No increase in the incidence of urinary bladder tumors was observed in female rats.
In 1986, the Health Effects Division Peer Review Committee for Carcinogenicity of the Office of Pesticide Programs
concluded that the available data provided limited evidence of the carcinogenicity of fosetyl-Al in male rats and
classified the pesticide as a Category C carcinogen (possible human carcinogen with limited evidence of carcinogenicity
in animals) in accordance with proposed Agency guidelines, published in the 

Federal Register

 of November 23, 1984 (49 FR 46294). The Health Effects Division Peer Review Committee for Carcinogenicity determined
that a quantitative risk assessment was not appropriate for the following reasons:
1. The carcinogenic response observed with this chemical was confined solely to the high-dose males at one site (urinary
bladder) in rats.
2. The tumor response was primarily due to an increase in benign tumors.
3. The tumors were seen only in surviving animals at the time of terminal sacrifice.
4. The carcinogenic effects were observed only at unusually high doses which exceed the commonly used limit dose of
1,000 mg/kg/day recommended as an upper-limiting dose for bioassays.
5. The chemical was not carcinogenic when administered in the diet to Charles River CD-1 mice at dose levels ranging
from 2,500 to 30,000 ppm (357 to 4,286 mg/kg bwt/day).
6. Fosetyl-Al was not mutagenic in eight well conducted genotoxic assays. In 1993, the Health Effects Division Peer
Review Committee (PRC) for Carcinogenicity revisited the carcinogenicity classification of fosetyl-Al because
of a recent 90-day feeding study of fosetyl-Al in rats which showed a strong association between the presence of uroliths
in the urinary bladder and the incidence of urinary bladder tumors in treated rats. The PRC concluded that fosetyl-Al
is not amenable to classification using the current Agency cancer guidelines. Based on a mechanistic evaluation
of the only tumors seen, those that occurred at exceptionally high doses (2,000/1,500 mg/kg) in the bladder of male
rats, it appears that humans are not likely to be exposed to doses of fosetyl-Al that produce the urinary tract toxicity
that precedes and seems to lead to the tumor response in rats. In particular, anticipated human dietary and occupational
exposures to fosetyl-Al are far below the NOEL in rats for the apparent urinary tract tumor precursors (stone formation
and attendant epithelial irritation). These effects are produced in rats at extremely high doses, under conditions
not anticipated to occur outside of the experimental laboratory. The PRC concludes that pesticidal use of fosetyl-Al
is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic hazard to humans. Therefore, the standard risk assessment approach of using the
Reference Dose (RfD) based on systemic toxicity was applied to fosetyl-Al.
Using a 100-fold safety factor and the NOEL of 250 mg/kg bwt/day determined by the most sensitive species from the 2-year
dog-feeding study, the RfD is 3.0 mg/kg bwt/day. The theoretical maximum residue contribution (TMRC) from the established
and proposed tolerances is 0.053921 mg/kg bwt/day and utilizes 1.8 percent of the RfD for the overall U. S. population.
For exposure of the most highly exposed subgroup in the population, Non-Hispanic Others, the TMRC is 0.081236 mg/kg
bwt/day and utilizes 2.7 percent of the RfD. Previous tolerances have been established for fosetyl-Al, aluminum
tris(O-ethylphosphonate), in asparagus, avocadoes, brassica vegetable crop group, caneberries, citrus, cucurbit
vegetables group, dried hops, dry bulb onions, fresh ginseng root, leafy vegetables crop group, pineapples, pineapple
forage and fodder, and strawberries.
The metabolism of aluminum tris(

O

-ethylphosphonate) in plants is adequately understood. No animal feed items are associated with this petition;
therefore, there is no reasonable expectation of secondary residues occurring in milk, eggs, and meat of livestock
or poultry. There are no processed commodities derived from the RACs, strawberries, brassica vegetable group, and
leafy vegetable group; consequently, no corresponding food or feed additive regulations are required.

An adequate analytical method, gas-liquid chromatography, is available for enforcement purposes. Because of the
long lead time from establishing these tolerances to publication of the enforcement methodology in the Pesticide
Analytical Manual, Vol. II, the analytical methodology is being made available in the interim to anyone interested
in pesticide enforcement when requested from: Calvin Furlow, Public Response Program Branch, Field Operations
Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC
20460. Office location and telephone number: Rm. 1128, CM #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Hwy., Arlington, VA 22202, (703)-305-5805.
The pesticide is considered useful for the purposes for which the tolerances are sought. Based on the information
and data considered, the Agency concludes that the establishment of the tolerances will protect the public health.
Therefore, the tolerances are established as set forth below.
Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register

, file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fees provided by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested and the requestor's contentions on each such issue, and a summary of the evidence relied upon by the objection
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve on or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).

Captan; Order Denying Objection to Revocation of Feed Additive Regulation 




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; Order denying objection to revocation. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This Order, pursuant to section 409(f) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) and in accordance with the
regulations in 40 CFR part 178, announces that EPA is denying an objection to a final rule issued August 4, 1993, that
revoked the feed additive regulation in 40 CFR 186.500 for residues of the pesticide captan in or on detreated captan-treated
corn seed.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of August 4, 1993 (58 FR 41430), EPA revoked the feed additive regulation (40 CFR 186.500) for residues of the fungicide
captan in or on corn seed at 100 parts per million (ppm). This regulation addressed corn seed that originally was treated
with captan as a seed protectant and was later ``detreated'' by washing or roasting so that the seed could be used as
an animal feed. The basis for the revocation was the absence of residue data to support the regulation and the lack of
adequate control procedures to ensure seed was detreated properly. On August 27, 1993, Ken Hunt of Ken's Roasting
Service filed objections to that revocation. This Order denies those objections.


Background


In March 1986, as part of an overall review of captan, EPA determined that the record contained ``no acceptable residue
data to support the roasting detreatment method at any dosage or period of storage.'' (Guidance for the Reregistration
of Pesticide Products Containing Captan (March 1986).) The Residue Chemistry Chapter of the Registration Standard
(August 1985) concluded that there were insufficient data for residues of captan on corn seed that had been treated
at the maximum label rate and then detreated. The only available data were on residue reduction from washing of treated
corn seed. The then- existing tolerance was exceeded in several samples, the treatments were not conducted at the
maximum label rate, and crucial details of many of the experiments were missing. The validity of the data could not
be determined, and the data covered only a washing process. Data were requested on the residues of concern on seed both
before and after detreating. The detreatment methods of interest to the registrant(s), such as roasting, were to
be tested. This information was essential to establish a proper tolerance and to evaluate the dietary risk from detreated
corn.
EPA announced it would revoke the food additive regulation for detreated corn seed unless within 1 year the following
data and information were submitted:
1. Data on the residues of concern in or on corn seed treated with captan at the maximum allowable rate and detreated
by an acceptable process. Data were required on residues of concern both before and after detreatment. Moreover,
EPA made clear that different methods of detreating would only be permitted under the regulation if data were presented
depicting residues resulting from each method. EPA required that the data must depict the influence of varying parameters
of the detreating process, such as rate of seed treatment, volume of water required, temperature employed, etc. Finally,
EPA explained that these data would be used to establish the acceptable conditions for detreating by each method.
2. An acceptable method for informing corn seed treaters and corn seed distributors of acceptable methods for detreating
captan-treated corn seed must be proposed.
3. An acceptable handling procedure for captan-treated seed corn (to be detreated) to assure that there are no other
pesticides on the seed must be proposed.
Because no data or information were submitted over the next 3 years, on August 30, 1989 (54 FR 35897), EPA proposed to
revoke the food additive regulation on the grounds that there were insufficient data to support it. EPA received several
comments opposing the revocation, but none of the commenters submitted the data requested. EPA was not convinced
by any of the comments that the data were not necessary and, therefore, on August 4, 1993, it issued a final rule revoking
the tolerance.
On August 27, 1993, Ken Hunt of Ken's Roasting Service, Arcadia, Nebraska, filed objections to the revocation. Mr.
Hunt supplemented his objections on September 7, 1993. Mr. Hunt's primary objection is that detreatment of captan-treated
seed by roasting is safer than simply disposing of the seed. As support for this contention, Mr. Hunt claims that his
experience in feeding to his livestock seed that he has detreated has caused no harm to the livestock or to his family,
which has consumed meat from that livestock. Mr. Hunt also notes that tolerances for captan on various other crops,
such as grapes, are as high as 50 parts per million (ppm). Mr. Hunt submitted analytic sampling results from his detreated
corn which show that the tested corn contained low levels of captan (2 ppm or less). Mr. Hunt claims that he avoids detreating
seeds that contain pesticide residues other than captan by having his trucker check the labels on all seed that is picked
up for detreatment. Finally, Mr. Hunt asks if EPA would allow him to continue his operation for a few more years because
of the sizable investment he has put into it.
For the reasons below, EPA must deny Mr. Hunt's objections. Magnitude of residue data, such as were requested here,
are critical data in establishing or supporting tolerances and food additive regulations for pesticide residues.
As EPA's Pesticide Assessment Guidelines explain, ``[r]esidue chemistry data on processed food/feed are used by
the Agency to estimate the exposure of the general population to pesticide residues in foods (including animal commodities)
and for setting and enforcing food additive tolerances for pesticide residues in or on processed food/feed under
provisions of Section 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.'' (Pesticide Assessment Guidelines, Subdivision
O, Addendum 4, p. 2 [MIS #PB88-117270, EPA 540/09-88-004 (Nov. 1987)].)
Without magnitude-of-residue data, EPA cannot make accurate exposure estimates and hence risk estimates also will
be inaccurate. The anecdotal information supplied by Mr. Hunt cannot substitute for safety evaluations made on the
basis of valid scientific data. Additionally, magnitude-of-residue data allow EPA to establish enforcement levels
in tolerances and food additive regulations that are representative of the residue levels that will be found under
proper pesticide use patterns. If tolerances and food additive regulations are set at levels exceeding what could
be expected from normal usage, then pesticide users might be encouraged to apply pesticides without strict regard
to label requirements or not to follow proper detreatment procedures. If tolerances and food additive regulations
are set too low, then otherwise safe food may be seized by the Food and Drug Administration or Department of Agriculture.
It is true that several foods have captan tolerances at levels exceeding the levels Mr. Hunt has reported in his detreated
corn, but those tolerances are supported by residue data and the safety of those tolerances has been evaluated based
on those data, consumption pattern data, and information on exposure from other uses of captan. If residue data had
been submitted for detreated corn, a similar analysis could have been performed for the food additive regulation
at issue.
The sampling results submitted by Mr. Hunt are no substitute for the magnitude-of-residue data requested. They represent
a single detreatment method under unspecified conditions. Several summary analysis reports are given, indicating
residues on detreated corn ranging from less than 0.01 ppm to 2.6 ppm. The analytical methods are not specified, and
no method validation data were included. Moreover, no data were provided on the same corn prior to detreatment. The
data are of the type that a business might use to monitor quality control in its process, but the data are totally inadequate
for fulfilling residue chemistry data requirements. Mr. Hunt appears to follow a careful procedure for not detreating
seed containing other than captan residues, but this alone is not grounds for maintaining the food additive regulation.
Finally, EPA recognizes that Mr. Hunt may have a sizable investment in his operation, but tolerances and food additive
regulations are rules of national application, and Mr. Hunt's investment cannot justify maintaining the legality
of these pesticide residues nationwide.
Accordingly, the objections are denied. This Order is issued under FFDCA section 409(f) and is subject to judicial
review as provided in FFDCA section 409(g).

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Deletion of the Ringwood Mines/Landfill Site from the National Priorities List.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region II announces the deletion of the Ringwood Mines/Landfill site
(Site) from the National Priorities List (NPL). The NPL constitutes appendix B of 40 CFR part 300 which is the National
Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP), which EPA promulgated pursuant to Section 105 of
the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), as amended. EPA and the State
of New Jersey have determined that no further action is appropriate under CERCLA.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The site to be deleted from the NPL is: Ringwood Mines/Landfill Site, Ringwood Borough, New Jersey. 



A Notice of Intent to Delete for this Site was published in the 

Federal Register

, on December 8, 1993 (58 FR 64539). The closing date for comments on the Notice of Intent to Delete was January 7, 1993.
EPA has received no comments. Therefore there is no responsiveness summary.

The EPA identifies sites that appear to present a significant risk to public health, welfare, or the environment and
maintains the NPL as the list of those sites. Sites on the NPL may be the subject of remedial actions financed by the Hazardous
Substances Superfund Response Trust Fund (Fund). Pursuant to  300.425(e)(3) of the NCP, any site deleted from
the NPL remains eligible for Fund-financed remedial actions if conditions at the site warrant such action. Deletion
of a site from the NPL does not effect responsible party liability or impede agency efforts to recover costs associated
with response efforts.

Revised Procedures for Filing an Amateur Service License Application 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Communications Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This Order amends the amateur service rules to provide an electronic filing capability to the volunteer-examiner
coordinators (VECs), to clarify that amateur station and operator licensees are authorized as soon as the license
data is entered into the Commission's licensee data base, and to reflect other non-substantive procedural changes.
This action is necessary because recent modernization of the Commission's data processing capabilities makes it
possible to greatly reduce the time it takes for us to grant licenses in the amateur service, and all of the VECs have
notified us that they want to begin electronic filing of license application data as soon as possible. The intended
effect of this action is to allow successful license examinees to operate their amateur stations as soon as possible.
The text of the final rules is at the end of this document.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:





1. This is a summary of the Order adopted October 17, 1994, and released October 24, 1994. The complete text of this Order,
including the rule amendments, may also be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcription
Service, (202) 857-3800, 2100 M Street NW., Suite 140, Washington, DC 20037.

2. Accepting from the VECs electronically filed data from applications for new and upgraded amateur operator licenses,
will eliminate the time and effort required for the VECs to send, and for the Commission to receive, application documents
by mail. As part of their routine operations, the VECs enter the data from the application documents they receive into
an electronic form that can be sent at high speed over telephone lines to our license processing facility. This data
can be used as received so that our license processors could discontinue manually reentering the data into the processing
system. We have been making arrangements with the VECs to enable them to use electronic filing procedures similar
to those that have been implemented for certain private land mobile radio services. The FCC Form 610 has been revised
to accommodate electronic filing. VECs may also continue to send by mail to our license processing facility the application
documents. 

3. The decision to grant a license occurs when our license processing facility enters the data into the amateur service
licensee data base. Currently, however, the new licensee must delay beginning operation until a license document
can be printed, mailed, and delivered. This procedure can result in several weeks delay during which the licensee
cannot operate an amateur station. Fortunately, information technology is making our amateur service licensee
data base more widely available, thus diminishing the need for an amateur operator to hold a license document before
exercising the privileges authorized by the grant of the license. We are amending the rules, therefore, to authorize
operation on the basis of the licensee data appearing in the amateur service licensee data base. 

4. Beginning in 1995, our new system also will give us the capability to make a timely mailing to a licensee's address
of record a renewal short form, filled in and ready for signature. We are amending the rules to allow this form to be used.
Because we cannot be certain of delivery of the form to every licensee in every instance, however, we will also continue
to allow the Form 610 to be used for renewing licenses. 

5. We are also combining into  97.509 all of the administering volunteers examiner (VE) requirements that are
presently stated in four separate rule sections, and adding new  97.511, 

Examinee conduct, 

to emphasize that an examinee must comply with the instructions given by the administering VEs. Further, we are amending
 97.9 to treat Technician Plus as a license class. 

6. We certify that the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 does not apply to the amended rules because there will not
be any significant economic impact on a substantial number of small business entities, as defined by section 601(3)
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The amateur service may not be used to transmit communications for compensation,
for the pecuniary benefit of the station control operator or the station control operator's employer, or for communications,
on a regular basis, which could reasonably be furnished through other radio services. 

See 

47 CFR 97.113.

7. The Secretary shall send a copy of this 

Order, 

including the certification, to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration in accordance
with paragraph 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612
(1981). 

8. The Commission ordered that effective December 20, 1994, part 97 of the Commission's rules, 47 CFR part 97, IS AMENDED

2. Section 97.5 is revised to read as follows:


 97.5


Station license required.


(a) The person having physical control of the station apparatus must have been granted a station license of the type
listed in paragraph (b) of this section, or hold an unexpired document of the type listed in paragraph (c) of this section,
before the station may transmit on any amateur service frequency from any place that is:
(1) Within 50 km of the Earth's surface and at a place where the amateur service is regulated by the FCC;
(2) Within 50 km of the Earth's surface and aboard any vessel or craft that is documented or registered in the United
States; or
(3) More than 50 km above the Earth's surface aboard any craft that is documented or registered in the United States.
(b) The types of station licenses are:
(1) An operator/primary station license. One, but only one, operator/primary station license is granted to each
person who is qualified to be an amateur operator. The primary station license is granted together with the amateur
operator license. Except for a representative of a foreign government, any person who qualifies by examination is
eligible to apply for an operator/primary station license. The operator/primary station license document is printed
on FCC Form 660.

 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), DOT. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice amends Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 108 to specify that plastic materials used in reflex
reflectors show not more than 7 percent haze after a 3-year outdoor exposure test, a level at which haze becomes discernable
to the naked eye. This amendment will not change the stringency of the standard as it has been applied, but it will increase
its objectivity. NHTSA has not adopted its proposal that cumulative haze not exceed 7 percent when a plastic lens is
placed in front of a reflex reflector. Instead, the same haze criterion is applied to the reflex reflector and outer
lens material. This approach will limit cumulative haze to about the same level without the need to retest current
materials. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Sierra Products of Livermore, California (``Sierra'') filed a ``Petition to Amend FMVSS 108 Updating Weather &
Heat Testing of Vehicle Lights & Reflectors.'' In granting the petition, NHTSA considered that three principal
issues and several lesser issues merited public consideration and comment. An appropriate notice of proposed rulemaking
(NPRM) was published on March 9, 1993, and an opportunity afforded for comment (58 FR 13042). Its primary subject concerned
the permissibility of a minimum amount of haze. NHTSA noted that if any of the other issues merited the initiation of
rulemaking, a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking would follow. 



Comments on the NPRM were received from Trucklite, Truck Safety Equipment Institute (TSEI), American Automobile
Manufacturers Association (AAMA), 3M, Chrysler Corporation, Ford Motor Company, General Motors Corporation (GM),
Japan Auto Parts Industries Association (JAPIA), Peterson Manufacturing, Thomas Loughran, and General Electric
Plastics (GEP). 



1. Haze Limit for Reflex Reflectors 



The principal issue of the NPRM concerned the permissible amount of haze after outdoor exposure testing of reflex
reflectors. S5.1.2 of Standard No. 108 establishes requirements for plastic materials used for optical parts such
as lenses and reflectors. One of the requirements (subsection (c)) is that plastic materials used for reflex reflectors
shall meet the appearance requirements of paragraph 4.2.2 of SAE Recommended Practice J576c, May 1970, after the
3-year exposure test specified in the Recommended Practice. Paragraph 4.2.2 states in pertinent part that ``The
exposed samples, when compared with the unexposed control samples, shall not show * * * haze * * *.''
Whether a sample shows haze has traditionally been determined by whether haze is visible to the naked eye. However,
all plastics will develop an amount of haze during the weathering test that may not be visible to the naked eye, but which
is measurable by instrumentation. 

General Electric, the manufacturer of ``Lexan,'' a polycarbonate plastic resin used in reflex reflectors, has stated
that its polycarbonate plastic will not pass the weathering test for reflector material unless the reflex reflector
manufacturer coats the finished product with an optical coating approved by GE. In its latest revision of J576, SAE
has replaced the visual inspection criterion for haze with a 7-percent haze limit for measurement with a hazometer.
The committee recommending the change considered the new procedure equivalent to the previous practice but more
objective. Properly coated polycarbonates develop about 6 percent haze, and acrylics develop about 3 percent haze
in exposure tests conducted in Florida. Such products are certified under the present test and will remain in compliance.
NHTSA notes that 7 percent haze is not difficult to discern visually.

Neither Standard No. 108 nor SAE J576c ``requires'' coating, although that process may, in fact, be the most practicable
way to meet the requirements of both. The present requirement may imply the absence of haze after weathering, but an
absolute requirement of zero haze is neither practicable nor appropriate. Industry studies used by the SAE Lighting
Committee have demonstrated that degradation of reflex reflector performance can be limited to less than 17 percent
by preventing haze in excess of 7 percent, but that degradation increases rapidly with further haze to a loss of over
80 percent of initial performance at 21 percent haze. To control reflex reflector degradation and to make the haze
test more objective, the SAE amended its Recommended Practice to establish a maximum allowable limit of 7 percent
haze for plastics used for reflex reflectors. 

The proposal was opposed by AAMA, Ford, Chrysler, GM, and JAPIA. AAMA (supported in these views by Ford, Chrysler,
GM, and GEP) believes that the rulemaking is premature for two reasons. The first is that ``the agency has not identified
any safety problem arising from inadequacies'' in the existing requirement. The second is that ``there is no currently
available information [to motor vehicle manufacturers] that relates haze test data for plastic materials currently
used to the performance of reflex reflectors.'' It recommended that the agency withdraw its NPRM and issue an ANPRM
on the subject. The comments of JAPIA were similar in that it requested an effective date for the final rule 5 years after
its issuance to review its appropriateness. 

NHTSA disagrees that the rulemaking is premature. The purpose of the rulemaking is to ensure that an existing requirement
will more closely conform to that portion of the statutory definition of a Federal motor vehicle safety standard that
it ``provides objective criteria.'' (15 U.S.C. 1391(2)). The ``inadequacy'', to use AAMA's term, of the existing
requirement is that it is subjective. As for the second argument, the SAE considered industry data on reflector performance
with various haze filters fitted in front of a reflex reflector to quantify performance loss with increased haze,
and it reported a subjective demonstration test also using haze filters (haze filters were used in the experiments
rather than reflectors in various weathered states because reflector facets prevent the use of a hazeometer to measure
the degree of haze). NHTSA believes that the needs for safety are met by the current requirement that plastic materials
used in optical parts such as lenses meet the weathering test. Absent any treatment of the raw materials that affects
its ability to meet J576 (see discussion below), optical parts fashioned from complying plastic materials ought
to have the same haze resistance. 

AAMA also commented that the proposal would increase the stringency of haze requirements: ``[w]hereas the current
Standard calls for no visually-perceptible 

change

 in haze resulting from outdoor exposure, the proposed revision would set a limit on the 

total

 haze of the exposed sample. Even unexposed samples exhibit some measurable haze that would be additive to any incremental
haze produced by the three year outdoor exposure test.'' AAMA is not aware of any body of test data demonstrating whether
plastic materials used in current reflex reflectors are capable of meeting a post-exposure limit of 7 percent. 

The present requirement contained in 4.2.2 of SAE J576c states that ``the exposed samples, when compared with the
unexposed control samples, shall not show surface deterioration, crazing, haze, dimensional changes, color bleeding,
delamination, or loss of surface luster.'' The determination of surface deterioration, dimensional changes, and
color bleeding require comparison with control samples. But the SAE bases its interpretation of the haze requirement
on the premise that low levels of haze are invisible to the naked eye, and it is certainly inappropriate for the samples
to have visible haze before exposure. Therefore, the haze test is actually absolute; the only criterion is whether
the exposed sample has visible haze. The ``comparison'' of visible haze to invisible haze is nothing more than a determination
of the visible haze. Implicit in the visual test requirement is a mutually exclusive concept of haze_it is either visible
or it is not visible. The concept of relative haze has little meaning unless the instrumentation of the proposed method
of measurement is used.

NHTSA presumes that the certification of present materials is based on test data in the possession of material manufacturers.
It is likely that haze measurements as well as visual inspection have been performed on current materials following
exposure to weathering, but visual inspections alone should be sufficient. It is not difficult to detect 7 percent
haze visually and samples already found to endure weathering without the development of visually perceptible haze
are unlikely to have developed more than 7 percent haze. 

The proposal was supported by Trucklite, TSEI, and Peterson. They pointed out that the SAE Lighting Committee haze
task force unanimously recommended the 7 percent haze limit in part because it did not affect the use of plastic resins
currently employed for reflex reflectors. 

On balance, the agency has concluded that there is no demonstrable reason not to adopt the 7 percent haze limitation
for plastic materials used for reflex reflectors. 

The second part of the NPRM concerned a proposed cumulative haze limit of 7 percent when a plastic reflex reflector
is installed behind a plastic outer lens and not exposed directly to sunlight. This was based upon draft SAE language
and was opposed by the commenters. Subsequent to the NPRM the SAE modified its draft so that a cumulative haze limit
was an optional part of its specification. NHTSA has decided not to impose a cumulative haze limit of 7 percent, but
simply to adopt the same criterion (7 percent haze limit with direct exposure). Thus, S5.1.2(c) as amended by this
notice will apply the limit and other criteria to ``plastic materials used for reflex reflectors and for lenses used
in front of reflex reflectors.'' 

A comment from GE indicated that while uncoated ``Lexan'' would develop in excess of 30 percent haze in a Florida exposure
test, the addition of a glass covering lens would limit haze to 4 to 6 percent. GE also offered data to show that plastic
covering lenses provided similar benefits. In view of the vast reduction in ultraviolet exposure of inner reflectors
afforded by glass or plastic outer lenses, the agency concluded that acrylic and coated polycarbonate materials,
which experience less than 7 percent haze under direct exposure, would experience negligible haze when protected
by an outer lens. Therefore, it is not necessary to consider cumulative haze when material suitable for direct exposure
is used with a covering lens, also suitable for direct exposure.

NHTSA's decision not to adopt the cumulative haze provision should allay industry concerns regarding the lack of
test data to continue recertifying existing designs using covered reflex reflectors, but it may have the effect of
necessitating an optical coating on any polycarbonate reflex reflectors which previously relied on an outer lens
to prevent the formation of visible haze. 

The SAE haze task force had also considered applying the 7 percent haze limit to plastic headlamp lenses as well as reflex
reflectors, but it decided that more work was required to define the safety needs of headlamps. The revision of SAE
J576 left the headlamp lens requirement unchanged from previous versions. It states that ``plastic material used
for forward road illumination devices, excluding cornering lamps, shall show no deterioration.'' It is not clear
whether that specification is meant to be more restrictive than the 7 percent haze limit for reflectors, but it has
the same effect in practice as the visual inspection requirement had for reflex reflectors. 

NHTSA notes that in Standard No. 108, plastic lenses of replaceable bulb headlamps are subject to an abrasion resistance
test, and that most, if not all, lenses must be given an abrasion resistant coating to meet it. It has been the agency's
assumption that the hard coating would also protect headlamps lenses against excessive haze. Standard No. 108 does
not require the abrasion test for plastic sealed beam headlamps, but NHTSA believes that it is industry practice to
coat plastic sealed beam lamps. To pursue the subject of haze limitations for headlamp lens material, NHTSA requested
that commenters address five specific issues. Ford was the sole commenter on the first four issues. These issues and
Ford's comments follow: 

(1) Whether there are any replaceable bulb headlamps with plastic lenses that do not use a hard coating to achieve abrasion
resistance. 

Ford's headlamps of this type all employ a hard coating. 

(2) Whether all abrasion resistant coatings also prevent the formation of more than 7 percent haze on samples of plastics
used in headlamp lenses which are subjected to the 3-year test. 

In Ford's experience, coatings prevent formation of haze that exceeds 7 percent. 

(3) Whether there are any sealed beam headlamps with plastic lenses that do not use a hard coating for either haze or
abrasion resistance. 

Ford used headlamps of this type in two model lines for one model year each a decade and a half ago. The lamps used an acrylic
coating to prevent yellowing of the polycarbonate lens.

<PARENT> FR941102-0-00021 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(4) Whether the adoption of a 7 percent haze limit for plastic headlamp lenses would create a burden on industry, and
if so, the nature and severity of the burden. 

Ford does not believe that it would create a burden ``except possibly for some initial additional testing.'' 
(5) Whether the industry favors harmonization of Standard No. 108 with SAE J576 for haze resistance of plastic headlamp
lens materials. 
Ford and another commenter, Truck-Lite, supported application of Standard No. 108 to materials for plastic headlamp
lenses, albeit with the more recent versions of SAE J576, those of 1986 and 1991. 
It appears that the abrasion resistance requirements for replaceable bulb headlamps and the industry practice of
hard coating sealed beams already act to prevent haze on plastic headlamp lenses that exceed 7 percent. NHTSA remains
interested in any SAE attempts to establish an appropriate haze criterion for headlamp lenses, but it appears that
there is no safety need for rulemaking at present. 



2. Thermal Degradation of Acrylic Reflex Reflectors 



Sierra also claimed that current weathering tests do not address the loss of reflector performance for causes other
than haze. It criticized the agency for deleting the lens warpage test in 1973 which regulated distortion from heat.
Before then, Standard No. 108 incorporated the heat test of SAE Standard J575d which consisted of operating a lamp
for one hour in a chamber heated to 120 degrees F. The lamp would reach a temperature higher than that from the heat of
the filament. At the conclusion of the test, no warpage could result that would ``affect the proper functioning of
the device.'' Since the requirement was ambiguous, NHTSA eliminated it. However, in light of Sierra's complaint,
NHTSA has reviewed the matter. When the heat test was deleted, the principal concern of the test seemed to be gross distortions
of through-optic lenses. It appears that the heat damage to a lens with an integral reflex reflector was not considered.

There are limited data indicating that acrylic reflex reflectors may suffer from heat degradation. The General Electric
Company (GE) has reported (NHTSA Docket No. 108-PRM-000015-01) a weathering test in Florida in
which amber and yellow acrylic reflex reflectors decreased in specific intensity by 18 to 32 percent after an exposure
of one year, regardless of the angle of exposure. GE attributed the decrease in photometric performance to minute
distortions of the reflex lens (which the industry calls ``creep'') which occurred when the plastics were exposed
to direct sunlight (temperatures of 150 to 160 degrees F). 
In view of this test, NHTSA sought comments on the potential problem of heat degradation of acrylic plastic reflex
reflectors. NHTSA requested commenters to address the following: 
(1) Whether the commenter has test or other data relating to the performance of acrylic reflectors after exposure
to heat. 
(2) The threshold temperatures for creep and stress relaxation for acrylic plastics used for lamp lenses. 
(3) Whether creep will stabilize or continue indefinitely. 
(4) The maximum temperature acrylic lenses may endure without experiencing visible deformation. 
(5) The length of exposure required for stability at slightly over the threshold temperature and at the maximum temperature
stated in response to (4). 
(6) The maximum loss of photometric performance to be expected if the creep and stress relaxation eventually stabilize.

(7) The maximum operating temperature of multiple function rear lamps on passenger cars, trucks, and trailers under
realistic extreme conditions. 
(8) Whether integral reflex reflectors would degrade under the conditions stated in response to (7).

<TEXT>
 

(9) The test procedures that would be effective and practicable for testing reflectors and lamps with integral reflectors
for the purpose of detecting which devices would degrade significantly in service. 
Comments were received from TSEI, Peterson, 3M, Ford, and Trucklite. They reported that acrylic devices are designed
to operate up to about 170 degrees F and that stress relaxation begins at about 180 degrees. A heat test of plastic samples
at 175 degrees F is incorporated by reference in Standard No. 108. The amount of distortion experienced at temperatures
between 180 and 200 degrees F depends on the residual stress at the particular location, and the speed at which it stabilizes
depends on the temperature. Unlike haze, creep is not indefinitely progressive; stabilization occurs in a matter
of hours at elevated temperature. 
All lamp manufacturers reported using a heat warpage test of some sort, even though no longer required by Standard
No. 108. Some test more stringently than SAE J575d. Some commenters reported using photometric testing after a heat
warpage test while others used a visual examination (the method set forth in SAE J575d). Peterson reported that acrylic
lenses with reflectors subjected to SAE J575d show less than 5 percent losses in photometric brightness. 
The agency eliminated the warpage test because it did not deem it required for safety. The degradation of acrylic reflectors
alleged by Sierra would not be detected under SAE J575d which specifies a visual inspection. 
Creep would affect a reflex reflector in a way fundamentally different from haze. Haze reduces the brightness of the
reflector at all light entrance angles. Creep may cause the reflex reflector to lose brightness at some angles while
gaining brightness at other angles. It appears unlikely that the loss of brightness reported by General Electric
was the result of creep. GE did not test the acrylic reflectors thoroughly enough to make well founded conclusions
about their performance. 
In sum, there is no evidence that reflex reflectors degrade before other visible damage occurs. 



3. Dye Loss of Acrylic Reflectors and Lenses 


Sierra claimed that the weathering test of Standard No. 108 is inadequate because complying red and amber acrylic
lenses lose their color in use. NHTSA responded that the breakdown of the dye may not be a property of the plastic but
of the dye itself. Dyes with higher temperature tolerance are frequently used in polycarbonate products because
they may be designed for higher temperature applications than acrylic products, but there is no property of acrylic
plastic which contributes to fading. NHTSA understands, however, that the SAE adopted the three-year test when plastic
began to replace glass because of some concern that plastic would not be as fade resistant as glass. 
NHTSA requested that commenters provide information on the following: 
(1) Whether the commenter has test or other data relating to fading or loss of dye color in acrylic or polycarbonate
lenses through exposure to heat or weathering. 
(2) Whether any data exist indicating that acrylic or polycarbonate lenses fade or do not fade under realistic operating
conditions.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941102-0-00080 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941102-0-00021 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(3) The conditions under which fading could be expected. 

(4) Whether there is any reason to believe that acrylic lenses are more subject to this type of degradation than polycarbonate
lenses. 

(5) Whether the commenter has observed faded lenses in service and, if so, what views the commenter has about the cause
of the fading. 

(6) Whether the three-year test of SAE J576, conducted in Florida and Arizona, is sufficient to identify plastic materials
prone to fade in color. 

(7) The kind of test procedure that would be effective and practicable for testing lenses or plastic materials used
in lenses to detect any propensity to fade significantly in service. 

Comments were received from TSEI, Peterson, 3M, Ford, Trucklite, and Thomas Loughran. The commenters believe that
the three year weathering test of SAE J576 is adequate to identify plastic materials that are prone to fading. Acrylic
materials do not appear to have a greater tendency to fade than polycarbonate materials. Peterson has observed that
dyes used in acrylic material darken slightly as a result of sustained exposure to sunlight. TSEI reported that the
only faded lenses in service which have been observed by its membership have been identified as made of noncomplying
materials. Mr Loughran suggested that faded lenses result from the practice of blending virgin and reground material
with additional dye at the time of molding. 

Ford suggested that a modified xenon accelerated weathering test would be effective for testing colored plastic
materials for their propensity to fade in service. This test would be configured to correlate with the three year weathering
test. The object of accelerated testing with xenon lamps would be increased productivity rather than increased accuracy
of detection. 

The comments were unanimous in supporting the existing rule as an effective and sufficient test for dye loss of lamp
and reflector materials. However, it appears from Mr. Loughran's comment that the uncontrolled use of reground material
and added dye can create noncomplying plastic material to a greater degree than the lamp industry recognizes. NHTSA
believes that the fading problem observed by the petitioner is the likely result of lamp manufacturing practices
brought to its attention by Mr. Loughran. Accordingly, there appears to be no reason to change the present weathering
test. 

With respect to Mr. Loughran's comments, NHTSA takes this opportunity to present its views on the obligations of a
manufacturer of reflex reflectors. The haze requirement is imposed by S5.1.2 upon ``plastic materials used in optical
parts''. SAE Standard J594f ``Reflex Reflectors'' January 1977 as incorporated into Standard No. 108 at 3.2 references
the plastic material test of SAE J576. This imposes an obligation upon the manufacturer of a reflex reflector to use
plastic materials meeting J576. Thus, the manufacturer has an obligation to ensure that its acts do nothing to negate
the conformance of the raw material with the tests of J576 when it is fashioned into reflectors. 

A weathering test performed by NHTSA and comments to the docket suggest that lamp manufacturers need to take care that
their coating practices actually meet the specifications used by plastic manufacturers to certify material properties.
NHTSA's test included coated and uncoated ``Lexan'' samples exposed in Florida and Arizona. The uncoated samples
failed the test visually as well as by the development of more than 7 percent haze before the end of the first year at both
exposure sites. At the end of the second year, the coated Arizona sample had developed slightly less than 7 percent
haze, but haze was plainly visible. The coated Florida sample had failed in both respects with 10.5 percent haze after
a two-year exposure. Its uncoated mate had developed 10.3 percent haze in one year. At the end of the third year, the
large haze reductions of the coated specimens, seen after one- and two-years exposure, had disappeared. Both Arizona
specimens had slightly less than 20 percent haze and both Florida specimens had slightly more than 30 percent haze.
The 24-month results were available at the time of the NPRM and were placed in the docket.

<PARENT> FR941102-0-00021 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

TSEI and Peterson commented on the 24-month test results, and Thomas Loughran's comment is relevant to cases of premature
degradation. TSEI and Peterson consider the failure of coated sample to be an anomaly, uncharacteristic of the performance
of all other coated polycarbonates in their experience. In their view, the failure is due to a faulty coating. Peterson
suggested that either the coating thickness or the curing process was not performed in accordance with the plastic
manufacturer's specifications. The rapid surface degradation of both coated samples occurring in the period between
24 and 36 months exposure and the apparent flaking of the coating of the Arizona 18-month specimen support Peterson's
opinion of faulty coating. 

Mr. Loughran was concerned that coated polycarbonates may not meet the 7 percent haze limit either as samples or as
finished products. He cited knowledge of Arizona exposure tests in which coated polycarbonate reflectors suffered
60 percent to 70 percent losses in reflective performance, and he suggested testing of finished products as well as
material. 

Mr. Loughran's experience appears to be at odds with the confidence of TSEI, Peterson, Trucklite, and the SAE haze
task force that coated polycarbonate plastic will haze less than 7 percent in a 3-year exposure test. However, it is
likely that departures from virgin material and poor coating practices can combine to cause inferior performance
in products nominally made from certified materials. 

These data suggest the beneficent effect of coating on polycarbonate plastic will not be sufficiently durable to
meet the performance certified after the material unless the material manufacturer's recommendations are followed
rigorously. While the presence of some coating material does not guarantee compliance, the absence of coating seems
to ensure that plastics such as polycarbonates will quickly fail the haze test. Use of coatings with a tint element
visible under an ultraviolet inspection light affords a simple, practicable way for regulatory bodies such as NHTSA
to discern whether relevant plastic materials have been coated. The 3-year test period appears to be unnecessarily
long in those instances where test failures occur long in advance, such as samples that manifest haze at the end of an
exposure of only a year's duration. Failure to tint, and premature hazing afforded a basis upon which NHTSA can determine
noncompliance without having to complete pro forma the 3-year test period and unnecessarily delay the remedy of a
noncompliant product. 



4. Miscellaneous Issues 



3M suggested that a test measuring reflective brightness before and after exposure of retroreflective devices be
established as an alternative to haze testing so that sheeting material devices could qualify as reflex reflectors.
No specific test procedures or criteria were included in the comment. Because this issue is beyond the scope of the
present rulemaking, it could not be not considered in formulating the final rule. 



Rulemaking Analyses 



Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures



This rulemaking action has not been considered under E.O. 12866. NHTSA has considered the impacts of this rulemaking
action and has determined that it is not significant under Department of Transportation regulatory policies and
procedures. The stringency of the haze requirement would not be changed. Further, manufacturers of plastic materials
are currently measuring the haze of weathered samples by ASTM D 1003, which will govern the certification to the 7 percent
haze limit. In addition, according to the agency's observation that haze not detectable by the human eye is also less
than 7 percent, conformance of a reflector with the haze requirement could still be judged with the naked eye. Impacts
of the final rule are, therefore, be so minimal as not to warrant preparation of a full regulatory evaluation. 



Regulatory Flexibility Act



The agency has also considered the effects of this rulemaking action in relation to the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
I certify that this rulemaking action would not have a significant economic effect upon a substantial number of small
entities. Manufacturers of plastic materials are generally not small businesses within the meaning of the Regulatory
Flexibility Act. Further, small organizations and governmental jurisdictions would not be significantly affected
as the price of new motor vehicles 
should not be impacted. Accordingly, no Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has been prepared.

Executive Order 12612 (Federalism)



This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 on
``Federalism.'' It has been determined that the rulemaking action does not have sufficient federalism implications
to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 



National Environmental Policy Act



NHTSA has analyzed this rulemaking action for purposes of the National Environmental Policy Act. The rulemaking
action would not have a significant effect upon the environment. 



Civil Justice Reform



This rule would not have any retroactive effect. Under 49 U.S.C. 30103 (formerly section 103(d) of the National Traffic
and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1392(d)), whenever a Federal motor vehicle safety standard is in effect, a
state may not adopt or maintain a safety standard applicable to the same aspect of performance which is not identical
to the Federal standard. Forty-nine U.S.C. 30161 (formerly Section 105 of the Act (15 U.S.C. 1394)) sets forth a procedure
for judicial review of final rules establishing, amending, or revoking Federal motor vehicle safety standards.
That section does not require submission of a petition for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings
before parties may file suit in court.

Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Emergency Reclassification of the Snake River Spring/Summer Chinook
Salmon and the Snake River Fall Chinook Salmon From Threatened to Endangered Status 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Emergency rule.

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Fish and Wildlife Service is reclassifying the Snake River spring/summer chinook salmon (

Oncorhynchus tshawytscha

) and the Snake River fall chinook salmon from threatened to endangered status under the emergency provisions of the
Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act). This reflects a determination by the National Marine Fisheries Service, which
has jurisdiction for these species, that the species warrant emergency reclassification based on a projected decline
in adult Snake River chinook salmon abundance. This determination by NMFS was published in the August 18, 1994, 

Federal Register

. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Under the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.), and in accordance with Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1970,
the National Marine Fisheries Services (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Department of
Commerce, is responsible for the Snake River spring/summer and fall chinook salmon. Under section 4(a)(2) of the
Act, NMFS must decide whether a species under its jurisdiction should be classified as endangered or threatened.
The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) is responsible for the actual addition, deletion and amendment of the List
of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife in 50 CFR 17.11(h) (List). 



NMFS published its determination of threatened status for the Snake River spring/summer chinook salmon and the Snake
River fall chinook salmon on April 22, 1992 (57 FR 14653). Accordingly, the Service added the species to the List on
September 23, 1993 (58 FR 49880). On August 18, 1994, NMFS published an emergency interim rule in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 42529) reclassifying the Snake River spring/summer chinook salmon and the Snake River fall chinook salmon
from threatened to endangered status based on new data that indicates that critically low salmon returns are expected
for 1994. 
Accordingly, the Service is amending the List, pursuant to the emergency provisions of section 4(b)(7) of the Act,
to reflect the revised status. 

During the 240 days this emergency rule is in effect, NMFS will initiate and complete a rulemaking (with a public comment
period) to extend the reclassification of Snake River spring/summer and fall chinook salmon to endangered status
under the Act until such time as reclassification or delisting is warranted. This action of the Service to amend the
List in accordance with the determination by NMFS is nondiscretionary. Therefore, in view of the public comment period
that will be provided by NMFS on the proposed reclassification, the Service finds that good cause exists to omit the
notice and public comment procedures of 5 U.S.C. 553(b) and to make this action effective on August 18, 1994, the date
of publication of NMFS' emergency interim rule, waiving the 30-day effective date provision of 5 U.S.C. 553(d). 



National Environmental Policy Act 



The Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment, as defined under the authority of the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuant to section 4(a) of the Endangered
Species Act of 1973, as amended. A notice outlining the Service's reasons for this determination was published in
the 

Federal Register

 on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244).

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Closure.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS closes the fishery for live rock in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) off the southern Atlantic states. This action
is necessary to prevent exceeding the 1994 harvest quota.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Coral and coral reefs in the EEZ off the southern Atlantic states and in the Gulf of Mexico are managed under the Fishery
Management Plan for Coral and Coral Reefs of the Gulf of Mexico and the South Atlantic (FMP). The FMP was prepared by
the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic Fishery Management Councils and is implemented through regulations at 50 CFR
part 638 under the authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act.


Under an emergency interim rule effective through September 26, 1994 (59 FR 32938, June 27, 1994), and extended through
December 25, 1994 (59 FR 47563, September 16, 1994), NMFS established a 1994 harvest quota of 485,000 lb (219,992 kg)
for live rock in the EEZ off the southern Atlantic states. Section 638.28(d) of that emergency interim rule requires
the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA), to close the live rock fishery in the EEZ off the southern Atlantic
states when the 1994 harvest quota is reached, or is projected to be reached.
The AA has determined that the quota will be reached on October 31, 1994. Accordingly, the live rock fishery in the South
Atlantic EEZ is closed effective 12:01 a.m., local time, November 1, 1994, through December 25, 1994, the end of the
period of effectiveness of the emergency interim rule. During the closure, live rock may not be harvested or possessed
in the EEZ off the southern Atlantic states, and the purchase, barter, trade, and sale of live rock in or from the EEZ
off the southern Atlantic states is prohibited. The latter prohibition does not apply to live rock that was harvested
prior to November 1, 1994.


Classification


This action is required by 50 CFR 638.28(d) and is exempt from review under E.O. 12866.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; correction.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document contains corrections to final regulations (I.D. 090892B), which were published Wednesday, October
5, 1994. The regulation established standard groundfish product types and standard product recovery rates for purposes
of managing the groundfish fisheries off Alaska.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On October 5, 1994 (59 FR 50699), NMFS published a final rule to implement a regulatory amendment establishing standard
groundfish product types and standard product recovery rates (PRRs) for purposes of managing the groundfish fisheries
off Alaska and specify certain product types and PRRs that may be used to calculate round-weight equivalents of pollock
for purposes of calculating amounts of pollock roe that may be retained onboard a vessel during the pollock fishery.
The final rule is to be effective November 4, 1994. In that rule, the amendatory instruction that revises  672.20
was inadvertently omitted.


Correction of Publication

Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Apportionment of reserve.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS is apportioning reserve to certain target species in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI).
This action is necessary to allow for ongoing harvest and account for previous harvest of the total allowable catch
(TAC).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The groundfish fishery in the U.S. BSAI exclusive economic zone is managed by NMFS according to the Fishery Management
Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery
Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels
is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675.


The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined that the initial TACs specified for Pacific ocean perch in the Bering
Sea subarea (BS), and for yellowfin sole and arrowtooth flounder in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management
area, need to be supplemented from the nonspecific reserve in order to continue operations and account for prior harvest.
Therefore, in accordance with  675.20(b), NMFS is apportioning from the reserve to TACs for the following species:
(1) For the BS-286 metric tons (mt) to Pacific ocean perch; (2) for the BSAI-22,549 mt to yellowfin sole and 1,500 mt
to arrowtooth flounder.
These apportionments are consistent with  675.20(a)(2)(i) and do not result in overfishing of a target species
or the ``other species'' category, because the revised TACs are equal to or less than specifications of acceptable
biological catch.


Classification


This action is taken under 50 CFR 675.20 and is exempt from review under E.O. 12866.
The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, has determined, under section 553(d)(3) of the Administrative
Procedure Act and 50 CFR 675.20(b)(2), that good cause exists for waiving the opportunity for public comment and the
30-day delayed effectiveness period for this action. Fisheries are currently taking place that will be supplemented
by this apportionment. Delaying the implementation of this action would be disruptive and costly to these ongoing
operations.

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Securities and Exchange Commission announces the adoption of Rule 11Ac1-3 and amendments to Rule 10b-10
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which, together, require enhanced disclosure of payment for order flow
practices on customer confirmations, and account statements, as well as upon opening new accounts. The new Rule and
amendments to Rule 10b-10 are designed to provide relevant information to customers regarding factors influencing
the routing of their orders. The new Rule and amendments to Rule 10b-10 also will serve to enhance investor protection
and further competition for retail orders by enabling customers to evaluate more effectively the markets to which
their orders are routed.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Executive Summary



On October 6, 1993, the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') proposed for comment amendments
to Rule 10b-10 (17 CFR 240.10b-10) and new Rule 11Ac1-3 (17 CFR 240.11Ac1-3) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') concerning payment for order flow practices.
 Taken together, those proposals were designed to improve information available to investors about their broker-dealer's
order routing practices, and whether the broker-dealer received market center
 inducements for routing unspecified order flow to them. These disclosures would occur when the investor opened an
account, annually thereafter, and on the required trade confirmations. In the Proposing Release, the Commission
invited commenters to address issues related to the proposals as well as alternative approaches to payment for order
flow, such as banning the practice outright, mandatory pass-through of payments to customers, and requiring exchanges,
national securities associations and broker-dealers to convert to decimal pricing.

The Commission received 53 comment letters concerning the proposals. Of those commenters, 31 supported the disclosure
approach and 17 opposed it.
 Many of the commenters supporting the approach offered suggestions to improve the effectiveness of disclosure.




The Commission is adopting the proposed disclosure approach as discussed below. The Commission believes this approach
will further the investor protection goals of the Act, and is consistent with the general philosophy underlying disclosure
that ``sunlight is the best disinfectant.''
 The Commission, in response to commenters' suggestions, has modified the proposed Rule and amendments to Rule 10b-10,
as described below.





The Commission is modifying Rule 11Ac1-3 and amendments to Rule 10b-10 as proposed, to include Nasdaq
Small-Cap and Over-The-Counter (``OTC'') Bulletin Board securities. The Commission also is modifying the proposed
amendments to Rule 10b-10 to limit the disclosure of payment for order flow on customer confirmations to a statement
that the broker or dealer receives payment for order flow. In addition, the Commission is revising proposed Rule 11Ac1-3
regarding customer account statements by requiring disclosure of the broker-dealer's policies for determining
where to route customer orders that are the subject of payment for order flow absent specific instructions from customers,
including a description of the extent to which orders can be executed at prices superior to the national best bid or
best offer (``NBBO'').
In a parallel action, the Commission is proposing for comment amendments to Rule 10b-10 and Rule 11Ac1-3
that would extend those Rules to the options market.
 In addition, the Commission is proposing for comment a requirement that broker-dealers disclose in writing, on confirmations,
upon opening new accounts and on annual disclosure statements, ranges of payment for order flow received on a per share
basis; and include, in new account documentation and on annual disclosure statements, an estimate of the aggregate
amount of payment for order flow received on an annual basis.
 The Commission also is proposing for comment a requirement that broker-dealers disclose whether they execute orders
as principal (``internalize'') or route orders to an affiliated broker-dealer or exchange specialist for execution
and, a requirement that broker-dealers quantify and disclose information about internalized/affiliate practices.
 The Commission further is proposing for comment a requirement that broker-dealers disclose their order routing
practices regardless of whether the broker-dealer received payment for order flow or engaged in internalized/affiliate
practices. The Companion Release also solicits comment on expanding the definition of payment for order flow.

II. Basis and Purpose of the Rule


The practice of paying for order flow has generated much debate and controversy
 regarding the potential benefits and harm to public investors and whether receipt and retention of payment for order
flow compromises a broker-dealer's duties to its customer.
 Congress has shown continuing interest in the resolution of that controversy.
 The history of that debate and other background information can be found in the Proposing Release.
 In their response to the Proposing Release, few commenters suggested that the Commission not act at all regarding
payment for order flow practices.
 Most commenters supported the disclosure approach, with modifications. These commenters suggested that payment
for order flow practices are a mechanism for competition among market centers for order flow. Many commenters argued
that there is no harm in these practices. Others argued that disclosure to the customer adequately would address any
perceived conflict of interest.








As noted in the Proposing Release, payment for order flow may result in lower execution costs, facilitate technological
advances in retail customer order handling practices and facilitate competition among broker-dealers and securities
markets. At the same time, however, the practice raises concern as to whether the customer is being treated fairly.
Specifically, payment for order flow raises concerns about whether a firm is meeting its obligation of best execution
to its customer. Not all market centers expose market orders to other order flow or attempt to improve the price at which
market orders are executed. Thus, the decision to route an unpriced order to a market center offering immediate execution
at the NBBO, could mean that the customer has lost an opportunity for execution at a superior price because of the lack
of exposure to other order flow.
 For the reasons discussed below, the Commission believes disclosure that payment for order flow has been received
and a description of whether the customer's order has an opportunity for price improvement will enhance investor
protection and provide customers with information to evaluate more effectively the markets to which their orders
are routed.




III. Discussion


The Rules adopted today represent a tiered approach to disclosure of payment for order flow practices in the broader
context of broker-dealer order handling practices and the special relationship that already exists between a broker-dealer
and its customer.
 The components of the Rules include disclosure at the time an account is opened, annually thereafter, and on the transaction
confirmation.

<DOCNO> FR941102-0-00092 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941102-0-00026 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

First, the Rules adopted today require broker-dealers to inform customers in writing, when a new account is opened,
about the dealer's policies regarding the receipt of payment for order flow, including whether payment for order
flow is received; and a detailed description of the nature of the compensation received. As discussed in greater detail
below, the new Rule and Rule amendments require that broker-dealers provide information in account opening documents
about order routing decisions in orders subject to payment for order flow, including an explanation of the extent
to which unpriced orders can be executed at prices superior to the displayed NBBO at the time the order is received.
Second, the Rules adopted today require dealers to update this information and to provide such information annually
to all customers. Taken together, this information should assist customers in assessing the quality of trade executions
they receive and encourage broker-dealers to consider the opportunity for price improvement in establishing order
routing arrangements. Finally, the Rules adopted today require broker-dealers to indicate on confirmations whether
the broker or dealer receives payment for order flow, and the availability of further information on request. These
are described in greater detail below, beginning with the scope of securities subject to the Rules and the types of
inducements covered by the Rules.


A. Securities Subject to Disclosure Obligations and Definition of Payment for Order Flow


1. Securities Subject to Disclosure Obligations


As proposed, the obligations of both Rule 11Ac1-3 and the amendments to Rule 10b-10 were limited to orders
in national market system securities. The Commission requested comment on whether both Rules should be extended
to Nasdaq Small-Cap and OTC Bulletin Board Securities.
 Commenters addressing this issue supported the inclusion of both and, accordingly, the Commission is expanding
Rule 11Ac1-3 and amendments to Rule 10b-10 to include these securities. As revised, both Rules would include
``any subject security as defined in  240.11Ac1-2 or a security authorized for quotation on an automated
interdealer quotation system that has the characteristics set forth in Section 17B of the Act * * *.''






The Commission believes that inclusion of these securities provides customers with the best picture of a broker-dealer's
policies regarding the routing of customer orders and the receipt of payment for order flow. As discussed in the Proposing
Release,
 the practice of payment for order flow originated in the OTC market, and since then has been routinely used as a competitive
tool in that market. Payments for Nasdaq and OTC Bulletin Board stocks, moreover, are generally greater than for exchange-listed
national market system securities.
 Accordingly, the Commission believes that the disclosure protections should be extended to the OTC market.





2. Definition of Payment for Order Flow


As proposed, Rule 10b-10(e)(9) defined payment for order flow broadly, to include all forms or arrangements
compensating for directing order flow. The Commission received 23 comment letters addressing the scope of the definition.
The majority of these commenters were supportive of the Commission's efforts and agreed that non-cash inducements
for order flow are economically equivalent to, and have the same effect as, cash payments for order flow. Opponents
of the proposed definition, which include most of the exchanges, argued that rebates and fee reductions are structurally
different from other cash payments and should be excluded from ``monetary'' payment for order flow.
 The Commission has considered all the comments, and for the reasons discussed below, believes that the items enumerated
in Rule 10b-10(e)(9) appropriately include arrangements involving payment for order flow.





</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941102-0-00093 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941102-0-00026 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Rule 10b-10(e)(9) defines payment for order flow to include any monetary payment, service, property, or any
other benefit that results in remuneration, compensation or consideration to a broker or dealer in return for the
routing of customer orders. Broker-dealers should examine order routing arrangements carefully, with a view toward
determining whether the firm has received some form of remuneration as a result of routing orders to that market. As
noted, payment for order flow includes non-monetary compensation, such as clearing services or reciprocal order
swapping arrangements. It is the Commission's view that monetary and non-monetary inducements are alternative
methods of payment to attract order flow and are economically equivalent.
 As such, non-cash remuneration is as likely to influence the broker's order routing decision as cash. In addition,
as is the case with monetary payments, the customer is unlikely to be aware of many of these practices. Thus, the net
effect of non-monetary arrangements is not appreciably different than that of monetary payment for order flow. Therefore,
the Commission concludes that non-monetary payment for order flow should be included in the definition and should
be subject to the regulatory treatment set forth in the proposal.





Payment for order flow also includes any credit, rebate, or discount against execution fees that exceeds the fee charged
for executing the order.
 It is the Commission's view that although SRO fee schedules are reviewed by the Commission under section 19(b) of the
Act and appear in the 

Federal Register

, the connection between these fee arrangements and a member firm's order routing practices may not be known or apparent
to that firm's customers. Moreover, it is possible for an exchange to adjust its fee schedule for members routing orders
to provide the economic equivalent of payment for order flow. The existence of such remuneration to the firm, whether
in the form of monetary payments or other benefits, should be disclosed directly to customers.







B. New Account and Annual Disclosures



The Commission is adopting Rule 11Ac1-3 to require broker-dealers to provide to customers information regarding
their payment for order flow practices when a new account is opened and to all customers annually. The Commission is
modifying the Rule to require a description of the broker-dealer's policies for determining where to route customer
orders that are subject to payment for order flow absent specific instructions from customers, including a description
of the extent to which orders can be executed at prices superior to the NBBO.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941102-0-00094 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941102-0-00026 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In sum, the revised Rule requires broker-dealers to disclose whether they receive payment for order flow. If any type
of payment for order flow is received, the broker-dealer must provide a detailed description of the nature of the compensation
received and, as discussed below, information about the routing of unspecified orders and whether those orders can
be executed at prices better than the NBBO at the time the order is received.



1. Order Routing and Best Execution



To the extent that market center structures differ materially in the opportunity for unpriced orders to be executed
at prices that are superior to the NBBO, the receipt of payment for order flow could be viewed as improperly affecting
a dealer's determination regarding where to route customer orders and the dealer's ability to satisfy its best execution
obligation, if the dealer does not provide as good an overall opportunity for best execution as it would without the
payment for order flow.
 In particular, this could happen when dealers decide to route orders to a market center which does not provide an opportunity
for price improvement, although other factors such as the size of the order, speed of execution, and the costs and difficulty
associated with achieving best execution in a particular market may negate this conclusion.
 The Commission noted in the Proposing Release that broker-dealers are under a duty to seek the ``best execution''
of their customer's orders.
 Broker-dealers accepting remuneration from a market center for directing order flow to that market center are still
obligated to fulfill their duty of best execution to their customers.
 The Commission understands that most firms that pay for order flow guarantee, at a minimum, executions at the NBBO.
As stated in the Proposing Release, such so-called quote-derived executions in many ways are not materially different
from automated execution systems operated by the regional exchanges for years. While automated execution systems
offer fast and assured executions to customers, orders sent to an exchange for manual handling and orders sent to an
OTC dealer for manual (or in some cases automated) handling may have a greater opportunity for an execution between
the spread than do orders that are routed to a quote-based automated execution system.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941102-0-00095 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941102-0-00026 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Commission traditionally has concluded that a broker-dealer routing customer orders for automated execution
could satisfy its best execution obligations so long as the broker-dealer assesses periodically the quality of competing
markets to ensure that its order flow is directed to markets providing the most advantageous terms for its customers'
orders.
 Nevertheless, the Commission's staff recently has warned against presuming that guaranteed executions at the best
bid or offer always will satisfy the broker-dealer's best execution duties for small orders in listed securities.
 For example, as a general matter, trades in listed securities routed to an exchange will be exposed to other public
orders or interest in the trading crowd, with the possibility that the order may receive a price that is better than
the existing quotations (so-called ``price improvement''). Most regional exchanges, for example, have incorporated
order exposure features into their small order routing and execution systems with a view toward offering price improvement.








The Commission believes that the possibility for price improvement, while not the exclusive factor, bears on the
question of whether a broker-dealer is fulfilling its duty to seek best execution, especially when payment is received
by the broker-dealer in return for guaranteeing order flow.
 Although it may be impractical for a broker or dealer that handles a heavy volume of orders to make an individual determination
regarding where to route each order it receives, the broker or dealer must use due diligence to seek the best execution
possible given all facts and circumstances. The Commission believes a broker or dealer must assess whether the order
flow in the aggregate, is receiving best execution and that a broker-dealer must not allow a payment or an inducement
for order flow to interfere with its efforts to obtain best execution. Accordingly, in light of a broker-dealer's
obligation to assess periodically the quality of the markets to which it routes packaged order flow absent specific
instructions from customers, the Commission does not believe such a broker-dealer violates its best execution obligation
merely because it receives payment for order flow.





In this connection, the Commission has taken several steps recently to expand the opportunity for customer market
orders to be executed at prices better than the NBBO at the time of receipt, including proposal of a Rule to require limit
order price protection in Nasdaq National Market securities.
 Nevertheless, considerable differences among market centers exist today. Accordingly, consistent with these
steps to help customers understand payment for order flow practices, and to facilitate fair competition among exchange
and non-exchange market centers, the Commission believes that it is appropriate to require broker-dealers to disclose
to customers their policies regarding where they route unspecified orders that are subject to payment for order flow.
 This provision requires a description of the extent to which orders so routed can be executed at prices superior to
the NBBO at the time the order is received. Dealers should explain, in simple terms, whether the market center to which
they route unspecified orders executes orders to purchase or sell at the NBBO and whether it provides an opportunity
for execution at prices superior to the NBBO.








2. Annual Disclosure



Several commenters opposed annual disclosure because it would duplicate the account opening disclosure and suggested
that the Commission require additional disclosure only upon a material change in the firm's policies. The Commission
is retaining the annual disclosure requirement because it believes this will serve to remind customers that evaluation
of a dealer's services involves more than a comparison of commission rates and to encourage broker-dealers to continue
to evaluate the quality of service they receive from market centers from which they receive payment for order flow.

3. Quantification of Monetary Payment for Order Flow


Over 20 commenters addressed the proposed requirement that broker-dealers inform customers annually about the
aggregate amount of monetary compensation received for routing order flow. The majority oppose the inclusion of
any aggregate value requirement.
 The Commission has determined to solicit further comment on this issue in the Companion Release because it believes
that aggregate information provides useful information to customers to evaluate the magnitude of payment for order
flow practices and whether such payments, taken as a whole, might affect adversely order routing determinations.
As discussed in the Companion Release, the Commission has determined to solicit further comment on this issue in conjunction
with its proposal to require valuation of all forms of payment for order flow because disclosure of monetary payment
for order flow without similar disclosures regarding non-monetary payment for order flow and internalization could
mislead investors or foster non-monetary payments or internalized/affiliate practices.




C. Customer Confirmation Statements


As proposed, amended Rule 10b-10(a)(7)(iii)
 required customer confirmations to disclose whether any payment for order flow has been received for a national market
system security and the amount of any monetary payment, discount, rebate or reduction of fee. More than 30 commenters
expressed concern about the proposed requirement that broker-dealers disclose on customer order confirmations
the amount of any monetary payment, discount, rebate or reduction of fee received in connection with a transaction
in a national market system security. Most of these commenters considered this unworkable.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941102-0-00097 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941102-0-00026 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In response to commenters' concerns, the Commission has modified the Rule to require a statement on order confirmations
that payment for order flow is received by the broker or dealer and that the source and nature of the payment for order
flow received in connection with the particular transaction will be furnished upon written request of the customer.
 The Commission has determined to allow broker-dealers to conform the statement to the firm's practices, for instance,
specifically noting that it limits the receipt of payment for order flow to market orders only, if applicable. Because
the definition of payment for order flow includes non-monetary forms of payment for order flow, broker-dealers will
be expected to include those forms of compensation in preparing confirmations and to provide the nature and source
of the compensation upon written request. The Commission believes that the Rule, as modified, retains informative
disclosure to investors.
 The Commission recognizes that information on the confirmation may not communicate all information of interest
to investors about payment for order flow or the quality of order execution. The role of the required disclosures on
the confirmation is more limited and is intended to inform customers about the existence of payment for order flow
practices and to confirm that which the customer, if interested, already should know about the broker's order handling
practices as a result of the new account and annual disclosure statements.








IV. Alternative Proposals




The Commission also solicited comment in the Proposing Release on alternative approaches to regulating the practice
of payment for order flow. The Commission invited commenters to address such alternatives as banning payment for
order flow and requiring the broker-dealers to pass payment for order flow through to their customers,
 and directing securities markets to convert quotations to decimal-based pricing from the current one-eigth fractions.
The Commission, however, has determined that these approaches are not the appropriate regulatory response at this
time.






A. Banning Payment for Order Flow




The Commission believes disclosure is the appropriate response to the issue raised by payment for order flow. The
Commission does not believe that all payment for order flow arrangements are against the customer's best interest
and must be banned per se 

as compromising a broker's duty to seek best execution of the customer's order.
 For example, it is unclear what harm lurks in specialists' or market makers' payment for order flow practices if unpriced
orders are subject to a meaningful opportunity for price improvement, or if other benefits are provided to the customer
due to the dealer's ability to use the payments. Additionally, the disclosures required by the new Rule and Rule amendments
should mitigate concerns opponents may have that investors are unaware of a broker-dealer's order routing practices.

An outright ban at this time, moreover, would represent a radical change to the industry where the payment of cash or
its monetary equivalent has become widespread.
 In addition, banning payment for order flow has associated workability problems.
 If the practice of ca
