NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION








Reduction of Reporting Requirements Imposed on NRC Licensees


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Nuclear Regulatory Commission.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is proposing to amend its regulations to reduce reporting requirements
currently imposed on water-cooled nuclear power reactor, research and test reactor, and nuclear material licensees.
This action would reduce the regulatory burden on NRC licensees. The proposed rule would implement an NRC initiative
to review its current regulations with the intent to revise or eliminate duplicative or unnecessary reporting requirements.
The proposed amendments would: (1) Eliminate the current requirement for licensees to submit summary reports of
containment leakage rate tests to the NRC (10 CFR Part 50_Appendix J), but preserve the requirements in   50.72
and 50.73 under which licensees currently report any instances of leakage exceeding authorized limits in the technical
specifications of the license; (2) revise 10 CFR 55.25 to refer licensees to a similar reporting requirement in 10
CFR 50.74(c) and require notification of operator incapacity only in case of permanent disability or illness; and
(3) eliminate the requirement for quarterly submittal of safeguards event logs presently contained in 10 CFR 73.71(c)(2)
and Appendix G to Part 73.

Background


On January 7, 1994, the Executive Director for Operations (EDO) sent to the Commission SECY-94-003, ``Plan
for Implementing Regulatory Review Group Recommendations.'' The Commission approved these recommendations for
reducing regulatory burden on its licensees. This proposed rule is one of several rulemaking and other regulatory
actions that the NRC staff is developing to implement those recommendations.
During the NRC staff review of the regulations, 

Federal Register

 notices were published on February 24, 1992 (57 FR 6299) and June 19, 1992 (57 FR 27394) that solicited the views of the
public, the nuclear power industry, and other interested parties regarding reduction of the regulatory burden and
reporting requirements. Comments were received in response to those notices. A summary of the comments received
that are pertinent to this action is included in this document.


Discussion


These proposed amendments would: (1) Eliminate the current requirement for licensees to submit summary reports
of containment leakage rate tests to the NRC (10 CFR Part 50-Appendix J), but preserve the requirements in   50.72
and 50.73 under which licensees currently report any instances of leakage exceeding authorized limits in the technical
specifications of the license; (2) revise 10 CFR 55.25 to refer licensees to a similar reporting requirement in 10
CFR 50.74(c) and require notification of operator incapacity only in case of permanent disability or illness; and
(3) eliminate the requirement for quarterly submittal of safeguards event logs presently contained in 10 CFR 73.71(c)(2)
and Appendix G to Part 73.
Although these proposed reduction in reporting requirements were discussed in 

Federal Register

 notices published on February 24, 1992 (57 FR 6299) and June 19, 1992 (57 FR 27394), the public is again invited to submit
comments. Specifically, the NRC requests comments and supporting rationale on the appropriateness of eliminating
or consolidating these reporting requirements and whether the public health and safety will be adversely affected
by these changes. 


Elimination of Reporting Requirements from 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J


10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J, currently requires all water-cooled nuclear power reactor licensees to conduct containment
leakage testing. The containment leakage tests demonstrate that the containment system meets all the leakage criteria
specified in the technical specifications of the licenses. Currently, Section V.B. of Appendix J requires licensees
to submit a summary report of the results of all leak rate tests and any associated corrective actions. Under this proposed
rulemaking, licensees of water-cooled nuclear power reactors will continue to conduct containment leakage testing
and to prepare the summary report. However, they would not be required to submit the summary report to the NRC. They
would still be required to report to the NRC instances of leakage in excess of authorized limits, via a written licensee
event report,

1

 as now required by  50.73(a)(2)(ii). If such a leakage condition is found during operation, an immediate notification
by telephone is required by  50.72(b)(1)(ii). If the leakage condition is found during shutdown the telephone
notification is required by  50.72(b)(2)(i).




The NRC believes that the elimination of the requirement to submit the summary report to the NRC of leakage tests when
these results are within acceptance limits would have no impact on the overall health and safety of the public. Because
these tests have been performed and evaluated frequently by the nuclear power industry, any misinterpretation of
testing requirements is highly unlikely. Moreover, licensees would still be required to prepare the summary reports
and make those reports available for review and inspection at the respective plant sites. Having these reports available
at the plant sites should be sufficient for normal record reviews, and for any necessary in-depth reviews. Therefore,
the NRC proposes to eliminate the requirement to report results of tests within specified limits.


Consolidation of 10 CFR 50.74 and 10 CFR 55.25 Reporting Requirements


If an operator licensed pursuant to 10 CFR 55, becomes ill or disabled to the point that he or she no longer can safely
perform their duties, the reactor licensee is required to report the occurrence of disability under both 10 CFR 50.74(c)
and 10 CFR 55.25. The NRC is proposing to require only a single report by eliminating the reporting requirements in
10 CFR 55.25 and modifying 10 CFR 55.25 to refer facility licensees to 10 CFR 50.74(c).
In addition, when 10 CFR Part 55 was promulgated, the intent of  55.25 was to receive reports only of permanent
or potentially permanent illness or disability of licensed operators that would prevent them from safely carrying
out their responsibilities. However, this intent, is not explicitly stated in either  55.25 or  50.74(c).
To remove this ambiguity, the word ``permanent'' is added in both   50.74(c) and 55.25. (A more detailed
discussion on ``permanent'' versus ``temporary,'' illness, or disability can be found in the NRC publication NUREG-1262,

2

 ``Answers to Questions at Public Meetings Regarding Implementation of Title 10, Code of Federal Regulations, Part
55 on Operators' Licenses,'' November 1987, page 21, question 91).




Public Comments


Only two comments were received concerning the reporting requirements for power reactor licensees. Neither suggested
elimination of any power reactor reporting requirement. However, both suggested that the redundant requirements
of 10 CFR Parts 50 and 55 addressing illness or disability of licensed operator be consolidated in 10 CFR 50.74.

Elimination of Reporting Requirements in 10 CFR Part 73.71(c)(2) 


10 CFR Part 73.71(c)(1) requires that licensees maintain a current log for recording safeguards events. An event
that must be recorded in the log is defined in Appendix G, Part 73 as ``Any failure, degradation, or discovered vulnerability
in a safeguard system. * * *.''

3

 10 CFR 73.71(c)(2) requires that a copy of the log be submitted quarterly to the NRC.





The NRC proposes to eliminate the requirement that licensees submit copies of the safeguard event logs. Until recently,
the NRC staff published an annual report which contained trending analysis of log events. However, the NRC now believes
that the greatest benefits of dissemination of these statistics on safeguards equipment performance and lessons
learned about the causes and prevention of safeguards equipment malfunctions have been realized, and that continuing
to publish that report is no longer cost effective. However, licensees will still be required to enter events in the
logs, and make those logs available for review and inspection at the respective plant sites. Having the logs available
at the plant site should be sufficient for normal record reviews, and any necessary in-depth reviews. Therefore,
the NRC believes that public health and safety will not be adversely affected if the logs are no longer submitted to
the NRC.



Public Comments



The former Nuclear Management and Resources Council, now known as the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI), commented
that power reactor licensees should be deleted from the list of licensees subject to the provisions of 10 CFR 73.71(c).
According to NEI, comparisons among plants using the data provided in the logs are not meaningful because the number
of events reported by each site is dramatically influenced by a number of site-specific variables such as the number
and design of system components and unique physical arrangements. NEI stated that comments received from industry
were almost unanimous in advising that licensees receive insignificant information from the NRC's quarterly ``Safeguards
Events Analysis Report.'' NEI further commented that the real benefit in recording safeguards events lies in its
usefulness as a management tool to measure a plant's specific performance, independent of other facilities.

One licensee commented that if the requirement to submit a log to the NRC were not deleted, the frequency of submittal
should be reduced from 4 times each year to 2 times each year as required for submittal of fitness-for-duty performance
data in 10 CFR 26.71(d). The licensee noted that timeliness would not be adversely impacted in a significant way by
annual or semiannual rather than quarterly reporting. The licensee also suggested that evaluation of trends is more
meaningful when based on events over 6 months or a year rather than only 3 months.

The NRC believes that, in the early years of this program, there was considerable benefit from comparisons of the performance
of a site's security equipment with the performance of the rest of the industry, notwithstanding differences in site-specific
variables. However, the NRC now believes that the greatest benefits have been realized and that continuing the program
as a regulatory tool has a diminishing cost benefit. As such, the NRC agrees with the comments that the primary benefit
in logging events is the usefulness of the log as a means for the licensees to track and trend the performance of the safeguards
systems at their own plants. In fact, the NRC has already discontinued publication of the ``Safeguards Events Analysis
Report.'' Although the NRC is proposing to eliminate the requirement that licensees submit their safeguards event
logs, licensees would still be required to enter events into their logs and maintain those logs on site for review by
the NRC inspectors.



Written Reports



This proposed rule would not require additional written reports. On the contrary, under this proposed rule, reporting
will be reduced for all licensees under 10 CFR Parts 50, 55, and 73.



Environmental Impact: Categorical Exclusion



The NRC has determined that this proposed rule is the type of action described in the categorical exclusion, 10 CFR
51.22(c)(3)(iii). Therefore, neither an environmental impact statement nor an environmental assessment has been
prepared for this regulation.

Paperwork Reduction Act Statement



This proposed rule amends information collection requirements that are subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of
1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

). This rule has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review and approval of the paperwork requirements.

Because the rule will relax existing information collection requirements, the public burden for this collection
of information is expected to be reduced by approximately 10 hours per licensee. This reduction includes the time
required for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed
and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding the estimated burden reduction
or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to the Information
and Records Management Branch (T-6 F33), U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555-0001;
and to the Desk Officer, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, NEOB-10202 (3150-0011, 3150-0018,
3150-0002), Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503.



Regulatory Analysis 



The Commission has prepared a draft regulatory analysis on this proposed regulation. The analysis examines the costs
and benefits of the alternatives considered by the Commission. The draft analysis is available for inspection in
the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC. Single copies of the draft analysis
may be obtained from Naiem S. Tanious, telephone (301) 415-6103. The Commission requests public comment on
the draft regulatory analysis. Comments on the draft analysis may be submitted to the NRC as indicated under the 

ADDRESSES 

heading. 



Regulatory Flexibility Certification



In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the Commission certifies that this rule
will not, if promulgated, have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This proposed
rule affects the nuclear power reactors, research and test reactors, and some material licensees. The companies
and organizations that own these plants do not fall within the scope of the definition of ``small entities'' set forth
in the Regulatory Flexibility Act of the size standards established by the NRC (56 FR 56671; November 6, 1991).



Backfit Analysis



The NRC has determined that the backfit rule 10 CFR 50.109, does not apply to this proposed rule because these amendments
do not involve any provisions which would impose backfits on licensees as defined in  50.109(a)(1). Information
collection and reporting requirements are not subject to the backfit rule; moreover, the changes proposed in this
rulemaking relax existing requirements.

* * * * * 



III. 

Leakage Testing Requirements. 


* * * * * 



A. Type A test-1. Pretest requirements. 

(a) Containment inspection in accordance with V. A. shall be performed as a prerequisite to the performance of Type
A tests. During the period between the initiation of the containment inspection and the performance of the Type A test,
no repairs or adjustments shall be made so that the containment can be tested in as close to the ``as is'' condition as
practical. During the period between the completion of one Type A test and the initiation of the containment inspection
for the subsequent Type A test, repairs or adjustments shall be made to components whose leakage exceeds that specified
in the technical specification as soon as practical after identification. If during a Type A test, including the supplemental
test specified in III.A.3.(b), potentially excessive leakage paths are identified which will interfere with satisfactory
completion of the test, or which result in the Type A test not meeting the acceptance criteria III.A.4.(b) or III.A.5.(b),
the Type A test shall be terminated and the leakage through such paths shall be measured using local leakage testing
methods. Repairs and/or adjustments to equipment shall be made and Type A test performed. The corrective action taken
and the change in leakage rate determined from the tests and overall integrated leakage determined from local leak
and Type A tests shall be included in the summary report required by V.B. 


(b) Closure of containment isolation valves for the Type A test shall be accomplished by normal operation and without
any preliminary exercising or adjustments (e.g., no tightening of valve after closure by valve motor). Repairs of
maloperating or leaking valves shall be made as necessary. Information on any valve closure malfunction or valve
leakage that require corrective action before the test, shall be included in the summary report required by V.B. 



* * * * * 




(d) Those portions of the fluid systems that are part of the reactor coolant pressure boundary and are open directly
to the containment atmosphere under post-accident conditions and become an extension an extension of the boundary
of the containment shall be opened or vented to the containment atmosphere prior to and during the test. Portions of
closed systems inside containment that penetrate containment and rupture as a result of a loss of coolant accident
shall be vented to the containment atmosphere. All vented systems shall be drained of water or other fluids to the extent
necessary to assure exposure of the system containment isolation valves to containment air test pressure and to assure
they will be subjected to the post accident differential pressure. Systems that are required to maintain the plant
in a safe condition during the test shall be operable in their normal mode, and need not be vented. Systems that are normally
filled with water and operating under post-accident conditions, such as the containment heat removal system, need
not be vented. However, the containment isolation valves in the systems defined in III.A.1.(d) shall be tested in
accordance with III.C. The measured leakage rate from these tests shall be included in the summary required by V.B.

IV. Special Testing Requirements. 



A. 

Containment modification. 

Any major modification, replacement of a component which is part of the primary reactor containment boundary, or
resealing a seal-welded door, performed after the preoperational leakage rate test shall be followed by either a
Type A, Type B, or Type C test, as applicable for the area affected by the modification. The measured leakage from this
test shall be included in the summary report required by V.B. The acceptance criteria of III.A.5.(b), III.B.3., or
III.C.3., as appropriate, shall be met. Minor modifications, replacements, or resealing of seal-welded doors,
performed directly prior to the conduct of a scheduled Type A test do not require a separate test. 


* * * * *




V. Inspection and Reporting of Tests. 




A. 

Containment inspection. 

A general inspection of the accessible interior and exterior surfaces of the containment structures and components
shall be performed prior to any Type A test to uncover any evidence of structural deterioration which may affect either
the containment structural integrity or leak-tightness. If there is evidence of structural deterioration, Type
A tests shall not be performed until corrective action is taken in accordance with repair procedures, non destructive
examinations, and tests as specified in the applicable code specified in  50.55a at the commencement of repair
work. Such structural deterioration and corrective actions taken shall be included in the summary test report required
by V.B. 

B. 

Report of Test Results. 

1. The preoperational and periodic tests must be documented in a readily available summary report that will be made
available for inspection, upon request, at the nuclear power plant. The summary report shall include a schematic
arrangement of the leakage rate measurement system, the instrumentation used, the supplemental test method, and
the test program selected as applicable to the preoperational test, and all the subsequent periodic tests. The report
shall contain an analysis and interpretation of the leakage rate test data for the Type A test results to the extent
necessary to demonstrate the acceptability of the containment's leakage rate in meeting acceptance criteria. 

2. For each periodic test, leakage test results from Type A, B, and C tests shall be included in the summary report. The
summary report shall contain an analysis and interpretation of the Type A test results and a summary analysis of periodic
Type B and Type C tests that were performed since the last type A test. Leakage test results from type A, B, and C tests
that failed to meet the acceptance criteria of III.A.5(b), III.B.3, and III.C.3, respectively, shall be included
in a separate accompanying summary report that includes an analysis and interpretation of the test data, the least
squares fit analysis of the test data, the instrumentation error analysis, and the structural conditions of the containment
or components, if any, which contributed to the failure in meeting the acceptance criteria. Results and analyses
of the supplemental verification test employed to demonstrate the validity of the leakage rate test measurements
shall also be included.

carry-through frame structure for cracks on certain 
Beech 33, 35, and 36 series airplanes, and, if found 
cracked, repairing or reinforcing. The Federal 
Aviation Administration (FAA) has received 43 reports 
of wing front spar carry-through frame structure 
cracks on the affected airplanes during the inspection 
required by AD 92-08-07. The proposed action would 
make this one-time inspection repetitive. The actions 
specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent 
spar carry-through structure failure, which could result in 
severe structural damage to the wing.

Discussion 



AD 92-08-07, Amendment 39-8218 (57 FR 13004, April 
15, 1992), currently requires inspecting (one-time) the 
wing front spar carry-through frame structure for 
cracks on certain Beech 33, 35, and 36 series 
airplanes, and, if found cracked, repairing or 
reinforcing. These actions are accomplished in 
accordance with Beech Service Bulletin (SB) No. 2360, 
dated November 1990. 

Since this AD became effective, the FAA has 
received 43 reports of wing front spar carry-through 
frame structure cracks on Beech 33, 35, and 36 series 
airplanes during the inspection required by AD 92-08-07. Several of these affected airplanes had cracks

between huckbolts that incur heavy loads and along the 
radius of the carry-through web in critical primary 
airframe structure. These cracks, if not detected and 
corrected, could result in wing front spar carry-through structure failure, which could result in severe 
structural damage to the wing. 

After examining the circumstances and reviewing 
all available information related to the incidents 
described above, the FAA has determined that the 
inspection required by AD 92-08-07 should be 
repetitive. 

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that 
is likely to exist or develop in other Beech 33, 35, 
and 36 airplanes of the same type design, the proposed 
AD would supersede AD 92-08-07 with a new AD that would 
require repetitively inspecting the wing front spar 
carry-through structure for cracks, and, if found 
cracked, repairing or replacing. The proposed action 
would be accomplished in accordance with Beech SB No. 
2360, dated November 1990. 

The FAA estimates that 11,000 airplanes in the 
U.S. registry would be affected by the proposed AD, 
that it would take approximately 8 workhours per 
airplane to accomplish the proposed action, and that 
the average labor rate is approximately $55 an hour. 
Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the 
proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be 
$4,840,000. This figure does not account for 
repetitive inspections. The only difference between 
the cost analysis for this proposed action and AD 92-08-07 (which would be superseded by this proposed
action) 
is the cost of these repetitive inspections. The FAA 
has no way of determining the number of repetitive 
inspections an owner/operator may incur.

Airworthiness Directives; Sikorsky Aircraft Model S-76B Helicopters 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule; withdrawal.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This action withdraws a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that proposed a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable
to Sikorsky Aircraft Model S-76B helicopters. That action would have limited the applicability of the inspections
of the left and right engine input drive shaft assemblies (shaft assemblies) for loose balance weights or cracks to
those shaft assemblies of original (or initial) design only, and would have excluded redesigned shaft assemblies
from those inspections. Since the issuance of the NPRM, the FAA has received a report of a fatigue crack in a redesigned
shaft assembly indicating a need to continue the existing inspections of the redesigned shaft assembly. Accordingly,
the proposed rule is withdrawn.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to supersede an existing airworthiness
directive (AD), applicable to Sikorsky Aircraft Model S-76B helicopters, was published in the 

Federal Register

 on November 2, 1992 (57 FR 49431). The proposed rule would have limited the applicability of AD 91-19-02
by requiring initial and repetitive 25 hours time-in-service inspections of the shaft assemblies of original (or
initial) design only, excluding the redesigned shaft assemblies from the inspections. That action was prompted
by the introduction of a redesigned shaft assembly that was designed to eliminate the cause of cracks in the original
shaft assemblies. The proposed actions were intended to prevent failure of certain shaft assemblies and subsequent
loss of power to the helicopter rotor system. 


Since the issuance of that NPRM, the FAA has received a report of a fatigue crack in a redesigned shaft assembly. Therefore,
the FAA issued Priority Letter AD 93-1-05 on June 4, 1993, to require inspections of the redesigned shaft
assemblies at intervals not to exceed 6 hours time-in-service from the last inspection. 
Upon further consideration, the FAA has determined that the proposed rule to exclude redesigned shaft assemblies
from the AD inspections is no longer appropriate. Accordingly, the proposed rule is hereby withdrawn. 
Withdrawal of this notice of proposed rulemaking constitutes only such action, and does not preclude the agency from
issuing another notice in the future, nor does it commit the agency to any course of action in the future. 
Since this action only withdraws a notice of proposed rulemaking, it is neither a proposed nor a final rule and therefore,
is not covered under Executive Order 12866, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, or DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979).

Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Model A320 Series Airplanes



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Airbus Model
A320 series airplanes. This proposal would require inspections to determine proper adjustment of the gap tolerances
of the seat track joints at frame 64, and correction of discrepancies. This proposal would also require eventual repositioning
or replacing the seat tracks on all affected airplanes, which would terminate the requirement of repetitively removing
or repositioning the seat tracks. This proposal is prompted by in-service inspection reports, which have revealed
that a gap between the forward and aft seat track at frame 64 could exceed the tolerance limit due to a method used on the
assembly line to control the position of the seat track. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to ensure
that the gap tolerances of the seat track joints do not exceed the tolerance limit and subsequently lead to separation
of the passenger seats from the seat track under emergency landing conditions.

Discussion



The Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC), which is the airworthiness authority for France,
recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Airbus Model A320 series airplanes. The DGAC
advises that in-service inspection reports have revealed that the gap between the forward and aft seat track at frame
64 (left- and right-hand) could be exceeding the 2.8 mm (.11 inch) tolerance limit. Investigation revealed that the
cause has been attributed to the method used on the assembly line to control the position of the seat track. This method
is inadequate in monitoring the gap between the forward and aft seat track of the passenger seats at frame 64. Incorrectly
installed seat tracks, if not corrected, could result in a gap that exceeds the tolerance limit, and could subsequently
lead to separation of the passenger seats from the seat track under emergency landing conditions.

Airbus has issued All Operator Telex (AOT) 53-01, dated August 27, 1992, which describes procedures for:

1. Performing a one-time visual inspection to determine if a seat fitting having an x-plunger behind a z-stud is installed
at the seat track joint at frame 64;

2. Measuring the gap between the forward and aft seat tracks, if any seat fitting having an x-plunger is installed;

3. Applying sealing material at the seat tracks, if the gap is less than or equal to 2.8 mm; and

4. Removing or repositioning the seat, if the gap is greater than 2.8 mm.

Airbus has also issued Service Bulletin A320-53-1088, dated May 10, 1993, which describes procedures
for repositioning or replacing the seat tracks.

The DGAC classified the AOT and service bulletin as mandatory and issued French Airworthiness Directive 93-081-042(B),
dated May 26, 1993, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in France.

This airplane model is manufactured in France and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the
provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the DGAC has kept the FAA informed of the situation
described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the DGAC, reviewed all available information, and determined
that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require a one-time visual inspection to determine if
a seat fitting having an x-plunger behind a z-stud is installed at the seat track joint at frame 64, and correction of
discrepancies. The proposed AD would also require repositioning or replacing the seat tracks, which would terminate
the requirement of repetitively removing or repositioning the seat tracks. The actions would be required to be accomplished
in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. If any cabin equipment other than passenger seats
is installed at frame 64, the correction would be required to be accomplished in accordance with a method approved
by the FAA.

The FAA estimates that 85 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD.

It would take approximately 7 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed inspection at an average labor rate
is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the inspection proposed by this AD on U.S. operators
is estimated to be $32,725, or $385 per airplane. 

It would take approximately 54 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed modification at an average labor
rate of $55 per work hour. Required parts would be supplied by the manufacturer at no cost to the operators. Based on
these figures, the total impact of the modification proposed by this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $252,450,
or $2,970. 

Based on above figures, the total cost impact of the proposed inspection and modification on U.S. operators is estimated
to be $285,175, or $3,355/per airplane. 

The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted. 

The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting

Notice of Inquiry 



Before Commissioners: Elizabeth Anne Moler, Chair; Vicky A. Bailey, James J. Hoecker, William L. Massey, and Donald
F. Santa, Jr. 






October 26, 1994.




I. Introduction 



The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) is initiating this proceeding to solicit comments from interested
persons on issues related to alternative power pooling institutions.

1

 





Since the inception of power pools, fundamental changes have occurred in the electric utility industry. Most significant
are the enactment of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct)

2

 and the emerging development of a competitive bulk power market. The Commission has recently announced in a series
of orders its policy of promoting competitive bulk power markets, and has emphasized the critical role of comparable
transmission access in meeting that goal. 





Given the ongoing changes in the competitive environment of the electric utility industry_in particular, the potential
for substantially increased access to transmission_we must consider whether we are appropriately balancing our
dual objectives of promoting coordination and competition. Indeed, industry participants in many regions are responding
to competitive changes by exploring the possibility of changes in, or alternatives to, traditional power pools.


The Commission believes that the new alternative power pooling institutions have great potential. In particular,
they may be of assistance in facilitating the resolution of some difficult federal-state jurisdictional issues
and in developing mechanisms for resolving or minimizing stranded cost issues. We therefore want to explore them
in detail. We are particularly interested in determining whether alternative power pooling institutions may have
special transmission pricing needs.

3

 







We also wish to re-examine the role of more traditional power pools in an era of increased competition. 


For these reasons, we are initiating a notice of inquiry on alternative power pooling institutions. This notice has
three parts. First, we relate our understanding of an innovative power pooling concept proposed by two utilities
in Southern California in response to the California Public Utilities Commission's (California Commission) inquiry
into retail access (the ``Blue Book Proposal'').

4

 We also note our interest in any other alternative pooling institutions that are being explored today. Second, we
briefly describe power pools as they have evolved to date in order to provide a comparison of traditional power pools
with emerging, innovative proposals. Third, we ask interested parties to respond to specific questions, as well
as to provide us with any other comments they may have, on alternative power pooling institutions and existing power
pools.





We note that a major focus of this notice of inquiry is on power pooling to accomplish short-term transactions, rather
than long-term regional planning, which we addressed in our Policy Statement on Regional Transmission Groups (RTGs).

5

 While power pools do some transmission planning, it is not necessarily of a regional or long-term nature. In contrast,
as envisioned in our policy statement on RTGs, RTGs may be better able to focus on long-term and regional transmission
planning. In this sense, RTGs and poolcos, at a minimum, would be complementary, rather than competing, institutions.
Indeed, the same institution could perform both functions. For example, some RTGs may decide to develop mechanisms
to accommodate short-term transactions within the RTG. The Commission is interested in exploring whether RTGs would
be appropriate institutions to accommodate power pooling. 






II. Alternative Power Pooling Institutions 



Increased competition in the electric utility industry may signal the need for alternative power pooling arrangements.
We are interested in considering new arrangements that could better capture the benefits of competition in bulk power
markets without unnecessarily sacrificing coordination benefits. Serious discussion is occurring in California
at the present time concerning an alternative power pooling arrangement. 



A. The Poolco Concept 



Two utilities (San Diego Gas & Electric Company and Southern California Edison Company) have each proposed creating
a regional pooling company, or ``poolco,'' in response to the California Commission's Blue Book Proposal. Both proposals
discuss some form of restructuring, either vertical disintegration or the relinquishment of transmission control.
Divestiture has not been proposed. However, the utilities may intend to create subsidiary companies for each function
that would remain affiliated.

Although the two proposals vary in some details, they share many fundamental characteristics. Basically, the poolco
would be an independent entity that would not own any (or would own only a limited number of) facilities, but would control
the operation of some or all generators, and all transmission facilities, in a region. The poolco would be open to all
generators connected to the grid, who would automatically receive any transmission service needed to sell power
into the regional pool. In effect, the poolco would be responsible for creating and maintaining a regional spot market
for electricity. The spot price in each trading period (perhaps hour-by-hour) would be readily available and made
known to all market participants. 
Generating resources would be centrally dispatched on an hourly basis by the poolco in much the same way as in current
power pools. The principal difference appears to be that generators would be dispatched based on the bid price they
submit to the poolco, rather than on their running costs. The poolco would operate a least-cost (in the sense of lowest
bid) dispatch that accounts for any transmission constraints in the same manner as an existing power pool or a single
utility dispatch center. Generators would be paid the market-clearing price
 during each hour, as opposed to the bid price that each generator submitted to the poolco.
 Likewise, distributors would pay the market-clearing price in each hour. Consequently, the poolco would break even
in its basic dispatch function, since distributors would pay to the poolco what the generators would receive from
the poolco. 






In effect, the poolco would become the market clearinghouse for the hourly energy market. Under the poolco concept,
dispatch benefits are implicitly allocated among sellers and buyers by the spot trading at a market-clearing price.
The poolco would have no further role in dividing or allocating benefits. Also, the proposed poolco would have no role
in long-term energy or capacity markets. Generators and distributors could enter into contracts outside the poolco.


Under San Diego's poolco concept as currently proposed,
 spot prices would vary from one geographical location to another to reflect transmission constraints.
 This would allow the spot trading to be conducted at a price that reflects the real ability and limitations of the grid
to move power from low-cost to high-cost areas. The proposal includes opportunity cost pricing for grid congestion,
as well as tradable capacity rights. 






While the poolco concept contains many similarities to existing power pools, it appears that significant differences
exist between a traditional power pool and a poolco, particularly with respect to both generation and transmission
pricing. Although a traditional power pool generally has flexible cost-based pricing schemes,
 we understand that a fundamental characteristic of the California poolco concept is that all short-term power sales
would occur at a market-clearing price. In other words, whereas in a traditional power pool the offer-price mechanisms
are cost-based, in the California poolco proposal they would be based on economic bids with an incentive to bid at or
near the utility's marginal running costs. 





Another difference between traditional power pools and the California poolco proposals is their membership. Today,
some power pool agreements include explicit membership criteria. Most include no explicit provisions addressing
the admission of new members. However, most existing pools to some extent limit membership. On the other hand, the
California poolco proposals, as we understand them, would require open membership for at least all bulk power participants.

The California poolco proposals represent an interesting alternative approach to achieving operating efficiency
and competition in hourly electricity markets. However, the proposals are in an early stage of development and a number
of significant transmission issues apparently have not yet been resolved (for example, how transmission owners
would be compensated for the existing facilities, how to determine priorities for use of the transmission grid, how
to allocate expansion costs and how to induce appropriate expansion). Since the California poolco proposals raise
several questions and issues that need additional consideration, we have included a list of questions in section
III.C of this Notice on which we seek comments from interested persons. 



B. Other Alternative Power Pooling Institutions 



There may be other alternative pooling proposals of which the Commission is not aware. The above discussion is not
intended to limit the scope of this inquiry. The Commission is interested in all innovative pooling proposals intended
to capture the benefits of competitive bulk power markets while preserving those coordination benefits that are
consistent with competition. 

The issue of alternative power pooling arrangements, and the California poolco proposal in particular, is part of
a larger discussion concerning the future structure of the electric power industry in the United States. In addition
to the California poolco concept, other innovative institutions have been proposed which, as the Commission comprehends
them, might either work in tandem with a poolco, or separately from a poolco to facilitate the development of a more
competitive bulk power market. For example, some have suggested that the electric power industry could be restructured
to include: (1) generating companies, known as ``gencos,'' which are groupings of generators that may or may not be
affiliated with utilities that compete to sell electricity in the wholesale spot and contract markets; (2) transmitters,
known as ``transcos'' or ``gridcos,'' which are companies that would separately own and maintain a regional transmission
grid; and (3) distributors, known as ``discos,'' which are utilities that would operate the local distribution systems
and purchase energy in the competitive wholesale market for resale to ultimate customers. 

In such a restructured market, the poolco could be a fourth player that could control the operation of the generation
and transmission facilities owned by gencos and gridcos; 

i.e.

, the poolco could dispatch the system based on buy/sell offers from individual gencos and discos. In addition, the
poolco could provide any necessary ancillary services (

e.g.

, load following, spinning reserves, and reactive power) at cost. 

In addition to proposals to restructure the electric power industry along functional lines, there may be other alternative
institutional structures for the industry that warrant consideration in this inquiry. The Commission is interested
in expanding its appreciation of any such proposals for alternative institutional structures. In particular, the
Commission is interested in the extent to which such alternative institutional structures might facilitate the
achievement of a more competitive bulk power market in a way that the current institutional structure of the industry
may not. We have included several questions in this regard as part of section IV. of this notice. 



III. Existing Power Pools 



In order to fully understand the issues presented by alternative power pooling institutions, it is necessary to understand
existing power pools. In addition, given the competitive changes in the industry and the fact that new pooling alternatives
are emerging, it is appropriate to consider whether existing power pools are functioning appropriately and, if not,
to consider what changes are necessary.

Historically, utilities began coordination activities by entering into simple bilateral arrangements, progressing
gradually to more complex contractual agreements. Such agreements may simply cover an exchange of energy and power,
or they may cover a variety of services. They generally are not considered to be pooling agreements unless they include
coordination of reserve generating capacity and, in most cases, some coordination of planning and construction
in addition to operating coordination. 
 





Traditional power pools have provided to their members significant economic benefits and operating efficiencies,
including: reduced operating costs resulting from joint dispatch; reduced fixed costs resulting from joint construction
of generating units and reserve sharing; and increased system reliability resulting from reserve sharing and regional
planning. 


Existing pools vary a great deal in the extent to which they are integrated, i.e., to which they plan and operate their
individual systems as a single system.
 The most highly integrated pools are referred to as ``tight'' pools.
 Tight pools extensively coordinate their planning and operations in both the long and short run, and in theory provide
the greatest benefits. They provide for joint planning on a highly coordinated basis and for centralized dispatch
of generating facilities. They also establish contractual requirements with respect to generating capacity and
operating reserves, together with financial penalties to enforce reserve requirements. 
 







One of the key characteristics of a tight power pool is central dispatch, which ensures short-term efficiency by dispatching
the pool's combined generating resources to meet the pool's combined loads, without regard to unit ownership. The
benefits of central dispatch (i.e., the savings realized by dispatching jointly rather than individually) are shared
among pool members. 
 





A long-term benefit of a tight power pool is joint action to enhance reliability. A tight pool coordinates maintenance
to ensure that adequate reserves are maintained, that is, units are taken out of service on a staggered basis. Also,
tight pools undertake some regional planning of production and transmission to facilitate joint solutions to regional
needs and problems. Finally, tight pools conduct transactions with neighboring pools to realize additional economy
savings and to increase reliability whenever possible. 

Tight power pools generally require that members provide transmission access to other members without a direct charge
for economy trades effected through central dispatch as compensation for use of their facilities. However, the transmission
providers may be assigned a share of the savings resulting from the central dispatch. Affiliated power pools, i.e.,
the registered holding companies, have more extensive transmission access provisions that generally include some
form of transmission equalization payments among members. 

Pools that are characterized by a lower level of coordination are called ``loose pools.'' 
 For example, while the participating utilities work together to establish principles and practices for interconnected
operation, review area power supply problems and establish criteria for power supply adequacy, exchange generation
and transmission construction plans, and plan coordinated efforts to attain optimal economy and reliability, there
is no central dispatch and there may be less joint planning.

As discussed in section IV of this Notice, the Commission seeks comment on a number of questions pertaining to existing
power pools (both tight pools and loose pools), and their strengths and weaknesses in light of emerging competitive
bulk power markets. 



IV. Request for Comments 



In order to assess the merits of alternative power pooling institutions, including the California poolco proposals,
and to evaluate whether our existing policies will impede the development of such institutions, the Commission seeks
comments from interested industry participants. We also believe that this proceeding is an appropriate forum to
consider whether any changes should be made in our policies concerning existing power pools. Our intention is to ensure
that our policies, while continuing to maintain adequate and reliable service, are consistent with the development
of a competitive bulk power market. Answers to the questions below should refer to the number(s) of the specific question(s)
when possible. In addition, commenters may address any other matters related to these issues. We are interested in
all aspects of potential changes in, or alternatives to, existing power pools.




Question 1. What alternative power pooling institutions might be beneficial? What are the strengths and weaknesses
of these alternatives? What special transmission pricing needs, if any, would such alternative pooling institutions
have? What specific benefits would an alternative bring that are not available today? What specific benefits of existing
pools would be lost? What, if any, benefits would alternative power pooling institutions provide compared to bilateral
trading? How would alternative power pooling institutions differ from a regime of bilateral trading? 

Question 2. Do any current Commission policies impede the formation of beneficial alternative power pooling institutions?
What changes in our existing policies, if any, including pricing policies, are needed to encourage pools that facilitate
competitive bulk power markets? 

Question 3. In discussing any alternative power pooling institution, please address how the adequacy of generation
and transmission services would be ensured, 

e.g.,

 maintenance of adequate generation and transmission reserves and construction of needed generating and transmission
capacity? How would reliability be ensured, 

e.g.

, control of transmission systems, voltage support, reactive power, loop flow, load following, backup services
and other control area services? 

Question 4. What are the conditions required for alternative power pooling institutions to be beneficial, 

e.g.

, a minimum number of sellers or buyers, a minimum geographic size, maximum market share for any seller or buyer, open
membership, appropriate governance rules? Should participation by generators in the alternative pool's area be
voluntary or mandatory? 

Question 5. Do alternative power pooling institutions have the potential to help resolve or minimize stranded cost
issues? If so, how? 

Question 6. How would specific alternative power pooling institutions be regulated? In particular, can these institutions
be designed to fit easily into the existing Federal-State regulatory structure so as to avoid duplicating the regulation
of pool functions? 

Question 7. What are the merits of proposals to restructure the electric power industry along functional lines such
as the genco-gridco-disco delineation? Should the Commission be prepared to proceed with poolco-type proposals
in advance of any functional utility restructuring efforts, or should the Commission refuse to act on poolco-type
proposals unless the functional restructuring occurs simultaneously? Does such a restructuring have merit even
if an alternative power pooling arrangement is not adopted? Would such a restructuring facilitate the development
of a more competitive bulk power market in a way that the current institutional structure of the electric power industry
cannot?

Question 8. In addition to the proposal mentioned in the preceding question, are there other alternative institutional
structures for the electric power industry that warrant the Commission's consideration in this Inquiry?
Question 9. What are the strengths and weaknesses of today's power pools? We are particularly interested in concrete
examples related to existing power pools. Should the Commission consider changing any existing power pool practices
or policies to facilitate competitive bulk power markets?
Question 10. Would changes to existing power pools be preferable to creating new pooling institutions? Is an RTG an
appropriate institution to become a power pool? Or should the RTG's transmission planning function be kept separate
from the pool's generation market-clearing function?
Question 11. Can a pool provide advantages to its members without unduly preferring members to non-members? How should
pool members relate to non-members in an open access market? Are any improvements in information availability necessary
for existing pools or alternative pooling institutions to be more beneficial? What reciprocity conditions are appropriate
between pool members and non-members? How would a state policy of retail access affect pool membership conditions
and reciprocity obligations? What if retail access were available in only some states in the pool?
Question 12. How should the Commission's recently-announced policy concerning comparability of transmission
services be implemented with respect to alternative power pooling institutions and/or existing power pools?


V. Public Comment Procedures


The Commission invites all interested parties to submit an original and 14 copies of their written comments. Comments

Decertification of Approved Instructors and Certified and Qualified Persons


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Mine Safety and Health Administration, Labor.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This proposed rule would establish uniform procedures under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (Mine Act)
for the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) to decertify persons who have been designated as MSHA-approved
instructors and those individuals certified or qualified to perform certain mining related tasks under the applicable
training, safety and health regulations. These proposed decertification procedures would also apply to those persons
who are deemed certified by MSHA as a result of their certification through State programs recognized by the agency.
The proposal would provide notice of potential decertification by MSHA and would provide procedural due process,
including a notice of proposed action, an informational meeting with the district manager, notice of the district
manager's decision, appeal rights to the appropriate administrator, and a 

de novo 

post-decertification evidentiary hearing before an administrative law judge of the U.S. Department of Labor. In
addition, the proposal would provide a new paragraph to replace the decertification of diesel mechanics previously
proposed.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
I. Paperwork Reduction Act


This proposed rule contains no information collection requirements.


II. Background


In order to maintain safe and healthful working conditions in mines, MSHA recognizes that certain tasks and duties
must be performed by individuals with the proper knowledge and expertise. MSHA has promulgated regulations in Title
30 of the Code of Federal Regulations (30 CFR), parts 48, 70, 71, 75, 77, and 90, that require particular activities
to be performed by persons who have demonstrated their expertise or proficiency to the agency or to a State mining agency,
who have been recognized as competent through training, testing or experience, and who have been formally ``approved,''
``certified,'' or ``qualified'' by MSHA or a State to perform these activities.

MSHA regulations require some form of approval, certification, or qualification for a variety of activities. At
coal mines, certification requirements apply to underground coal mine foremen, assistant foremen, and preshift
examiners who, among other things, must be able to check for evidence of methane gas and identify other safety hazards.
Individuals who collect respirable dust samples, maintain and calibrate dust sampling equipment, test noise levels,
or examine surface coal mine work areas for hazardous conditions must also be certified by MSHA. Regulations for coal
mines also require the qualification of persons who perform electrical work, examine impoundment structures, test
methane and oxygen levels, operate hoists, or use explosives. Finally, MSHA approves instructors to provide training
to coal, metal and nonmetal miners. 


Depending upon the type of approval, certification or qualification sought, an individual can become certified
or qualified through an MSHA-administered program, or a State-administered program recognized by MSHA. Six activities
require an approval, certification or qualification issued solely by MSHA: Respirable dust sampling; maintenance
and calibration of respirable dust sampling equipment; noise level testing; examination of impoundments; electrical
work (several States have electrical qualification programs approved by MSHA); and the training and retraining
of miners. 

MSHA certifies and qualifies individuals to perform work in the remaining job categories, but also recognizes State
certifications for the following: blasters; foremen; assistant foremen; preshift examiners; persons who conduct
surface examinations; gas testers, and hoist operators. Because MSHA accepts State certifications for these job
categories, the agency does not require an MSHA-issued certification except where there is no State certification
program. 

Certification and qualification procedures require an individual to show the necessary competency in the appropriate
areas. In general, an individual obtains an MSHA certification or qualification by attending an MSHA-sponsored
or approved training program; by demonstrating the ability to perform the activities and duties stated in the regulations;
or by successfully passing an examination. MSHA currently administers examinations for certification or qualification
for dust sampling, noise level testing, maintenance and calibration of dust sampling equipment, electrical work,
and examination of impoundments. In order to remain qualified to perform electrical work, the qualified person must
satisfactorily complete an MSHA-approved coal mine electrical retraining program annually. All other certifications
or qualifications have an indefinite duration requiring no recertification, except for those persons referred
to in  75.100(c)(2) and 77.100(b)(2). 

Most State certifications are conditional upon minimum age and years of mining experience, undergoing required
training, and passing a relevant examination. In many instances, States also require refresher training at specified
intervals. The following coal-producing States have one or more certification programs: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona,
Arkansas, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania,
Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming. These States do not all maintain the same number and types
of certification programs, nor does MSHA recognize all State certifications. For instance, all of these States,
with the exception of Alaska, maintain programs for the certification of responsible individuals. MSHA recognizes
all of these types of certifications. On the other hand, although Arkansas, Illinois, and Pennsylvania have electrical
certification programs, MSHA does not recognize their State electrical certifications for compliance with Federal
regulations. 

Currently, 30 CFR part 48 specifies procedures for revocation of the approval of part 48 training instructors. Under
30 CFR 48.3(i) and 48.23(i), a person's approval to conduct training under part 48 can be revoked for good cause which
may include failure to instruct a course within a 24-month period. It may also include failure to follow the approved
training plan, inadequate teaching skills, or lack of subject matter knowledge. This proposed rule would revise
and expand part 48 procedures. 

This proposed rule would also for the first time establish formal procedures for the revocation of the certifications
or qualifications of individuals as well as the termination of MSHA's acceptance of an individual's State certification
or qualification. Although an individual may continue to hold a State certification, MSHA could discontinue its
recognition or acceptance of the State certification by following the procedures in this part. Revisions to the applicable
sections of 30 CFR parts 70, 71, 75, 77 and 90 are included within the proposed rule. MSHA anticipates extensive coordination
with the States regarding pursuit of decertification actions within those States whose certifications MSHA recognizes.
MSHA will be cognizant of any State decertification actions, initiated independently of those actions specifically
referred or sought by MSHA, prior to the initiation of decertification actions by MSHA under this proposed rule. 

MSHA has reviewed the existing certification and qualification programs (and their attendant policies and procedures)
administered by MSHA and the States. MSHA has concluded that decertification procedures are necessary to assure
that specific activities are conducted only by persons who do so in compliance with the applicable regulations, or
who are competently fulfilling their work responsibilities. The agency has previously taken decertification action
against certain individuals on a limited basis. MSHA has determined that formalizing the process and standardizing
the procedures would assure that adequate notice is provided and sufficient due process is afforded to affected individuals.


MSHA has also re-examined the proposed decertification process specifically applied to qualified diesel mechanics
and published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 4, 1989, (54 FR 40996) as part of its comprehensive proposal for the approval and use of diesel equipment
in underground coal mines. Because of the generic nature of the procedures published and proposed today, the agency
does not believe that it is necessary to have a separate procedure for qualified diesel mechanics. This procedure
was published under proposed  75.1916(h) (54 FR 40996). Consequently, today's proposal also contains a new
paragraph to amend proposed  75.1915 which will serve to apply today's proposed part 42 to any qualification
requirements for diesel mechanics which become a final rule. It is MSHA's intent to delete any reference to the decertification
procedures referred to in proposed  75.1916(h) when that regulation becomes final. 

Although the assessment of civil penalties and the initiation of criminal action against operators or agents under
110 of the Mine Act do serve as effective enforcement measures, they may not, in all instances, induce necessary compliance
with regulations. MSHA believes that the emphasis in the certification and qualification programs should be on maintaining
the integrity of the certifications and the qualifications that are granted by ensuring that only those individuals
who adequately discharge the obligations which a certification requires continue to hold such certification. The
status of being certified or qualified is a privilege, not a right, and only those who carry out the responsibilities
that are inherent in these credentials should be permitted to hold them.

Uniform decertification procedures would provide another approach for MSHA to direct a change in the actions and
attitudes of certified and qualified persons who do not comply with health and safety regulations. Temporary or permanent
decertification should compel compliance with the law, as decertification could adversely affect that person's
livelihood, and in the most severe instances, result in loss of employment. This proposed rule will encourage certified
and qualified persons to maintain their level of competence and follow required procedures, by establishing appropriate
remedial measures when MSHA identifies a certified or qualified person or an approved instructor who is not fulfilling
his or her responsibilities, either deliberately or as the result of accident, oversight, or lack of training. MSHA
believes that establishing uniform decertification procedures will ensure that certified and qualified persons
fulfill their responsibilities with due regard for compliance with safety and health standards.


III. Discussion of Proposed Rule


Section 42.1 Purpose and Scope


This part would establish the criteria and procedures for revocation of the authority given to persons to perform
certain tasks that must be done by a certified or qualified person, or an approved instructor. In general, temporary
or permanent decertification would be directed toward individuals who either repeatedly exhibit clear disregard
for compliance with training, health or safety standards or other relevant regulations, or who commit a particular
offense that is evidence of a serious disregard for the health and safety of miners affected by their activities.
When evidence indicates that a certified person does not adhere to the required procedures that are necessary to fulfill
his or her certified or qualified duties, or has failed to adequately fulfill his or her work responsibilities, the
appropriate MSHA district manager would initiate the decertification process. During the course of the decertification
process, the district manager would determine if the certified person's actions are intentional or the result of
accident, oversight, or lack of training. Based upon the facts in each case, the district manager would decide the
appropriate deterrent or remedial measures to be taken, such as those described below. MSHA intends that the agency's
district managers would also be able to propose temporary or permanent decertification.
The issuance of warning letters, proposal of remedial measures or temporary or permanent decertifications are actions
intended to augment existing enforcement policies and procedures. When a certified person fails to adhere to required
procedures due to accident, oversight, or lack of training, the district manager would generally issue a warning
letter or propose remedial measures, such as additional training. If, after these initial measures are taken, the
certified or qualified person continues to disregard proper procedures, MSHA would pursue temporary or permanent
decertification.

<TEXT>
 

Temporary or permanent decertification would be directed toward individuals who repeatedly exhibit disregard
for health and safety, and also in instances when a particular single offense is of such a serious nature that temporary
or permanent decertification should be pursued. In some cases, a section 110 investigation, resulting in either
the assessment of civil penalties against the certified person or the pursuit of criminal proceedings, will occur
concurrently with temporary or permanent decertification. However, in particularly egregious cases, the district
manager may propose temporary or permanent decertification before any section 110 investigation is completed.
In summary, the district manager may choose to issue a warning letter, propose remedial action, or propose temporary
or permanent decertification prior to, or concurrent with, action taken as a result of a section 110 investigation
within the context of MSHA's current enforcement hierarchy.
Also, the district manager may use these actions in circumstances where civil penalties under section 110(c) of the
Mine Act are not applicable, for example, because the individual in question is not a corporate agent. Decertification
action would allow for actions against individuals in such cases that do not currently receive additional enforcement
actions.
Additionally, while MSHA has authority to enter mine property but cannot cite an operator or contractor for refusal
to allow the agency's examination of dust sampling equipment that is not located on mine property, the district manager
may take action against the responsible certification holders by proposing temporary or permanent decertification
when the certification holders have violated the regulations.
MSHA's current policy and procedures for revocation of approval to be a part 48 training instructor allow the instructor
to present evidence or witnesses to substantiate his or her position, either through a meeting or written submission
to MSHA. The person may appeal adverse actions to the appropriate MSHA administrator. MSHA believes that these same
procedures also would be appropriate for those persons who would be subject to decertification under this proposed
rule. To ensure equitable and uniform treatment in all decertification actions, the scope of this rulemaking would
include all activities for which MSHA issues certifications or qualifications, including the part 48 instructor
program. The proposed rule includes additional provisions for the issuance of warning letters and the person's right
to a post-decertification hearing before the Department of Labor's Office of Administrative Law Judges.
In addition, the proposed rule would address the withdrawal of MSHA's recognition of an individual's State certification
when circumstances warrant such action. MSHA believes that a single rule will afford the same level of due process
for all proposed temporary and permanent decertifications. Because MSHA recognizes many State certification programs,
cooperation between MSHA and State mining agencies is crucial to the success of any decertification program. Federal
and State mine safety and health programs are more effective when the two government bodies operate cooperatively.
In instances where the State confers upon an individual a certification which is recognized by MSHA, the agency would
inform the appropriate State agencies that it has determined that an individual's actions may warrant the temporary
or permanent decertification of the State-issued certification. In those States which have procedures to decertify
individuals, MSHA would work closely with the State to investigate the matter and provide assistance in determining
an appropriate course of action. In those cases where the State concludes that decertification is not appropriate
and decides to take only limited action or no further action, but MSHA continues to believe stringent action is necessary,
MSHA may decide to use the procedures outlined in this proposed rule to terminate MSHA's recognition of the individual's
State certification for purposes of compliance with Federal regulations. MSHA would therefore retain the right
to suspend or terminate its recognition of a person's State certification even if the State has chosen not to pursue
temporary or permanent decertification.


Section 42.2 Definitions


The following definitions would apply in this part:


Administrator.

 Administrator would mean MSHA's Administrator for Coal Mine Safety and Health or Administrator for Metal and Nonmetal
Mine Safety and Health, as appropriate.


Certified.

 Certified would mean certified, qualified, or approved by MSHA, either directly or through a State program recognized
by MSHA, to perform tasks or duties for which this chapter requires such specific authority. Similarly, certification
would mean certification, qualification, or approval.


Decertify.

 Decertify would mean to temporarily or permanently revoke a person's certification, qualification, or approval.
If MSHA recognizes a person's certification by a State, then decertify would mean that MSHA would no longer recognize
that person's State certification for purposes of compliance with this chapter. Decertification would mean temporary
or permanent revocation of a person's certification, qualification, or approval.


Section 42.3 Warning Letter


Proposed  42.3 would provide that when the evidence indicates that a certified person has failed to follow the
tasks set by this chapter, or the person no longer satisfies the requirements for retention of certification, or a
certified person's conduct leads to or contributes to a violation of any training, safety or health standard, the
district manager may send a warning letter to that person by certified mail, return receipt requested. This section
would provide that the district manager may notify the certified person through the warning letter that his or her
conduct has been deficient without requiring any further action, or may require remedial measures to be undertaken
by the certified person. In short, the warning letter must specify the basis for the warning. In some instances, MSHA
may choose to forego the issuance of a warning letter and move directly to issue a notice of proposed action under  42.4
of this part.

<DOCNO> FR941102-1-00028 </DOCNO>

<TEXT>
 

MSHA believes that certain types of deficient conduct on the part of a certified person may not require remedial action
or would not require, or provide a sufficient basis for, the more severe sanctions of temporary or permanent decertification.
In those instances, a warning letter from the district manager to the certified person would be sufficient to put the
certified person on notice that his or her conduct in the performance of regulated duties was not commensurate with
that normally required of a certified individual. The district manager may also include in the letter a statement
that further deficient conduct may lead to decertification action by the Agency. 

Under proposed  42.3(b)(2), the warning letter would also provide a vehicle for the Agency to require the certified
individual to take some remedial action in order to retain his or her status. In these instances, MSHA district managers
would specify what type of remedial action on the part of the certified person would be necessary to retain certification.
MSHA intends that it would also be able to take action, such as allowing the certified person to work only under supervision
or requiring retraining where the circumstances would warrant it. 

The proposed rule in  42.3(b)(3) would also give the certified person 15 days from receipt to respond to the warning
letter from the district manager or to initiate the required remedial action. MSHA foresees that some certified persons
may choose to ignore the warning letter from the district manager, or notify the district manager that they object
to the implementation of remedial action. If no response is forthcoming from the certified person, or the certified
person failed to perform the required remedial action, the district manager would have the option of sending a notice
of proposed action under proposed  42.4 to initiate temporary or permanent decertification. 



Section 42.4 Notice of Proposed Action 



Proposed  42.4(a) would provide that when the evidence indicates that a certified person has not undertaken
remedial action required by the district manager or that the temporary or permanent decertification is warranted
because of the certified person's disregard of training, safety or health standards, or the certified person's conduct
has led to or contributed to a violation of training, safety or health standards, the district manager would notify
the certified person of the proposed action by a certified letter, return receipt requested. 

The notice would contain sufficient information to apprise the person of the action being initiated against him or
her and the basis for the proposed action. Specifically, the notice would inform the certified person under proposed
 42.4(a) (1) and (2) whether the district manager was proposing temporary or permanent decertification. Under
 42.4(b) (1), (2), and (3) of the proposal, the notice would describe how the certified person failed to appropriately
discharge his or her responsibilities. This part of the notice would specifically describe the certified person's
conduct or actions giving rise to the decertification action. Under  42.4(c), the notice also would give the
person 15 calendar days from the date of its receipt to submit information to or request an informational meeting with
the district manager to discuss the proposed action. The notice would inform the person that if he or she fails to respond
within 15 days, the administrative record of the matter would close and MSHA would temporarily or permanently decertify
the person. 

MSHA intends that this notice would not replace the issuance of citations for violations of regulations, but rather
would supplement these normal enforcement actions and would serve as an additional measure to induce compliance.
MSHA anticipates that many cases could be resolved without proceeding to an informational meeting because the certified
person would respond to the notice, submit explanatory information to the district manager, or correct inadequate
performance to the district manager's satisfaction. 

A copy of the notice of proposed action and the return receipt, in conjunction with documentary evidence such as inspectors'
notes or informational submissions, would remain on file in the district office and become a part of the administrative
record of the action under proposed  42.5(c). 

Proposed  42.4(c) would also allow the certified person to submit information in place of or in addition to an
informational meeting. When no informational meeting is requested, the certified person would be able to submit
relevant information to the district manager within 15 calendar days from the date the person received the notice
of proposed action. After this 15-day period, the administrative record would be closed. 



Section 42.5 Informational Meeting 



Section 42.5 of the proposed rule would provide an opportunity for the certified person to present evidence or information
on his or her behalf to the district manager relevant to the circumstances which gave rise to the initiation of the decertification
action. 

Under proposed  42.5(a), if the certified person requests an informational meeting with the district manager
within 15 calendar days from the date of receipt of the warning letter, the district manager would be required to hold
such meeting within 15 calendar days of the certified person's request. MSHA intends that the certified person would
have the right to legal representation at this meeting. 

During the meeting proposed under  42.5(b), the Agency would provide the certified person with an opportunity
to present evidence or witnesses to support his or her position. In addition, this part of the proposed rule under  42.5(b)
(1) through (6) would require the district manager to inform the certified person of the following at the informational
meeting: the deficiencies in performance, and how the certified person had failed to appropriately fulfill required
responsibilities; the proposed remedial action and the reasons for the action; the close of the administrative record
15 calendar days after the informational meeting date to allow for the submission of additional information; the
projected date of the district manager's final decision; and the certified person's right to appeal this decision
to the appropriate administrator under proposed  42.6. MSHA anticipates that the district manager may also
send a letter requesting additional information which the district manager has determined is necessary to make a
decision in the case. Such a letter would set reasonable time limits for the certified person to respond with the requested
information. 

A detailed record of the meeting would be required to be kept under proposed  42.5(c). The record of the informational
meeting would be kept in a format agreed to by the parties, such as a tape-recorded transcription or detailed notes
kept by a designated individual, and would be made a part of the administrative record for the action.

Section 42.6 Notice of District Manager's Decision 



After an informational meeting, if requested, has been held, the district manager would proceed to issue a decision
on the proposed action issued under  42.6. Proposed  42.6 would provide guidance to the district manager
for the form and content of his or her decision. 

Proposed  42.6(a) would set a time limitation for the district manager to act after the administrative record
closes in a decertification case, and would provide that the decision be based on a complete evaluation of the whole
administrative record. The district manager would have 30 days to issue a decision once the administrative record
closes. MSHA believes that the 30-day period is an appropriate amount of time for the district manager to carefully
review and consider all of the evidence, and to issue a written decision. 



Under proposed  42.6(a) (1), (2), and (3), the Agency's district managers would have the power to suspend a person's
certification for a finite period of time; permanently decertify the individual with no opportunity for reapplication;
or allow the district manager to take any other appropriate action such as requiring the individual to undergo additional
training or testing to retain his or her certification. This range of options would give the district manager authority
to address each case in a manner that would be tailored to the facts presented by each case. 

For example, while the Agency has recently permanently decertified seven people after criminal convictions stemming
from respirable dust fraud, 73 people have also been temporarily decertified for periods ranging from one to four
years for respirable dust fraud. Additionally, two training instructors have been permanently decertified and
one training instructor has been temporarily decertified for a three-year period. One person has been temporarily
decertified to perform noise surveys for a two-year period and two individuals have been permanently decertified
from performing noise surveys. One individual has been temporarily decertified as an approved electrical qualifications
instructor for a two-year period. The above pleas or convictions, and related decertification actions, were the
result of criminal charges for offenses ranging from the creation and/or submission of fraudulent respirable dust
samples and cards, noise surveys, and training certificates, through conspiracy, mail fraud and charges under the
Racketeer Influence Corrupt Organizations (RICO) statute. 

When the district manager determines that temporary decertification is appropriate under proposed  42.6(a)(1),
MSHA contemplates that at the end of the suspension period the temporarily decertified person would not be automatically
certified but would make application as any other person to obtain certification. He or she would be required to fulfill
all procedural steps for certification, as well as any additional special conditions that the district manager might
have imposed when the certified person was temporarily decertified. For example, if a certified person was temporarily
decertified and allowed to reapply for certification pending the completion of certain training, the certified
person would need to demonstrate that the training had been completed prior to reapplying for certification. MSHA
has provided procedural guidance for recertification under proposed  42.10 of this rule. 

The proposed rule under  42.6(a)(2) would allow a district manager to order permanent decertification for
any person who had shown evidence of a significant disregard for the health or safety of miners. For example, the Agency
believes that egregious behavior, which may constitute a serious violation of safety and health regulations, exposes
miners to unsafe or unhealthy conditions, and presents a clear disregard for the safety or health of miners, would
warrant the sanction of permanent decertification. MSHA's aforementioned permanent decertifications to date
have focused on such demonstrated behavior. 

The proposed rule under  42.6(b) (1) through (6) would require the administrative record to include certain
information. The content of the administrative record is important in that it would give the certified person a basis
for understanding the nature of the action being taken against him or her and would provide documentation of the evidence
underlying the action. In addition, the district manager would have the ability to review all the relevant facts and
information in the case before reaching a decision. This information would include the notes or transcript from any
informational meeting which was held, as well as other relevant evidence. MSHA believes that other relevant evidence
may include background information such as information on the mine or mines where the certified person worked; relevant
correspondence between the district manager and the certified person concerning the decertification action; any
relevant documentary evidence such as certification papers, or certification examinations; possible district
investigation reports on the actions of the certified person; and any witness statements which were made as part of
the informational meeting or submitted separately to the district manager. Within 30 calendar days after the close
of the administrative record, the district manager would review and evaluate all submissions to the record, and send
a written decision to the certified person informing him or her of the results of the district manager's review.

<TEXT>
 

Proposed  42.6(c) would require that the district manager's decision be in writing and include certain information.
The district manager's written decision would inform the certified person of the district manager's conclusions.
For example, the letter may state that the record contains information which refutes the allegations in the notice
of proposed action, and that the matter has been closed. The decision could contain a description of the remedial action
that the certified person must take in order to retain his or her certification. Finally, the decision could also serve
as a notice of temporary decertification, with time limits and conditions for re-certification, or as a notice of
permanent decertification, if such a result were warranted by the evidence. 

The proposed rule would require that the district manager's written decision detail the specific facts which provide
the basis for the decertification action, and include a clear and concise statement of the reasons for the decision
reached by the district manager. The proposed rule would also provide that the decision would contain notification
of the certified person's right to appeal any adverse decision to the administrator under  42.6(c)(3). Section
42.6(c)(4) would also require that the district manager's decision contain a statement that the administrative
record is available for review at the MSHA district office, and that the certified person may obtain a copy upon request.
Because certain appeal rights may attach, MSHA is proposing under  42.6(d) that the Agency would send the decision
by certified mail, return receipt requested. The decision would be effective 15 calendar days after receipt by the
certified person, unless it is appealed. 



Section 42.7 Appeal to the Administrator



Proposed  42.7 would allow a certified person to appeal an adverse decision of temporary or permanent decertification
or other remedial action ordered by the district manager to the appropriate MSHA Administrator for Coal Mine Safety
and Health or Metal/Nonmetal Mine Safety and Health. This appeal would be required to be submitted in writing. 

Specifically, proposed  42.7(a) would allow a certified or qualified person to appeal, in writing, the decision
of the district manager to the appropriate MSHA administrator. The administrator must receive this appeal within
15 calendar days from the individual's receipt of the certified letter containing the district manager's decision
notice ordering remedial action, or temporary or permanent decertification. 

Upon receipt of the written appeal, the administrator would send written acknowledgment of the appeal to the certified
person, including an acknowledgment of an automatic stay of the remedial action or temporary or permanent decertification.
The stay would remain in effect pending the outcome of the appeal under proposed  42.7(b) (1) and (2), and would
allow a certified person to retain certification until the administrator reached a decision in the matter. MSHA believes
that an automatic stay would be appropriate because the matter would still be under consideration by the Agency. The
decision by the administrator would not be reached until after the administrator has had the opportunity to review
the record and make a decision. 

Under  42.7(b)(3) of the proposal, the district office would be required to forward a copy of the administrative
record to the administrator. 
In addition, the proposal would allow the certified person to request a meeting with the administrator under proposed
 42.7(b)(4). Such a meeting must be requested by the certified person within 15 days of the certified person's
receipt of the administrator's written acknowledgment of the appeal. When such a meeting is requested by the certified
person, MSHA intends that the administrator would be permitted to consider evidence in addition to that presented
to and considered by the district manager. MSHA intends that this subsection would allow the certified person to submit
relevant information to the administrator in lieu of a face-to-face meeting. 

Proposed  42.7(c) would provide the administrator with a time limit of 30 days to issue a written decision after
either his or her receipt of the administrative record and district manager's decision, or 30 days after his or her
meeting with the certified person. MSHA believes that this is a reasonable amount of time for the administrator to
review the evidence and issue a reasoned decision. In some instances, post-meeting submissions to the administrator
may extend the time to issue a written decision. 

Section 42.7(c) (1) and (2) would provide that the administrator would have several possible options after his or
her evaluation of all of the evidence. The administrator could issue a decision that upholds the decision of the district
manager, and in such a case the remedial action or temporary or permanent decertification would become effective
30 days after receipt by the certified person except as provided in  42.8(e). The administrator could also issue
a decision overturning the district manager's decision. Finally, the administrator may also refer the matter back
to the district manager with appropriate instructions, based on the receipt of new evidence or information that was
not available to, or considered by, the district manager at the time that his or her decision was rendered. 

Proposed  42.7(d) would require that the written decision contain a clear statement of the basis for the decision,
including specific references to the evidence contained in the record that was considered in arriving at the determination.
The written decision would be served upon the certified person by certified mail, return receipt requested.

Section 42.8 Hearing Before an Administrative Law Judge 



Because the individual who is temporarily or permanently decertified may suffer a reduction in pay and possibly loss
of his or her livelihood, the issue of due process for such individuals is a central concern of this rulemaking. MSHA
is therefore committed to providing meaningful procedural safeguards at an appropriate level of due process. 

Morrisey

 v. 

Brewer

, 408 U.S. 471 (1972). Thus, MSHA's multi-level review scheme within the Agency incorporating informal pre-decertification
proceedings such as a notice of charges, explanation of the evidence, and an opportunity for the certified person
to present ``his side of the story'' should be sufficient to satisfy the test of ``what process is due'' when the informal
pre-decertification proceedings are followed by a full post-decertification evidentiary hearing. 

Cleveland Board of Education

 v. 

Loudermill

, 470 U.S. 532 (1985). MSHA has carefully considered whether a certified person should get a formal pre-decertification
evidentiary hearing. At this point in the rulemaking process, MSHA believes that the procedural due process safeguards
proposed here are adequate under the requirements of the United States Constitution. 

In addition, MSHA believes that the potential harm to miner health and safety which may result from protracted pre-decertification
litigation is an issue which must be carefully considered. Therefore, under proposed  42.8(a)(1), a person
whose temporary or permanent decertification has been upheld by the administrator may obtain a 

de novo

 hearing before the Office of Administrative Law Judges, United States Department of Labor, by filing a request for
a hearing with the administrator within 30 calendar days after receipt of the administrator's decision. The administrator
would refer the request for hearing, along with the district manager's decision, and the administrator's decision
to the Office of Administrative Law Judges within 10 calendar days of receipt of the hearing request. 

The starting date of the temporary or permanent decertification would not be affected by the certified person's decision
to obtain a post-decertification hearing. The temporary or permanent decertification would be effective 30 days
after the certified person's receipt of the administrator's decision, except as provided in proposed  42.8(e).


The request for a hearing under 42.8(a)(2) would include a summary of the issues involved and the specific objections
that the certified person has to the administrator's decision. 

Under proposed  42.8(c), the administrative law judge assigned to hear the case would expedite the hearing
of the case because of the possibility that temporary or permanent decertification may significantly impair the
certified person's livelihood. In addition to expediting the hearing, the administrative law judge would render
his or her final decision in the case within 45 days of the close of the record. 

Proposed  42.8(d) would provide that decertification hearings before the Department of Labor Office of Administrative
Law Judges would be governed by the rules of practice and procedure for hearings before the Office of Administrative
Law Judges at 29 CFR part 18. 

Under proposed  42.8(e), a request for a stay would be filed within 30 calendar days after receipt of the administrator's
decision. The request for a stay would automatically stay the administrator's decision until the administrative
law judge could rule on the stay request. The automatic stay would allow the administrative law judge sufficient time
to obtain jurisdiction to rule on the request for a stay, and it would allow the status of the certified person to remain
unchanged until the stay request was decided by the administrative law judge. 

In determining whether to grant a stay, the proposal would require under  42.8(f) that the administrative law
judge would be required to consider the certified person's likelihood of success on the merits, and the potential
harm to mine safety and health if the certified person were allowed to continue his or her work during the pendency of
the case before the administrative law judge. The administrative law judge would also be required to clearly state
the reasons for the granting or denial of a stay in any subsequent order concerning the granting or denial of the stay.


MSHA envisions that a decision of the case rendered by an administrative law judge could then be appealed to the appropriate
United States Court of Appeals. In the Mine Act, the Congress established a scheme whereby judicial review of all record-based
Agency determinations is available only in the courts of appeal. After fully examining this statutory review scheme,
MSHA believes that all judicial review of Secretarial action under the Mine Act lies exclusively in the courts of appeal,
whether such review is specifically provided or whether the Mine Act is silent as to judicial review. See, 

Bituminous Coal Operators' Ass'n

. v. 

Marshall

, 82 F.R.D. 350 (D.D.C. 1979). 





Section 42.9 Notice of Decertification.



After a decision to temporarily or permanently decertify an individual becomes final, the district manager would
immediately notify, in writing, the mine operator or operators for whom the certified person performs such work that
he or she has been temporarily or permanently decertified. The district manager would also notify the appropriate
Coal Mine Safety and Health or Metal and Nonmetal Mine Safety and Health Technical Compliance and Investigation Division
(TCID) and the Qualification and Certification Unit of MSHA. The TCID would notify other district offices of the temporary
or permanent decertification so that all districts would be aware of the change in status of the certified person.

Section 42.10 Recertification 


A person who has been temporarily decertified may apply for recertification by MSHA after the end of the temporary
decertification period. To obtain recertification, the person must fulfill the requirements for certification
or qualification as required under the applicable regulations before a new certification or qualification is issued.
In addition, if the district manager, administrator or administrative law judge imposed additional requirements
for recertification beyond the basic application, the certified person must also show that those requirements have
been fulfilled. MSHA intends that applications for recertification would be forwarded by the Qualification and
Certification Unit to the Technical Compliance and Investigation Division, which is responsible for coordinating
those cases involving revocation of certification. By transferring cases involving decertification from the district
offices to a single administrative office, the Agency would eliminate the likelihood that a person whose certification
is suspended or revoked could become recertified without fulfilling the necessary requirements. 


IV. Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act 


The analysis contained in this preamble meets the Agency's responsibilities under Executive Order 12866 and the
Regulatory Flexibility Act. Under Executive Order 12866, MSHA has made a preliminary assessment of the costs and
benefits of the proposed rule. The proposed rule does not meet the criteria of a significant regulatory action and,
therefore, MSHA has not prepared a separate analysis of costs and benefits. 
The Executive Order also requires Federal agencies to seek the views of State governments on regulatory actions that
would affect them. MSHA intends to work closely with the States that have certification programs to coordinate implementation
of this proposal. The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires MSHA to consider the proposed rule's impact on small entities.
MSHA defines small entities as mines with 20 or fewer employees. This proposal would not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of such small mines. 
The proposal addresses procedures for decertifying individuals, either temporarily or permanently, who have failed
to maintain the knowledge and skills required to perform certain tasks or duties of an ``approved,'' ``certified''
or ``qualified'' person or who have failed to comply with the law in their role as an approved, certified or qualified
person. Any costs associated with the requirement that an individual be certified to perform a specific task or duty
are not included in this analysis. Such costs are attributed to the Agency's existing certification requirements,
and this rule does not impose any new such requirements. 
MSHA estimates that about 105,000 individuals have been certified by the Agency to perform required procedures.
Many of these individuals have been certified in more than one area. In addition, MSHA estimates that about 20,000
mine foremen have been certified by State governments. 
It is clear from MSHA's enforcement experience that some certified persons do not adhere to the Agency's requirements.
Therefore, the proposed rule establishes procedures for temporary or permanent decertification of such individuals.

MSHA has not attributed any costs to the pay loss or potential loss of employment a certified person faces if Agency
action ultimately leads to that individual's decertification. Such costs result from the individual's failure
to follow Federal requirements, which in many instances could potentially endanger other miners. As such, these
costs are far outweighed by no longer allowing the individual to jeopardize the safety and health of other miners.
For the certified person, these losses would occur from the loss of pay differential or ultimately the loss of employment.
For the mine operator, these losses might range from the cost of retraining the individual to significant lost production
if the operator cannot readily replace someone who has been decertified. In order for the mine to continue production
after MSHA has decertified an individual, the mine operator would need to hire a replacement who has the proper certification
or qualification or have one of the more experienced miners achieve certification or qualification status. 
MSHA has not attempted to calculate the financial losses that might accrue should an Agency decertification action
ultimately be overturned on appeal or if an individual convinces the district manager that decertification action
in not warranted. At this time, MSHA is unable to estimate how many such cases would occur. 
MSHA anticipates that the majority of actions under the proposed rule would begin with a letter from the MSHA district
manager to the certified person warning that the person's conduct in performing certain tasks is deficient. As proposed,
the warning letter may or may not require that remedial measures be undertaken by the individual.

MSHA estimates that it would issue about 50 warning letters each year for the first few years_about half of which would
require some remedial action such as passing a skills test or undergoing retraining. Of the 50 warning letters each
year, MSHA estimates that about 20 would be issued to mine foremen who must be certified to perform various inspection
and examination activities, about 25 would be issued for coal dust sampling and 5 would be issued to miners certified
to perform such activities as electrical work or blasting. After the first few years, MSHA anticipates that the Agency
would need to issue fewer warning letters as mine operators and certified individuals become more aware of the Agency's
intent to ensure that these individuals perform their tasks as required. 


 The proposed rule also would allow the district manager to forego the warning letter and send out a notice proposing
to temporarily or permanently decertify an individual who repeatedly exhibits disregard for health and safety,
and also in instances where a particular single offense is of such a serious nature that decertification is warranted.
MSHA estimates that the Agency annually would issue about 10 temporary and 10 permanent decertifications without
first issuing a warning letter. MSHA expects that temporary decertifications would last an average of one year and
would require the individual to reapply for certification and, perhaps, complete additional requirements, such
as retraining or testing. In all, MSHA estimates that the Agency would undertake in total about 70 decertification-related
actions a year (50 actions beginning with a warning letter and 20 actions without a warning letter). 


 MSHA has attributed most of the costs of this proposal to legal fees. In many instances, MSHA expects that the certified
persons facing adverse Agency action would hire an attorney. The costs of such legal fees would vary widely depending
on the nature of the action, the level to which the case is appealed, and the legal fees of the attorney. Although a few
individuals may not seek legal counsel, others might retain an attorney upon the initial receipt of a warning letter.
In some instances, the attorney's services would not be needed beyond the initial response to the district manager.
In other instances, in-depth legal advice may be sought at each level of appeal all the way through the Federal Court
of Appeals. In general, however, MSHA believes that most individuals would not pursue appeal beyond the level of the
Department of Labor's Administrative Law Judges. MSHA estimates that initially about 30 percent of the 70 actions
taken by the Agency each year (or 21 individual cases) would result in appeals to the Departmental level. Legal fees
vary from region to region and law firm to law firm, ranging from as high as $400 per hour to as low as $50 per hour. In this
analysis, MSHA has used an average cost of $120 per hour. Assuming it takes an attorney about 40 hours to prepare and
appeal a client's case up through the Departmental level, costs of the proposed rule arising from legal fees would
total about $100,800 a year, or $4,800 per contest. Of course, the fees for appealing a single case through the Federal
Court of Appeals may total significantly more than $4,800. Conversely, the use of an attorney to draft a response to
the district manager to a warning letter could cost as little as $50. 


 In addition, MSHA has assumed that the certified person would have to take time off from work to address decertification
actions initiated by the Agency. The average total compensation (wages plus fringe benefits) for a certified person
ranges from $24.74 to $28.50 per hour or an average of $26.50 per hour. Assuming that all 70 certified persons each takes
an average of 20 hours off from work to avail themselves of the procedures of the proposal, then the annual loss of income
attributable to responding to Agency's actions under the proposal would total about $37,100. 


 MSHA estimates that the total annual cost of this proposed rule to be about $137,900 ($100,800 related to legal fees
and $37,100 related to income loss during the appeal process). The Agency specifically requests comments concerning
these cost estimates; comments, including rationale, should be as specific as possible. 


 Although MSHA does not have data at this time to estimate quantitative benefits, the Agency has determined that the
qualitative benefits of this proposed rule are improved safety and health conditions for miners. The possibility
of a temporary or permanent decertification should be an effective incentive for certified and qualified persons
to perform their duties and tasks as required. The potential loss of pay or possible unemployment resulting from decertification
should serve as a strong, economic incentive for certified persons to comply with the required procedures. As the
tasks and duties of certified persons are critical to the safety and health of miners, ensuring that these activities
are performed in the required manner should result in fewer fatalities, injuries, and accidents. 


 A recent example of the need for formal decertification procedures involves the submission of fraudulent respirable
coal mine dust samples by some individuals certified to take them. To ensure the integrity of the respirable dust program,
the Agency needs more efficient decertification procedures to serve as a more effective deterrent to such illegal
activities. 


 As a result of plea agreements or criminal convictions stemming from respirable dust fraud, MSHA has permanently
decertified 7 people and temporarily decertified another 73 individuals for periods ranging from one to four years
for respirable dust fraud. The Agency temporarily decertified about sixty-five percent of these individuals for
a one-year period and about thirty percent for a three-year period.

Additionally, as the result of recent investigations, MSHA has permanently decertified two training instructors
and temporarily decertified one training instructor for a three-year period. As a result of continuing criminal
proceedings, the Agency also temporarily decertified for a two-year period one person who performed noise surveys
and permanently decertified two individuals who performed noise surveys. MSHA temporarily decertified for a two-year
period another individual who was an approved electrical qualifications instructor.

Approval and Promulgation of an Implementation Plan for Vehicle Miles Traveled; Indiana 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) proposes to approve a request for a State Implementation
Plan (SIP) revision, addressing the Lake and Porter County ozone nonattainment area, submitted by the State of Indiana
for the purpose of offsetting any growth in emissions from growth in vehicle miles traveled (VMT) or number of vehicle
trips, and to attain reduction in motor vehicle emissions, in combination with other emission reduction requirements,
as necessary to comply with Reasonable Further Progress (RFP) milestones and attainment requirements of the Clean
Air Act (Act). The rationale for this proposed approval is set forth below; additional information is available at
the address indicated below. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Background 


Section 182(d)(1)(A) of the Act, as amended in 1990 (Act), requires States containing ozone nonattainment areas
classified as ``severe'' pursuant to section 181(a) of the Act to adopt transportation control measures (TCMs) and
transportation control strategies to offset any growth in emissions from growth in VMT or number of vehicle trips,
and to attain reductions in motor vehicle emissions (in combination with other emission reduction requirements)
as necessary to comply with the Act's RFP milestones and attainment requirements. The requirements for establishing
a VMT Offset program are discussed in the April 16, 1992, General Preamble to title I of the Act (57 FR 13498), in addition
to section 182(d)(1)(A) of the Act. 
For certain programs required under the Act (including VMT-Offset), USEPA had earlier adopted a policy pursuant
to section 110(k)(4) of the Act to conditionally approve SIPs that committed to provide the USEPA with specific enforceable
measures by a date certain. That interpretation was challenged in 

Natural Resources Defense Council v. Browner

, consolidated lawsuits brought in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. In a full
opinion, dated May 6, 1994 (and in a March 8, 1994 Order and April 22, 1994 Amended Order issued earlier), the Court found
that USEPA's conditional approval interpretation exceeded USEPA's statutory authority. While the Court did not
specifically address the VMT Offset program in its orders or opinions, USEPA believes that the Court's general conclusions
that the USEPA's construction of the conditional approval provision was unlawful precludes USEPA from taking action
to approve any submitted VMT Offset committal SIPs. 
On September 10, 1993, the USEPA published a proposed rule (58 FR 47701) to conditionally approve Indiana's commitment
for the VMT-Offset requirement. In light of the Court opinion, Indiana has withdrawn the committal SIP in a letter
dated July 5, 1994. 
In light of the outcome of the litigation, USEPA has decided that it would be appropriate to interpret the VMT Offset
provision of the Act to account for how States can practicably comply with each of the provision's elements. The VMT
Offset provision requires that States submit by November 15, 1992, specific enforceable TCMs and strategies to offset
any growth in emissions from growth in VMT or number of vehicle trips sufficient to allow total area emissions to comply
with the RFP and attainment requirements of the Act.

The USEPA has observed that these three elements (i.e., offsetting growth in mobile source emissions, attainment
of the RFP reduction, and attainment of the ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) create a timing problem
of which Congress was perhaps not fully aware. As discussed in USEPA's April 16, 1992, General Preamble to title I,
ozone nonattainment areas affected by this provision were not otherwise required to submit SIPs that show attainment
of the 1996 15% RFP milestone until November 15, 1993, and likewise are not required to demonstrate post-1996 RFP and
attainment of the NAAQS until November 15, 1994. The SIP demonstrations due on November 15, 1993, and on November 15,
1994, are broader in scope than growth in VMT or trips in that they necessarily address emission trends and control
measures for non motor vehicle emission sources and, in the case of attainment demonstrations, complex photochemical
modeling studies. 
The USEPA does not believe that Congress intended the VMT Offset provision to advance the dates for these broader submissions.
Further, USEPA believes that the November 15, 1992, date would not allow sufficient time for States to have fully developed
specific sets of measures that would comply with all of the elements of the VMT Offset requirements of section 182(d)(1)(A)
over the long term. Consequently, USEPA believes it would be appropriate to interpret the Act to provide the following
alternative set of staged deadlines for submittal of elements of the VMT Offset SIP. 
Under this interpretation, the three required elements of section 182(d)(1)(A) are separable, and can be divided
into three separate submissions that could be submitted on different dates. Section 179(a) of the Act, in establishing
how USEPA would be required to apply mandatory sanctions if a State fails to submit a full SIP also provides that the
sanctions clock starts if a State fails to submit one or more SIP elements, as determined by the Administrator. The
USEPA believes that this language provides USEPA the authority to determine that the different elements of a SIP submission
are separable. Moreover, given the continued timing problems addressed above, USEPA believes it is appropriate
to allow States to separate the VMT Offset SIP into three elements, each to be submitted at different times: (1) The
initial requirement to submit TCMs that offset growth in emissions; (2) the requirement to comply with the 15% periodic
reduction requirement of the Act; and (3) the requirement to comply with the post-1996 periodic reduction and attainment
requirements of the Act. 
Under this approach, the first element, the emissions offset element, was due on November 15, 1992. The USEPA believes
this element is not necessarily dependent on the development of the other elements. The State could submit the emissions
growth offset element independent of an analysis of that element's consistency with the periodic reduction and attainment
requirements of the Act. Emissions trends from other sources need not be considered to show compliance with this offset
requirement. As submitting this element in isolation does not implicate the timing problem of advancing deadlines
for RFP and attainment demonstrations, USEPA does not believe it is necessary to extend the statutory deadline for
submittal of the emissions growth offset element. 
The second element, which requires the VMT Offset SIP to comply with the 15% RFP requirement of the Act, was due on November
15, 1993, which is the same date on which the 15% RFP SIP itself was due under section 182(b)(1) of the Act. The USEPA believes
it is reasonable to extend the deadline for this element to the date on which the entire 15% SIP was due, as this allows
States to develop the comprehensive strategy to address the 15% reduction requirement and assure that the TCM elements
required under section 182(d)(1)(A) are consistent with the remainder of the 15% demonstration. Indeed, USEPA believes
that only upon submittal of the broader 15% plan can a State have had the necessary opportunity to coordinate it's VMT
strategy with it's 15% plan.

The third element, which requires the VMT Offset SIP to comply with the post-1996 RFP and attainment requirements
of the Act, will be due on November 15, 1994, the statutory deadline for those broader submissions. The USEPA believes
it is reasonable to extend the deadline for this element to the date on which the post-1996 RFP and attainment SIPs are
due for the same reasons it is reasonable to extend the deadline for the second element. First, it is arguably impossible
for a State to make the showing required by section 182(d)(1)(A) for the third element until the broader demonstrations
have been developed by the State. Moreover, allowing States to develop the comprehensive strategy to address post-1996
RFP and attainment by providing a fuller opportunity to assure that the TCM elements comply with the broader RFP and
attainment demonstrations, will result in a better program for reducing emissions in the long term. 
On November 17, 1993, Indiana submitted to USEPA documentation to fulfill the first and second elements of the VMT-Offset
SIP. A public hearing was held on December 14, 1993, and documentation on the public hearing was submitted to complete
the SIP revision request. Indiana does not at this time anticipate the need for additional TCMs to meet the attainment
demonstration requirement but will submit any necessary TCMs with the attainment demonstration SIP. 


Evaluation of the State Submittal



Section 182(d)(1)(A) of the Act requires the State to offset any growth in emissions from growth in VMT. As discussed
in the General Preamble, the purpose is to prevent a growth in motor vehicle emissions from canceling out the emission
reduction benefits of the federally mandated programs in the Act. The USEPA interprets this provision to require
that sufficient measures be adopted so that projected motor vehicle volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions will
never be higher during the ozone season in one year than during the ozone season in the year before. When growth in VMT
and vehicle trips would otherwise cause a motor vehicle emissions upturn, this upturn must be prevented. The emissions
level at the point of upturn becomes a ceiling on motor vehicle emissions. This requirement applies to projected emissions
in the years between the submission of the SIP revision and the attainment deadline and is above and beyond the separate
requirements for the RFP and the attainment demonstrations. The ceiling level is defined therefore, up to the point
of upturn, as motor vehicle emissions that would occur in the ozone season of that year, with VMT growth, if all measures
for that area in that year were implemented as required by the Act. When this curve begins to turn up due to growth in VMT
or vehicle trips, the ceiling becomes a fixed value. The ceiling line would include the effects of Federal measures
such as new motor vehicle standards, phase II RVP controls, and reformulated gasoline, as well as the Act mandated
SIP requirements.

The State of Indiana has demonstrated in its submittal of November 17, 1993, that the predicted growth in VMT in Lake
and Porter Counties, Indiana, is not expected to result in a growth in motor vehicle emissions that will negate the
effects of the reductions mandated by the Act. Further, Indiana has projected motor vehicle emissions to the year
2007 and, using the most current socioeconomic data, has not predicted an upturn in motor vehicle emissions. In the
event that the projected socioeconomic data and associated VMT grow more rapidly than currently predicted, Indiana
is required by section 182(c)(5) to track actual VMT starting with 1996 and every three years there after to demonstrate
that the actual VMT is equal to or less than the projected VMT. TCMs will be required to offset VMT that is above the projected
levels (section 182(c)(5)).

The VMT offset submittal from Indiana dated November 17, 1993, contains the final report ``TCMs to Offset Emissions
from VMT Growth in Northwestern Indiana.'' The report used the most current socioeconomic data and the travel network
model in conjunction with the MOBILE5a to estimate mobile source emissions to the attainment year of 2007.

This report also documents the progress Indiana has made in evaluating TCMs to reduce growth in VMT and thus reduce
emissions. Indiana may choose to take credit for TCM emission reductions as part of the post 1996 RFP requirement or
to meet the attainment requirement. Not only has Indiana evaluated the effectiveness and predicted impact of a number
of TCMs but actual implementation of selected TCMs has been ongoing. For example, a new inter city bus route to link
the cities of Hammond, East Chicago and Gary, Indiana has been started. These three cities have operated established
intra city bus routes for many years and this is the first route to link the already existing transit services for these
cities.

<TEXT>
 

These specific TCMs however, are not a part of the current SIP revision request and are not a required portion of this
SIP revision. Thus, Indiana is not currently taking credit for the emission reductions from these TCM measures and
the State is not bound to implement or continue to implement any specific TCMs. These measures, however, illustrate
Indiana's work in evaluating and implementing TCMs to meet the requirements of the Act. Also, the TCMs may be used in
subsequent SIP submittals as necessary to meet the post 1996 RFP requirement or the attainment requirement.

Additionally, Indiana is implementing TCMs to complement the employee commute options (ECO) program which requires
a 25 percent reduction in single occupancy vehicle usage for home to work trips for employers of 100 or more persons.
Activities include: Planning and promotion, new bus routes, improved transit service, and carpooling match-up
services. A number of TCMs have been implemented in Lake and Porter Counties through use of the Department of Transportation's
congestion mitigation and air quality funds under the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act. These
projects have included: purchasing clean fueled buses, operation of new bus service, improved transit service and
ECO activities. In conclusion, Indiana is evaluating and implementing TCMs as expeditiously as possible even when
the 
emissions projections indicate that mobile source emissions will continue to decline without additional TCMs.

Indiana submitted a 15 percent RFP SIP for northwest Indiana to the USEPA in November 1993, but the submittal was found
incomplete in a letter dated January 25, 1994. The RFP SIP lacked enforceable regulations and a public hearing. The
public hearing was held on March 29, 1994. Although the RFP SIP is still incomplete due to the lack of enforceable regulations.
Indiana's submittal does indicate that TCM's would not be necessary to attain the 15% reduction required by 1996.
The RFP SIP asserts that a 15% reduction in emissions could be achieved by 1996 through the feasible measures detailed
in the SIP submittal. Under the approach contained in the submittal, the State would achieve the 15% reduction in VOCs
through measures other than relying on TCMs. The majority of the reduction would be obtained from stationary source
shut downs. Other measures include enhanced vehicle inspection and maintenance and reformulated gasoline. For
the attainment demonstration which is due November 14, 1994, Indiana has indicated that it will include TCMs as necessary
to reach attainment.



Summary of Findings



In the requested SIP revision submittal, Indiana has projected motor vehicle emissions until the statutory attainment
year of 2007 using the most recent population and economic growth projections. These projections went through public
hearing and comment on December 14, 1993. Using current VMT forecasts, these projections show that motor vehicle
emissions are not expected to rise above the ceiling level through the year 2007.

In addition, Indiana has identified and evaluated a number of specific TCMs to reduce single occupancy vehicle usage.
Several of these identified TCMs are currently being implemented. The VMT offset submittal from Indiana dated November
17, 1993, contains the final report ``TCMs to Offset Emissions from VMT Growth in Northwestern Indiana.'' This report
documents the progress Indiana has made in evaluating TCMs to reduce growth in VMT and thus reduce emissions. Indiana
has evaluated the effectiveness and predicted impact of a number of TCMs through actual implementation of selected
TCMs, although these TCMs are not a part of the SIP revision and Indiana is not taking emission reduction credit for
these TCMs.

Indiana has met the first and second requirements of the VMT offset plan. Indiana has identified and evaluated TCMs
to reduce VMT. Regarding the first requirement, Indiana has demonstrated in the November 17, 1993, submittal that
projected growth in VMT is not expected to result in an increase in emissions from motor vehicles and is not expected
to negate the progress in emissions reductions required to meet attainment of the standard by 2007. Regarding the
second element, Indiana listed in its incomplete 15% RFP submittal feasible measures intended to meet the 15% reduction
by 1996 without relying on TCMs and has shown that further TCMs are not necessary to meet the second element of section
182(d)(1)(A). The third requirement is for Indiana to use TCMs as necessary to meet the attainment of the standard.
This third requirement will be submitted with the attainment demonstration SIP and will be addressed in future proposed
and final rules.

III. Proposed Rulemaking Action and Solicitation of Comments 



Based on the submittal accompanying the State's SIP revision request, USEPA proposes to approve the SIP revision
submitted by the State of Indiana as satisfying the first two of the three VMT offset plan requirements. Public comments
are solicited on the requested SIP revision and on USEPA's proposed rulemaking action. Comments received by December
2, 1994, will be considered in the development of USEPA's final rule. 

This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this regulatory
action from Executive Order 12866 review. 

Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to any SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq

., USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small
entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on
a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises,
and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 

SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on small entities affected. Moreover, due to
the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would
constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Act forbids USEPA to base its actions
concerning SIPs on such grounds. See 

Union Electric Co. v. U.S. E.P.A.

, 427 U.S. 246, 256-66 (S. Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2).

ACTION:

 Notice of meeting of the peer reviewers.

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>

Notice is hereby given that a meeting of the peer reviewers of the proposed hazard ranking document of section 112(g)
of the Clean Air Act Amendments (1990 Amendments) will be held.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information: 

The main purpose of this meeting is to allow the public to give comment to the peer reviewers on the proposed hazard ranking
technical support document which describes the EPA's approach to relatively rank the 189 Hazardous Air Pollutants
(HAP) listed in the 1990 Amendments. The section 112(g) rulemaking was proposed April 1, 1994 (59 FR 15504). Copies
of the technical support document are available via the Technology Transfer Network [a network of electronic bulletin
boards developed and operated by the EPA's Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, phone (919) 541-5384]
or by contacting the EPA office of Air and Radiation Docket [Docket 

#

 A-91-64, phone (202) 260-7548]. 



The designated federal official for the meeting will be Mr. Robert Kellam. Anyone wishing to make an oral presentation
at the meeting should contact Dr. Jane Caldwell (U.S. EPA, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, Emission
Standards Division, Maildrop 13, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711 (919) 541-0328 Fax: (919) 541-4028)
by November 15, 1994. In general each individual or group making an oral presentation will be limited to fifteen minutes
but the time allowed will be dependent on the number of speakers. Seating at the meeting will be on a first come first
serve basis. 

Section 112 of the 1990 Amendments establishes a control technology-based program to reduce stationary source emissions
of HAP. In section 112(b) of the Clean Air Act, the 189 HAP are defined as hazardous for the purposes of regulation. Section
112(g) requires control technology reviews for new, modified and reconstructed major sources of these pollutants.
Increases in hazardous air pollution emissions from existing major sources are not considered a modification if
they can be offset by equal or greater decreases in HAP deemed ``more hazardous''. Furthermore, the HAP ``with no safety
threshold of exposure'' may only be offset by other such ``nonthreshold'' pollutants. Therefore, threshold and
nonthreshold pollutants must be identified and are subject to offsetting restrictions. The proposed section 112(g)
rulemaking contains the EPA's guidance that identifies the relative hazard to human health of these hazardous pollutants
and application of that characterization for determining allowing offsets.

Sodium Chlorate; Exemption from the Requirement of a Tolerance 




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA proposes to establish an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of sodium chlorate in or on
the raw agricultural commodity potato when applied as a defoliant in accordance with good agricultural practices.
The Interregional Research Project No. 4 (IR-4) requested this exemption. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Interregional Research Project No. 4 (IR-4), New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station, P.O. Box 231, Rutgers
University, New Brunswick, NJ 08903, has submitted pesticide petition (PP) 2E4148 to EPA on behalf of the Agricultural
Experiment Station of California. Pesticide petition 2E4148 requested that the Administrator, pursuant to section
408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a(e), establish an exemption from the requirement
of a tolerance for residues of sodium chlorate on potatoes when used as a defoliant in accordance with good agricultural
practices.


The data submitted in the petition and all other relevant material have been evaluated. The toxicological data considered
in support of the exemption from the requirement of a tolerance include:
1. A 90-day subchronic feeding study in rats given gavage doses of 0, 10, 100, or 1,000 milligrams (mg)/kilogram(kg)/day
with a no-observed-effect level (NOEL) of 100 mg/kg. Rats given doses of 1,000 mg/kg/day showed decreased hemoglobin
concentration, hematocrit, and red blood cell counts.
2. A subchronic study in monkeys given drinking water containing 25, 50, 100, 200, or 400 mg/liter of sodium chlorate
with no adverse clinical or hematological findings reported.
3. Mutagenicity studies including gene mutation tests in Salmonella species (Ames test) and Chinese hamster lung
cells, structural chromosome aberrations test in mice (a micronucleus assay for chromosome damage), and other genotoxic
effects (unscheduled DNA synthesis in HeLa cells) were all negative for mutagenic effects. A DNA repair test was positive
for primary DNA damage in repair-deficient bacterial cultures of Escherichia coli.
4. A developmental toxicity study in rats given gavage doses 0, 10, 100, and 1,000 mg/kg with no maternal or developmental
toxicity observed under the conditions of the study.
The toxicology data provided are sufficient to demonstrate that there are no foreseeable human health hazards likely
to arise from dietary exposure resulting from the proposed use of sodium chlorate on potatoes.
The nature of the residues in plants is understood; sodium chlorate will be reduced to sodium chloride in the presence
of organic material. The residues in plants will, therefore, be composed of sodium chlorate and sodium chloride.
Magnitude of residue studies report no detectable residues of sodium chlorate on potatoes from the proposed use pattern.
There is also no reasonable expectation of secondary residues in meat, milk, poultry, or eggs from the proposed use.
No enforcement actions based on the level of residues in food are expected. Therefore, the requirement for an analytical
method for enforcement purposes is not applicable to the exemption from the requirement of a tolerance.
Based on the information and data considered, the Agency concludes that a tolerance is not needed to protect the public
health. Therefore, it is proposed that the exemption from the requirement of a tolerance be established as set forth
below.
Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide, under the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) as amended, which contains any of the ingredients listed herein, may request
within 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register

 that this rulemaking proposal be referred to an Advisory Committee in accordance with section 408(e) of the FFDCA.
Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulation. Comments must bear a notation
indicating the document control number, [PP 2E4148/P589]. All written comments filed in response to this petition
will be available in the Public Response and Program Resources Branch, at the address given above from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday, except legal holidays. 

Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order (i.e., Regulatory Impact Analysis,
review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant'' as those
actions likely to lead to a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious
inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering
the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues
arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order.

Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).

Pasteuria Penetrans; Proposed Exemption from the Requirement of a Tolerance



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA proposes establishing an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of the biological pesticide


Pasteuria penetrans

 in or on all raw agricultural commodities when used as a nematicide in producing fruits and vegetables, except roots
and tubers, in greenhouses. Walt Disney World Co. requested this exemption.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 EPA received from Walt Disney World Co., P.O. Box 10000, Lake Buena Vista, FL 32830, pesticide petition (PP) 4F4387
on July 14, 1994, proposing to amend 40 CFR part 180 by establishing a regulation under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic
Act, 21 U.S.C. 346a, to exempt from the requirement of a tolerance the residues of the biological pesticide 

Pasteuria penetrans

 in or on all raw agricultural commodities when used as a nematicide in producing fruits and vegetables (other than
vegetables whose roots or tubers are considered to be food items) in greenhouses at The Land in EPCOT Center at Walt
Disney World. This petition is not associated with an application for pesticide registration. The establishment
of this tolerance exemption would not relieve manufacturers, distributors, or sellers of this pesticide of any obligation
they may have under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, 7 U.S.C. 136 et seq. 




Pasteuria penetrans

 is a naturally occurring soil microbe that is a parasite of species of the nematode genus 

Meloidogyne

. 

Pasteuria penetrans

 reproduces by means of endospores which remain dormant in the soil until contacted by a migrating juvenile nematode.
The spore attaches itself to the nematode and is carried by the nematode into a plant root. The endospore germinates
and invades the body of the nematode where it eventually produces new endospores that are released into the soil following
the death of the nematode and decomposition of root tissue. The infected nematodes do not produce eggs and therefore
do not reproduce.
The information submitted in support of this petition and all other relevant material have been evaluated. Literature
citations regarding the nature of this organism were considered adequate to support an exemption from the requirement
of a tolerance for the limited use of this biological pesticide. Additionally, since 

Pasteuria penetrans

 can only be grown in association with the host nematode, it is not possible to conduct standard toxicological tests
with this organism.


Pasteuria penetrans

 is not known to be pathogenic, infective, or toxic to humans. The specificity of the organism as a parasite only on nematodes
of the genus 

Meloidogyne

 would make it extremely unlikely to infect any other unrelated organism. 

Pasteuria penetrans

 is a common inhabitant of soils in areas infested with nematodes, including the area of Florida where the organism
will be used. The microorganism will only be applied to the soil in greenhouses, and use in this manner would result
in its presence only in the soil and roots of plants grown in the greenhouses. The proposed exemption excludes plant
roots which will be used for food purposes since the nematode and the associated parasite will be contained in the root
portion of such plants. Since there are no data available regarding any possible effects from the consumption of elevated
levels of either nematodes or their parasites, roots and tubers which may contain these organisms have been excluded
from this exemption from tolerance requirements. Above-ground parts of plants harvested from treated soil would
not be expected to contain levels of 

Pasteuria penetrans

 above that normally found in crops harvested under natural conditions and consumed on a daily basis. The information
submitted is adequate to show that there are no forseeable human or domestic health hazards likely to arise from the
use of the product as a nematicide in connection with the production of fruits and vegetables in greenhouses.
Although the submitted petition for an exemption from tolerance requirements for 

Pasteuria penetrans

 limited the use of the organism to greenhouses at The Land in EPCOT Center at Walt Disney World, the Agency believes
that this limitation is overly restrictive. Based on the lack of any known hazards from the use of this organism in the
manner described, the Agency has elected not to impose a geographic restriction for the use of this biological nematicide.


Pasteuria penetrans

 is considered useful for the purpose for which the exemption from the requirement of a tolerance is sought. Based on
the information considered, the Agency concludes that establishment of the exemption will protect the public health.
Therefore, the regulation is proposed as set forth below.
 
Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide under the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) as amended which contains any of the ingredients listed herein may request
within 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register

 that this rulemaking proposal be referred to an Advisory Committee in accordance with section 408(e) of the FFDCA.

Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulation. Comments must bear a notation
indicating the document control number, [PP 4F4387/P592]. All written comments filed in response to these petitions
will be available in the Public Response and Program Resources Branch, at the address given above from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday, except legal holidays.
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order (i.e., Regulatory Impact Analysis,
review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant'' as those
actions likely to lead to a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious
inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering
the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues
arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order.
Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat.
1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising
tolerance levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements, or establishing or raising food additive
regulations do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification
statement to this effect was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).

Acrylic Acid-Stearyl Methacrylate Copolymer; Tolerance Exemption 




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes that an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance be established for residues of acrylic
acid-stearyl methacrylate copolymer (CAS Reg. No. 27756-15-6) when used as an inert ingredient (emulsifier, suspending
agent, or rheology modifier) in pesticide formulations applied to growing crops, raw agricultural commodities
after harvest, or animals. B. F. Goodrich Co. petitioned for this proposed regulation.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The B. F. Goodrich Co., 3925 Embassy Parkway, Akron, OH 44313-1799, submitted pesticide petition (PP) 4E4298 to EPA
requesting that the Administrator, pursuant to section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA)
(21 U.S.C. 346a(e)), propose to amend 40 CFR part 180 by establishing an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance
for residues of acrylic acid-stearyl methacrylate copolymer (CAS Reg. No. 27756-15-6) when used as an inert ingredient
(emulsifier, suspending agent, or rheology modifier) in pesticide formulations applied to growing crops, or to
raw agricultural commodities after harvest, or to animals.


Inert ingredients are all ingredients that are not active ingredients as defined in 40 CFR 153.125, and include, but
are not limited to, the following types of ingredients (except when they have a pesticidal efficacy of their own):
solvents such as alcohols and hydrocarbons; surfactants such as polyoxyethylene polymers and fatty acids; carriers
such as clay and diatomaceous earth; thickeners such as carrageenan and modified cellulose; wetting, spreading,
and dispersing agents; propellents in aerosol dispensers; microencapsulating agents; and emulsifiers. The term
``inert'' is not intended to imply nontoxicity; the ingredient may or may not be chemically active.

Subsequent to the publication of the proposal of B. F. Goodrich's request on February 25, 1994 (59 FR 9165), the Agency
received a comment from the requestor (B. F. Goodrich) objecting to the proposed rule's requirement of a 1,250,000
minimum number-average molecular weight for the copolymer, stating that it was inconsistent with the October 28,
1992 final rule and would ``* * * place an unnecessary burden on both Industry and the Agency to list the same copolymer
every time there is a desire to use a high molecular weight polymer not meeting a 1,250,000 requirement.'' The referenced
final rule (57 FR 48736) established an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of acrylic acid-stearyl
methacrylate copolymer under 40 CFR 180.1001(d), for use on growing crops, without containing a molecular weight
limitation. The commentor stated that it was not their intention to limit the tolerance exemption for acrylic acid-stearyl
methacrylate copolymer to a minimum number average molecular weight of 1,250,000 in the proposed rule and sought
to eliminate the molecular weight limitation.



The Agency agrees that an apparent inconsistency exists. The basis for the February 25, 1994, proposed rule was conformance
to the criteria described in 40 CFR 723.250, which requires a reference to a minimum molecular weight. The previously
established tolerance exemption under 40 CFR 180.1001(d) also relied on the fact that acrylic acid-stearyl methacrylate
copolymer conformed to 40 CFR 723.250; however, a minimum number-average molecular weight was inadvertently omitted
from that rule.

Additional information was requested to be submitted by the petitioner to support the use of a new minimum-number
average molecular weight for acrylic acid stearyl methacrylate copolymer which would still conform to 40 CFR 723.250.
The requested information was provided, and the Agency is hereby proposing that the exemption from the requirement
of a tolerance for acrylic acid-stearyl methacrylate copolymer specify the minimum number-average molecular weight
as 2,500. EPA is deleting the entry for this chemical under 40 CFR 180.1001(d) because the requested expansion to section
180.1001(c) incorporates uses on growing crops as well as raw agricultural commodities.

The data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have been evaluated. As part of the EPA policy statement
on inert ingredients published in the 

Federal Register

 of April 22, 1987 (52 FR 13305), the Agency set forth a list of studies which would generally be used to evaluate the risks
posed by the presence of an inert ingredient in a pesticide formulation. However, where it can be determined without
that data that the inert ingredient will present minimal or no risk, the Agency generally does not require some or all
of the listed studies to rule on the proposed tolerance or exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for an inert
ingredient. The Agency has decided that no data, in addition to that described below, for acrylic acid-stearyl methacrylate
copolymer will need to be submitted. The rationale for this decision is described below.

In the case of certain chemical substances that are defined as ``polymers,'' the Agency has established a set of criteria
which identify categories of polymers that present low risk. These criteria (described in 40 CFR 723.250) identify
polymers that are relatively unreactive and stable compared to other chemical substances as well as polymers that
typically are not readily absorbed. These properties generally limit a polymer's ability to cause adverse effects.
In addition, these criteria exclude polymers about which little is known. The Agency believes that polymers meeting
the criteria noted above will present minimal or no risk. Acrylic acid-stearyl methacrylate copolymer conforms
to the definition of a polymer given in 40 CFR 723.250(b) (11) and meets the following criteria that are used to identify
low-risk polymers:
1. The minimum number-average molecular weight of the acrylic acid-stearyl methacrylate copolymer is 2,500. Substances
with molecular weights greater than 400 generally are not absorbed through the intact skin, and substances with molecular
weights greater than 1,000 generally are not absorbed through the intact gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Chemicals
not absorbed through skin or GI tract generally are incapable of eliciting a toxic response.

2. Acrylic acid-stearyl methacrylate copolymer is not a cationic polymer, nor is it reasonably anticipated to become
a cationic polymer in a natural aquatic environment.

3. Acrylic acid-stearyl methacrylate copolymer does not contain less than 32.0 percent by weight of the atomic element
carbon.

4. Acrylic acid-stearyl methacrylate copolymer contains as an integral part of its composition the atomic elements
carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen.

5. Acrylic acid-stearyl methacrylate copolymer does not contain as an integral part of its composition, except as
impurities, any elements other than those listed in 40 CFR 723.250(d)(3)(ii).

6. Acrylic acid-stearyl methacrylate copolymer is not a biopolymer, a synthetic equivalent of a biopolymer, or a
derivative or a modification of a biopolymer that is substantially intact.

7. Acrylic acid-stearyl methacrylate copolymer is not manufactured from reactants containing, other than impurities,
halogen atoms or cyano groups.

8. Acrylic acid-stearyl methacrylate copolymer does not contain a reactive functional group that is intended, or
reasonably anticipated, to undergo further reaction.

9. Acrylic acid-stearyl methacrylate copolymer is not designed, or reasonably anticipated, to substantially degrade,
decompose, or depolymerize.

Based on the information above and review of its use, EPA has found that, when used in accordance with good agricultural
practice, this ingredient is useful and a tolerance is not necessary to protect the public health. Therefore, EPA
proposes that the exemption from the requirement of a tolerance be established as set forth below.

Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide, under the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) as amended, that contains any of the ingredients listed herein, may request
within 30 days after the publication of this document in the 

Federal Register

 that this rulemaking proposal be referred to an Advisory Committee in accordance with section 408(e) of the FFDCA.

Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulation. Comments must bear a notation
indicating the document control number [OPP-300364]. All written comments filed in response to this petition will
be available in the Public Response and Program Resources Branch, at the address given above, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday, except legal holidays.




The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 2 of Executive Order 12866.




Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have an economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
A certification statement to this effect was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).

 Proposed rule. 





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is proposing a significant new use rule (SNUR) under section 5(a)(2) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA)
for the chemical substance described as dihydro-7a-methyl-1

H

H

-oxazolo[3,4-c]oxazole, which is the subject of premanufacture notice (PMN) P-91-1324. This proposal
would require certain persons who intend to manufacture, import, or process this substance for a significant new
use to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing any manufacturing or processing activities for a use designated
by this SNUR as a significant new use. The required notice would provide EPA with the opportunity to evaluate the intended
use and, if necessary, to prohibit or limit that activity before it can occur. 

</SUMMARY>

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This proposed SNUR would require persons to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing the manufacture, import,
or processing of the substance dihydro-7a-methyl-1

H

,3

H

,5

H

-oxazolo[3,4-c]oxazole for the significant new uses described herein. The required notice would provide EPA with
information with which to evaluate an intended use and associated activities. 


I. Authority 


Section 5(a)(2) of TSCA (15 U.S.C. 2604(a)(2)) authorizes EPA to determine that a use of a chemical substance is a ``significant
new use.'' EPA must make this determination by rule after considering all relevant factors, including those listed
in section 5(a)(2). Once EPA determines that a use of a chemical substance is a significant new use, section 5(a)(1)(B)
of TSCA requires persons to submit a notice to EPA at least 90 days before they manufacture, import, or process the chemical
substance for that use. Section 26(c) of TSCA authorizes EPA to take action under section 5(a)(2) with respect to a
category of chemical substances. Persons subject to this SNUR would comply with the same notice requirements and
EPA regulatory procedures as submitters of premanufacture notices under section 5(a)(1) of TSCA. In particular,
these requirements include the information submission requirements of section 5(b) and (d)(1), the exemptions
authorized by section 5(h)(1), (h)(2), (h)(3), and (h)(5), and the regulations at 40 CFR part 720. Once EPA receives
a SNUR notice, EPA may take regulatory action under section 5(e), 5(f), 6, or 7 to control the activities for which it
has received a SNUR notice. If EPA does not take action, section 5(g) of TSCA requires EPA to explain in the 

Federal Register

 its reasons for not taking action. Persons who intend to export a substance identified in a proposed or final SNUR are
subject to the export notification provisions of TSCA section 12(b). The regulations that interpret section 12(b)
appear at 40 CFR part 707. 



II. Applicability of General Provisions 


General regulatory provisions applicable to SNURs are codified at 40 CFR part 721, subpart A. Regulatory provisions
covering user fees applicable to significant new use notices are codified at 40 CFR part 700 under the authority of
TSCA section 26(b). Interested persons may refer to these sections for further information. 


III. Background 

EPA is proposing to establish significant new use and recordkeeping requirements for the following chemical name
dihydro-7a-methyl-1

H

,3

H

,5

H

-oxazolo[3,4-c]oxazole. The proposed SNUR designates as significant new uses: 
1. Exposure to the PMN substance without ocular protection (chemical goggles or equivalent eye protection). 
2. Any predictable or purposeful release of the PMN substance to surface water above 500 ppb (parts per billion). 
On August 19, 1991, EPA received a PMN (P-91-1324) for dihydro-7a-methyl-1

H

,3

H

,5

H

-oxazolo[3,4-c]oxazole. EPA had concerns that the substance may be a severe eye irritant based on test data available
on other aliphatic amines and oxazoles. Also, based on that data, irritation to the exposed eye is exacerbated by irrigation.
In a letter to the Company dated December 6, 1991, EPA predicted that releases of spent metalworking fluids containing
the PMN substance could result in surface water concentrations as high as 16 ppm (parts per million). Assuming rapid
hydrolysis of the PMN substance, the resulting surface water concentration is expected to significantly exceed
the Agency's level of concern for the hydrolysis product. To mitigate the Agency's concern regarding aquatic toxicity,
the company was required to perform a 96-h bioassay in algae (40 CFR 797.1050), a 48-h LC50 test in daphnids
(40 CFR 797.1300), and a 96-h LC50 test in fish (40 CFR 797.1400). Based on the results of this information, the
Agency would reassess its surface water concentration estimates for the PMN substance and its hydrolysis products.
The letter also recommended that each worker exposed to the PMN substance be required to wear adequate ocular protection
once they were allowed to manufacture or import. EPA has concerns for environmental effects of the PMN substance based
on quantitative structure activity relationships (``QSARs'') derived from test data on analogous aliphatic amines
and oxazoles. The following ecotoxicity values for the PMN substance were predicted: 307 mg/L for fish 96-h
LC50, 19 mg/L for daphnid 48-h LC50, and 21 mg/L for algal 96-h EC50, and algal chronic value (ChV) = 3.4 mg/L,
with a concentration of concern of 0.200 mg/L. The Company suspended the PMN review period and conducted the 96-h
bioassay in algae, 48-h LC50 test in 

Daphnia

, and 96-h LC50 test in fish. The data was completed and submitted to the Agency for validation and review. The
results of the studies were acceptable; however, suggestions from the Agency in performing the studies were not followed.
For the aquatic toxicity testing, the Agency recommended that the PMN substance be tested two ways: The PMN substance
added directly to the exposure vessels and organisms added within 10 minutes, and the PMN substance tested completely
hydrolyzed. The Company tested the PMN substance two ways, but they did not test by direct dilution. Direct dilution
is adding the PMN substance directly to exposure vessels without the preparation of a stock solution. They prepared
an aqueous stock solution which they added to the exposure vessels. Preparing an aqueous stock solution resulted
in some unknown amount of hydrolysis, thus reducing the difference between the two recommended tests, i.e. unhydrolyzed
PMN versus completely hydrolyzed PMN substance. The Agency accepted the test data, however, because (1) the unhydrolyzed
PMN substance was predicted to be less toxic than the hydrolysis products of the PMN substance and (2) the hydrolysis
t

1/2

 (half-life) of the PMN substance appeared to be much shorter than predicted during the initial review. The results
from the first type, i.e., case (1), of toxicity study were as follows: 








The fish and daphnid ChVs were predicted assuming an acute to chronic ratio (ACR) = 10.0. In reviewing the studies where
complete hydrolysis had taken place, i.e., case (2), the results were as follows: 









The fish and daphnid acute toxicity values were predicted by calculating the difference between the partially and
completely hydrolyzed chemical using test data for green algal 96-h EC50 values, i.e., a factor of 4.0. The fish
and daphnid ChVs were predicted assuming an ACR = 10.0. No other additional testing was recommended by the Agency.


The review period inadvertently expired prior to EPA making a final determination on the PMN substance. The Company
stated that they did not expect to commence manufacturing the PMN substance any time in the near future, but did not
withdraw the PMN from review. The only releases which may exceed the concern concentration would occur during use.
It was predicted that 99 percent of the PMN substance would undergo hydrolysis; however, negligible removal of the
hydrolysis products was expected during wastewater treatment. The surface water concentration of hydrolysis products
resulting from releases from large metalworking shops is the only situation in which EPA expects the concern concentration
would be exceeded. Based on the completed review of toxicity data on the PMN chemical submitted to the Agency and the
use scenario described in the PMN application, releases to surface water exceeding 500 ppb would be toxic to aquatic
organisms. Therefore, the issuance of a Non-5(e) Notice and Comment SNUR requiring the use of ocular protection for
workers who will be exposed to the PMN substance and any releases of the PMN substance to surface water resulting in
surface water concentrations above 500 ppb would be considered a significant new use. 


IV. Applicability of SNUR to Uses Occurring Before Effective Date of the Final SNUR 

EPA has decided that the intent of section 5(a)(1)(B) is best served by designating a use as a significant new use as
of the date of proposal rather than as of the effective date of the final rule. If uses which commence between that date
and the effective date of the final rule were considered ongoing, rather than new, any person could defeat the SNUR
by initiating a significant new use before the effective date. This would make it difficult for EPA to establish SNUR
notice requirements. Thus, persons who begin commercial manufacture, import, or processing of the substance for
uses identified in this SNUR after the proposed date of the final rule will have to cease any such activity before the
effective date of the rule. To resume their activities, such persons would have to comply with all applicable SNUR
notice requirements and wait until the notice review period, including all extensions, expires. EPA, not wishing
to unnecessarily disrupt the activities of persons who begin commercial manufacture, import, or processing of a
significant new use before the effective date of the SNUR, has promulgated provisions to allow such persons to comply
with this proposed SNUR before it is promulgated. If a person were to meet the conditions of advance compliance as codified
at  721.45(h), the person would be considered to have met the requirements of the final SNUR for those activities.
If persons who begin commercial manufacture, import, or processing of the substance between proposal and the effective
date of the SNUR do not meet the conditions of advance compliance, they must cease that activity before the effective
date of the rule. To resume their activities, these persons would have to comply with all applicable SNUR notice requirements
and wait until the notice review period, including all extensions, expires. 


V. Economic Analysis 

EPA has evaluated the potential costs of establishing significant new use notice requirements for potential manufacturers,
importers, and processors of the chemical substance. The Agency's complete economic analysis is available in the
public record for this proposed rule (OPPTS-50611). 


VI. Comments Containing Confidential Business Information 

Any person who submits comments claimed as CBI must mark the comments as ``confidential,'' ``trade secret,'' or other
appropriate designation. Comments not claimed as confidential at the time of submission will be placed in the public
file. Any comments marked as confidential will be treated in accordance with procedures in 40 CFR part 2. Any party
submitting comments claimed to be confidential must prepare and submit a nonconfidential public version in triplicate
of the comments that EPA can place in the public file. 



VII. Rulemaking Record 

EPA has established a record for this rulemaking (docket control number OPPTS-50611). The record includes
basic information considered by the Agency in developing this proposed rule. EPA will supplement the record with
additional information as it is received. EPA will accept additional materials for inclusion in the record at any
time between this proposal and designation of the complete record. EPA will identify the complete rulemaking record
by the date of promulgation. A public version of the record, without any CBI, is available in the TSCA Nonconfidential
Information Center (NCIC) from 12 noon to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays. The TSCA NCIC is located
in Rm. NE-B607, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC. 



VIII. Regulatory Assessment Requirements 


A. Executive Order 12866 


Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order (i.e., Regulatory Impact
Analysis, review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)). Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant
regulatory action'' as an action likely to lead to a rule: (1) Having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million
or more, or adversely and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment,
public health or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically
significant''); (2) creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by
another agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs
or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal
mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. Pursuant to the terms
of this Executive Order, it has been determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore not subject
to OMB review. 


B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), EPA has determined that this proposed rule would not have
a significant impact on a substantial number of small businesses. EPA has determined that approximately 10 percent
of the parties affected by the rule could be small businesses. However, EPA expects to receive few SNUNs for these substances.
Therefore, EPA believes that the number of small businesses affected by the rule will not be substantial, even if all
of the SNUR notice submitters were small firms. 



C. Paperwork Reduction Act 


OMB has approved the information collection requirements contained in this proposed rule under the provisions of
the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

), and has assigned OMB control number 2070-0012. Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated
to vary from 30 to 170 hours per response, with an average of 100 hours per response, including time for reviewing instructions,
searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection
of information. Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information,
including suggestions for reducing this burden, to Chief, Information Policy Branch (2131), U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460; and to Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office
of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.'' The final rule will respond
to any OMB or public comments on the information requirements contained in this proposal.

Natural Resource Damage Assessments: Type A Procedure for Great Lakes Environments


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of the Secretary, Interior.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule; extension of comment period.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On August 8, 1994, the Department of the Interior issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (59 FR 40319) to revise the
natural resource damage assessment regulations. The natural resource damage assessment regulations establish
procedures for assessing damages for injury to natural resources resulting from a discharge of oil into navigable
waters under the Clean Water Act, or a release of a hazardous substance under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation, and Liability Act. The August 8, 1994 proposed rule describes a procedure for simplified assessments
for relatively minor discharges or releases in Great Lakes environments. The Department is extending the period
for comment on the proposed rule and soliciting comment on an additional aspect of the type A procedure.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The natural resource damage assessment regulations establish procedures that Federal, State, and Tribal natural
resource trustees may use to obtain compensation from liable parties for natural resource injuries under the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq.) and the Clean Water
Act, as amended (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.). The regulations provide an administrative process for conducting assessments
as well as two types of technical procedures for the actual determination of injuries and damages. ``Type A'' procedures
are standard procedures for simplified assessments requiring minimal field observation in cases of minor discharges
or releases in certain environments. ``Type B'' procedures are site-specific procedures for detailed assessments
in other cases.



On August 8, 1994, the Department of the Interior published a proposed rule to amend the regulations to include an additional
type A procedure for assessing natural resource damages in Great Lakes environments. The proposed procedure incorporates
a computer model called the Natural Resource Damage Assessment Model for Great Lakes Environments Version 1.31 (NRDAM/GLE).

The comment period on the August 8, 1994, proposed rule was originally set to close on November 7, 1994. The Department
has received numerous requests for additional time to comment on the proposed rule. The requesters have emphasized
the large volume of technical documentation accompanying the NRDAM/GLE, all of which is subject to public review
and comment. Some requesters are assembling multidisciplinary teams to assist in the review of the model and associated
databases. The Department appreciates the level of technical review that is underway and is therefore extending
the comment period by 90 days.

The Department also solicits comment on an additional aspect of the proposed type A procedure for Great Lakes environments.
The proposed NRDAM/GLE is supported by a geographic information system (GIS) that supplies geographically distributed
information to the submodels. The submodels divide the Great Lakes into a series of rectangular grids. The proposed
NRDAM/GLE assigns a habitat type to each cell within the grids. Under the August 8, 1994 proposed rule, trustee officials
would not be allowed to modify the habitat designations in the final version of the model if they wished to obtain a rebuttable
presumption for their assessments. The Department specifically requested commenters to review the habitat designations
and provide information about possible revisions that should be made in the final version of the model. 59 FR 40330.
The Department remains committed to ensuring that the final version of the NRDAM/GLE reflects the most accurate habitat
information available. However, the Department is now soliciting comment on whether to revise the rule to allow trustee
officials to modify the habitat designations in the final version of the NRDAM/GLE and still obtain a rebuttable presumption.
Allowing trustee officials to modify the habitat designations might enable fine-tuning of the model to better reflect
reality. On the other hand, type A procedures are designed to simplify assessments, reduce fieldwork, and narrow
the potential areas of dispute. Providing an option to modify the habitat designations could undermine these goals.
Therefore, the Department solicits comment on whether the final rule should allow trustee officials to modify the
habitat designations and, if so, under what conditions.

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Federal Maritime Commission (``Commission'' or ``FMC'') published a Notice of Inquiry into alternative forms
of financial responsibility for nonperformance of transportation in the October 14, 1994 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 52133). Subsequent review after publication disclosed that the Notice of Inquiry failed to include language
to make clear that we are seeking comment on accepting, as evidence of financial responsibility, liens, mortgages
or other security instruments. Accordingly, the Notice is being revised in the following respects:





1. The second sentence of Part B (``Reinforced Self-Insurance'') is revised to read:




The Commission is concerned that its present self-insurance standards may be inadequate, but it will consider an
approach whereby it would restore its former ((net worth = 100% UPR) + (working capital = 100% UPR)) standard,17 but
require prospective self-insurers to provide alternative coverage for a percentage (

e.g.

, 50% or 25%) of their uncovered UPR, through either a traditional guaranty, surety, escrow agreement, lien or mortgage
or other security instrument, or through participation in a coverage association along the above-described lines.




2. The last sentence of Part C (``Coverage Requirements'') is revised to read as follows:




We also solicit comments on liens or mortgages or any other form of security or proposal that would provide adequate
coverage for the travelling public.

Enhanced 911 Emergency Calling



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Communications Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) proposes to amend rules to ensure the compatibility of enhanced 911 services
with private branch exchanges (PBXs), other private dispersed telephone systems, and wireless services. This action
responds to a petition for rulemaking (RM-8143) to amend the rules to require compatibility of PBXs with enhanced
911 emergency calling systems, a petition for reconsideration filed in the Commission's proceeding on personal
communications services, and issues raised in an Emergency Access Position Paper filed recently with the Commission.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This summarizes the NPRM in CC Docket No. 94-102 and RM-8143 (FCC 94-237) adopted September 19, 1994
and released October 19, 1994, which bears the title ``Revision of the Commission's rules to ensure compatibility
with enhanced 911 emergency calling systems.''



The NPRM and supporting file are available for inspection and copying during the weekday hours of 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
in the FCC Reference Center, room 239, 1919 M St., NW., Washington, DC. Copies may be purchased from the Commission's
duplicating contractor, ITS, Inc., 2100 M St., NW., suite 140, Washington, DC 20037, phone (202) 857-3800.
The NPRM will be published in the FCC Record.


Summary of NPRM


1. Background


A petition for rulemaking was filed by Adcomm Engineering Co. (Adcomm), to amend part 68 of the rules to require interoperability
between PBXs and enhanced 911 emergency calling systems. See FCC Report No. 1922 (RM-8143) released December
29, 1992. The Texas Advisory Commission on State Emergency Communications (TX-ACSEC) under the Office of the
Attorney General for the state of Texas filed a petition for reconsideration in the Commission's proceeding on personal
communications services (PCS) (GEN Dkt. 90-314) requesting Commission action to ensure the compatibility
of PCS with enhanced 911 emergency calling systems. This NPRM also addresses an Emergency Access Position Paper,
filed by the Associated Public Safety Communications Officials-International, Inc. (APCO), the National Emergency
Number Association (NENA), the National Association of State Nine One One Administrators (NASNA), and the Personal
Communications Industry Association (PCIA), which presents the consensus recommendations of these organizations
to assist in developing appropriate standards for emergency access from wireless service systems to 9-1-1
systems. We seek comment on proposals for insuring the compatibility of PBXs and other dispersed private telephone
systems with enhanced 911 emergency services. Second, we propose to adopt rules that would require wireless services
to include features that will make enhanced 911 services available to mobile radio callers.


2. Dispersed Private Telephone Systems and Enhanced 911 Systems


The NPRM proposes to require that PBX and similar equipment: (a) have the capability of automatically providing a
caller's number and location to the public safety answering points (PSAPs) where the calls are received; (b) permit
callers to obtain access to a PSAP by dialing 911, 

i.e.,

 without dialing ``9'' or another access code to obtain an outside dialtone; and (c) have the capability to alert, and
provide calling information to, an attendant at the location served by a dispersed private telephone system so that
an attendant may assist in responding to an emergency. These requirements would apply to PBX equipment manufactured
or imported one year after rules ultimately adopted in this proceeding or installed eighteen months after that date.
Under the proposed rules, PBX equipment manufactured or imported during the first year must be labeled with emergency
dialing instructions both on the device and on the outside of the packaging in which it is marketed.


3. Wireless Services and Enhanced 911 Systems


We propose to require commercial mobile radio services (CMRS) that provide, or are capable of providing, real time
voice services to include features that will make enhanced 911 services available to mobile radio callers. These
features include Station Number Identification (SNI), Automatic Location Information (ALI), and Selecting Routing
(SR).

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941102-1-00053 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941102-1-00015 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

We propose that: (a) Customers of mobile radio services be able to obtain access to emergency services by dialing 911
without having to dial additional digits; (b) such callers be able to place 911 calls without meeting any mobile radio
service user validation requirements; and (c) mobile radio service calls to 911 be placed at the beginning of any queue
of calls awaiting availability of radio or network resources. The NPRM proposes to require that mobile radio services
furnish information necessary for emergency service providers to locate a 911 caller who is using a mobile radio unit,
and that mobile radio services permit PSAPs to call back immediately a mobile unit from which a 911 call has been received.
The NPRM seeks comment on a proposal that mobile radio equipment that does not conform to the performance criteria
proposed in the NPRM must be labelled with a warning that access to 911 is limited and a description that specifies those
limitations. Further, the NPRM seeks comment on whether mobile radio services should provide PSAPs with common channel
signalling information elements, including subscriber's name and routing information, to direct the call to the
proper PSAP. In addition, the NPRM requests comment on ensuring access to 911 service by text telephone devices (TTY)
that use wireless services. The NPRM seeks comment on when these requirements should be imposed, and seeks analysis
of the technical and cost considerations involved.



4. Additional Considerations



The NPRM seeks comment on whether or what privacy considerations should apply to the provision of enhanced 911 services,
and seeks analysis of any additional issues that should be considered to ensure that the benefits of 911 services are
not diminished by new developments.



Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis



Reasons for Action



This Notice of Proposed Rule Making responds to the petitions submitted by TX-ACSEC and Adcomm to address issues
raised by the provision of enhanced 911 services through commercial mobile radio systems, private branch exchanges,
and other dispersed private telephone system equipment. Telephone stations for wireline stations served by PBX
or similar equipment and for wireless services are not adequately identifying caller location to permit a timely
response by emergency services personnel.



Objectives



The objective of this proposal is to ensure access to enhanced 911 emergency systems on the public switched telephone
network for callers served by private branch exchange other dispersed private telephone systems, and for callers
served by certain mobile services.



Legal Basis



The proposed action is authorized under sections 47 U.S.C. 151, 154, 155, 201-05, 208, 215, 218, 226, 227, 302,
303, 313, 314, 332, 403, 404, 410, 522.



Reporting, Record Keeping and Other Compliance Requirements



Private branch exchanges and other dispersed private telephone systems will be required to maintain records for
calling number identification, caller location identification, and a call-back number for each of their calling
stations. Commercial mobile radio services will be required to identify the location of mobile transmitters and
provide call-back numbers for them. Equipment used for private branch exchanges and other dispersed private systems
and commercial mobile radio services will have to be capable of providing this information to the local telephone
exchanges to which they are connected. Local telephone exchanges will incur costs storing and relaying this information
to enhanced 911 public service answering points.

Federal Rules Which Overlap, Duplicate or Conflict With These Rules




None.





Description, Potential Impact and Number of Small Entities Involved





The proposed changes in the regulations would affect a number of entities both large and small. An estimate of such
parties affected is approximately 65 million new wireless services users and approximately 4 million PBX equipment
owners.







Any Significant Alternatives Minimizing the Impact on Small Entities Consistent with Stated Objectives





With respect to PBX equipment, the NPRM asks whether the proposed rules must be applied where the equipment serves
a physically small location, such as a single story building, or a small number of closely situated telephone stations.






Ex Parte Presentations






This is a nonrestricted notice and comment rulemaking proceeding. 

Ex parte 

presentations are permitted, except during the Sunshine Agenda period, provided they are disclosed as provided

 Notice of proposed rulemaking.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice proposes amendments to the Federal motor vehicle standard on lighting to substitute SAE J576 JUL91 for
the currently incorporated J576c as the referenced standard on plastics materials, to substitute ASTM D 1003-92
for ASTM D 1003-61 in the test procedures, to allow alternative processing techniques, sample sizes and thickness
tolerances to those presently specified. Alternatively, the notice proposes amendments to the existing requirements
that would accomplish the same ends. This action is taken pursuant to a grant of a petition for rulemaking submitted
by Heraeus DSET Laboratories, Inc.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Heraeus DSET Laboratories, Inc. (``DSET''), of Phoenix, Arizona, petitioned NHTSA for rulemaking to amend Federal
Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 108, 

Lamps, Reflective Devices, and Associated Equipment. 

Specifically, DSET asked that paragraph S5.1.2 be amended ``to update the weathering and heat testing requirements
of plastic material used for optical parts such as lenses and reflectors.'' Currently, these materials are required
to conform to SAE Recommended Practice J576c, May 1970. DSET wants NHTSA ``to allow alternative processing techniques
besides injection molding to produce test specimens, to allow test specimen sizes other than a 3 inch diameter disc
and to change the specimen thickness tolerances from 

#

0.005 inch to 

#

.010 inch.'' Those requirements for injection molding and for the diameter and thickness of the test specimen are
set forth in J576c, May 1970.



The petition set forth five reasons in support. The first is that the requirement in Standard No. 108 (SAE J576c) that
test samples be injection molded is ``technology limiting'' and other methods of test specimen fabrication exist
and should be allowed. SAE J576 JUL91 allows alternative processing techniques to produce test specimens.

Secondly, SAE J576 JUL91 contains no sample shape or diameter requirement, in contrast to Standard No. 108's present
restriction to a round sample of 3-inch diameter. DSET submits that there is no technical reason to continue the limit
for the test specimen.

Third, DSET stated that no technical reason exists to limit the test specimen thickness tolerance to 0.005 inch (or
0.13 mm as NHTSA expresses it). Accordingly, the petitioner recommends 

#

0.010 inch (0.25 mm), ``since this appears to be a more reasonable tolerance that almost all plastic lens materials
manufacturers can meet.'' The petitioner said that many manufacturers currently have trouble meeting the 

#

0.005 inch tolerance.

Fourth, DSET believes that States impose a burden on manufacturers to test according to Standard No. 108. Although
49 U.S.C. Chapter 301 and Standard No. 108 do not require a manufacturer to conduct testing in producing and certifying
a vehicle or item of equipment (the requirement is that the product meet all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety
standards when tested according to the procedures specified), DSET says that many State laws require proof of testing
according to Standard No. 108. This means that even if there are alternative processing techniques for plastics that
have been developed as a result of advancing technology, the manufacturer is obliged to follow the test procedures
of Standard No. 108.

Finally, DSET said that SAE J576c has been out of print for many years. Its unavailability has resulted in manufacturers
routinely submitting ``test specimens that do not meet the 

#

0.005 inch thickness tolerance or the 3 [inch] diameter size requirement.''

The agency has reviewed DSET's petition and has found that there is a reasonable possibility that the amendments asked
for would occur at the conclusion of a rulemaking proceeding. Accordingly, the agency has granted DSET's petition.
The requested changes would appear to simplify the test requirements of Standard No. 108 without degrading safety.
These changes would also allow more flexibility in the preparation of test specimens.

However, NHTSA is concerned that simple substitution of the 1991 version of SAE J576 for the 1970 one might result in
an unintended burden upon industry, as the updated version contains some requirements that are different from and
in addition to those of the 1970 version. In addition, the ASTM D-1003 requirements currently referenced in
S5.1.2 of Standard No. 108 are those of 1961. NHTSA is proposing to amend S5.1.2 to replace the reference to the 1961
version of ASTM D-1003 with a 1992 version and seeks comment on this change. The differences between the two versions
include subtle changes to the text in virtually every section and the agency is unable to judge whether these changes
would result in an increased burden to industry. Because of this uncertainty, the agency is proposing as an alternative
a means of implementing DSET's request that does not include a reference to the revised standards. NHTSA welcomes
informed comment on this issue. As a consequence of its age, a 33-year-old ASTM specification may be technologically
limiting, as well as difficult to obtain. As noted above, strict adherence to older procedures which States may require
means that manufacturers could not avail themselves of newer, less restrictive processing techniques if such exist.

As noted, NHTSA is proposing alternative amendments of S5.1.2 as a means of implementing its grant of DSET's petition.
The agency asks commenters for their views on each of the alternatives. 



Alternative 1 



This alternative would substitute SAE J576 JUL91 for SAE J576c, May 1970, and make conforming amendments in the text
of S5.1.2. This alternative would also replace ASTM D-1003-61 with ASTM D-1003-92 with respect
to measurement of haze (which, as proposed at 58 FR 13042, would not exceed 7 percent). A specimen thickness tolerance
of 

#

0.25 mm (0.010 in.) would also be allowed as there is no technical reason to limit the test specimen thickness tolerance
to 

#

0.005 in., and the value proposed by NHTSA as recommended by DSET appears to be a more reasonable tolerance for test
specimens. 

Two new paragraphs would be added, maintaining the performance requirements required of plastic materials by SAE
J576c for the heat test, and specifying positioning of test samples during the test. These have been omitted from J576
JUL91. NHTSA believes the J576c heat test should be retained because the test is the only heat resistance requirement
in Standard No. 108. The test acts to eliminate flagrantly inferior material for reflex reflectors. (Use of material
with insufficient high temperature performance can result in reflectors that lose color and reflectivity.) The
positioning of test samples will allow the sample to droop if its strength is adversely affected by the test. 



Alternative 2



This alternative would retain the current SAE and ASTM specifications but would allow processing techniques other
than injection molding to produce equivalent test specimens, test specimens other than a disc of 3-inch diameter,
and a test specimen thickness tolerance of 

#

0.010 inch. 



Request for Comments 



Interested persons are invited to submit comments on the proposal. It is requested but not required that 10 copies
be submitted. 

All comments must not exceed 15 pages in length. (49 CFR 553.21). Necessary attachments may be appended to these submissions
without regard to the 15-page limit. This limitation is intended to encourage commenters to detail their primary
arguments in a concise fashion. 

If a commenter wishes to submit certain information under a claim of confidentiality, three copies of the complete
submission, including purportedly confidential business information, should be submitted to the Chief Counsel,
NHTSA, at the street address given above, and seven copies from which the purportedly confidential information has
been deleted should be submitted to the Docket Section. A request for confidentiality should be accompanied by a cover
letter setting forth the information specified in the agency's confidential business information regulation.
49 CFR Part 512. 

All comments received before the close of business on the comment closing date indicated above for the proposal will
be considered, and will be available for examination in the docket at the above address both before and after that date.
To the extent possible, comments filed after the closing date will also be considered. Comments received too late
for consideration in regard to the final rule will be considered as suggestions for further rulemaking action. Comments
on the proposal will be available for inspection in the docket. The NHTSA will continue to file relevant information
as it becomes available in the docket after the closing date, and it is recommended that interested persons continue
to examine the docket for new material. 

Those persons desiring to be notified upon receipt of their comments in the rules docket should enclose a self-addressed,
stamped postcard in the envelope with their comments. Upon receiving the comments, the docket supervisor will return
the postcard by mail.

Rulemaking Analyses and Notices 



Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures



The Office of Management and Budget has determined that it will not review this rulemaking action under Executive
Order 12866. It has been determined that the rulemaking action is not significant under Department of Transportation
regulatory policies and procedures. The purpose of the rulemaking action is to update testing procedures. Since
it is not anticipated that the final rule will have any significant cost or other impacts, preparation of a full regulatory
evaluation is not warranted. 



National Environmental Policy Act



NHTSA has analyzed this rulemaking action for the purposes of the National Environmental Policy Act. It is not anticipated
that a final rule based on this proposal would have a significant effect upon the environment. The composition of plastic
materials used in optical parts would not change from those presently in production. 



Regulatory Flexibility Act



The agency has also considered the impacts of this rulemaking action in relation to the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
I certify that this rulemaking action would not have a significant economic impact upon a substantial number of small
entities. Accordingly, no regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared. Manufacturers of motor vehicles
and motor vehicle equipment, those affected by the rulemaking action, are generally not small businesses within
the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Further, small organizations and governmental jurisdictions would
not be significantly affected because the price of new vehicles and vehicle equipment would not be impacted. 



Executive Order 12612 (Federalism)



This rulemaking action has also been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive
Order 12612, and NHTSA has determined that this rulemaking action does not have sufficient federalism implications
to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 



Civil Justice 



A final rule based on this proposal would not have any retroactive effect. Under 49 U.S.C.  30103, whenever a
Federal motor vehicle safety standard is in effect, a state may not adopt or maintain a safety standard applicable
to the same aspect of performance which is not identical to the Federal standard. 49 U.S.C.  30161 sets forth
a procedure for judicial review of final rules establishing, amending or revoking Federal motor vehicle safety standards.
That section does not require submission of a petition for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings
before parties may file suit in court.

SUMMARY:

 This document recommends changes in the Federal milk 
marketing orders for five north-central marketing areas based on 
industry proposals considered at a public hearing. The decision 
recommends adopting a plan for pricing milk on the basis of its 
protein and other nonfat solids, as well as butterfat, 
components. The proposed plan includes adjustments per 
hundredweight of all producer milk based on the somatic cell 
count of the milk. The intended effect of this rule is to better reflect the value of the nonfat solids components in
the skim portion of milk.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This administrative action is governed by the provisions of Sections 556 and 557 of Title 5 of the United States Code
and, therefore, is excluded from the requirements of Executive Order 12866. 



The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a proposed rule
on small entities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified
that this proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The
amendments would promote orderly marketing of milk by producers and regulated handlers. 

The amendments to the rules proposed herein have been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform.
They are not intended to have a retroactive effect. If adopted, the proposed amendments would not preempt any state
or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 

The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), provides that administrative
proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler
subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any
obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with the law and requesting a modification of
an order or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After
a hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in
any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity
to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the
date of the entry of the ruling.

Extension of Time for Filing Briefs: Issued April 22, 1994; published April 24, 1994 (59 FR 22138). 



Preliminary Statement 



Notice is hereby given of the filing with the Hearing Clerk of this recommended decision with respect to proposed amendments
to the tentative marketing agreements and the orders regulating the handling of milk in the Chicago Regional and certain
other marketing areas. This notice is issued pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement
Act and the applicable rules of practice and procedure governing the formulation of marketing agreements and marketing
orders (7 CFR Part 900). 

Interested parties may file written exceptions to this decision with the Hearing Clerk, U.S. Department of Agriculture,
Washington, DC 20250, by the 30th day after publication of this decision in the 

Federal Register

. Six copies of the exceptions should be filed. All written submissions made pursuant to this notice will be made available
for public inspection at the office of the Hearing Clerk during regular business hours (7 CFR 1.27(b)). 

The proposed amendments set forth below are based on the record of a public hearing held at Bloomington, Minnesota,
on January 25-27, 1994, pursuant to a notice of hearing issued December 22, 1993; (59 FR 260). 

The material issues on the record of hearing relate to: 

1. Adoption of multiple component pricing. 

2. Orders to be included. 

3. Components and component prices. 

a. Protein.

Findings and Conclusions


The following findings and conclusions on the material issues are based on evidence presented at the hearing and the
record thereof:


1. Adoption of Multiple Component Pricing


Proposals to incorporate multiple component pricing in the Chicago Regional (Order 30), Nebraska-Western Iowa
(Order 65), Upper Midwest (Order 68), Eastern South Dakota (Order 76) and Iowa (Order 79) Federal milk marketing orders
(the five orders) should be adopted, with some modifications. The pricing plan generally would be patterned after
the multiple component pricing plan proposed by National All-Jersey, Inc. and other dairy organizations. Producers
would be paid on the basis of the pounds of butterfat, protein and other nonfat solids (solids-not-fat other than protein)
in their milk, and would share in the value of the pool's Class I and Class II uses on a per hundredweight basis. Regulated
handlers would pay for the milk they receive on the basis of total butterfat, the protein and other nonfat solids used
in Classes II and III, skim milk used in Class I, and the hundredweight of total product used in Classes I and II. A somatic
cell adjustment, per hundredweight, would also apply to payments for all producer milk.
At the present time, milk received by handlers under the five orders is priced according to the pounds of producer milk
allocated to each class of use multiplied by the prices per hundredweight of milk testing 3.5 percent butterfat, as
determined under the orders for each class of use. Adjustments for such items as overage, reclassified inventory,
location and other source milk allocated to Class I are added to or subtracted from the classified use value of the milk.
The resulting amount is divided by the total producer milk in the pool to calculate a price per hundredweight of milk
testing 3.5 percent butterfat to be paid to producers for the milk they have delivered to handlers. The price paid to
each producer is then adjusted according to the specific butterfat test of the producer's milk by means of a butterfat
differential. The butterfat differential is computed by multiplying the wholesale selling price of Grade A (92-score)
bulk butter per pound on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, as reported for the month by the U.S. Department of Agriculture,
by 0.138 and subtracting the Minnesota-Wisconsin price at test, also as reported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture,
multiplied by .0028.

The multiple component pricing (MCP) plan was originally 
proposed for Orders 30, 68 and 79 by National All-Jersey, Inc. 
(NAJ) and other dairy organizations. In addition, Land O'Lakes, 
Inc., proposed that the multiple component plan be considered for 
Orders 65 and 76. Most other proposals considered at the hearing 
were modifications of the NAJ proposal and are discussed below. 


 The first NAJ witness stated that the current milk pricing 
system used in the five orders does not meet current marketing 
needs and should be replaced with a multiple component pricing 
system. Much of the general NAJ testimony in favor of multiple 
component pricing was later reiterated by witnesses expert in the 
field of economics and dairy chemistry testifying for NAJ, and a 
representative for Land O'Lakes. Also testifying in favor of the 
NAJ proposal were two dairy farmer members of the cooperative 
association Swiss Valley Farms Company, a representative of the 
Brown Swiss Cattle Breeders Association of U.S.A., Inc., and a 
representative of Tri-State Milk Cooperative. It was indicated 
in testimony that Alto Dairy Cooperative also supported the NAJ 
proposal. 


 The representative for the proponents said the intent of 
their proposal was to: 


 1. Use the M-W price as the base; 


 2. Pay all producers on four factors_pounds of 
butterfat, pounds of protein, pounds of other solids, 
and each producer's share of the fluid differential on 
a per hundredweight basis; 


 3. Leave Class I handler obligations on a skim-butterfat basis; 


 4. Determine Class II and III handlers' obligations on 
the basis of pounds of butterfat, protein, and other 
solids; and 


 5. Change only the order provisions needed to implement 
the NAJ proposal. 


 The NAJ witness said that there were five reasons for 
replacing the current milk pricing system with a multiple 
component pricing system. The first reason, according to the NAJ 
witness, is that the current skim-butterfat pricing system does 
not give dairy farmers economic incentives to produce milk high 
in nonfat solids, especially protein. He stated that under the 
current pricing system a pound of water receives the same price 
as a pound of protein or other solids, yet it is these solids 
that give milk its functional and nutritional value. 


 The second reason given by the NAJ witness for adopting MCP 
was that over a period of years much of the value of milk has 
shifted from butterfat to the skim portion of milk. The 
proponent's witness said that in 1960, butterfat represented 77% 
of the value of the M-W price, and skim represented 23%. By 
1993, he testified, these values were reversed, with butterfat 
representing only 23% of the value of the M-W, while the skim 
portion of the milk represented 77%. 


 According to the NAJ witness, the shift in value from 
butterfat to skim was partially caused by the USDA decision to 
decrease the support price for butter and increase the support 
price for nonfat dry milk. The support price for butter declined 
from $1.53 per pound in 1981 to 65

$

 per pound in 1993, with most 
of the decrease occurring since 1989. Nonfat dry milk purchase 
prices under the support program increased from 72.75

$

 per pound 
in 1988 to $1.034 per pound in 1993. In addition, the witness 
said, the butterfat differential under Federal orders has been 
dropping since the mid-1980s because of a decline in the market 
price for butter. This drop was accelerated by a change in the 
method of computing the butterfat differential, implemented in 
1990, that had the impact of reducing the butterfat differential 
even more. 


 The third reason the witness gave for implementing multiple 
component pricing was the shift in types of dairy products 
consumers are purchasing. According to the witness, some of the 
decline in butterfat value relative to skim value has been caused 
by a shift in consumption from whole milk to lowfat and skim 
fluid milk products. The witness presented data to show that 
from 1970 to 1991, national fluid milk sales of lowfat and skim 
milk increased 232%, while sales of whole milk declined 50%. In 
addition, he stated, consumption of lowfat manufactured products 
is growing faster than consumption of relatively high-fat 
manufactured products. 


 The NAJ witness discussed equity in Federal orders as the 
fourth reason for implementing multiple component pricing. He 
said that the current skim-butterfat pricing system is equitable 
for neither producers nor handlers since it does not properly 
recognize the value of protein, especially in manufactured 
products such as cheese. The witness provided examples to show 
how a producer with high protein milk may currently receive the 
same Federal order minimum price as a producer with low protein 
milk. Similarly, a cheese maker who purchases high protein milk 
could have a cost advantage at minimum order prices over a cheese 
maker who purchases low protein milk. 


 The fifth reason presented by the NAJ witness was the 
existence of a number of voluntary multiple component pricing 
plans in the areas covered by the five orders. Data were 
presented to show that nearly all producers in the five orders 
currently are eligible to be paid under one of these voluntary 
multiple component pricing plans. The witness stated that many 
of the plans have inadequacies which contribute to disorderly 
marketing. According to the witness, these inadequacies would be 
addressed by adopting the NAJ proposal.

A witness from Land O'Lakes, Inc. (LOL), testified in support of the adoption of MCP in the five orders in general, and
the NAJ proposal specifically. He discussed how the NAJ multiple component pricing proposal would better reflect
the market value of nutrients in the milk to the farmer. He stated that the proposed system, compared with the current
system, would essentially eliminate the value of milk used in manufacturing that is currently associated with water
which, he said, has very little market value in dairy products. The witness said that MCP would affect the cost of milk
to LOL as a handler in that it will come closer to equalizing the cost of milk relative to the value of the products derived
from the milk.
The LOL witness also described four major weaknesses in the existing voluntary MCP plans. The first weakness, he said,
was that the current plans emphasize component test instead of component yield. He said that the price paid to each
producer should be tied more directly to the value of the products that can be produced from the producer's milk.
The second weakness described by the LOL witness is that many existing plans do not provide for deductions for milk
with low component levels. This, he said, indicates that the plans recognize the higher value of milk with more pounds
of components, but do not recognize that milk with fewer pounds of components is worth less. He said that competitive,
rather than economic, factors are the reason deductions for low component levels generally do not exist, as many producers
do not like to see deductions on their milk checks.
According to the LOL witness, an inequitable feature of the voluntary MCP plans is that they generally pay no component
premiums when the somatic cell count of the milk is above a fixed level, resulting in high test producers losing their
component premium because of high somatic cells, while low test producers with high somatic cell counts lose nothing.
The fourth weakness described by the witness is that some existing MCP plans pay premiums for protein, while others
pay premiums for solids-not-fat. He said that most producers in Wisconsin receive premiums based on protein, while
most producers in Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska and South Dakota receive premiums based on solids-not-fat. The witness
claimed that the variety of payment plans currently in existence do a poor job of transmitting market signals to the
producers, are not economically consistent, and lead to confusion among farmers. He said that the NAJ proposal would
address the deficiencies in the current situation.
Most participants at the hearing advocated the introduction of MCP for payments to producers and for milk delivered
to handlers for Class II and Class III use in the five orders. There was no support for pricing Class I milk on other than
the current butterfat and skim basis.
In addition to NAJ and LOL, adoption of some form of multiple component pricing in the five orders was supported by Central
Milk Producers Cooperative (CMPC), the Trade Association of Proprietary Plants (TAPP), Farmers Union Milk Marketing
Cooperative (FUMMC), National Farmers Organization (NFO), Kraft General Foods (Kraft), Associated Milk Producers,
Inc., North Central Region (AMPI North Central), Wisconsin Cheese Makers Association (WCMA), Dean Foods, and National
Cheese Institute (NCI).
The CMPC witnesses strongly supported the need for implementing multiple component pricing in the five orders and
proposed a plan very similar to that of NAJ. The fundamental difference between the two plans is that the CMPC proposal
would result in lower protein prices than the NAJ proposal. The appropriate level of the protein price is discussed
under Issue 3a below.
The CMPC proposal was supported in testimony and in a post-hearing brief by NFO. A witness for WCMA testified in support
of the CMPC proposal for multiple component pricing. A witness for Dean Foods testified in support of the concept of
MCP, and in response to a question about which proposal he favored, he expressed support for the CMPC proposal. AMPI
North Central Region submitted a brief in support of the CMPC proposal for multiple component pricing.

A witness for NCI testified in support of the CMPC multiple 
component pricing proposal with one primary modification. The 
NCI proposal would calculate a ``residual fluid price'', instead of 
an other solids price. This proposal is discussed further under 
Issue 3b below in this decision. Kraft testified and submitted a 
brief in support of the NCI proposal for multiple component 
pricing. 

A witness for the Trade Association of Proprietary Plants 
(TAPP) and Farmers Union Milk Marketing Cooperative (FUMMC) 
testified in support of the TAPP proposal, a variation of the 
CMPC proposal that would price both butterfat and protein on a 
differential basis, rather than on a per pound basis. 

The five north central Federal milk orders included in this 
proceeding should be amended to include multiple component 
pricing. On the basis of the record of this proceeding, multiple 
component pricing would entail pricing milk on the basis of the 
pounds of butterfat, protein and other nonfat solids contained in 
the milk, with a somatic cell adjustment to the hundredweight 
price paid to producers. The record indicates that a large 
percentage of the producers pooled under these orders are already 
eligible for or receive some form of multiple component pricing 
and that many of these component pricing plans use protein as a 
pricing component. 

The record also shows that the diverse component pricing 
programs that currently exist promote disorderly and inefficient 
marketing conditions in the procurement of milk supplies by 
competing handlers. The different programs establish non-uniform 
bases of payments to producers. The adoption of multiple 
component pricing will allow the Orders to recognize the 
additional value of milk with a higher-than-average solids 
content. 

In the five orders included in this proceeding, the vast 
majority of the milk pooled is utilized in manufactured products. 
The total solids in the milk used for manufacturing are the 
primary determinants of product yield. In addition, it is the 
solids in fluid milk that give it its nutritional value and 
taste. In both types of products, the current pricing system 
used in the five orders does not properly recognize the value of 
nonfat milk solids, nor encourage producers to increase the 
quantity of nonfat milk solids in the milk they produce. 

As a result of the shift in value in recent years from the 
butterfat portion of milk to the skim portion, most of the value 
of milk is determined on a volume basis without any consideration 
of the value of the skim components. Adoption of the multiple 
component pricing plan recommended in this decision will enable 
the market to reflect the value of the skim components in milk to 
producers. 

In addition to butterfat, protein is clearly the most 
appropriate component of milk on which payment should be based. 
Most of the milk pooled under these five orders is used for 
manufacturing, and 86% of the milk used in manufacturing is used 
to produce cheese. Because protein is a main determinant of 
cheese yield, and it is cheese that determines the profitability 
for most of the dairy industry in the 5-market area, the milk 
pricing system should recognize the value of the protein 
component of milk as it is used in the manufacture of cheese. 

Record evidence clearly shows that protein has a higher 
demand than other components of milk because of its functional, 
nutritional and economic value in the marketplace. The 
functional characteristics of protein allow it to form the matrix 
in the production of cheese and yogurt. Protein is also 
important to the air formation in the manufacture of certain 
products and provides some required nutrients in the human diet. 
Milk containing a higher percentage of protein will result in 
greater yields of most manufactured products than milk with a 
lower protein test. Additionally, handlers receiving milk that 
results in greater volumes of finished products such as cheese 
and cottage cheese than an equivalent volume of milk testing 
lower in protein should be required to pay more for the higher-
testing milk. At the same time, the dairy farmer producing milk 
that yields greater amounts of finished products deserves to be 
paid more for it than a dairy farmer producing the same volume of 
milk that results in less product yield. Thus, sending an 
economic signal to dairy farmers will encourage them to maximize 
the production of those components which have the greatest demand 
in the marketplace. 

According to analysis of the record, proponents are correct 
that attribution of all of the skim value of the M-W price to 
protein would result in an overstatement of the value of protein 
used in cheese and most other uses. In order to maintain fairly 
uniform prices between orders for milk used in manufactured 
products, it is necessary to assign the residual value of the M-W 
price minus the butterfat and protein values to either other 
nonfat solids or a fluid carrier price. The discussion of this 
residual component may be found in Issue 3b below.

A witness for the Galloway Company testified in support of TAPP and Galloway's own proposals to exclude sweetened
condensed milk, ice cream and ice cream mix from pricing under a multiple component pricing system. The witness stated
that such products should continue to be priced under the current pricing system.
The Galloway witness said that some Class II manufactured products, together with other products such as sour cream,
whipping cream, half and half, eggnog, yogurt, nonfat dry milk and butter, are not affected in yield by the protein
content of the milk from which the products are manufactured. Instead, according to the witness, it is total skim solids
that affect the yield of these products. Accordingly, the witness stated, it would not be equitable to price such products
under a multiple component pricing system which prices protein at a level higher than the remaining skim solids in
the milk. The witness argued that these products should be left out of any MCP plan adopted.
The Galloway witness testified, and post-hearing briefs filed on behalf of Anderson-Erickson (A-E) and Galloway
asserted, that yields are affected by the level of total skim solids rather than protein, making the pricing of protein
irrelevant for Class II pricing. The Galloway witness testified that there have been months in which the monthly average
protein level and other nonfat solids level of milk moved in opposite directions. In addition, the A-E and Galloway
briefs asserted that MCP would significantly increase the cost of Class II milk, which would put them at an even greater
disadvantage than currently with respect to products made from nonfat dry milk priced at the Class III-A price.
The Galloway witness stated that the primary product manufactured by the Galloway Company is sweetened condensed
milk. According to the witness, this product competes on a national basis with other manufacturers who do not have
to procure their milk under Federal orders with MCP provisions. The witness stated that it would be unfair to force
his organization to procure milk under a set of regulations that differ from those regulating his competitors.
A portion of the TAPP proposal would require a classification change for sweetened condensed milk from Class II to
Class III. Although the Galloway witness expressed strong concern over the impact of multiple component pricing
on his company, the effect of the classification of sweetened condensed milk on the Galloway company is not part of
the MCP issue. Reclassification of this product is a separate issue that was discussed thoroughly at a previous hearing,
and in the decision issued as a result of that hearing (58 FR 27774). No new evidence was presented at this hearing that
would justify reclassifying sweetened condensed milk.
Milk used to produce sweetened condensed milk, or any other Class II product, should not be exempted from multiple
component pricing. The MCP plan recommended for adoption will cover all Class II and Class III products.
Testimony at the hearing indicated that there are essentially two groups of Class II products that differ with respect
to the impact of multiple component pricing on the handlers that make these products. The first group of Class II products
are those in which there generally seemed to be agreement in the hearing record that yields are greatly affected by
the level of protein in the milk. These products include the various cottage cheeses and other similar soft, high-moisture
cheeses. The handlers that make these products benefit directly from higher levels of protein in milk and should be
accountable to the pool for this added benefit.
The second group of Class II products are those where there was some disagreement in the record about the affect of protein
on the yield. These products include ice cream and frozen desserts and mixes, fluid creams, sour creams, yogurt, sweetened
condensed milk and others. Considerable debate took place on whether it was appropriate to include these products
in a multiple component pricing system.

Occurrences of average protein level and other nonfat solids 
level of milk moving in opposite directions appears to be an 
exception rather than the rule. Evidence presented in ``Analysis 
of Component Levels and Somatic Cell Counts in Individual Herd 
Milk at the Farm Level, 1992, Upper Midwest Marketing Area'', 
indicates that about 60% of the variation in solids-not-fat is 
caused by variation in protein, and that higher protein levels 
are positively correlated with higher solids-not-fat levels. 
Data presented in this and other documents show that the level of 
other solids in milk tends to be relatively constant with, 
generally, small month-to-month variation. Thus, when a handler 
purchases milk with higher than average protein levels, he will 
also, generally, be purchasing milk with higher than average 
levels of solids-not-fat. 

In addition, the sum of the value of the protein and other 
solids under this recommended pricing plan equals the value of 
the total nonfat solids. The value of total nonfat solids, 
therefore, is a weighted average of the quantity and price of the 
protein and the quantity and price of the other nonfat solids 
contained in the milk. Analysis based on the average tests of 
the five markets shows that under the recommended pricing plan, 
the value of total nonfat solids would range from approximately 
$.002 per pound below the current value to approximately $.008 
per pound above the current value. 

This estimated price difference is certainly not the 
significant increase that is claimed in the briefs. In hearing 
testimony, the Galloway witness stated that an analysis of the 
effect of the CMPC proposal on the Galloway Company showed a 
nine-cent increase per hundredweight in the cost of Galloway's 
milk only when the CMPC somatic cell adjustment was included. 
Without the somatic cell adjustment, the analysis showed that the 
cost of milk to Galloway would be reduced under the CMPC multiple 
component pricing plan. 

It is appropriate to include all Class II products in the 
multiple component pricing system being proposed here. All 
Class II products derive benefit from butterfat, protein and/or 
other solids in the milk. The benefit may be in enhanced yield, 
such as protein for cottage cheese, or a combination of protein 
and other solids (i.e. the solids-not-fat in the milk) in many of 
the other Class II products. Or, the benefit may be in some 
other area. For example, the NAJ dairy chemist witness testified 
about the importance of protein in the functionality of many of 
these products, such as in ice cream, whipping cream, and yogurt. 
Some testimony even went so far as to discuss the importance of 
protein in fluid milk, in terms of the nutrient content and the 
mineral carrying content of the milk. However, since there was 
no substantial support for including Class I milk in the multiple 
component pricing system being proposed here, only Class II and 
Class III products will be priced on multiple components. 



2. Orders To Be Included



A proposal to incorporate the 
multiple component pricing plan adopted in this proceeding in the 
Nebraska-Western Iowa and Eastern South Dakota Federal milk 
orders as well as in the Chicago Regional, Iowa, and Upper 
Midwest orders should be adopted. 

The witness for Land O'Lakes (LOL), proponent of the 
proposal, listed a number of reasons for including the multiple 
component pricing plan in the Nebraska-Western Iowa and Eastern 
South Dakota orders as well as in the orders proposed by NAJ. 
The witness explained that all five orders are similar in that 
their predominant use of milk is for manufacturing Class III 
products. He testified that the primary organizations that 
supply the Nebraska-Western Iowa and Eastern South Dakota markets 
also are major participants in one or more of the Chicago 
Regional, Iowa, and Upper Midwest order marketing areas. The 
witness stated that inclusion of the Nebraska-Western Iowa and 
Eastern South Dakota orders in the multiple component pricing 
plan would allow those organizations that have producers and 
market milk in multiple orders to standardize their payrolls and 
billings, thus maintaining uniformity and reducing confusion 
among producers and handlers. 

The decision to include additional orders in this decision 
should not be made entirely on the basis of convenience to the 
parties marketing milk on the various orders. The decision is 
based on whether inclusion of the two orders would tend to 
effectuate the policy of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement 
Act. Certainly, including the Nebraska-Western Iowa and Eastern 
South Dakota orders in this decision will contribute to orderly 
marketing. 

The data supplied by the market administrators' offices 
describing the milksheds of the various orders shows a 
considerable overlap of milksheds. For example, many South 
Dakota counties have milk pooled on three of the five orders 
during the same month. In the absence of uniform pricing 
provisions between the five orders, disorderly marketing could 
occur, particularly when orders have overlapping milksheds, if 
one order were pricing milk on a skim and butterfat basis while 
another order was pricing milk on the basis of its components. 
If a producer's milk tests high for nonfat components but is 
pooled under an order that prices milk on a skim-butterfat basis, 
the producer would attempt to maximize returns by changing the 
market under which his milk is pooled to benefit from his high 
component levels. The opposite situation would occur if the milk 
of a producer testing below average for nonfat components is 
pooled under an order with MCP provisions. Such a producer would 
maximize returns by changing the order under which his milk is 
pooled to one with skim-butterfat pricing. This shuffling of 
producers in the same geographic area because of nonuniform 
pricing provisions would not constitute orderly marketing. 

Since the inclusion of the Nebraska-Western Iowa and Eastern 
South Dakota orders in the multiple component pricing decision 
would tend to reduce disorderly marketing in the region, benefit 
handlers by allowing a standardized payroll, and there was no 
opposition to their inclusion, multiple component pricing should 
be adopted for these two orders as well as the other three.

3. Components and Component Prices



Unlike the multiple 
component pricing plans adopted previously in other Federal milk 
marketing orders, this decision recommends the adoption of a 
pricing plan for milk based on three components rather than two. 
Under the five orders involved in this decision, milk should be 
priced on the basis of its protein, other nonfat solids, and 
butterfat components. 
The protein price contained in this decision is based on the 
value of protein in the manufacture of cheese, as determined by 
cheese market prices, and is not a residual of the Minnesota- 
Wisconsin (M-W) price minus butterfat value as is the case in 
other MCP plans. The butterfat price would be based on the 
butter market, as it is in other multiple component pricing 
systems. ``Other nonfat solids'' will be priced as a residual of 
the M-W price minus protein value and butterfat value. The 
butterfat, protein, and other nonfat solids prices shall be 
expressed in dollars per pound carried to the fourth decimal 
place. In addition, payments to each producer should reflect the 
value of participation in the marketwide pools on a hundredweight 
basis. 
As in other orders for which multiple component pricing has 
been adopted, this decision maintains the relationship of the 
value of producer milk to the 



M-W price. If the sum of the butterfat value and the protein value is greater than the M-W price, a situation which would
result in a negative other nonfat solids price, the protein price will be adjusted such that the other nonfat solids
price will be zero. 



In testimony and brief a witness for the Trade Association 
of Proprietary Plants (TAPP) and Farmers Union Milk Marketing 
Cooperative (FUMMC) presented a plan that would pay producers for 
protein above a neutral zone of 3.00% to 3.29%, and provide 
deductions for protein levels below the neutral zone. The level 
of adjustment would be tied to the price of barrel cheddar cheese 
on the National Cheese Exchange, and would be used to adjust pay 
prices to producers in a manner similar to the current butterfat 
differential. 
The witness said that milk traditionally has been purchased 
on a per hundredweight basis, with differential adjustments for 
levels of components. According to the witness, not only are 
producers usually paid on a per hundredweight basis, but milk is 
measured on a per hundredweight basis for purposes of plant 
accounting, payments between plants and to haulers, and by breed 
associations and DHIA with adjustments for percentages of 
components where necessary. The witness also claimed that using 
differential pricing would be revenue neutral. 
The TAPP/FUMMC witness is correct that switching payments to 
producers from a per hundredweight system to one of pounds of 
components, as adopted in this decision, is not a minor change. 
Some expense will be incurred by handlers and producers in 
adapting to the new system. However, the benefits to the 
industry in the affected areas of adopting a uniform multiple 
component pricing system outweigh the one-time costs of its 
adoption. The implication that everyone connected with the dairy 
industry must adopt this system is not correct. Pounds of milk 
must still be accounted for under the multiple component pricing 
system. For example, nothing in this decision would prevent a 
handler from continuing to pay haulers on a hundredweight basis. 
No testimony at the hearing from witnesses that have producers 
pooled under Federal orders that have already adopted multiple 
component pricing indicated that moving to a pricing system that 
prices milk component by the pound was an onerous burden. The 
transcript does reveal disagreement with the level of the protein 
price under some Federal orders with multiple component pricing, 
but little dissatisfaction with the system itself, nor complaints 
about the difficulty of switching to a component pricing system. 
As to the argument that pricing protein and butterfat on the 
basis of price differentials would be revenue neutral, the 
multiple component pricing system recommended for adoption is 
designed neither to enhance nor reduce total producer returns. 
The only changes in the total pool value that may occur because 
of the recommended changes would result from differences in the 
protein and other nonfat solids content between milk pooled under 
the orders included in this proceeding and the milk included in 
the Minnesota-Wisconsin survey. In addition, some redistribution 
of the dollars involved in each pool can be expected between 
producers, and between handlers.

The proposal by TAPP and FUMMC to leave butterfat on a 
differential pricing basis and to price protein on a differential 
basis with a neutral range is not included in this decision. To 
continue to pay producers for butterfat and to add payment for 
protein on the ``traditional'' differential system would confuse 
and frustrate producers in the understanding of their milk 
checks. Continued use of differentials would perpetuate the 
volume-based pricing system with a high value on water, and would 
fail to give producers a true price signal of what the 
marketplace wants. 
The use of differentials in pricing milk components is not 
widely understood. There is no valid reason to continue an 
outmoded and confusing pricing system in valuing milk components. 
Pricing components on a per-pound basis will allow producers to 
see clearly what components have the most value, a result which 
plainly fits the goal of encouraging producers to produce those 
components which have the highest value in the market place. 
Per-pound pricing also makes clear to producers that it is the 
pounds of components that result in payment, rather than the 
percentages of those components in milk. Producers would be 
better able to look at the cost of producing pounds of 
components, and compare those costs with possible returns. 
Application of a neutral zone would discourage producers from 
increasing protein production marginally unless such an increase 
would raise the protein level above the neutral range. 


A. Protein



The protein price for milk pooled under the 
five north central Federal milk orders should be calculated by 
multiplying the monthly average of 40-pound block cheese prices 
on the Green Bay Cheese Exchange by 1.32, without including a 
value for whey protein. 
No opposition was expressed at the hearing to pricing 
protein on the basis of its value in the manufacture of cheese. 
The differences between participants came in determining the 
appropriate level of the protein price. 
A proposal submitted and supported by National All-Jersey, 
Inc. (NAJ), and supported by a number of cooperative associations 
and other dairy organizations, would calculate the protein price 
in two parts: (1) Multiply the National Cheese Exchange monthly 
average 40-pound block cheese price by 1.32, and (2) add the 
monthly average whey protein concentrate price multiplied by 
.735. The sum of these two values would equal the protein price. 
The NAJ proponent witness explained that one of the 
objectives of the NAJ proposal was to establish a protein price 
that was high enough to give producers an incentive to produce 
protein. He added that a second objective was to determine the 
protein price from market forces rather than as a residual value, 
as is used in other Federal orders. The witness explained that 
the 1.32 factor used in the NAJ proposal comes from the modified 
Van Slyke cheese yield formula that is commonly used by the 
industry. The 1.32 factor represents the pounds of 38-percent 
moisture Cheddar cheese obtained from one pound of protein with 
75 percent of the protein going into the cheese. 
The witness gave four reasons for using the National Cheese 
Exchange 40-pound Cheddar block price (block price): (1) The 
majority of the cheese in the five Federal orders is priced using 
the block price as the base price, (2) the block price is used in 
determining the somatic cell adjustment in the Eastern Ohio-Western Pennsylvania, Indiana, and Ohio Valley orders,
as well as 
being used in the computation of the Class II price in all 
Federal orders, and in the determination of the Class 4a price in 
California, (3) since there is over twice as much American cheese 
manufactured in blocks as is made in barrels, and the Wisconsin 
assembly point barrel cheese price is within one cent of the 
block price, the block price represents a minimum cheese price, 
and (4) the protein price determined pursuant to this proposal 
gives a greater incentive to producers to produce protein and is 
more equitable to handlers and producers than the (lower) protein 
price contained in the other proposals.

<TEXT>
 

The NAJ witness continued by explaining that the proposal 
includes the value of whey protein in the protein price so that 
all of the protein in the milk would be accounted for. As 
explained by the proponent witness, the .735 factor was 
determined by dividing 25 percent, which is the protein left in 
whey after making cheese, by 34 percent, which is the percent of 
protein in whey protein concentrate. The resulting value, .735, 
is multiplied by the monthly average 34 percent whey protein concentrate 
price to yield the whey contribution to the protein price. The 
witness stated that the whey protein concentrate price was 
selected because it is a better indicator of the value of the 
protein contained in whey than is dry whey or animal feed whey. 
An economist supporting the NAJ proposal testified that even 
though the butterfat price is determined at its marginal value, 
that is, the value of butterfat in butter, the protein price 
should be determined by the value of protein in the most common 
use of protein in the five markets included in this proceeding. 
The witness pointed out that the most common use of protein is in 
the manufacture of cheese, with 85.9 percent of the milk 
marketed in 1992 in Wisconsin being used in the manufacture of 
cheese. The witness testified that the appropriate cheese price 
to be used in computing the protein price was the block price 
because it is a ``conservative estimate of the price actually 
received for block cheddar cheese''. The witness went on to 
explain that the reported block price is closer to what 
manufacturing plants receive for barrel cheese than is the 
reported barrel price because when the customary premiums are 
added to the reported barrel cheese price the result is 
approximately equal to the block price. 
The academic NAJ witness reiterated the NAJ position that 
the value of whey protein should be included in the protein price 
because the total value of the protein in producer milk would 
thus be reflected in the protein price, giving producers an 
incentive to produce more protein. 
A witness for Central Milk Producers Cooperative (CMPC) 
explained that the CMPC proposal would use the monthly average 
Green Bay Cheese Exchange barrel price (barrel price) instead of 
the block price, and would not include the value of whey protein. 
The witness for CMPC testified that the barrel price better 
represents the value of cheese than the block price because there 
is a greater volume of trading in barrel cheese than in block 
cheese. The resulting protein price would be lower than the 
protein price computed under the NAJ proposal. A witness for 
CMPC explained that their proposed protein price was based on the 
understanding that Federal order prices are minimum prices, and 
that the CMPC proposal, using the barrel cheese price and not 
including a value for whey protein, would result in a minimum 
price for protein.

The CMPC protein price proposal was supported at the hearing 
by other hearing participants, including National Farmers 
Organization (NFO), Kraft, Inc., Galloway Co., Wisconsin Cheese 
Makers Association (WCMA), National Cheese Institute (NCI), 
Farmers Union Milk Marketing Cooperative (FUMMC), and the Trade 
Association of Proprietary Plants (TAPP). A witness for NCI 
explained that if the protein price is set at too high a level, 
cheese manufacturers would experience a declining gross margin as 
the price for protein increases above the return the plant can 
obtain from additional protein. He explained that this would be 
the case with the protein price as proposed by NAJ, but not with 
the NCI and CMPC proposed protein price. 
Other witnesses supporting a lower protein price than that 
proposed by NAJ explained that protein should not be priced at a 
high level because the higher price may disadvantage handlers who 
do not manufacture cheese. They testified that the higher 
protein price would not be recoverable in certain products such 
as nonfat dry milk, condensed milk, or certain Class II products, 
and that even though the lower protein price still may not be 
recoverable, it offers the best alternative. 
The Galloway witness stated that if a multiple component 
pricing plan that derives a protein price from a cheese market 
value were adopted, the protein price should represent a minimum 
value, should be based on the barrel cheese market, and should 
not include a value for whey protein concentrate. He argued that 
such a price would have the impact of minimizing the difference 
between the protein and other solids prices. 
The TAPP/FUMMC witness testified that protein should be 
priced at a level somewhat below its full value in cheddar cheese 
and whey for several reasons. He said that too high a protein 
price could invite the use of non-dairy protein, whey solids, and 
casein, and thereby cause an increase in the production of 
imitation cheese. He also said that since some Class II and III 
products do not recoup as much value from high protein milk as 
cheese and cottage cheese, the protein price should be set at a 
level less than its full value for cheese. The witness expressed 
concern that too high a protein price could result in a zero 
value for the residual component, or other solids. According to 
the witness, a zero value for the residual would fail to reflect 
a realistic value, and would not cover a make allowance. 
In the post-hearing brief filed by NAJ, the position of 
using a ``justifiably high'' protein price to send a signal to 
producers that protein is the most valuable component in milk was 
reiterated. In post hearing briefs filed by CMPC, NFO, Kraft, 
NCI, TAPP and FUMMC, Anderson-Erickson (A-E), and AMPI North 
Central Region, the computation of the protein price as proposed 
by CMPC was supported. The reasons given in testimony for using 
a lower protein price than that proposed by NAJ were reiterated 
in briefs. In addition, A-E, Kraft and AMPI North Central Region 
argued that the difference between the barrel cheese price and 
the block cheese price is due to the cost of packaging and other 
nonmilk factors, and therefore the barrel cheese price should be 
used for determining the protein price. 
In pure economic terms the price of a product represents the 
supply and demand for that product as affected by place, form, 
and time. The problem with determining a price for protein 
contained in milk is that the protein is not marketed as a 
separate unique product, but is marketed as an integral part of 
both fluid and manufactured dairy products. Therefore, in 
determining an appropriate protein price, the value of protein in 
dairy products is determined by using the value of a product 
whose yield is a function of the protein content of the milk. At 
this point in time no attempt is made to reflect the protein 
content of milk in the value of milk used for fluid use. For 
this reason, the component pricing plan recommended in this 
decision does not apply to milk used for Class I purposes.

The level of protein in milk does have a measurable affect 
on the value of milk used for manufacturing. This value varies 
among the diverse manufactured products because of differences in 
the market values of manufactured dairy products and in the 
contribution made by protein to various finished products. For 
instance, testimony at the hearing showed that for a one-pound 
change in protein in the manufacture of cheddar cheese there is a 
1.32 pound change in the quantity of cheese produced, whereas in 
the production of milk powder a one-pound change in the level of 
protein would change the amount of powder produced by 
approximately one pound. Since the vast majority of milk in the 
five orders included in this hearing is used to manufacture 
cheese, the protein price will be based on the contribution made 
by protein in the manufacture of cheese. 
The 1.32 factor used in both methods proposed for the 
computation of the protein price for these five orders is derived 
from a modified Van Slyke cheese yield formula, where the casein 
is assumed to be 75 percent of the protein and the moisture 
content of the cheese is 38 percent. Assuming the butterfat is 
constant, a change of protein by one pound in this formula will 
change cheese yield by 1.32 pounds. Therefore, the 1.32 factor 
is appropriate for determining the order protein price. 
In determining the level of the protein price, the question 
of whether to use the average block price versus the average 
barrel price is a lesser issue than the question of whether or 
not whey protein should be included in the computation of the 
protein price, as proposed by NAJ. The average difference 
between the Green Bay Cheese Exchange average block price and 
average barrel price during 1992 and 1993 was $.0388 per pound. 
Multiplying this difference by the 1.32 factor results in an 
average difference of $.05 per pound of protein between the 
protein prices derived from the barrel and the block cheese 
prices. Over the same 2 years the inclusion of whey protein in 
the computation of the protein price would have increased the 
protein price by an average of $.4265. 
The principal issues that must be addressed in determining 
the computation of the protein price are the factors that must be 
included to arrive at a price that most accurately reflects the 
value of protein in milk. In addition, the effect of the level 
of the protein price on the other nonfat solids price must be 
considered. Since the other nonfat solids price is computed as a 
residual of the Minnesota-Wisconsin price, the other nonfat 
solids price is inversely related to the protein price. In 
determining an appropriate protein price and other nonfat solids 
price, the effects of both prices on payments to producers and 
margins to handlers buying milk must be determined. 
Inclusion of a protein price and an other solids price in 
determining payments to producers gives producers an incentive to 
increase their production of nonfat solids, especially protein. 
There was no evidence in the hearing record to indicate the cost 
to producers of increasing the protein content of milk. It is 
therefore difficult to determine what the absolute level of the 
protein price, or its relative level to the butterfat and other 
solids prices, must be to encourage producers to increase the 
protein content of milk.

On average for the 21 months of data available in the record 
the protein price recommended for adoption in this decision, at 
$1.6851 per pound of protein, is twice both the $.6379 per pound 
average other solids price and the $.8374 per pound average 
butterfat price. Certainly, pricing protein at double the price 
of the other components in milk gives producers a clear message 
that protein is the component most desired in the marketplace 
without over-valuing that component. The significant difference 
in prices between protein and the other nonfat solids and 
butterfat components should give producers an incentive to 
increase protein output. 
Testimony by several proponents of component pricing 
explained that component pricing would be more equitable to 
handlers than the current skim-butterfat pricing system. The 
proponents explained that the increased equity would be due to 
handlers paying for milk based more closely on its economic value 
to them. This increased equity is reflected in a narrower spread 
in margins between handlers making cheese from low protein-low 
solids milk versus handlers making cheese from high protein-high 
solids milk. Several exhibits showed that handlers using 
``average'' milk would experience little if any change in their net 
margins. However, handlers using low-testing milk would 
experience a higher net margin than under the present pricing 
plan, while handlers using high-testing milk would experience a 
lower net margin. This result, the narrowing of handlers' net 
margins when compared to the skim-butterfat pricing system, would 
occur no matter which of the proposed pricing plans is used to 
price the components. 
Analysis of data presented at the hearing, using price 
computations based on each of the proposals and averaged over the 
21 months of data included in exhibits, shows a range of net 
manufacturing margins for cheese using the recommended pricing 
system of $1.57 per hundredweight compared with the $3.34 range 
in cheese manufacturing margins per hundredweight of milk 
purchased attributable to the current skim-butterfat pricing 
system. The three component pricing plans discussed at the 
hearing would result in ranges in net cheese manufacturing 
margins of $1.16 per hundredweight for the NAJ proposal, $1.62 
per hundredweight for the CMPC proposal, and $1.70 per 
hundredweight for the NCI proposal. 
Even though the NAJ proposal yielded the smallest spread in 
net margins, further analysis of the NAJ results shows that the 
net margins increase and then start to decline. The decline in 
margins occurs when there is not enough butterfat in the milk to 
fully utilize the protein available, thus reducing the increase 
in cheese yield as protein content continues to increase. 
Accordingly, if the price of protein is greater than the 
increased return from cheese, the net return will start to 
decline. 
The decline in net returns under the NAJ proposal indicates 
that the NAJ proposal would overprice protein, at least when 
there is not enough butterfat to fully utilize the protein. The 
result is that the marginal return using the NAJ proposal peaks 
within the protein and butterfat range of average milk while the 
marginal return using the protein and other solids price as 
recommended in this decision continues to increase, although at a 
decreasing rate. A mandated pricing system should not set prices 
at levels that result in a declining marginal return, 
particularly when the decline occurs at or near average market 
component levels. Therefore, the whey protein factor should not 
be included in the computation of the protein price. 
The monthly average price for 40-pound block cheddar cheese 
on the National Cheese Exchange in Green Bay, Wisconsin, is the 
appropriate price to use for determining the protein price. Use 
of the block price results in producers receiving a higher price 
for protein than if the barrel price were used without handlers 
incurring any significantly higher cost for milk. In addition, 
although the record showed that more cars of barrel cheese were 
sold on the Exchange than block cheese, the predominant cheese 
form in which American cheese is manufactured in the five-market 
region is in 40-pound or 640-pound blocks.

The price difference between block and barrel cheese may be due to packaging and other nonmilk factors. However, the
protein price must be established at a level that best meets the needs of all concerned. The block cheese price should
be more effective than the barrel price in establishing a sufficiently high protein price to accomplish the goal of
encouraging producers to produce protein without having a detrimental impact on handlers, and does result in a narrower
range of manufacturing margins for cheese. 
Over the period January 1992 through September 1993, a protein price computed by multiplying the block price by 1.32
would have resulted in an average protein price of $1.6851 per pound. The CMPC and NCI proposals, using the barrel cheese
price, would have resulted in an average protein price of $1.6337 per pound of protein over the same time period. A comparison
of the net margins resulting from the recommended protein price versus the CMPC and NCI proposals shows that the slightly
higher protein price and correspondingly lower other solids price recommended herein have a negligible affect on
net margins. In fact, the spread between the highest and lowest cheese manufacturing margin declines slightly while
the margin per pound of cheese remains virtually unchanged. At the same time, the producer is paid a higher protein
price and thereby has a greater incentive to increase protein production. 


B. Other Nonfat Solids


The balance of the M-W price, after the values of protein and butterfat are removed, should be priced on the basis of
``other nonfat solids.'' The other nonfat solids price per pound will be computed by subtracting from the Class III
price the sum of the butterfat price times 3.5 and the protein price times the test of the Minnesota-Wisconsin price
survey milk. The result will be divided by the other nonfat solids test of the Minnesota-Wisconsin price survey milk.
Because the computation of the other solids price is based on a residual value, the other solids price could be negative
without further adjustments. Therefore, if computation of the other solids price results in a negative price, the
protein price will be adjusted (downward) to result in a zero value for the other solids price. 
As a residual, a NAJ witness stated, the other nonfat solids price would represent the value of lactose and ash, which
are the primary constituents of the other nonfat solids, and the difference in value between a competitively set price
for milk, the Minnesota-Wisconsin price, and the value of that milk based strictly on product prices. 
An expert witness for NAJ testified that a higher price for other solids than would be computed by using a protein price
lower than that proposed by NAJ was not justified because a higher other nonfat solids price would defeat the purpose
of multiple component pricing: To give producers an economic incentive to increase the protein content of their milk.
The witness also explained that since the ``other nonfat solids'' consist primarily of lactose, for which there is
a limited market and cheaper substitutes, there is no reason to have a high other nonfat solids price. 
A witness for CMPC explained that the CMPC proposal would result in a higher price for other nonfat solids than the NAJ
proposal. The witness testified that reduced emphasis on the protein price and increased emphasis on the other solids
price would reduce the impact of multiple component pricing on handlers and producers. The witness observed that
the average difference in handlers' cost of milk between the current skim-butterfat pricing system and the CMPC proposal
was less than one cent per hundredweight, while the NAJ proposal would result in a difference of slightly over three
cents per hundredweight. 
The CMPC witness pointed out that the same relationship was applicable to returns to producers. In fact, the witness
stated, when comparing the effect of the current skim-butterfat pricing system on handlers' obligations with both
the NAJ proposal and the CMPC proposal, there is a narrower spread from the highest difference to the lowest difference
and a smaller standard deviation with the CMPC proposal than the equivalent comparisons with the NAJ proposal. 
An alternative residual price was proposed by NCI and supported by Kraft. A witness for NCI testified that instead
of placing the residual value on the other nonfat solids, the residual value should be placed on the remaining pounds
of fluid milk. The witness explained that this residual fluid price would be calculated by subtracting the value of
3.5 pounds of butterfat and the value of the protein based on the protein test of the milk in the Minnesota-Wisconsin
price survey from the Minnesota-Wisconsin price. The resulting value would be divided by 100 minus 3.5 minus the protein
test of the milk in the Minnesota-Wisconsin price survey. 
The NCI witness testified that placing the residual value on other nonfat solids would yield an ``other nonfat solids''
price that could not be recovered in the marketplace. In addition, he stated, although the butterfat price is based
on the butter market and the protein price would be based on the return to cheese manufacture, the other nonfat solids
price would have no relationship to any particular established market or component. The witness also testified that
since an other nonfat solids test would not be needed for the NCI proposal, administration of the pricing plan would
be easier and less expensive than the other pricing proposals.

The proposal by NCI to place the residual value on a ``fluid 
carrier'' component has some merit in that it does not try to 
apply the residual value to a component such as other solids, on 
which the market may not place a value. The major drawback to 
the NCI proposal is that it ignores one of the components of 
milk, other nonfat solids, which is composed of lactose and ash. 

Although the other nonfat solids do not have as much market 
value as either butterfat or protein, they are an important 
component of milk. If a multiple component pricing system is to 
be effective it should price as many of the components in milk as 
possible, preferably based on the value of those components in 
the marketplace. There is, however, no readily available measure 
of the market value of the other nonfat solids. Since there was 
no testimony or any justification in the record for departing 
from the Minnesota-Wisconsin price as a basic price for milk, at 
least one of the components in the payment plan must represent 
the difference between a competitively-set pay price (the M-W) 
and the product-derived component prices. This residual value 
therefore represents not only the value of the lactose and ash, 
but also equates the component values, some of which are 
determined by their market value, with a competitively set 
producer pay price. 

The prospect of lactose being added to milk by producers for 
the purpose of benefitting from the other solids price was 
discussed by several hearing participants. The incentive to 
adulterate milk with added lactose should be no more of a problem 
than the current incentive to adulterate milk with water. 
Testing to determine whether lactose has been added should, in 
fact, be easier than testing for water since it would be part of 
the testing necessary to determine producers' payments. In 
addition, added lactose can be detected during normal testing 
procedures currently conducted on milk. 

NCI's concern that testing for total solids would increase 
handlers' costs and difficulty of testing was not established in 
the hearing record. In fact, testimony indicated that many 
handlers are already testing for total solids. Hearing testimony 
also showed that the testing for total solids is as accurate or 
more accurate than testing for butterfat or protein. In 
addition, the infrared machines that are used by most 
laboratories will test for total solids at the same time the 
butterfat and protein tests are done. Therefore, there should be 
no significant increase in testing cost or testing difficulty 
with the implementation of the component pricing plan 
incorporated in this decision. 



C. Butterfat



The value of butterfat in the amended orders 
will be the same as under the current orders. There was no 
proposal or testimony to change the way butterfat currently is 
valued. One expert witness testified that the current system of 
basing the value of butterfat on the value of butter is proper. 

This decision continues the historical relationship of the 
values of butterfat and butter. The difference between the 
pricing of butterfat in the amended order and the current order 
is due to the way that value is expressed. Currently the value 
of butterfat is expressed as a differential; that is, the 
difference in value between 0.1 pound of butterfat and 0.1 pound 
of skim milk. The amended order will express the value of 
butterfat on the basis of a price per pound. Whichever method is 
used, the total value of butterfat in milk is the same. However, 
by expressing the value on a per pound basis instead of a 
differential, the objective of demonstrating clearly to producers 
where the value is in milk is easily achieved. 

As proposed, the butterfat price per pound in the amended 
order will be determined by multiplying the butterfat 
differential by 965 and adding the Class III price. The 
resulting price per hundredweight would then be divided by 100 to 
give a price per pound of butterfat.

D. Miscellaneous



The three component prices: butterfat, protein, and the 
other solids, will be expressed on a per pound basis with four 
places to the right of the decimal. Analysis has shown that by 
expressing these prices to the nearest one-hundredth of a cent, 
the accuracy of the prices is significantly enhanced over 
expressing the prices to the nearest cent. Additionally, the 
difference between what is paid into the producer settlement fund 
and what is drawn from the producer settlement fund is much 
closer to zero than when prices are rounded to the nearest full 
cent. 

In contrast to other orders that have multiple component 
pricing provisions, this decision incorporates only one protein 
price as well as one other nonfat solids price. The pooling of 
the components to include the Class I skim portion is 
incorporated within the computation of the producer price 
differential. This feature of the pricing plan allows for the 
elimination of separate handler and producer protein prices and 
separate handler and producer other solids prices, and resulting 
confusion over which price, handler or producer, should be used 
when. In addition, a handler's per pound price for protein or 
other solids is the same whether the handler is buying milk from 
producers or from other handlers. 

The producer price differential, which represents the 
additional value of Class I and Class II milk in the pool and any 
positive or negative effect of Class III-A, will be determined by 
computing for each handler, and then accumulating for all 
handlers, the differential value (from Class III) of the Class I, 
Class II, and Class III-A product pounds. The differential value 
is adjusted, when appropriate, for shrinkage and overage, 
inventory reclassification, receipts of other source milk 
allocated as Class I, receipts from unregulated supply plants, 
location adjustments, and, in the Chicago Regional order, 
transportation and assembly credits. 

For the purpose of eliminating differences between handler 
and producer component values, the value of the Class I skim milk 
and the values of the protein and other solids contained in the 
skim milk allocated to Class II and Class III will be added to, 
and the values of the protein and other solids contained in all 
producer milk subtracted from, the differential pool. The 
accumulated total for all handlers is then adjusted by total 
producer location adjustments and one-half the unobligated 
balance in the producer settlement fund. The resulting value is 
then divided by the total pounds of producer milk in the pool, 
and an amount not less than four cents nor more than five cents 
is deducted. The result is the producer price differential to be 
paid to producers on a per hundredweight basis. 

It is possible for the producer price differential to be 
negative. A negative producer price differential can result for 
two reasons. Any of the Class I, II, or III-A differential 
prices may be negative and/or the minus adjustments may be large 
enough to offset any positive contribution from the differential 
price. A negative producer price differential would be 
equivalent to a uniform price less than the Class III price. 

An issue that was not directly addressed in this proceeding 
concerned testing for protein. The five orders included in this 
hearing currently base protein testing on the standard Kjeldahl 
method, which tests for nitrogen and then converts the nitrogen 
result to protein. Since there is a certain amount of free 
nitrogen in milk this test somewhat overstates the protein 
content of milk. Recent developments in testing allow for 
testing for true protein which is a more accurate reflection of 
protein content. In no way does this decision mandate a specific 
testing procedure. However, when (or if) the industry does move 
to testing for true protein, this decision should not be viewed 
as a hindrance to that conversion. At the time a change to 
testing for true protein may occur, a change in the 1.32 factor 
may be necessary.

4. Somatic Cell Adjustment


The producer price differential paid to each producer should be adjusted on the basis of the somatic cell content of
the producer's milk no matter how the milk is used by a handler. The value adjustment per hundredweight for each 1,000
somatic cells would be determined by multiplying .0005 times the monthly average National Cheese Exchange 40-pound
block cheese price. Each producer's monthly average somatic cell count (SCC), in thousands, would be subtracted
from 350 and multiplied by the value adjustment per 1,000 SCCs. Somatic cell adjustments will not be included in the
computation of the producer price differential.
A wide range of somatic cell or quality plans were included in the notice of hearing and at the hearing itself. In general,
all parties agreed that high-quality milk is important to all segments of the dairy industry. The major differences
between the parties arose over the questions of how and whether quality and/or somatic cell adjustments should be
included in the Federal order program.
A witness expert in the field of milk testing and quality testified about the influence somatic cells have on milk and
the resulting affect on products made from milk. The witness explained that in normal healthy cows the somatic cell
count is around 50,000. When an infection occurs in the udder of the cow white blood cells enter to fight the bacterial
infection. The SCC thus increases with the increasing number of white blood cells. In fact, white blood cells and somatic
cells are synonymous in this context. The witness continued by explaining that white blood cells contain enzymes
that are designed to break down the cell walls of the bacteria that are infecting the udder, but do not distinguish between
milk protein and bacteria. As a result, milk protein is also degraded. The witness also stated that the enzyme causes
some deterioration in milkfat. The witness continued by explaining that these white blood cells also cause to be activated
a proteolytic enzyme that is present in all milk.
The expert witness went on to explain that casein, which is the functionally important protein in milk, is broken down
into smaller protein chains that cannot perform the same functions as the casein. In fact, the witness explained,
the destruction of the casein affects all dairy products that rely on casein for structure or function. These products
include cheeses, whipped cream, yogurt, ice cream, and condensed and dry products used in the manufacture of other
products in which casein is a functional necessity. The witness also explained that higher SCC milks have a tendency
to have a faster increase in ``acid degree value'', which is a measure of rancidity and off flavors, than milks with
low SCCs. The witness testified that most of the damage occurs in the udder of the cow, where conditions are ideal for
the various enzymes to work. Once the milk is removed from the udder and cooled and stored properly, further deterioration
does not stop but is slowed down significantly, and further damage is minimized.
The expert witness discussed the effect that somatic cell counts have on the manufacture of various dairy products,
specifically cheese. He explained that high SCC milk results in lower cheese yields as well as problems with moisture
control and the activity of the starter culture. The increased somatic cells result in less casein in relationship
to the total protein so that less cheese is produced than would be indicated by the amount of protein present. The degraded
protein ends up in the whey with the rest of the whey proteins. The witness explained that in studies using individual
cow's milk cheese yield would drop dramatically as the somatic cell count went above 100,000, with the yield staying
fairly constant as the somatic cell count climbed to 1,000,000.
The witness pointed out that the cheese yield effect of somatic cells differs when bulk tank milk is used instead of
an individual cow's milk. He explained that in the case of bulk tank milk the relationship between cheese yield and
somatic cell counts would be linear, with cheese yields declining as SCCs increase. The witness stated that the linear
relationship is caused by the weighting of the SCCs in the bulk tank. Bulk tank tests are weighted averages rather than
simple averages. For example, if 100 pounds of milk with a somatic cell count of 50,000 and 400 pounds of milk with a somatic
cell count of 250,000 are added to the bulk tank the somatic cell count would be a weighted average of 210,000 and not
the simple average of 150,000.

The witness also testified that the effect of somatic cell 
levels on fluid milk products is reflected in higher acid degree 
values that indicate rancidity and off flavors, resulting in 
shorter shelf life. 

The expert witness testified that routine testing for 
somatic cells is conducted using a Foss-O-Matic infrared 
analyzer. The reference method for testing is the direct 
microscope somatic cell count in which the sample is stained and 
the somatic cells are counted using a microscope. The witness 
explained that if the electronic instruments are calibrated to 
the same reference samples the resulting test values and standard 
deviations should be in close agreement. The witness concluded 
that on a relative basis the results should be close to what 
would be obtained using other analytical tests. 

The notice of hearing contained a proposal by CMPC to 
include an adjustment for somatic cells. However at the hearing, 
a witness for CMPC explained that CMPC had decided neither to 
support nor oppose the inclusion of a somatic cell adjuster in 
the amended orders. The CMPC witness testified that the 
individual members of CMPC were free to support or oppose any of 
the somatic cell proposals as they saw fit. 

As originally proposed by CMPC, the somatic cell adjustment 
would be computed by multiplying the National Cheese Exchange 
barrel price times .0005. The resulting quantity would be 
multiplied by 500 minus the somatic cell count of the milk, in 
thousands. The resulting value would be applied on a per 
hundredweight basis. As explained by a witness for CMPC, the 
proposed somatic cell adjuster would apply to all producer milk, 
including that purchased by Class I handlers. The witness went 
on to explain that the effect of somatic cells on the value of 
producer milk and milk used in Class II and Class III would be 
included in the computation of the producer price differential. 
A somatic cell adjustment on Class I milk would not be included 
in the pool, and therefore would not affect Class I handlers' 
cost of milk. 

A witness for WCMA quoted extensively from the MCP 
recommended decisions for the Indiana, Ohio Valley, and Eastern 
Ohio-Western Pennsylvania milk marketing orders, and for the 
Michigan milk order, supporting the inclusion of an adjustment 
for somatic cells in Federal orders. The witness supported the 
CMPC proposal, but suggested that the somatic cell adjustment be 
applied to all milk; that is, Class I milk would not be exempted 
from a somatic cell adjustment. In addition, he proposed that 
the somatic cell adjustment be applied to the protein price 
rather than on a hundredweight basis. 

A witness for TAPP and FUMMC expressed support for including 
a somatic cell adjustment in the amended orders. The TAPP-FUMMC 
brief also supported such a provision. The witness stated that a 
somatic cell adjustment would benefit producers, handlers, and 
consumers by increasing the volume of milk marketed, improving 
yield, and supplying consumers with more nutritious, better 
quality dairy products. The TAPP/FUMMC witness explained that 
their proposal would have a neutral range of 301,000 to 400,000 
somatic cells with a one-cent positive adjustment for each 50,000 
somatic cell count below the neutral range up to a maximum of a 
six cents as the somatic cell count declined, and a one cent 
negative adjustment for each 50,000 somatic cell count above the 
neutral range up to a maximum of ten cents as the somatic cell 
count increased. The TAPP/FUMMC witness testified that under 
their proposal the somatic cell adjustment would apply to all 
producer milk, milk used in Class III, and, if the plan is to be 
revenue neutral, also to milk used in Class II. 

A witness for Swiss Valley Farms Company (Swiss Valley) 
testified in support of including additions and subtractions for 
somatic cells in the amended order. 
The Swiss Valley witness 
explained that somatic cells add proteolytic and lipolytic 
enzymes to the milk, as well as a plasmin enzyme that is 
extremely heat stable, such that it is not deactivated during 
pasteurization. Therefore, the enzyme continues to degrade the 
milk during storage. The witness added that low SCC milk is 
important to the Swiss Valley bottling operations because it 
results in fluid milk products of improved flavor, and to their 
cheese-making operations because of the resulting higher casein 
and lower whey protein content of the milk, which increases 
manufacturing returns.

The Swiss Valley witness proposed that the somatic cell 
adjustment begin at 400,000, with a positive adjustment as the 
SCC declines, and a negative adjustment as the SCC increases, 
from that level. The adjustment would be five percent of the 
National Cheese Exchange block price per 100,000 somatic cells. 
The Swiss Valley witness explained that the adjustment for 
somatic cells should apply to all producer milk and that Swiss 
Valley would support a somatic cell adjustment on Class II and 
Class III milk for the handler. 

In its post-hearing brief, Swiss Valley reiterated the 
testimony of its witness in favor of including an adjustment for 
somatic cells in the amended order. Besides supporting the 
position of the Swiss Valley witness, Swiss Valley expressed 
general support for a somatic cell adjustment. 

Testimony by a fluid processor witness indicated that the 
handler pays a quality premium when buying milk from producers 
and specifies minimum quality standards on purchased tanker milk. 

A witness for Mid-America Dairymen, Inc. (Mid-Am), testified 
that Mid-Am favored the inclusion of an adjustment for somatic 
cells in the amended order. The witness quoted from the Final 
Decision of the Indiana, Ohio Valley, and Eastern Ohio-Western 
Pennsylvania proceeding to support the position of Mid-Am that an 
adjustment for somatic cells should be included based on the 
effect somatic cells have on all milk. The witness explained 
that quantifying the adjustment on an incremental basis was 
difficult, and since not all milk is used in the manufacture of 
cheese a moderate adjustment rate should be used. The witness 
explained that the Mid-Am proposal would apply the somatic cell 
adjustment to all producer milk, on a hundredweight basis, with a 
positive adjustment for a somatic cell count below 400,000 and a 
negative adjustment for SCCs above 400,000. 

The witness explained that under the Mid-Am proposal, the 
somatic cell adjustment would be computed by subtracting the 
monthly average somatic cell count (in thousands) of the producer 
from 400 and then multiplying the result by the National Cheese 
Exchange monthly average barrel cheese price multiplied by .0005. 
He stated that since the somatic cell adjustment would be 
included in the computation of the producer price differential, 
on the producer side only, the total size of the pool would not 
change but individual producers would receive more or less, 
depending on whether their milk had a somatic cell count above or 
below the average SCC of the market. The Mid-Am witness 
continued by explaining that the Mid-Am proposal would be a 
redistribution of money from high somatic cell testing producer 
milk to the lower somatic cell testing milk, since there would be 
no additional money in the pool from the somatic cell 
adjustments. 

Instead of supporting the inclusion of somatic cell 
adjustment provisions in the five Federal orders, witnesses 
testifying on behalf of Land of Lakes, Inc., and NCI supported 
those organizations' proposals to allow each handler to submit a 
somatic cell or quality adjustment plan for payments to its own 
producers to the market administrator. 

A witness for LOL testified that with the LOL proposal a 
handler could reduce a producer's payment by up to ten percent 
from that required by the order if other producers of the handler 
received positive adjustments to their payments, as long as the 
total payments were equal to at least the minimum total order 
payment requirements. The witness explained that LOL's proposal does not contain specific criteria for quality
and/or volume 
adjustments. Each handler would submit an individual quality 
and/or volume adjustment plan to the market administrator which 
the handler would be required to adhere to until a new plan would 
be submitted. The witness testified that there is general 
agreement among handlers for the need to adjust payments for milk 
based on quality and volume. The witness continued by arguing 
that since the industry has not yet reached a consensus on how to 
adjust for quality and volume, it would be appropriate to allow 
each handler to develop its own quality and volume plan with the 
approval of the market administrator.

A witness for NCI testified that even though somatic cells 
affect the quality of milk, particularly in the manufacture of 
cheese, it is difficult to place a value on their effect. The 
witness explained that the variability in somatic cell levels 
from day to day and producer to producer makes determining an 
appropriate payment adjustment imprecise. In addition, the 
witness pointed out that other factors affect milk quality, and 
that placing a precise value on their effect is even more 
difficult than in the case of somatic cells. The NCI witness 
explained that the NCI proposal would allow each handler to 
establish and apply its own somatic cell adjustment schedule, 
with the approval of the market administrator, as long as the 
total payments to producers met or exceeded the Federal order 
minimum value. The witness explained that each handler could 
change its payment plan as conditions warranted. 
A witness for Kraft emphasized the earlier testimony on the 
effect of somatic cells on milk quality and cheese yields. The 
witness listed several studies supporting the results testified 
to by the NAJ expert witness. The Kraft witness testified that 
Kraft has, since the early 1980's, employed a quality payment 
program as part of its producer payroll. The witness went on to 
state that the plethora of somatic cell payment programs in use 
in the industry is strong evidence of the industry's recognition 
that somatic cells play a major role in milk quality. The Kraft 
witness explained that, in order of preference, Kraft supports 
the proposal submitted by NCI, followed by LOL's proposal and the 
TAPP/FUMMC proposal. 
Kraft, in its post-hearing brief, reiterated its support for 
a somatic cell adjustment to be included in the amended order. 
Kraft's brief did not support a particular adjustment plan but 
preferred the LOL-NCI concept. If that plan were not adopted, 
Kraft expressed support for the proposal by Mid-Am or the 
original CMPC proposal. A brief filed largely reiterative of NCI 
testimony was filed on behalf of NCI with the Dairy Division 
rather than the Hearing Clerk, and was received more than 3 weeks 
after the extended due date for filing briefs. The brief is not 
considered in this decision. 
In the Anderson-Erickson Dairy Company (A-E) post-hearing 
brief, A-E opposed the application of an adjustment for somatic 
cells to Class I milk. They contended that the Class I handler 
is unable to recover the added cost of lower somatic cell count 
milk from the retail market. This position was supported in the 
post-hearing brief filed by Lamers Dairy and Hansen Dairy 
(Lamers). Lamers pointed to testimony that indicated that the 
monetary effect of somatic cells on Class I milk could not be 
quantified as it could be with the manufacture of cheese. 
NFO, in its post-hearing brief, opposed the inclusion of any 
somatic cell adjuster in the recommended order. NFO expressed 
the opinion that support for a somatic cell adjuster was rather 
weak, with none of the positions presented having strong support. 
As an example, the NFO brief pointed to the neutral position 
taken by CMPC at the hearing after including a somatic cell 
adjuster in the original CMPC proposal. The NFO brief continued 
by explaining that testimony at the hearing indicated that the 
relationship between somatic cell levels and economic return is 
not a clear and definite relationship. The NFO brief went on to 
point out that there was no consensus at the hearing on how to 
apply a somatic cell adjuster. 
There is ample testimony and evidence to support the 
inclusion of a somatic cell adjuster in these amended orders. 
The somatic cell adjuster per hundredweight per 1,000 somatic 
cells will be calculated by multiplying .0005 times the monthly 
average National Cheese Exchange 40-pound block cheese price. To 
determine the value for an individual producer, the producer
s 
monthly average somatic cell count (in thousands) will be 
subtracted from 350 and multiplied by the somatic cell adjuster. 
The value of the somatic cell adjustment will be applied on a per 
hundredweight basis in the handlers' payment to producers. 
Somatic cells will not be included in the computation of the 
producer price differential.

The application of the somatic cell adjustment contained herein will promote orderly marketing. As pointed out by
several witnesses testifying at the hearing, producers in these markets are faced with a wide array of quality premium
programs. These programs have no standard basis or standard value that is applied between handlers. Therefore a producer
is faced with trying to decide which premium program will give the producer the greatest return without a standard
with which to compare. Inconsistent premium programs also result in producers with identical milk receiving different
prices for that milk depending on which handler is procuring the milk. The inclusion of this recommended somatic cell
adjustment will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act by encouraging orderly marketing through the standardization
of the basis for payment on the level of somatic cells in the milk and the standardization and checking of the testing
and test procedures used for determining the somatic cell counts. 

As was stated earlier, all parties agreed that high quality milk is important to all segments of the dairy industry.
In fact, there was little opposition to the inclusion of an adjustment for quality in the amended orders. Even though
testimony indicated that there are other quality factors that are important in overall milk quality, there was no
determination of their effect on milk quality or any attempt to compute a relevant associated value. Therefore, somatic
cell count will be used as the quality adjustment factor in this decision. 

There are two basic reasons to apply the somatic cell adjustment rate on a hundredweight basis rather than to adjust
the protein price. First, the somatic cell adjustment reflects the quality of milk in all uses rather than just cheese,
and second, application of the somatic cell adjustment on a hundredweight basis makes it very clear to producers and
to handlers that quality affects milk used in all products. Although testimony clearly showed that somatic cells
affect the quality of milk in all uses, a value determined on the basis of the effect of somatic cells on cheese reflects
the most prevalent use of milk in these markets and is the easiest way to determine a value for payment to producers.


A lack of agreement among hearing participants occurred in trying to determine the application of a somatic cell adjustment.
There was a general consensus that an adjustment should be made in the producer pay price for quality and/or somatic
cells. The rate at which such adjustment should be made varied by proposal, but was tied to the reduction in cheese yield
that occurs as somatic cell counts increase. Several witnesses testified that the somatic cell adjustment rate should
be set at a moderate level. Testimony indicated that most of the decline in cheese yield occurs as the SCC increases
from below 100,000 to above 100,000, with a much slower decline in yield as the somatic cell count increases to one million.
However, testimony also showed that declines in yield are much more linear when somatic cell tests and cheese yield
studies are done with bulk tank milk than with the milk of individual cows. Several proposals suggested using a factor
of .0005 times the cheese price in determining the value of the somatic cell adjustment per 1,000 somatic cells. This
factor is derived from the approximately four percent decline in cheese yield as the somatic cell count increases
from 100,000 to one million. This is the same adjustment that is used in other Federal orders in which a somatic cell
adjuster is included. 

The formula used to determine the somatic cell adjuster reflects the changes in the yield of cheese as the levels of
somatic cells change. The formula also ties the adjustment to the value of the milk by using the block cheese price to
determine the value per 1,000 somatic cells. However, since record evidence clearly shows that the affect of somatic
cells on Class I and Class II products is related more to the quality of the finished product than to the yield of the product,
the formula should reflect less than the full value of the affect of somatic cells on cheese yield. Using the recommended
formula, the somatic cell adjustment for the average producer under the Chicago Regional order would be three cents
per hundredweight, far below the 25 cents per hundredweight average quality premium that is shown in hearing exhibits
as being paid currently.

The corresponding somatic cell adjustments for average 
producers under the four orders in addition to Chicago are: 
Upper Midwest, zero cents; Iowa, minus one cent; Nebraska-Western 
Iowa, minus six cents; and Eastern South Dakota, minus three 
cents. The formula results in an estimated range of forty-eight 
cents per hundredweight from a somatic cell count of 1,000 to a 
somatic cell count of 750,000, or a positive twenty-two cents to 
a minus twenty-six cents, although there is no limit on the 
deduction that may be made since there is no limit on the maximum 
SCC in this decision. 
The use of a neutral point was supported by various 
proponents of a somatic cell adjuster. Several others suggested 
a neutral range. The record contains numerous references to a 
neutral range or point around a somatic cell count of 400,000. 
One witness expressed the opinion that the base level for the 
somatic cell adjustment should be near the average for the five 
markets. Another witness explained that their proposal used 
400,000 SCC because that is where their present quality program 
begins. Based on data included in the hearing record, the 
average SCC for producers whose milk is pooled under the five 
orders is 367,000. Therefore, a neutral point of 350,000 is 
appropriate. It is close to the average for the markets, and not 
substantially different from the values that witnesses found 
appropriate. Also, by using the formula included herein, 
proponents of both a neutral point or a neutral range are 
accommodated because the formula yields no value adjustment for 
approximately plus or minus 7,000 SCC around 350,000. 
The formula will give producers an incentive to reduce their 
SCCs while minimizing the effect of the somatic cell adjuster on 
those products in which somatic cells have a quality effect 
rather than a yield effect. The argument that a somatic cell 
adjuster will negate the forward pricing of Class I and Class II 
milk is also minimized by the proposed formula. Analysis shows 
that the month-to-month variation in the somatic cell adjustment 
at a particular somatic cell level is no more than one cent per 
hundredweight, with an approximate change of 1 cent for every 
increment of 15,000 somatic cells. This small variation from 
month to month should allow handlers to determine accurately the 
cost of milk for forward pricing. In fact, the variation in the 
somatic cell adjustment is significantly less than the month-to-
month variation in the current butterfat differential, which is 
not known until after the end of the month. 
Since this decision applies an adjustment for somatic cells 
to all milk, there is no need to include the somatic cell 
adjustment in the computation of the producer price differential. There are only two reasons to include somatic cells
in the 
producer price differential computation: (1) To exclude a 
particular class or classes of milk from being affected by a 
somatic cell adjustment, or (2) to redistribute the somatic cell 
adjustment money among all of the producers in the market. Since 
this decision applies the somatic cell adjustment to all milk the 
first reason is not relevant. 
There may be some merit for redistributing money from high 
somatic cell producers to low somatic cell producers marketwide. 
However, if such a provision were adopted, the producer price 
differential would also be affected with changes in the market 
average SCC. In fact, as the market average SCC decreased, the 
producer price differential would decline below the level of the 
producer price differential in the absence of a somatic cell 
count adjustment, decreasing the incentive for producers to 
reduce the somatic cell counts of their milk and defeating the 
objective of a somatic cell count adjustment. Therefore the 
somatic cell adjustment will be applied to all producer milk 
without being included in the pool or producer price differential 
computation.

Neither the quality proposal by LOL nor the somatic cell 
proposal by NCI, in which each handler would be allowed to submit 
an individual quality or somatic cell payment plan to the market 
administrator, is included in this decision. Although the 
Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act in 7 U.S.C. 608c(5) does 
allow for adjustments to minimum pay prices on the basis of 
quality, such adjustments should be at a uniform rate for all 
producers in the market. Allowing each handler to have its own 
payment schedule would defeat the concept of uniform pricing to 
producers, eliminate the purpose of allowing quality adjustments 
under the order, and lead to disorderly marketing. Producers 
with identical milk shipping to different handlers within the 
same market could, and probably would, have different minimum 
order pay prices if each handler had its own quality or somatic 
cell payment plan. 
A number of witnesses testified that the profusion of 
payment plans currently in effect in the market today are causing 
disorderly marketing, and that one of the benefits of 
incorporating multiple component pricing with a somatic cell 
adjustment in the five orders would be to reduce or at least 
standardize the vast array of producer payment plans currently in 
effect in the region. In view of such testimony, adoption of the 
LOL or NCI quality adjustment proposals would serve no purpose. 



5. Conforming Changes



To accommodate multiple component pricing a number of changes need to be made in the current order provisions of the
five orders in this decision. To compute a handler's obligation and the producer price differential, several 
prices need to be defined. The Class I differential price should 
be defined as the difference between the current month's Class I 
price and the current month's Class III price. The Class II 
differential price should be defined as the difference between 
the current month's Class II price and the current month's 
Class III price. These differential prices should not be 
confused with the fixed value that is added to the Minnesota-Wisconsin price for the second preceding month to arrive
at the 
Class I price for the current month, or the computed value that 
is used in the computation of the Class II price. It should also 
be pointed out that these differential prices may be negative, 
which currently happens when the Minnesota-Wisconsin price is 
greater than the Class I or Class II price. The skim milk price 
will be calculated by subtracting from the Class III price the 
value determined by multiplying the butterfat differential by 35. 
The skim milk price will be expressed on a per hundredweight 
basis with four places to the right of the decimal. 

Since producer location adjustments are not changed in this 
decision, the application of such adjustments to the producer 
price differential remains unchanged. In some of the orders the 
uniform price is ``snubbed'' at the Class III price when producer 
location adjustments are applied. In these orders, the producer 
price differential will be adjusted for location until the 
producer price differential is zero if the producer price 
differential at the zero zone is zero or greater. However, if 
the producer price differential is negative, no minus producer 
location adjustment will be applied. Plus adjustments to a 
negative producer price differential would be made. In those 
orders in which the uniform price is not ``snubbed'' to the Class 
III price, producer location adjustments will be applied as they 
are currently. 
For the Market Administrator to compute the producer price 
differential handlers will need to supply additional information 
on their monthly reports of receipts and utilization. In 
addition to the product pounds and butterfat currently reported, 
handlers will be required to report pounds of protein and pounds 
of other solids. This information will be required from each 
handler for all producer receipts, including milk diverted by the 
handler, receipts from cooperatives as 9(c) handlers, and 
receipts of bulk milk received by transfer or diversion. 

For the Upper Midwest Order only, the due date for handlers 
to submit reports of receipts and utilization should be changed, 
from the 10th of the month to the 8th of the month. Currently, 
the Upper Midwest Order requires handlers to submit reports by 
the 10th of the month, and the Uniform Price to be announced by 
the 11th of the month, allowing only one day for the pooling 
process. The other four orders involved in this decision allow a 
longer period of time for the processing of data and the 
announcement of the Uniform Price. In the Chicago Regional 
Order, handler reports are due on the 10th, and the Uniform Price 
is announced on the 14th, a period of 4 days. In the Iowa Order, 
handler reports are due on the 8th, and the Uniform Price is 
announced on the 12th, a period of 4 days. In the Nebraska-Western Iowa Order, handler reports are due on the 7th, and
the 
Uniform Price is announced on the 12th, a period of 5 days. In 
the Eastern South Dakota Order, handler reports are due on the 
8th, and the Uniform Price is announced on the 12th, a period of 
4 days.

The order changes recommended in this decision will require the market administrator of each order to carry out a more
comprehensive review and analysis of the data than is required currently. As noted at the hearing, the pooling process
will become somewhat more complicated because data submitted will involve not only skim and butterfat pounds, but
also pounds of protein and other solids. Thus, it is appropriate to allow the market administrator for the Upper Midwest
Order a period of 3 days to compute and announce the producer price differential and the statistical uniform price.
By changing the due date for handler reports from the 10th to the 8th, but retaining the 11th as the day the producer price
differential and statistical uniform price are to be announced, the pooling process will be better accommodated.

For purposes of allocation of producer receipts the assumption will be made that the protein and other solids cannot
easily be separated from skim milk. The protein and other solids will therefore be allocated proportionately with
the skim milk based on the percentage of protein and other solids in the skim milk received from producers.

The implementation of this multiple component pricing decision will require several changes in the way handlers
pay for milk. Partial payment at the Class III price for the previous month for milk deliveries during the first 15 days
of a month was proposed by both NAJ and CMPC. Although no objections to the proposal were expressed, there was no testimony
supporting or opposing the proposal. Therefore, there is no basis in the record of the proceeding to make substantive
changes in the payment provisions of the orders that provide for partial payments at a significantly different level.

Currently, the Nebraska-Western Iowa order, the Upper Midwest order, and the Iowa order require partial payments
to be based on the prior month's uniform price. Since this component pricing plan does not contain a uniform price,
these three orders will be changed to require the partial payments to be made at the ``statistical uniform price'',
announced by the market administrator on or before the 14th day of the month for which partial payment is to be made.

The Chicago Regional order will also be changed from the current requirement that the partial payment be based on the
lowest class price for the prior month to a partial payment based on the prior month's Class III price. The Eastern South
Dakota order does not need to be changed.

Final payment to producers will be determined by the total hundredweight of milk times the producer price differential
adjusted by the applicable location adjustment, plus or minus the total hundredweight of milk times the adjustment
for somatic cells, plus the pounds of protein times the protein price, plus the pounds of other solids times the other
solids price, plus the pounds of butterfat times the butterfat price, minus any authorized deductions currently
allowed.

Handlers purchasing milk from cooperative pool plants will pay for Class I milk at the Class I differential price plus
the pounds of skim milk in Class I at the skim milk price plus the pounds of butterfat at the butterfat price; for Class
II milk at the Class II differential price plus the pounds of protein at the protein price, plus the pounds of other solids
at the other solids price, plus the pounds of butterfat at the butterfat price; and for Class III milk at the protein
pounds times the protein price, plus the pounds of other solids at the other solids price, plus the pounds of butterfat
at the butterfat price. All milk purchased will be adjusted by the appropriate somatic cell adjustment. Payment for
9(c) milk will be based on the producer price differential adjusted for location at the plant of receipt and somatic
cells, plus the value of protein, other solids, and butterfat contained in the milk.

Since producers will be receiving payments based on the component levels of their milk, the payroll reports that handlers
supply to producers must reflect the basis for such payment. Therefore the handler will be required to supply the producer
not only with the information currently supplied, but also: (a) The pounds of butterfat, the pounds of protein, and
the pounds of other solids contained in the producer's milk, as well as the producer's average somatic cell count,
and (b) the minimum rate that is required for payment for each component and, if a different rate is paid, the effective
rate also.

The handler's value of milk will be determined by combining: (a) The pounds of producer milk in Class I times the Class
I differential price, (b) the pounds of producer milk in Class II times the Class II differential price, (c) the value
of overage, (d) the value of inventory reclassification, (e) the value, at the Class I minus Class III price difference,
of other source receipts and receipts from unregulated supply plants allocated to Class I, (g) the value of handler
location adjustments, (h) Class III-A credits, (i) the pounds of skim milk in Class I times the skim milk price,
(j) the pounds of protein in Class II and Class III times the protein price, and (k) the pounds of other solids in Class
II and Class III times the other solids price.

The pounds of protein and other solids in Class II and Class III will be determined by multiplying the percent protein
or percent other solids in the skim milk of the total producer milk received by the handler times the pounds of skim milk
allocated to Class II and Class III.

Handler's obligations to the producer settlement fund will be determined by subtracting from the handler's value
of milk the following: (a) The total pounds of each handler's producer milk times the producer price differential
adjusted for location, (b) the total pounds of protein contained in the producer milk times the protein price, (c)
the total pounds of other solids contained in the producer milk times the other solids price, and (d) the value of other
source milk at the producer price differential with any applicable location adjustment at the plant from which the
milk was shipped deducted from the handler's value of milk.

The amendments to order language accompanying this recommended decision are based on the current language of the
five orders. There are two national amendatory proceedings in process (the M-W replacement and Class II pricing)
that may result in changes to some of the provisions that will also be changed by this proceeding. No attempt has been
made in drafting the order language amendments accompanying this decision to accommodate any of the changes that
may result from the other two proceedings. Any adjustments needed will be made on the basis of the order language in
effect at the time a final decision is issued.



Rulings on Proposed Findings and Conclusions 



Briefs and proposed findings and conclusions were filed on behalf of certain interested parties. These briefs, proposed
findings and conclusions, and the evidence in the record were considered in making the findings and conclusions set

General Findings



The findings and determinations hereinafter set forth supplement those that were made when the aforementioned orders
were first issued and when they were amended. The previous findings and determinations are hereby ratified and confirmed,
except where they may conflict with those set forth herein.

(a) The tentative marketing agreements and the orders, as hereby proposed to be amended, and all of the terms and conditions
thereof, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act;

(b) The parity prices of milk as determined pursuant to section 2 of the Act are not reasonable in view of the price of
feeds, available supplies of feeds, and other economic conditions which affect market supply and demand for milk
in the marketing areas, and the minimum prices specified in the tentative marketing agreements and the orders, as
hereby proposed to be amended, are such prices as will reflect the aforesaid factors, insure a sufficient quantity
of pure and wholesome milk, and be in the public interest; and

producer price differential per hundredweight for Zone 1. If the 
unreserved cash balance in the producer settlement fund to be 
included in the computation is less than 2 cents per 
hundredweight of producer milk on all reports, the report of any 
handler who has not made the payments required pursuant to 
 1030.71 for the preceding month shall not be included in the 
computation of the producer price differential. The report of 
such handler shall not be included in the computation for 
succeeding months until he has made full payment of outstanding 
monthly obligations. Subject to the aforementioned conditions, 
the market administrator shall compute the producer price 
differential in the following manner: 

(a) Combine into one total for all handlers: 

(1) The values computed pursuant to  1030.60 (a)(1), (a)(2) 
and (b) through (k) for all handlers; 

(2) Add values computed pursuant to  1030.60 (a)(3), 
(a)(4), and (a)(5) and subtract the values obtained by 
multiplying the handlers' total pounds of protein and total 
pounds of other solids contained in such milk by their respective 
prices; and 

(3) Subtract the value obtained by multiplying the 
difference between the Class III price and the Class III-A price 
times the pounds of product determined pursuant to  1030.43(e);

Subject to the provisions of  1068.52, the class prices per hundredweight of milk containing 3.5 percent butterfat
and the component prices for the month shall be as follows: 

(a)

 Class I price. 

 The Class I price shall be the basic formula price for the second preceding month plus $1.20. 



* * * * * 



(e)

 Class I differential price. 

 The Class I differential price shall be the difference between the current month's Class I and Class III prices (this
price may be negative). 

(f)

 Class II differential price. 

 The Class II differential price shall be the difference between the current month's Class II and Class III prices (this
price may be negative). 

(g)

 Skim milk price. 

 The skim milk price per hundredweight, rounded to the nearest cent, shall be the Class III price less an amount computed
by multiplying the butterfat differential by 35. 

(h)

 Butterfat price. 

 The butterfat price per pound, rounded to the nearest one-hundredth cent, shall be the Class III price plus an amount
computed by multiplying the butterfat differential by 965 and dividing the resulting amount by one hundred.

less than zero, then the protein price will be reduced so that the other solids price equals zero. 

(k)

 Somatic cell adjustment. 

 The somatic cell adjustment per hundredweight shall be computed by subtracting the monthly average somatic cell
count, in thousands, of the producer's milk from 350 and multiplying the remaining quantity by .0005 times the monthly
cheddar cheese price as defined in paragraph (i) of this section.

 1079.60 


Handler's value of milk. 



For the purpose of computing a handler's obligation for milk the market administrator shall determine for each month
the value of milk of each handler described in  1079.9(a) with respect to each of its pool plants, and each handler
described in  1079.9 (b) and (c).

(a) The handler's obligation for producer milk and milk received from a handler described in  1079.9(c) shall
be computed as follows: 

(1) Multiply the total hundredweight of milk in Class I as determined pursuant to  1079.43(a) and  1079.44(c)
by the Class I differential price for the month;

(2) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the total 
hundredweight of milk in Class II as determined pursuant to 
 1079.43(a) and  1079.44(c) by the Class II differential price 
for the month; 

(3) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the hundredweight 
of skim milk in Class I as determined pursuant to  1079.44(a) by 
the skim milk price; 

(4) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the pounds of 
skim milk in Class II and Class III as determined pursuant to 
 1079.44(a) by the average protein content of the skim milk 
received by the handler, and multiplying the resulting pounds of 
protein by the protein price; and 

(5) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the pounds of 
skim milk in Class II and Class III as determined pursuant to 
 1079.44(a) by the average other solids content of the skim milk 
received by the handler, and multiplying the resulting pounds of 
other solids by the other solids price;



* * * * * 



(f) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the Class I 
differential price applicable at the location of the nearest 
unregulated supply plants from which an equivalent volume was 
received by the pounds of skim milk and butterfat in receipts of 
concentrated fluid milk products assigned to Class I pursuant to 
 1079.43(d) and  1079.44(a)(7)(i) and the pounds of skim milk 
and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to 
 1079.44(a)(11) and the corresponding steps of  1079.44(b), 
excluding such skim milk and butterfat in receipts of bulk fluid 
milk products from an unregulated supply plant to the extent that 
an equivalent amount of skim milk or butterfat disposed of to 
such plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal milk 
order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as 
an offset for any other payment obligation under any order; 

(g) Subtract for a handler described in  1079.9(c) the 
amount charged the preceding month for the skim milk and 
butterfat contained in inventory at the beginning of the month 
that was delivered to a pool plant during the month; 



* * * * * 



6. Section 1079.61 is amended by revising the heading, 
introductory text, and paragraphs (a) and (e) to read as follows: 



 1079.61 

Producer price differential. 



For each month the market administrator shall compute a 
producer price differential per hundredweight for Zone 1. If the 
unreserved cash balance in the producer settlement fund to be 
included in the computation is less than 2 cents per 
hundredweight of producer milk on all reports, the report of any 
handler who has not made the payments required pursuant to 
 1079.71 for the preceding month shall not be included in the 
computation of the producer price differential. The report of 
such handler shall not be included in the computation for 
succeeding months until he has made full payment of outstanding 
monthly obligations. Subject to the aforementioned conditions, 
the market administrator shall compute the producer price 
differential in the following manner: 

(a) Combine into one total for all handlers: 

(1) The values computed pursuant to  1079.60 (a)(1), 
(a)(2), and (b) through (j) for all handlers; 

(2) Add values computed pursuant to  1079.60 (a)(3), 
(a)(4), and (a)(5) and subtract the values obtained by 
multiplying the handlers' total pounds of protein and total 
pounds of other solids contained in such milk by their respective 
prices; and 
(3) Subtract the value obtained by multiplying the 
difference between the Class III price and the Class III-A price 
times the pounds of product determined pursuant to  1079.43(e); 



* * * * * 



(e) Subtract not less than 4 cents nor more than 5 cents 
from the price computed pursuant to paragraph (d) of this 
section. The result shall be known as the ``producer price 
differential.'' 

7. Section 1079.62 is revised to read as follows:

 Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Section 1018 of the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 directs EPA and HUD to jointly issue
regulations requiring disclosure of certain information by persons selling or leasing (leasing includes renting)
housing that may contain lead-based paint or lead-based paint hazards. Under that authority, EPA and HUD propose
the following requirements. Sellers and lessors, or any agent acting on their behalf, of most residential housing
built before 1978 would be required to provide purchasers and lessees with all information known to the seller, lessor,
or agent on the presence of lead-based paint and lead-based paint hazards, as well as an EPA pamphlet on lead-based
paint hazards. In addition, sellers would be required to grant purchasers 10 calendar days to conduct an inspection
or risk assessment for lead-based paint hazards before being obligated under any contract to purchase that housing.
Finally, the regulation would require that a standard warning, disclosure, and acknowledgement form be attached
to all leases and sales contracts involving target housing. The rule would require the completion of these disclosure
activities before the purchaser or lessee had become obligated under any contract to purchase or lease the target
housing. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Authority 


This proposed rule is issued under the authority of section 1018 of the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction
Act of 1992, [42 U.S.C. 4852(d)]. The Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act is Title X of the Housing and
Community and Development Act of 1992, Public Law 102-550. 



II. Background


A. Legal Background


In 1992, Congress, recognizing the need to control exposure to lead-based paint hazards, passed the Residential
Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 (the Act). The main purpose of the Act was to develop the infrastructure
and standards necessary to reduce lead-based paint hazards in housing (section 1003 of the Act). Congress recognized
that lead poisoning is a particular threat to children under age 6, and particularly emphasized the needs of this vulnerable
population within various sections of the Act. Section 1021 of the Act amends the Toxic Substances Control Act (``TSCA''),
15 U.S.C. 2601 et seq., by adding a new Title IV entitled ``Lead Exposure Reduction.'' 
Actions under some sections of the Act are to be implemented and administered by HUD, some by EPA, and some jointly by
both agencies, often in consultation with other federal agencies. 
This proposed rule is issued under the authority of section 1018 of the Act. Section 1018 requires EPA and HUD to jointly
promulgate regulations for disclosure of lead-based paint or lead-based paint hazards in target housing which is
offered for sale or lease. Target housing is defined in section 1004(27) of the Act and in Unit V. of this preamble. Specifically,
section 1018 requires: (1) Sellers or lessors to provide the purchaser or lessee of target housing with a lead information
pamphlet to be developed under section 406(a) of TSCA; (2) sellers and lessors of target housing to disclose any known
lead-based paint or lead-based paint hazard in such housing; (3) sellers of target housing to permit purchasers a
10-day opportunity to conduct a risk assessment or inspection for the presence of lead-based paint hazards; and (4)
attachment of a lead warning statement to each contract for purchase and sale of target housing. Violation of section
1018 may result in civil and criminal penalties and potential triple damages in a private civil suit. Section 1018
provides that regulations under this section must be promulgated no later than 2 years after the date of enactment
of the Act and must take effect 3 years after enactment of the Act. Thus, Congress intended that the section 1018 regulations
must be published as final by October 28, 1994, and must take effect on October 28, 1995. Although 1018 specified that
final regulations should be promulgated no later than October 28, 1994, EPA/HUD will not be able to meet this deadline.
It appears that Congress' intent in section 1018 was to provide a year between the promulgation of the final rule, and
the effective date of the rule. Congress reasonably could have believed that this year was necessary in order that
the real estate industry, landlords, sellers, etc. could become familiar with the rule requirements and set up procedures
for compliance. For this reason, EPA and HUD believe that the effective date of the rule should be no earlier than 1 year
after promulgation of the final rule, even if this occurs later than October 28, 1995. EPA and HUD believe that this
interpretation is the one most consistent with Congressional intent. 
Several related provisions of the Act and of the new Title IV of TSCA, added by section 1021 of the Act, are briefly discussed
below to further clarify this proposed rule. 
The section most closely related to section 1018 is section 406 of TSCA. Section 406(a) directs EPA to develop and publish,
after notice and comment, a lead hazard information pamphlet on lead and lead-based paint hazards in the home. EPA
has developed the draft pamphlet in consultation with HUD and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),
and published a notice in the 

Federal Register

 of March 9, 1994 (59 FR 11119), announcing the pamphlet's availability for public review and comment. As required
under section 1018 of the Act, the section 406 pamphlet will be given to purchasers and lessees under the EPA/HUD disclosure
regulations proposed today. 
Sections 1004(15), 1004(16), and 1004(17) of the Act generally define lead-based paint hazards, lead-contaminated
dust, and lead-contaminated soil. Congress charged EPA under section 403 of TSCA to issue regulations identifying
more specifically the meaning of these three terms, for the purposes of other provisions of TSCA and the Act. Thus,
EPA is in the process of defining more precisely what constitutes a lead-based paint hazard, including lead-contaminated
dust and lead-contaminated soil. However, EPA and HUD believe that the provisions of this proposed section 1018 rule
can be carefully considered on their own merit and independent of decisions made under the section 403 rulemaking.

Therefore, EPA and HUD are soliciting public comment on this proposed rule prior to the availability of proposed or
final regulations under section 403. EPA and HUD believe the public has adequate information and opportunity to comment
on the contents of this proposed rule and on the relationship between regulations promulgated under sections 1018
and 403 for the following reasons: (1) While known lead-based paint hazards must be disclosed, this requirement is
only one of a number of requirements for which sellers and lessors of target housing are responsible. Therefore, EPA's
definition of ``lead-based paint hazards'' does not change the affected population, although that definition has
clear implications for the extent of disclosure. 
(2) The requirements under section 1018 will apply to all target housing regardless of the presence of lead-based
paint hazards in that housing. That is, all owners, sellers, and lessors of target housing will be on notice that EPA
and HUD are issuing disclosure requirements, and that they will be required to retain and disclose certain types of
information and to allow for the 10-day inspection period, regardless of whether their housing contains lead-based
paint or a lead-based paint hazard. 
(3) The Act clearly specifies the requirements of this proposed rule. Therefore, regardless of the standards proposed
and issued in the section 403 regulations, EPA and HUD do not have flexibility to change the basic provisions specified
by Congress. 
(4) Section 403, on the other hand, does give EPA flexibility to consider a number of factors in developing health-based
standards. Comments specifically concerning the implications of EPA's section 403 standards, given the concrete
legislative requirements of section 1018, will be most appropriately addressed by EPA during the development of
the section 403 rule. 
Section 402 of TSCA requires that EPA (in consultation with HUD, the Department of Labor, and the Department of Health
and Human Services) promulgate regulations to ensure that individuals engaged in certain lead-based paint activities
are trained, that such training programs are accredited, and that contractors engaging in such activities are certified.
This section also requires that EPA, in consultation with the above agencies, shall develop standards for performance
of lead-based paint activities. Pursuant to section 402, EPA is in the process of developing regulations which would
require that detailed reports be written at the completion of any lead inspection or risk assessment, whether voluntary
or required. Such reports would have to be disclosed as information known to the seller or lessor under the proposed
section 1018 disclosure requirements being proposed today. 


B. Lead Background 


1. 

Lead and lead-based paint

. Lead is a soft, bluish metallic element mined from rock and found in its natural state all over the world. Lead is virtually
indestructible, is nonbiodegradable, and has been known since antiquity for its adaptability in making various
useful items. In modern times it has been used to manufacture many different products, including paint, batteries,
pipes, solder, pottery, and gasoline. From the turn of the century through the 1940's, paint manufacturers frequently
used lead as a primary ingredient in many oil-based interior and exterior house paints. Usage gradually decreased
through the 1950's and 60's as latex paints (which are generally lead-free) became more widespread. Although the
Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) banned lead-based paints from residential use in 1978 (paint currently
may not have greater than .06 percent lead by weight) (Ref. 1), HUD estimates that 75 percent of the houses built in the
United States before 1978 contain some lead-based paint (Ref. 2). By current estimations, approximately 57 million
homes may contain lead-based paint (Ref. 2). Thus lead-based paint may pose a potential hazard to the occupants under
some conditions. 
2. 

Lead hazards

. Lead affects virtually every system of the body. While it is harmful to individuals of all ages, lead exposure is especially
harmful to children, fetuses, and women of childbearing age. Results of recent studies suggest that lead's adverse
effects occur at blood-lead levels previously thought to be safe; in fact, there does not yet appear to be a discernable
threshold for the adverse effects of lead on the young (Ref. 3). Lead poisoning has been referred to as ``the silent
disease'' because its effects often occur gradually and imperceptibly, showing no obvious symptoms. Over time,
low levels of lead in the bloodstream can cause learning disabilities, interfere with growth, cause permanent hearing
and visual impairment, and cause other damage to the brain and nervous system. In large doses, lead can cause blindness,
brain damage, convulsions, and even death. Lead exposure before or during pregnancy can also affect fetal development
and cause miscarriages (Ref. 3). 
In 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services characterized lead poisoning as the ``number
one environmental threat to the health of children in the United States'' (Ref. 4). 
Although the percentage of children with elevated blood-lead levels has declined over the last 20 years with the reduction
of lead in gasoline, millions of U.S. children still have levels of lead in their blood high enough to seriously threaten
their health (Ref. 5). 
Lead-based paint poses a health threat through various routes of exposure. Children under age 6 may ingest lead-based
paint chips from flaking walls, windows, and doors. Lead from exterior house paint can flake off or leach into the soil
around the outside of a home, contaminating children's playing areas. Dust caused during normal lead-based paint
wear (especially around windows and doors) can create an invisible film over surfaces in a house. In some cases, cleaning
and renovation activities can actually increase the threat of lead-based paint exposure by dispersing fine lead
dust particles in the air and over accessible household surfaces. Both adults and children can receive hazardous
exposures by inhaling the fine dust or by ingesting paint-dust during hand-to-mouth activities. 


III. Purpose 


The purpose of this proposed rule is to ensure that families are aware of: (1) The existence of lead-based paint or lead-based
paint hazards in target housing, (2) the hazards of exposure to lead-based paint, and (3) ways to avoid such exposure
before they become obligated to purchase or lease housing that may contain lead-based paint. EPA and HUD are proposing
identical rules to appear in both Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) where other EPA lead rules will appear
and in Title 24 of the CFR where other HUD lead rules appear. 


IV. Scope and Applicability 


Section 1018 of the Act applies to contracts for sale or lease of target housing as defined in section 1004(27) of the
Act. Therefore, this rulemaking would apply to virtually all transactions involving a written contract to sell or
lease target housing. EPA and HUD have identified the following several specific areas that would be excluded or where
coverage would be limited in the proposed rule. 


A. Foreclosure Sales 


EPA and HUD have identified both legal and policy reasons to exclude the sale of properties at foreclosure from the
section 1018 requirements. First, when a property is sold at foreclosure, the sale is conducted at public auction
by or on behalf of a secured lender, and the property is sold to the highest bidder without any form of arms-length negotiation
and without a sales contract. In most of these cases, the lender is not in possession of the property being sold and never
has been; the property is controlled by the owner, who is often hostile to the lender and to any potential purchaser.

For this reason, the lender (or the party conducting the sale for the lender) is often not in a position to provide a potential
purchaser with access to the property for a risk assessment or inspection, nor are they usually in possession of information
concerning the existence of lead-based paint, as required by section 1018(a)(1)(B). In fact, lenders typically
know very little about the history of single-family properties in their portfolios, and these make up the vast majority
of the properties being foreclosed. 
HUD's experience in foreclosure sales suggests that most properties sold at foreclosure are not sold to private investors
or people attempting to purchase a residence for themselves. Rather, the secured lender, acting to protect its security
for the defaulted loan, is the successful bidder in nearly all foreclosure sales, purchasing the property at auction.
When the lender is the purchaser, the lender will typically attempt to recover its investment by selling the property
to a third party and, at that point, the protections of section 1018 would clearly apply. 


B. Informal Rental Agreements 


Because this proposed rulemaking only applies to transactions to lease housing which involve a written contract,
EPA and HUD have concluded that it should not apply to informal rental agreements which do not involve a lease. Such
arrangements, by virtue of their informality, make the administration and enforcement of these requirements extremely
difficult. To the extent practicable, however, EPA and HUD encourage individuals engaging in such informal arrangements
to obtain available information on lead-based paint before occupying target housing. 


C. Renewals of Existing Leases 


EPA and HUD do not believe that individuals would significantly benefit from multiple receipt of previously disclosed
information during renewals of existing leases and see no justification for placing repetitive disclosure requirements
on lessors. For that reason, renewals of existing leases would only be covered by this proposed regulation if the tenant
has not previously received the lead-based paint hazard information required under section 1018. If, however, the
lessor becomes aware of additional information about the property concerning lead-based paint or lead-based paint
hazards during the term of the lease, he or she would be required to disclose this information prior to renewal of the
lease. 


V. Definitions 


In order to implement section 1018 of the Act, certain terms need to be defined. This section will provide the regulatory
definition followed by an explanation of the definition's source. Where possible, EPA and HUD have drawn definitions
directly from section 1004 of the Act. In cases where the statute either failed to define terms for the rulemaking or
where the definition lacked sufficient detail, EPA and HUD are proposing appropriate definitions, along with an
explanation of the reasons for their choices. EPA and HUD are accepting comment on all definitions not taken directly
from the statute. 

Abatement

 means any set of measures designed to permanently eliminate lead-based paint hazards in accordance with standards
established by appropriate Federal agencies. Such term includes: (1) The removal of lead-based paint and lead-contaminated
dust, the permanent containment or encapsulation of lead-based paint, the replacement of lead painted surfaces
or fixtures, and the removal or covering of lead-contaminated soil; and (2) all preparation, clean up, disposal,
and post abatement clearance testing activities associated with such measures. 
This definition appears in section 1004(1) of the Act. In accordance with the development of standards for the performance
of abatements by EPA under section 402 of TSCA, EPA may propose modifications to this definition in a separate proposed
rule. If such a revision is proposed, EPA and HUD would consider including the revised definition in the final rule
for these requirements. 


The Act

 means the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992, Title X of the Housing and Community Development
Act of 1992, Pub. L. 102-550. 


Agent

 means any party who enters into a contract with a seller or lessor to represent the seller or lessor for the purpose of
selling or leasing target housing. 
This definition is based on the statutory wording of section 1018(a)(4) of the Act, which states that ``Whenever a
seller or lessor 

has entered into a contract with an agent for the purpose of selling or leasing a residential dwelling of target housing

, the regulations promulgated under this section shall require the agent, on behalf of the seller or lessor, to ensure
compliance with the requirements of this section'' [emphasis added]. This provision clearly identifies an agent
as a party who has entered into a contract for the purpose of selling or leasing target housing. 
State statutory provisions and common law may vary on the topic of real estate contracts and the concept of agency.
In response to this diversity in state law, EPA and HUD propose a definition of ``agent'' which does not seek to differentiate
various real estate agent activities. The agencies believe that this proposed definition provides necessary flexibility
regarding which parties could be defined as ``agents'' who have entered into a contract to sell or lease target housing
and, as a consequence, would be covered by the requirements of this regulation. 
For example, it is EPA's and HUD's understanding that in many states, it is typical for a seller or lessor to enter into
a contract to sell or lease target housing with a licensed ``real estate broker,'' who may or may not perform the actual
duties of an ``agent'' associated with selling or leasing housing. In these states, individuals working for the licensed
broker, typically called ``real estate agents,'' may perform some or all of the duties of an ``agent'' but may be treated
as an employee of the broker or independent contractor. If the ``real estate agent'' were to fail to ensure compliance
with the requirements of the rulemaking, the broker would assume liability for that failure, just as if the broker
had performed all agent duties themselves. In other states, the real estate agent is considered an independent contractor
rather than an employee of the broker, and the agent, rather than the broker, is held liable for negligence under common
law. Because of these variations in state law, EPA/HUD propose a flexible definition of agent, one that could include
broker and/or agent, depending on the particular circumstance. If state law does not recognize the difference between
a real estate agent and a real estate broker, the party identified in the contract, and in any subcontract to perform
those duties, would be liable for any failure to comply, regardless of whether they were called brokers or agents.

Specifically excluded from the requirements of this regulation, however, would be agents or brokers who operate
solely on behalf of the buyer(s) or lessee(s) and who receive all remuneration from the buyer/lessee (so called ``buyers'
agents''). This exclusion is based on the language of section 1018(a)(4) which focuses on agents entering into a contract
with a seller or lessor. 


Common Area

 means a portion of a building generally accessible to all residents/users including, but not limited to, hallways,
stairways, laundry and recreational rooms, playgrounds, community centers, and boundary fences. 
EPA and HUD are proposing this definition to maintain consistency with the definition of ``common area'' proposed
in a separate notice in the 

Federal Register

 of March 9, 1994 (59 FR 11108), pursuant to the requirements of section 406 of TSCA. This definition is purposefully
broad to allow for its use in other EPA and HUD regulations that might also cover commercial and public buildings. 


Contract for the purchase and sale of residential real property

 means any contract or agreement in which one party agrees to purchase an interest in real property on which there is
situated one or more residential dwellings used or occupied, or intended to be used or occupied, in whole or in part,
as the home or residence of one or more persons. 
This definition appears in section 1004(4) of the Act. 


Evaluation

 means a risk assessment and/or inspection. 
This definition appears in section 1004(6) of the Act. 


Inspection

 means (1) a surface-by-surface investigation to determine the presence of lead-based paint as provided in section
302(c) of the Lead-Based Paint Poisoning and Prevention Act [42 U.S.C. 4822], and (2) the provision of a report explaining
the results of the investigation. 
This definition appears in section 1004(12) of the Act. 


Lead-based paint

 means paint or other surface coatings that contain lead in excess of 1.0 milligrams per centimeter squared or 0.5 percent
by weight or (1) in the case of paint or other surface coatings on target housing, such lower level as may be established
by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development as defined under section 302(c) of the Lead-Based Paint Poisoning
Prevention Act [42 U.S.C. 4822], or (2) in the case of any other paint or surface coatings, such other level as may be
established by the Administrator. 
This definition appears in section 401 of TSCA. Title IV of TSCA was added by the Act, and, given the close relationship
between the section 1018 requirements and the provisions of TSCA Title IV, EPA and HUD believe it is consistent to use
the Title IV definition for section 1018 purposes. 


Lead-based paint hazard

 means any condition that causes exposure to lead from lead-contaminated dust, lead-contaminated soil, lead-contaminated
paint that is deteriorated or present in accessible surfaces, friction surfaces, or impact surfaces that would result
in adverse human health effects as established by the appropriate Federal Agency. 
This definition appears in section 1004(15) of the Act. The exact levels of lead in dust, paint, and soil that would
be defined as a hazard will be addressed in a separate rulemaking, mandated by section 403 of TSCA. For the purposes
of this rulemaking, however, the statutory definition is sufficient to provide the public with notice to comment
on the rulemaking's requirements and structure. Parties who wish to provide comments specifically on what levels
of lead in dust and soil (or what conditions or locations of lead-based paint) should be considered a hazard, should
do so separately in the section 403 rulemaking process. 


Lessee

 means any entity that enters into an agreement to lease or rent target housing, including but not limited to individuals,
partnerships, corporations, trusteeships, government agencies, Indian tribes, or nonprofit organizations.

This proposed definition is based on the agencies' interpretation of the intent of the Act in identifying individuals
entering into a contract to lease target housing. 


Lessor

 means any entity that offers target housing for lease, including but not limited to individuals, partnerships, corporations,
trusteeships, government agencies, Indian tribes, or nonprofit organizations. This definition is based on the
agencies' interpretation of the Act's intent in identifying entities entering into an agreement to lease target
housing. 


Owner

 means any entity that has legal title to target housing, including but not limited to individuals, partnerships,
corporations, trusteeships, government agencies, Indian tribes, or nonprofit organizations. 
This definition is based on the agencies' interpretation of the intent of the Act relating to owners of target housing.



Purchaser

 means any entity that submits a written offer to purchaser an interest in target housing, including but not limited
to individuals, partnerships, corporations, trusteeships, government agencies, Indian tribes, or nonprofit
organizations. 
EPA and HUD are proposing to limit the scope of this regulation to parties that demonstrate a real interest in purchasing
target housing, so that sellers or agents representing sellers need not provide all parties who view a property with
a 10 calendar-day opportunity to inspect for lead-based paint hazards. This definition is based on the agencies'
interpretation of the Act's intent in identifying purchasers of target housing. 


Residential dwelling

 means (1) a single-family dwelling, including attached structures such as porches and stoops; or (2) a single-family
dwelling unit in a structure that contains more than one separate residential dwelling unit, and in which each such
unit is used or occupied, or intended to be used or occupied, in whole or in part, as the residence of one or more persons.

This definition is provided in section 1004(23) of the Act. 


Risk assessment

 means an on-site investigation to determine and report the existence, nature, severity, and location of lead-based
paint hazards in residential dwellings, including: (1) Information gathering regarding the age and history of the
housing and occupancy by children under age 6; (2) visual inspection; (3) limited wipe sampling or other environmental
sampling techniques; (4) other activity as may be appropriate, and; (5) provision of a report explaining the results
of the investigation. 
This definition is provided in section 1004(25) of the Act. 


Secretary

 means the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. 


Seller

 means any entity that sells an interest in target housing, including but not limited to individuals, partnerships,
corporations, trusteeships, government agencies, Indian tribes, or nonprofit organizations. The term seller
also includes: (1) An entity which transfers shares in a cooperatively-owned project and (2) an entity which transfers
its interest in a leasehold in jurisdictions or circumstances where it is legally permissible to separate the fee
title from the title to the improvement. 
EPA and HUD have proposed this definition to cover the range of entities and arrangements that may be involved in the
``sale'' of target housing and that the agencies interpret to be covered by the Act. The second part of the proposed
definition describes sellers who have legal title to the improvements (residential dwellings) on property that
is leased from another person. 


Target housing

 means any housing constructed prior to 1978, except 0-bedroom dwellings, or housing for the elderly or persons with
disabilities (unless any child who is less than 6 years of age resides or is expected to reside in the dwelling). In the
case of jurisdictions which banned the sale or use of lead-based paint prior to 1978, the Secretary, at the Secretary's
discretion, may designate an earlier date. 
This definition appears in section 1004(27) of the Act. The Act excludes housing constructed after 1978 since the
allowable lead in paint was reduced to .06 percent by CPSC after that date (Ref. 1). 
EPA and HUD interpret the term ``0-bedroom dwelling'' to mean any dwelling in which the living area is unseparated
from the sleeping area. Under this definition, efficiency, studio apartments, loft space, and single-room dormitory
units would be exempt from the requirements of the rule unless children under 6 years of age reside or may reside in the
unit. 
EPA and HUD interpret the term ``housing for the elderly,'' to mean retirement communities or similar types of housing
reserved for persons 62 years of age or older. EPA and HUD request comment on what additional specificity might be necessary
for identifying housing for the elderly. 
EPA and HUD also considered whether Congress meant to include hotels, motels, inns, and other commercial lodging
facilities in the term ``housing.'' Most hotels, motels, inns, and other commercial lodging are 0-bedroom dwellings,
and would typically be exempt from the requirements of this proposed rule. In addition, EPA and HUD believe it is reasonable
to interpret that Congress' intent was to distinguish residential housing from commercial lodging facilities.

Specifically, the definition of target housing intended to capture housing designed for long-term or continuous
residence, as opposed to lodging facilities offering temporary accommodations. Given the high frequency and short
duration of transactions, EPA and HUD believe it is impractical to apply the requirements of this proposed rule to
rental transactions in motels, hotels, and other commercial lodging facilities. 
As directed in the statute, the exclusions for 0-bedroom dwelling, elderly housing, and handicapped housing do not
apply to any housing in which children under 6 years old reside or are expected to reside. Similarly, in cases where
families with children under 6 might enter into a contract to purchase or lease commercial housing as long-term residences,
however, EPA and HUD believe it is consistent with the statute that such establishments be considered target housing
under this proposed rule's requirements. 


0-Bedroom dwelling

 means any residential dwelling in which the living area is unseparated from the sleeping area. 
EPA and HUD are proposing this definition to clarify the term used in the Act's definition of target housing. Under
this definition, efficiency, studio apartments, loft space, and single-room dormitory units would be considered
0-bedroom dwellings. 


VI. Proposed Regulatory Requirements 


Section 1018 requires EPA and HUD to promulgate joint regulations for disclosure of lead-based paint hazards in target
housing which is offered for sale or lease. Specifically, section 1018 requires that before purchasers or lessees
become obligated under any purchase or lease contract, sellers or lessors must provide the purchaser or lessee with
a lead information pamphlet (being developed by EPA under TSCA section 406) and disclose any lead-based paint or lead-based
paint hazards known to the seller or lessor in such housing. In addition, before obligating purchasers under a contract
to purchase the housing, sellers must permit purchasers a 10-day period to conduct a risk assessment or inspection
for the presence of lead-based paint hazards, and must attach a specific lead warning statement and acknowledgement,
signed by the purchaser, to each contract. Violation of Section 1018 may result in civil and criminal penalties, and
potential triple damages in a private civil suit. In this unit, EPA and HUD present a more detailed discussion of these
requirements as proposed in the EPA and HUD regulations. As noted above, EPA and HUD are proposing joint and equivalent
regulations that would appear in Title 40 of the CFR with other EPA lead regulations and in Title 24 of the CFR with other
HUD lead regulations. Including the joint regulations in both CFR locations will help ensure that sellers, lessors,
agents, buyers, and lessees are informed of their existence. 

A. Disclosure Requirement 


Section 1018(a)(1)(B) of the Act requires the seller or lessor of target housing to provide all information known
to the seller or lessor on lead-based paint and lead-based paint hazards in the housing to the purchaser or lessee before
the purchaser or lessee is obligated under any contract to purchase or lease target housing. EPA and HUD are proposing
such a disclosure requirement in 24 CFR 38.20 and 40 CFR 745.107. Under the proposed regulations, the seller or lessor,
or the agent acting on behalf of the seller or lessor, is required to provide the purchaser or lessee with written documentation
of all information known to the seller or lessor, or the agent regarding the presence of lead-based paint or lead-based
paint hazards associated with the housing being sold or leased. Consistent with the statute, records of this information
must be provided to the purchaser or lessee before they become obligated under any contract to purchase or lease the
target housing. 
For the purposes of this proposed rule, EPA and HUD propose that ``information known to the seller or lessor'' comprise,
at minimum, the information described in 24 CFR 38.20 and 40 CFR 745.107 of these regulations. The proposed information
would include, but not be limited to, the following items: 
1. Reports from all lead-based paint inspections, risk assessments, and abatement activities known to the seller
or lessor and conducted on or in the target housing, including any known reports completed before the effective date
of the final rule if such reports are available to the seller or lessor on or after the effective date. Section 1018(a)(1)(B)
requires sellers or lessors of target housing to ``provide to the purchaser or lessee any lead hazard evaluation report
available to the seller or lessor.'' EPA and HUD recognize that reports from some lead-based paint activities conducted
before the effective date of the final rule may no longer be available to the seller or lessor given that the seller or
lessor had not been put on notice that disclosure of such records would be required. However, those reports in the possession
of the seller or lessor on or after November 2, 1994 would become part of the permanent record for that unit of target
housing. 
2. Records of lead-based paint inspections, assessments, and abatement activities conducted for current or past
sellers or lessors in common areas of target housing containing more than one residential dwelling. EPA and HUD are
concerned that lead-based paint in common areas may pose an additional exposure risk to occupants, especially in
buildings where lead-based paint chips and dust are allowed to accumulate. Also, the presence of lead-based paint
in common areas of buildings containing target housing may signal the presence of lead-based paint within the residential
dwellings. For these reasons, EPA and HUD are proposing to require the disclosure of records and reports of lead-based
paint in common areas. 
3. Information known to the seller or lessor regarding whether other residential dwellings in the target housing
contain or have contained lead-based paint or lead-based paint hazards. This would only apply to target housing containing
more than one residential dwelling, and would be of primary value in cases where information on lead-based paint and
lead-based paint hazards only exists for some, but not all residential dwellings. The presence of lead-based paint
in some of the residential dwellings may suggest a greater likelihood of lead-based paint existing in the residential
dwellings that have yet to be tested. 
To balance the indirect value of the information with the disclosure burden of providing such information during
transactions, EPA and HUD propose to require that sellers/lessors disclose only whether or not lead-based paint
is or has been present in other residential dwellings within the target housing, rather than requiring that sellers
and lessors provide specific reports on those residential dwellings. The seller or lessor would, of course, retain
the option of providing more detailed information, but would not be required to provide specific data on each residential
dwelling. 
EPA and HUD believe that such information will help potential occupants make more informed decisions when considering
leasing or purchasing target housing. For example, such information could persuade purchasers to exercise their
option to conduct an inspection or risk assessment before purchasing the property. Similarly, knowledge of lead-based
paint on the premises could prompt lessees to take greater precautions to guard against exposure. EPA and HUD request
comment on whether requiring disclosure of information regarding other residential units is warranted and, if so,
whether a more stringent disclosure standard is needed. 
4. Other available information that may indicate lead-based paint or a lead-based paint hazard in the unit. This proposed
requirement is directed at other relevant information on lead-based paint hazards that may be known by the seller
or lessor. 
EPA and HUD request information and comment on other appropriate information that may be commonly available to owners
of target housing and which should be itemized in the final rule. For example, should information on past cases of lead-poisoning
of occupants be disclosed to purchasers or lessees? If such information is to be considered, what level of detail would
be appropriate given the privacy implications of medical records? 
In addition, EPA and HUD request comment on whether the final rule should impose specific recordkeeping requirements
on owners of target housing to retain information known to the owner on lead-based paint and lead-based paint hazards,
as identified in proposed 24 CFR 35.20 and 40 CFR 745.107. If promulgated, the time period for such a recordkeeping
requirement for owners of target housing could range in length from the length of ownership to a discrete number of
years (3 years, 5 years, 10 years, etc), based on its feasibility and utility in ensuring compliance with the regulations.
In evaluating the value of an owner record retention requirement, EPA and HUD will consider its potential value both
in aiding and supporting Agency enforcement efforts as well as its potential value in supporting civil actions for
damages taken under section 1018(b)(3). 


B. Lead-Hazard Information Pamphlet 


Section 1018(a)(1)(A) requires that sellers and lessors of target housing provide the purchaser or lessee with a
copy of the EPA pamphlet 

Lead Paint: Protect Your Family

 before the purchaser or lessee is obligated under any contract to purchase or lease the housing. A primary function
of the pamphlet is to educate families on the potential health risks associated with lead exposure and ways to avoid
such exposure. By requiring that families receive the pamphlet at the beginning of the real estate transaction, Congress
ensured that families would be informed about lead-based paint issues during the transaction process. Therefore,
the joint provisions of these regulations (located in   38.20(a) and 745.107(a) of the proposed regulatory
text) would require that purchasers and lessees receive the pamphlet before becoming obligated under any contract.

The draft pamphlet was developed by EPA in consultation with HUD and CDC and was released to the public for a 60-day
comment period and announced in the 

Federal Register

 of March 9, 1994, (59 FR 11119). In addition, EPA has conducted a series of focus tests and interviews in different regions
of the country to ensure that the pamphlet meets both high technical and editorial standards. 
The final pamphlet will be made available to the public through the Government Printing Office (GPO) for a nominal
fee. In addition, EPA will make a limited number of camera-ready copies of the final pamphlet available to organizations
that wish to print copies for private distribution, and the pamphlet will be available in electronic form through
the GPO Bulletin Board. EPA and HUD are continuing to explore methods for printing and distributing the pamphlet in
a quick and inexpensive way to the regulated community and the general public at large. EPA and HUD welcome comment
on other potential distribution methods for the pamphlet. 


C. Disclosure and Acknowledgment Form 


In addition to requiring written documentation of the information known by the seller or lessor, defined in proposed
24 CFR 38.20(b) and 40 CFR 745.107(b) of the regulatory text, EPA and HUD have developed disclosure and acknowledgement
forms to be attached to all sales and leasing contracts for target housing. Form A for sellers and Form B for lessors
are included as Appendix A to the proposed HUD regulatory text. EPA and HUD believe that the forms will help ensure that
(1) All information known to the seller or lessor on lead-based paint and lead-based paint hazards is disclosed and
documented, (2) all purchasers and lessees are aware of their rights under the provisions of section 1018, and (3)
sellers, lessors, and agents are aware of their obligations under their rule. In addition, these forms would be an
important enforcement tool by providing a record of compliance with the rule. By maintaining completed forms after
a transaction to purchase or lease target housing, the seller, lessor, and agents would have documentation of their
compliance with the disclosure activities and of the purchaser's/lessee's receipt and acknowledgement. Because
sellers and lessors have different obligations under the requirements mandated by section 1018, EPA and HUD believe
that it is appropriate to provide two separate and distinct forms for the two types of transactions. 
EPA and HUD initially considered including the elements in the forms as separate provisions for inclusion in the leasing
or purchase contracts themselves. Ultimately, that concept was rejected because it would be more burdensome and
confusing. By creating one form covering all regulated parties for each type of transaction, EPA and HUD hope to minimize
confusion over the new requirements, decrease the recordkeeping burden, and ensure a greater level of compliance.

1. Form for Transactions to Sell Target Housing 
For the reasons discussed above, EPA and HUD are proposing in   745.107(a)(4) and 38.20(a)(4), respectively,
that each contract to sell property defined as target housing contain a signed and dated copy of the joint HUD/EPA form
entitled 

Disclosure and Acknowledgement of Lead-Based Paint Before Sale

. The form is divided into four distinct parts: a general notice statement, a certification of compliance statement
by the seller, a certification of compliance statement by the agent (where applicable), and an acknowledgement statement
by the purchaser. Each part is discussed below. 
a. 

Notice to purchasers of target housing

. Section 1018(a)(3) of the Act provides a specific ``lead warning statement'' to be included in all contracts involving
the purchase and sale of any interest in target housing. The statute states that the lead warning statement shall contain
the required language printed in large type on a separate sheet of paper attached to the contract. Because the disclosure
and acknowledgement form would serve as an attachment to the contract, EPA and HUD propose to include this lead warning
statement as the first part of the form, and to print it in a larger type than the rest of the form to ensure its prominence.
The required text would read: 




Every purchaser of any interest in residential real property on which a residential dwelling was built prior to 1978
is notified that such property may present exposure to lead from lead-based paint that may place young children at
risk of developing lead poisoning. Lead poisoning in young children may produce permanent neurological damage,
including learning disabilities, reduced intelligence quotient, behavioral problems, and impaired memory. Lead
poisoning also poses a particular risk to pregnant women. The seller of any interest in residential real property
is required to provide the buyer with any information on lead-based paint hazards from risk assessments or inspections
in the seller's possession and notify the buyer of any known lead-based paint hazards. A risk assessment or inspection
for possible lead-based paint hazards is recommended prior to purchase. 




In addition, EPA and HUD propose that, in cases where the sales contract is written in a language other than English,
the lead warning statement must be included in the language of the contract as well, based on a translation of the English-version
lead warning statement. While this is not expressly required by the statute, such a requirement would be consistent
with Congress' intent of ensuring that families be fully aware of the potential hazards of lead-based paint before
purchasing target housing. EPA and HUD request comment on this proposed requirement. 

b. 

Certification of compliance statement by the seller

. The second part of the form would require the seller to list all information known to the seller on lead-based paint
and lead-based paint hazards in the target housing. EPA and HUD believe that it is necessary to create a single record
of the information provided by the lessor/owner. Completion of this part would ensure that at the time of the contract
agreement, both the seller and the purchaser would be aware of the disclosure requirements under these regulations
and the lead-based paint hazard information being disclosed. 
If information described in Part II of the form is in the possession of the seller, the seller would be required to provide
the information in written form to the purchaser, check the appropriate box, and note the dates and type of known information
in the space provided. This information would be a necessary record during the disclosure process, both to inform
the purchaser of the information the purchaser should have received, and as a later measure of compliance by the seller
and the seller's agent. 
c. 

Certification of compliance statement by the agent

. The third part of the form would require an agent, if one is used, to certify that the requirements of section 1018 have
been satisfied, either by the seller or by the agent. 
d. 

Acknowledgement of lead-based paint requirements in target housing by the purchaser

. Section 1018(a)(2) requires that contracts to purchase target property include an acknowledgement signed by purchasers.
EPA and HUD propose that the purchaser indicate the following in the acknowledgement: That they have read and understood
the lead warning statement, received any information on lead-based paint and lead-based paint hazards noted in the
seller certification, received a lead hazard information pamphlet, and that they are aware that they must receive
an opportunity for a 10-day inspection period before becoming obligated under a contract to purchase the property.
In the fourth part of the form, EPA and HUD propose such an acknowledgement. The acknowledgement would state: 




I acknowledge that I have read and understood the attached lead warning statement in Part I of this form, received the
information noted in Part II of this form, received the lead hazard information pamphlet 

Lead-Based Paint: Protect Your Family

. In addition, I acknowledge that, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 4852(d) and its implementing regulations, the attached contract
entitles me to up to 10 calendar days to conduct a risk assessment or inspection for the presence of lead-based paint
hazards before becoming obligated under a contract to purchase, unless I agree otherwise in writing. 


2. Form for Transactions to Lease Target Housing 
EPA and HUD are proposing in   745.107(a)(5) and 38.20(a)(5), respectively, that each contract to lease
target housing contain a signed and dated copy of the joint HUD/EPA form entitled 

Disclosure and Acknowledgement of Lead-Based Paint Before Lease. 
The form is divided into four distinct parts: a general notice statement, a certification of compliance statement
by the lessor, a certification of compliance statement by the agent (where applicable), and an acknowledgement statement
by the lessee. Each part is discussed below; however, where statutory justifications and background are the same
as that presented in the part on the form for sales of target housing, the repetitive elements have been omitted. 
a. Notice to residents of target housing

. EPA and HUD propose to include a tailored lead warning statement as the first part of the form, and to print it in a larger
type than the rest of the form to ensure its prominence. Although not specifically required by section 1018, EPA and
HUD believe that this statement provides a useful context for information disclosed to lessees, just as for purchasers,
concerning the hazards of lead-based paint. The required text would read: 




A residential structure built prior to 1978 may present exposure to lead from lead-based paint. This exposure may
place young children at risk of developing lead poisoning. Lead poisoning in young children can produce permanent
neurological damage, including learning disabilities, reduced intelligence quotient, behavioral problems,
and impaired memory. Lead poisoning also poses a particular risk to pregnant women. The lessor of any residential
dwelling is required to provide the lessee with any information on lead-based paint hazards from risk assessments
or inspections in the lessor's possession and notify the lessee of any known lead-based paint hazards.




In addition, EPA and HUD propose that, in cases where the lease is written in a language other than English, a translation
of this lead warning statement would be required to be attached in the language of the contract. EPA and HUD believe
that this translation requirement may be even more critical in the case of leasing transactions than in purchases
as many non-English speakers may be more likely to lease housing for themselves and their families. EPA and HUD request
comment on this proposed requirement. 
b. 

Certification of compliance statement by the lessor

. The second part of the form would require the lessor to list all information known to the lessor on lead-based paint
and lead-based paint hazards in the target housing. 


If information listed in Part II of the form is in the possession of the lessor, the lessor would be required to provide
it in written form to the lessee, check the appropriate box, and note the dates and type of known information in the space
provided.
c. 

Certification of compliance statement by the agent

. The third part of the form would require an agent, if one is used, to certify that the requirements of section 1018 have
been satisfied, either by the lessor or by the agent.
d. 

Acknowledgement of lead-based paint requirements in target housing by the lessee

. The fourth part of the form consists of an acknowledgement by the lessee that the necessary disclosure steps, as required
by section 1018(a)(1), had been performed. The acknowledgement language reads: 



I acknowledge that I have read and understood the attached lead warning statement in Part I of this form, received the
information noted in Part II of this form and received the lead hazard information pamphlet 

Lead Paint: Protect Your Family



3. Request for Comment on the Forms



EPA and HUD request comments on all aspects of the disclosure and acknowledgement forms. Specific questions include:
Are the forms effective in communicating the importance of lead-based paint hazard awareness and the rights of purchasers
and lessees? Is there other information that should be included on the forms? Is some of the included information that
is not required by the statute unnecessary? 



4. Retention of Disclosure and Acknowledgment Form



The disclosure and acknowledgement form documents the fulfillment of the mandated disclosure requirements during
the sale or lease of target housing. This record, if maintained by the seller or lessor after the completion of the transaction,
would provide a valuable record of the fulfillment of these requirements to both the agencies and courts. If this record
were not regularly maintained, EPA and HUD are concerned that they would have little ability to determine whether
the necessary disclosure steps had occurred. 
For that reason, proposed   38.20 and 745.107 of the regulatory text would require that the signed notice
and disclosure form be maintained by sellers, lessors, and agents for a full 3 years from: (a) The commencement of the
lease period in the case of a transaction to lease target housing, or (b) the completion of the sale in the case of a sale
of target housing. EPA and HUD chose 3 years as the retention period for the disclosure form in order to allow adequate
time for enforcement action by HUD or EPA. If the regulation were to mandate a shorter period of time, Federal enforcement
actions could be hampered, undermining the efficacy of the regulations mandated by statute. EPA and HUD are concerned
that requiring a longer retention period would place an undue burden on the regulated community. 
EPA and HUD have not identified any less burdensome alternative to support compliance monitoring and enforcement
actions but are sensitive to the need to impose minimum recordkeeping burdens on the regulated community, especially
given the large number of transactions affected. The agencies are willing to consider alternatives to the proposed
requirements, including the reduction or omission of recordkeeping requirements, if the alternatives would still
ensure the successful administration and enforcement of the provisions of section 1018 of the Act. 
Such alternatives could include the imposition of a longer or shorter retention period for the disclosure form, or
the addition or substitution of other records as part of a post-transaction recordkeeping requirement. EPA is also
considering the potential efficacy of instituting recordkeeping requirements with a sunset provision, which would
phase them out over time as the market increasingly embraced and institutionalized the disclosure process. Regardless
of what recordkeeping time limits the agencies impose, these limits would not effect time limits on lawsuits under
section 1018(b)(3) by injured parties against former sellers, lessors, or agents who fail to comply with these regulations.
For this reason EPA and HUD would encourage sellers, lessors, and agents to maintain signed, dated forms beyond the
required recordkeeping period as proof of compliance.



D. 10-Day Inspection Period 



Section 1018(a)(1)(C) of the Act requires that, before a party is obligated under any contract to purchase target
housing, the seller shall grant the purchaser a 10-day period to conduct a risk assessment or inspection for
the presence of lead-based paint hazards in target housing.



EPA and HUD interpret the term ``10-day period'' to mean 10 calendar days. While the seller and purchaser may
mutually agree to a shorter or longer period, without written proof of an agreed upon change to the time, the legally
enforceable period would remain 10 calendar days. Given the diversity of definitions for ``business'' or ``working''
days, EPA and HUD believe that an alternative interpretation of the 10-day period would lead to confusion among
the public. In cases where a 10 calendar-day inspection or assessment period would be insufficient, the purchaser
would retain the option of negotiating in writing for a longer period. 
Since known lead-based paint information may affect a purchaser's decision to utilize the 10-day inspection
period option, EPA and HUD propose to require that sellers perform and document all disclosure activities required
under this proposed rule before providing the purchaser with the opportunity for the 10-day period. EPA and
HUD believe that the purchaser will be most able to determine whether a risk assessment or inspection is necessary
or appropriate after receiving the disclosed information. 
EPA and HUD also believe that reports from inspections conducted during the 10-day inspection/assessment
period should become part of the permanent record retained by the owner of the housing. Therefore, EPA and HUD are also
requesting comment on whether purchasers who conduct inspections or risk assessments during the 10-day period
but who do not ultimately purchase the housing should be required, under this rulemaking, to provide a copy of any report
to the owner for their records. 
Some purchasers and sellers may prefer to conduct the 10-day inspection/assessment period before the parties
have signed a contract for the purchase and sale of the target housing. Others may prefer to conduct the inspection
period after the contract is signed. In implementing these requirements, EPA and HUD have considered several approaches
to fulfilling the statutory provision that the purchaser receive the opportunity for a 10-day inspection period
before becoming obligated under a contract to purchase the housing. These regulations propose several approaches
to Federal implementation of the 10-day inspection period. 
Option 1. Require Contract Language Addressing Outcome of Inspection (Preferred Option) 
To insure that the purchaser receives the statutorily required 10-day opportunity to conduct a risk assessment
or inspection before

 becoming obligated under the contract, the proposed regulation (24 CFR 38.21 and 40 CFR 745.110) requires that, if
the parties elect to ratify the contract prior to completion of the 10-day opportunity, the seller or agent must
include appropriate language in the contract to reflect that the contract shall be contingent on the condition that
no lead-based paint hazard is found in the inspection or risk assessment. If a lead-based paint hazard is found during
the inspection or risk assessment, the seller and purchaser would mutually determine the terms under which the sale
will or will not proceed. 
Option 2. Base Regulatory Text on Statutory Language 
The least prescriptive option for implementing section 1018(a)(1)(C) requirement for a 10-day inspection
opportunity is to state in the regulation simply that ``the seller shall provide the purchaser with an opportunity
for a 10-day inspection period (unless the parties agree to a mutually agreed upon different period of time)
before becoming obligated under the contract to purchase the housing to conduct a risk assessment or inspection for
the presence of lead-based paint hazards.'' While this option would provide the regulated community with flexibility
in determining how to comply, EPA and HUD are concerned that the lack of detail would provide inadequate guidance to
the regulated community, regarding the measures needed for proper compliance. 
Option 3. Mandate Specific Contingency Language for All Contracts Completed Before Inspection or Assessment Period

EPA and HUD are considering the merit of requiring that all contracts to purchase target housing include specific
language mandated by HUD and EPA addressing the purchaser's opportunity for a 10-day inspection period. In
addition to further informing the purchaser of his/her rights to the inspection/assessment period, EPA and HUD could
provide specific language addressing the rights of the purchaser in cases where the inspection/assessment period
was provided after the purchaser had signed a contract to purchase the target housing. These requirements have the
advantage of providing a clear message regarding what the seller and agent must do to comply and regarding what rights
the purchaser has in cases where the purchaser does not receive the inspection or assessment period until after having
signed a contract. 
Option 4. Require the Inspection/Assessment Period Before the Contract is Signed
EPA and HUD also requests comment on requiring that the 10-day opportunity for inspection or assessment be provided
before the purchaser signs a contract for the purchase of target housing. This would ensure that all purchasers were
aware of the presence of any lead-based paint and lead-based paint hazards before they entered into the contract to
purchase the housing. EPA and HUD do not currently prefer to impose such a prescriptive requirement on the real estate
community; however, recognizing that both purchasers and sellers may prefer, at times, to implement the inspection
period after all parties have acknowledged serious interest in completing the transaction. 
In addition, EPA and HUD request comment on whether more prescriptive regulations would be of value regarding exactly
what level or conditions of lead-based paint or lead-based paint hazards would allow for purchasers to escape their
obligation under a contract signed before the inspection. Alternatively, the agencies would also like comment on
whether the regulatory language and safeguards being proposed may be overly prescriptive regarding implementation
of the 10-day opportunity. 


E. Role of Agent 


As set forth in section 1018(a)(4) of the Act, agents entering into a contract with a seller or lessor to sell or lease
target housing must ensure compliance with all requirements imposed upon the seller or lessor under section 1018.
If the sale or lease of target housing was aided or accomplished by an agent who has entered into a contract with a seller
or lessor, the agent can be held liable for their failure to comply with the requirements of section 1018 and the regulations
and can be liable for all penalties, both criminal and civil. 
EPA and HUD propose to impose an affirmative obligation on agents to advise the seller of the provisions of the rule,
including the seller's obligation to inform the agent of lead-based paint or lead-based paint hazards in the target
housing. The language of the disclosure form reflects this notification requirement. 
As a method for demonstrating compliance, EPA and HUD have proposed a requirement that agents sign and maintain copies
of the signed notice and disclosure forms from each sale or lease of target housing. As proposed for sellers and lessors,
the agent would have to maintain these records for 3 years from the commencement of the leasing period or for 3 years
from the completion of the sale. 
In determining an appropriate recordkeeping requirement, EPA and HUD considered both the burden on the regulated
community and the information and duration necessary to ensure adequate compliance monitoring and enforcement
of the rule's provisions. EPA and HUD rejected the ``no-recordkeeping requirement'' for agents because it would
hinder Federal compliance assurance activities and make it difficult to determine whether a disclosure had taken
place. Similarly, a recordkeeping requirement of less than 3 years would provide inadequate time for inspection
of records and initiation of appropriate enforcement actions. 
If no agents were employed during the leasing or purchasing process, then all liability for failure to adhere to the
proposed requirements would rest solely with the seller or lessor. 
EPA and HUD request comment on the rule's proposed definition of agent (see Unit IV of the preamble and   38.15
and 745.103 of the regulatory text) and on the interpretation of their compliance assurance provision in section
1018(a)(4). 


F. Effective Date 


Section 1018(a)(1) of the Act directs EPA and HUD to jointly issue these requirements as final regulations by October
28, 1994, and pursuant to section 1018(d), the regulations will take effect on October 28, 1995. 
Although section 1018 specified that final regulations should be promulgated no later than October 28, 1994, EPA/HUD
will not be able to meet this deadline. It appears that Congress' intent in section 1018 was to provide a year between
the promulgation of the final rule, and the effective date of the rule. Congress reasonably could have felt that this
year was necessary in order that the real estate industry, landlords, sellers, etc. could become familiar with the
rule requirements and set up procedures for compliance. For this reason, EPA/HUD believe that the effective date
of the rule should be no early than 1 year after promulgation of the final rule, even if this means occurring later than
October 28, 1995, as mandated by section 1018. EPA and HUD believe that this interpretation is the one most consistent
with Congressional intent. 


VII. Non-Compliance and Penalties


In addition to civil liability under section 1018(b)(3), section 1018 provides both EPA and HUD with other enforcement
authority for these requirements. The enforcement authority is discussed below. 


A. HUD Authority 


Section 1018(b)(1) of the Act authorizes HUD to impose civil monetary penalties on any person who knowingly violates
section 1018. HUD interprets this authority to apply to violators of the regulations under section 1018 as well. HUD
shall impose penalties under section 102 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 [42
U.S.C. 3545]. These penalties may be up to $10,000 for each violation. In addition, section 1018(b)(2) of the Act authorizes
the Secretary of HUD to ``take such lawful action as may be necessary to enjoin any violation'' of the rule's provisions.
Section 1018(b)(5) provides that any violation of section 1018 will be a violation of section 409. Section 412(a)
of TSCA provides that the U.S. district courts have jurisdiction to restrain any violation of section 409 of TSCA.
Thus, the district courts will have jurisdiction over violations of section 1018. 


B. EPA Authority 


1. Civil
Section 1018(b)(5) of the Act provides that failure or refusal to comply with section 1018 or its implementing regulations
is a violation of TSCA section 409. Violations of TSCA section 409 are subject to TSCA section 16 penalties. Thus, a
violator of section 1018 will be subject to penalties under TSCA section 16 of up to $10,000 for each violation. 
2. Criminal 
Since TSCA section 16 includes violations under section 409, TSCA section 16(b) provides that any person who knowingly
or willfully violates section 409 (and thus section 1018) would, in addition to or instead of any civil penalty, be
subject, upon conviction, to a fine of not more than $10,000 for each day of violation or to imprisonment for not more
than 1 year, or both. As violations of each provision can only occur one time during each transaction (as opposed to
on a daily basis), the $10,000 penalty may be interpreted as ``for each violation.'' 


C. Civil Liability 


In addition to the EPA and HUD enforcement authority for the provisions of this proposed rule, under section 1018(b)(3)
of the Act, ``Any person who knowingly violates the provisions of this section shall be jointly and severally liable
to the purchaser or lessee in an amount equal to 3 times the amount of damages incurred by such individual.'' This provision
allows the purchaser or lessee to seek direct compensation for any damages incurred based on the seller or lessor's
noncompliance. Section 1018(b)(4) authorizes the court to award court costs, reasonable attorney fees, and expert
witness fees to the plaintiff if the plaintiff prevails. 


D. Validity of Contracts and Liens 


Section 1018(c) provides that nothing in section 1018 (or implementing rules) shall affect the validity or enforceability
of any sale or contract for the purchase and sale or lease of any interest in residential real property or any loan, loan
agreement, mortgage, or lien, made or arising in connection with a mortgage loan.'' It also provides that nothing
in section 1018 (or its implementing rules) shall ``create a defect in title.'' EPA and HUD have looked at section 1018(c)
in the context of other section 1018 provisions, which outline specific clauses which must be attached to contracts
for the purchase and sale of target housing, and specific procedural protections which must be given to the purchaser/lessee.
EPA and HUD interpret section 1018 as a whole to provide that, once the contract is ratified, if certain attachments
are not included in the ratified contract and if certain protections afforded in section 1018 were not given to the
lessee/purchaser, the remedy available to the purchaser or lessee under section 1018 against the seller or lessor
would be monetary damages. 
It appears clear from the language of section 1018(c), that such an injured purchaser/lessee could not void or nullify
the contract after ratification and could not void any transfer of real estate, through the use of section 1018 authority,
even if it could be proven that the seller/lessor violated section 1018 provisions. Congress appears to have wanted
to avoid upsetting real estate transactions once they were completed, and to have intended to limit the purchaser/lessee's
remedies to civil damage suits. Also, Congress appears to have wanted not to create an independent cause of action
for breach of contract or for any breach associated with real estate transfers through the use of section 1018. Of course,
traditional causes of action under state law for misrepresentation/fraud would still exist, and possibly could
be applied to some section 1018 violations. Also, violations of section 1018 would be subject to civil and criminal
penalties administered by EPA and HUD under section 1018(b). 


VIII. Procedures for Requesting a Public Hearing 


The Act mandates Federal involvement in housing transactions at an unprecedented level. Recognizing the broad scope
of these provisions, EPA and HUD will consider holding an informal hearing for public comment on this proposed rule
in Washington, DC. To ensure adequate preparation for the hearing by all parties involved, persons or organizations
desiring to participate in an informal hearing must file a written request for a hearing or to participate in any such
hearing. The written request must be sent to the Environmental Assistance Division at the address listed under 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT

. The written request to participate must include: (1) A brief statement of the interest of the person or organization
in the proceeding; (2) a brief outline of the points to be addressed; (3) an estimate of the time required; and (4) if
the request comes from an organization, a non-binding list of the persons to take part in the presentation. The request
must be received by December 2, 1994. Should a hearing be held, organizations are requested to bring with them, to the
extent possible, employees with individual expertise in and responsibility for each one of the areas to be addressed.
Organizations which do not file written comments in response to the proposed rule will not be allowed to participate
at the hearing. 


IX. Summary of Regulatory Impact Analysis 


EPA has prepared a Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) examining the potential costs, benefits, and impacts of regulations
for the disclosure of lead-based paint hazards in residential property upon the transfer of the property for sale
or rental. The analysis is presented in five sections:  Framework for Analyzing the Costs of the Lead-Based
Paint Hazard Disclosure Rule for Real Estate Transfers 
 Profile of Sectors Affected by the Lead-Based Paint Hazard Disclosure Rule for Real Estate Transfers

Regulatory Flexibility Analysis  Assessment of the Benefits of the Lead-Based Paint Hazard Disclosure Rule
for Real Estate Transfers. 
1. 

Framework for Analyzing the Costs of the Lead-Based Paint Hazard Disclosure Rule for Real Estate Transfers 
Those parties directly affected by the proposed rule are the seller, lessor, agent, property manager, buyer, and
tenant. EPA found the required activities which give rise to regulatory burden imposed on the affected parties to
fall into four categories for cost estimation purposes: 
 Start-up costs, which include learning the rule's requirements and establishing compliance procedures.

 Disclosure activities, which refers to the costs resulting from the actual transfer of information and obtaining
of needed signatures.  Recordkeeping, which results from the requirement that signed acknowledgement forms
must be retained by the provider of the information.  Materials, which are linked primarily to the disclosure
requirement, as the lead hazard information pamphlet must be purchased or photocopied (acknowedgement forms must
also be duplicated). Costs may also be incurred for filing where a high number of acknowledgement forms are generated
(e.g., agents), though such burden was estimated to be quite modest. 
The requirements of section 1018 of the Act fall primarily on the seller or lessor of ``target housing,'' which is defined
to be any housing constructed prior to 1978, except housing for the elderly or persons with disabilities (unless any
child who is less than 6 years of age resides or is expected to reside in such housing) or any 0 bedroom dwelling. However,
if an agent or property manager acts on behalf of the seller or lessor, which EPA has estimated to be the case in the great
majority of transfers, the responsibilities fall to such agents or managers. 
To estimate the cost impacts of the proposed rule, data were sought pertaining to the number of affected parties in
each classification listed above, the frequency with which affected purchase and lease transactions are completed,
and the incremental costs, in labor and materials, added to each transaction by the proposed regulations. 
2. Profile of Sectors Affected by the Lead-Based Paint Hazard Disclosure Rule for Real Estate Transfers

 
The larger of the two affected sectors expected to bear the principal effects of the proposed rule falls within Standard
Industrial Classification (SIC) code 651, Real Estate Operators and Lessors. EPA estimates there to be 96,000 establishments
potentially affected by the proposed rule. Also affected are business establishments falling within SIC code 653,
Real Estate Agents and Managers; an estimated 72,000 establishments could be affected by the proposed rule. Employment
data for these industries were obtained for occupations most likely to be involved in transactions subject to the
rule. EPA estimates that 339,000 real estate agents and 225,000 property managers will be affected. With regard to
transaction volume, EPA found that 2.9 million sales transactions and 9.3 million rental transactions occur annually
in target housing. 
3. 

Estimated Costs to Private Parties from the Lead-Based Paint Hazard Disclosure Rule for Real Estate Transfers 
Table 1 below presents a summary of the estimated annual compliance costs associated with the proposed rule. Each
of the four cost categories appearing in the table are discussed briefly below. 
The first category, start-up costs, represents about one-third of overall annual costs. Factors affecting the magnitude
of these costs include the number of employees having to familiarize themselves with the regulations, both initially
(employees in the existing workforce) and over time (new entrants to the affected sectors); the time required to learn
the activities which must be undertaken in order to comply; and the hourly compensation of affected employees. 
As is evident from Table 1 below, disclosure event costs constitute the greatest portion of overall costs. Factors
affecting the magnitude of these costs include the frequencies of regulated events; the time involved in performing
required activities, such as providing the prospective purchaser/tenant with the required information and obtaining
the required signatures; and the hourly compensation of all involved parties. EPA also took into account the fact
that a number of States have similar requirements pertaining to information transfer regarding potential lead hazards
in the sale of residential property. Thus, an allowance was made in the burden estimates for transactions occurring
in such States to reflect a certain level of current compliance. 




*First-year costs annualized at 3 percent rate. 



Recordkeeping and materials costs comprise a relatively modest share of overall annual costs. Factors affecting
the magnitude of these cost items include the number of affected parties per transaction; the frequency of transactions,
the costs of acquiring/duplicating documents, which include the lead hazard information pamphlet and signed acknowledgement
forms; and costs to maintain documents. 
4. 

Effect of the Lead-Based Paint Hazard Disclosure Rule for Real Estate Transfers on Small Businesses - Initial Regulatory
Flexibility Analysis


EPA investigated the potential impacts of the proposed rule on small businesses, and has prepared an Initial Regulatory
Flexibility Analysis (IRFA). While a large number of small establishments will be potentially affected by the rule,
cost impacts were not found to be of sufficient magnitude to cause undue harm to such establishments. Consequently,
no regulatory alternatives are being proposed in connection with small business impacts. The IRFA is summarized
separately below in Unit XI.C of this preamble. 
5. 

Assessment of the Benefits of the Lead-Based Paint Hazard Disclosure Rule for Real Estate Transfers 
The market imperfection that the proposed rule is intended to correct is the lack of information available to prospective
home buyers and renters on lead-based paint hazards in homes they may be considering for purchase or rent. Under the
proposed rule, general information about risks associated with lead-based paint will be provided (through the provision
of a brochure) and, when available, information about the presence of or abatement of lead in the specific unit being
considered for purchase or rent must also be disclosed (e.g., information concerning previous testing for the presence
of lead-based paint, abatement history, evidence of previous poisoning, etc.). The failure of the marketplace to
provide this information or to provide prospective home buyers and renters the opportunity to develop such information
means that prospective buyers and renters might purchase or lease a property, or make pricing or rental payment decisions
regarding properties, without understanding possible lead-related health risks or risk management costs accompanying
the transaction. 
EPA and HUD expect that this rulemaking will generate benefits by providing prospective home buyers and renters access
to information which they otherwise may not have been able to acquire, such as information pertaining to abatement
activities for a specific residence, or, in the case of more general information, which they may have been able to acquire
only through their own effort at some cost. In addition, EPA believes the information will generate health benefits
by leading many buyers and renters to modify their behavior in a way that will reduce risks from lead-based paint. For
example, purchasers could undertake abatement activities subsequent to taking ownership of a dwelling, change
household cleaning practices, or request professional assistance when undertaking renovation activities. The
proposed rule may also prompt property owners, due to reluctance on the part of prospective buyers/renters to select
housing containing lead-based paint, to act to reduce lead-related hazards associated with their residential dwellings.
In cases where action is taken to remediate a lead-based paint hazard, additional costs would be incurred, and would
have to be subtracted from the expected benefits associated with the remediation. 
EPA and HUD note that the regulation does not require actions to be taken to reduce lead-based paint hazards in residential
housing; thus, the extent to which health benefits accrue depends upon how transaction participants, that is, sellers/lessors
and prospective buyers/renters, value and respond to the additional information. 
In the RIA, three approaches are detailed that are evolving and can be seen as a starting point in an effort to expand
the level of understanding of how benefits from information products can be valued. However, an information base
and the associated accepted analytic methods necessary to predict consumer reaction to information products on
lead-based paint hazards are not readily available; thus, quantifying the expected benefits of this proposed rule
would be extremely difficult. Given the high level of uncertainty associated with the results from such a quantitative
analysis, and given the prescriptive nature of section 1018 of the Act, EPA and HUD believe that the information provided
in the qualitative analysis presented in the RIA served to inform decisionmaking. EPA invites comment, however,
on its benefits analysis and on alternative approaches to assessing the benefits of the proposed rule. 


X. Confidential Business Information 


While EPA and HUD do not anticipate the receipt of much (if any) confidential business information (CBI) in connection
with this rulemaking, a person may assert a claim of confidentiality for any information, including all or portions
of written comments, submitted in connection with the proposed rule. Any person who submits a comment subject to a
claim of confidentiality must also submit a nonconfidential version. Any claim of confidentiality must accompany
the information when it is submitted. Persons must label information claimed as confidential by circling, bracketing,
or underlining it, and marking it with ``CONFIDENTIAL'' or some other appropriate designation. A determination
of whether information will be disclosed will be made pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act. If a person does not
assert a claim of confidentiality for information in comments at the time they are submitted to EPA, EPA will place
the information in the public record for this rulemaking without further notice to that person. 


XI. Rulemaking Record 


A record for this proposed rule has been established under docket number ``OPPTS-62130.'' The public version
of this record (which does not contain any information claimed as CBI) is available for inspection from noon to 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday, excluding legal holidays. The public record is located in EPA's TSCA Nonconfidential Information
Center (NCIC), Rm. NE-B607, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. 
The following is a list of documents which EPA and HUD referred to in developing this regulation and which can be found
in the docket. In addition, other documents, including those submitted with written comments from interested parties,
will be included in the docket following the publication of this proposed rule in the 

Federal Register

.

The draft of the proposed rule submitted by EPA and HUD to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review prior
to proposal will also be contained in the docket. The drafts of the final rule submitted for review before promulgation
will be placed into the docket as well.

Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) Having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local, or significant''); (2) creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken
or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grant, user fees, or
loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising
out of legal mandates, the Presidents priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, it has been determined that this proposed rule is a ``significant regulatory
action'' because it is raising novel policy issues arising out of its legal mandate. As such, this action was submitted
to OMB for review, and any comments or changes made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations have been documented
in the public record. 

B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 


The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires each Federal agency to perform a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
for all rules that are likely to have a ``significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' In an effort
to identify and characterize the proposed rule's effects on small business, EPA and HUD have prepared an Initial Regulatory
Flexibility Analysis (IRFA). This assessment has been included as part of the RIA, and is summarized below. 
In preparing the IRFA, EPA and HUD first developed an establishment profile for each major sector (SIC 651 and SIC 653).
This profile indicated that approximately 75 percent of all establishments in SIC 651 (Real Estate Operators and
Lessors) and approximately 71 percent of all establishments in SIC 653 (Real Estate Agents and Managers) fell within
the 1 to 4 employee size class. These proportions increased to 90 percent and 86 percent, respectively, when employee
size class 1 to 9 was examined. 
To measure the cost impacts of the proposed rule on these small establishments, representative, or model establishments
were designed. These model establishments corresponded to typical establishments, with respect to number of employees
and annual transaction volume, in each affected sector. Since transaction activity was reported to vary widely,
a range of transaction volume was estimated for each establishment type. 
For each model establishment, annual regulatory costs were then calculated and compared to annual labor and overhead
costs. Ratios were computed for both high and low estimates of the range of transaction activity. In the case of a real
estate sales organization, regulatory costs were found to represent from 0.18 to 0.38 percent of labor and overhead
costs. In the case of a rental establishment, impacts were slightly higher, ranging from 0.20 to 0.46 percent. An establishment
engaged in both activities was projected to sustain impacts of 0.26 to 0.59 percent. 
Thus, while a large number of small establishments will be potentially affected by the rule, cost impacts were not
found to be of sufficient magnitude to cause undue harm to such establishments. Consequently, no regulatory alternatives
are being proposed in connection with small business impacts. 
Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), EPA certifies that this proposed rule
will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 


C. Paperwork Reduction Act 


The information collection requirements in this proposed rule have been submitted for approval to OMB under the Paperwork
Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq

. An Information Collection Request (ICR) document has been prepared by EPA and HUD (ICR No. 1710.01) and a copy may
be obtained from Sandy Farmer, Information Policy Branch (MC-2136), Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St.,
SW., Washington, DC or by calling (202) 260-2740. 
The collection of information that would be associated with this proposed rule is estimated to have a public burden
averaging 19.5 minutes per response (at 6.5 minutes per an average of 3 respondents), and to require 15.4 minutes per
respondent, annually. This includes time for gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing
the collection of information. 
Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions
for reducing this burden to Chief, Information Policy Branch (MC-2136); Environmental Protection Agency; 401 M
St., SW; Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.'' The final rule will respond to any OMB or
public comments on the information collection requirements contained in this proposed rule. 


D. Environmental Impact


In accordance with 40 CFR 1508.4 of the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality and 24 CFR 50.19 and 50.20(o)(2)
of the HUD regulations, the policies and procedures contained in this proposed rule relate only to information services
and, therfore, are categorically excluded from the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act. 


E. HUD's Regulatory Agenda


This proposed rule was listed as Item No. 1517 in HUD's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on April 25, 1994
(59 FR 20424, 20431), in accordance with Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act, and was requested
by and submitted to the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives under section
7(o) of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act.

Internalized/Affiliate Practices, Payment for Order Flow and Order Routing Practices


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Securities and Exchange Commission. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rulemaking. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Securities and Exchange Commission is proposing to revise its rules governing disclosure to customers by broker-dealers
of practices related to the routing of order flow, including payment for order flow, internalization of order flow,
and affiliate practices. The proposed amendments are intended to provide customers with more useful information
in evaluating the quality of executions. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Introduction and Background 


The Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') is proposing to amend its rules governing disclosure
of broker-dealer payment for order flow and the practice of executing orders as principal or routing orders to an affiliated
broker-dealer or exchange specialist (``internalized/affiliate practices''), Rule 10b-10 (17 CFR 240.10b-10)
and Rule 11Ac1-3 (17 CFR 240.11Ac1-3) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''). As described
below and in a related release, both payment for order flow and internalized/affiliate practices have been the subject
of extensive debate.

1

 




The proposed Rule amendments regarding payment for order flow also are intended to enhance disclosure to customers
of compensation their broker-dealer may receive from market centers

2

 in return for routing customer orders to them for execution.

3

 The amendments would require broker-dealers receiving payment for order flow to provide customers additional information
regarding the value of the compensation received. The proposed additional disclosures would include, for monetary
payment for order flow, the range of payments received on a per share basis and on an aggregate basis annually, and for
non-monetary payment for order flow, an estimate of the range of payment for order flow on a per share basis and on an
aggregate basis annually. These disclosures would be required when a customer opens an account, on an annual basis
thereafter, and in abbreviated fashion on required confirmations. The proposed amendments would require similar
disclosure with respect to the value of order flow subject to internalized/affiliate practices. 





The Commission also is proposing that broker-dealers disclose to their customers information regarding their order
routing practices generally, regardless of whether they receive payment for order flow or engage in internalized/affiliate
practices. 
The proposed amendments regarding internalized/affiliate practices are intended to address comments the Commission
received in connection with its consideration of payment for order flow practices and to elicit further discussion
regarding their implications. In connection with the Adopting Release, six commenters indicated that the internalization
of order flow by broker-dealers presents issues similar to those commonly associated with payment for order flow.
These commenters argued that the opportunity to capture the spread through internalized/affiliate practices encourages
broker-dealers to execute orders in house or to send orders to an affiliated broker-dealer or exchange specialist.
At the most basic level, under each practice the broker-dealer is influenced with respect to where it will route customer
orders. 
The proposed amendments would require broker-dealers to inform customers on new account and annual disclosure statements
whether they execute orders as principal or route those orders to affiliated firms. These amendments are designed
to provide customers with more information about firms' order routing decisions, especially in light of changes
that might result from requiring additional disclosure of payment for order flow practices. 
Finally, the proposed rule amendments would extend confirmation and account statement disclosure of payment for
order flow to transactions in standardized options. 
In the Adopting Release issued today, the Commission adopted requirements for additional disclosure of payment
for order flow practices.

4

 Commenters are encouraged to review the Adopting Release in considering the amendments proposed today. The discussion
that follows describes the proposed amendments and solicits views regarding those amendments.

II. Discussion 



A. Definition and Quantification of Payment for Order Flow 



The proposed amendments would require broker-dealers to provide more detailed information to customers regarding
payment for order flow. The proposed amendments would require broker-dealers receiving monetary payment for order
flow to disclose the range of payments received on a per share basis and the aggregate amount of payment for order flow
received on an annual basis, and, for non-monetary payment for order flow, to disclose an estimate of the range of non-monetary
payment for order flow received by the broker-dealer on a per share basis and on an aggregate basis annually. 



1. Definition of Payment for Order Flow 



The Commission, in the Adopting Release, adopted a definition of payment for order flow that includes monetary payments,
services, property or any other benefit offered for order flow that results in remuneration to the firm in return for
the routing of customer orders for execution. As discussed below, the proposed amendments would establish definitions
of monetary and non-monetary payment for order flow, defining monetary payment for order flow as any monetary payment,
discount, rebate or reduction of fee to the extent that the payment, discount, rebate or reduction exceeds the fee
charged. At the same time, however, the Commission is concerned that other practices used by market centers are designed
to induce broker-dealers to direct order flow, and, therefore, may present issues similar to those practices currently
defined as payment for order flow in the Adopting Release. The Commission is soliciting comment on whether to expand
the definition of payment for order flow. Specifically, the Commission is considering expanding the definition
to include volume discounts, rebates, reductions or other inducements for order flow, even if not in excess of the
execution fee charged by a market center.

5

 Commenters should specifically indicate which practices should be included in the definition to provide the maximum
benefit to investors and encourage equivalent regulatory treatment among competing market centers consistent
with the purposes of the Act. 





The Commission also requests the views of commenters as to whether a differential in fees between competing market
centers should be considered as the economic equivalent of payment for order flow for either or both general disclosure
and quantification purposes. This differential might be viewed as affecting the order routing determination of
a broker-dealer in a manner similar to payment for order flow. 

Commenters also are asked to address why payment for order flow should exist in certain instances, but not others,
when the inducement for order flow to be routed to one market center or another is identical in both instances. For example,
assume that one market center currently pays $.02 per share for order flow, while a competing market center charges
a fee of $.05 per share to handle customer orders, resulting in an overall differential of $.07 per share. Under the
current definition, the first market center would be deemed to be paying for order flow, quantified as $.02 per share.
Why should payment for order flow be deemed to no longer exist where, as a result of a $.02 per share increase in costs
uniformly incurred by all market centers, the first market center simply ceased paying for order flow in favor of handling
customer orders without charge, while its competitor proportionately increased the fees charged for handling customer
orders to $.07 per share? In this instance, the first market center maintains the identical differential in terms
of the inducement to broker-dealers to direct order flow to the first market center, as opposed to the second. 

In a related manner, commenters are requested to indicate whether the proposed quantification of payment for order
flow (discussed more fully in the next Section) accurately reflects the inducement to a broker-dealer to route orders
to a particular market center. For instance, in the example noted above, is the amount of the inducement that should
be disclosed in connection with payment for order flow paid by the first market center $.02 per share, as would be the
case under the current definition of payment for order flow in Rule 11Ac1-3, or does the $.07 per share differential
more accurately reflect the level of inducement for order flow?

2. Quantification of Payment for Order Flow 


The proposed amendments would establish definitions of ``monetary payment for order flow'' and ``non-monetary
payment for order flow.'' The term monetary payment for order flow would be defined in section 10b-10(e)(10)
to mean ``any monetary payment, discount, rebate or reduction of fee to the extent that the payment, discount, rebate
or reduction exceeds the fee charged.'' The term non-monetary payment for order flow would be defined in section 10b-10(e)(11)
to mean ``any payment for order flow received other than monetary payment for order flow.'' 
The Adopting Release, while requiring additional disclosure of payment for order flow practices, does not require
disclosure of the amount of any payment for order flow. Certain of the proposed amendments to Rule 11Ac1-3 would
focus on this disclosure. For monetary payment for order flow, the broker-dealer would be required by Rule 11Ac1-3(a)
(3) and (4) to disclose the aggregate amount of monetary payment for order flow received annually, and the range of
monetary payment for order flow received on a per share basis. The proposed amendments to Rule 11Ac1-3(a) (5)
and (6) would require broker-dealers to disclose to customers at account opening and annually thereafter, an estimate
of the aggregate value of non-monetary payment for order flow received by the broker-dealer in return for directing
order flow on an annual basis, and an estimate of the range of non-monetary payment for order flow received on a per share
basis. 
The proposal calls for an estimate of non-monetary payment for order flow, recognizing that precision may not be possible.
To the extent that a broker-dealer finds it difficult to estimate the per share value of non-monetary payment for order
flow, the Commission would envision permitting the broker-dealer to assume the value of the non-monetary compensation
was equal to the cash per share payment for order flow received from the same source, or, if none, similar sources. The
assumption would be that a broker-dealer, in choosing the form of payment for order flow, would demand a value that
is commensurate with the amount of cash that could be received from the same or competing market maker or specialist.
Commenters are requested to identify alternative methods by which firms might arrive at an estimate of the value of
non-monetary payment for order flow.
 




The proposed rule would require an estimate of the range of non-monetary payment for order flow received by the broker-dealer
expressed on a per share basis. To comply with this requirement, broker-dealers would be expected to use the estimate
required by Rule 11Ac1-3(a)(5) in calculating the range of values to be disclosed. The proposed rule would recognize
expressly that the calculation of values represents an estimate.

The Commission also is proposing to require broker-dealers who receive payment for routing orders to include information
on the confirmation. Proposed Rule 10b-10(a)(7)(B) would require, for any monetary payment for order flow
received, confirmation disclosure of the range of payments received on a per share basis. Proposed Rule 10b-10(a)(7)(iii)(C)
would require, for any non-monetary payment for order flow received, an estimate by the broker-dealer of the range
in value of non-monetary compensation on a per share basis. Because it may not be possible to identify immediately
after execution which orders are subject to payment for order flow arrangements or the 

pro rata 

value of a specific order, the Commission is proposing to require disclosure of an estimate of the range in value of
compensation that may have been received, stated on a per share basis. Proposed Rule 10b-10(a)(7)(iii) (B)
and (C) also would require, for any non-monetary payment for order flow received, a statement that the nature and source
of such compensation will be furnished upon written request of the customer. 
In crafting the proposed amendments, the Commission is mindful of the concern that requiring quantification of monetary
but not non-monetary payment for order flow could result in broker-dealers moving toward potentially undisclosed
compensatory practices, such as non-monetary payment for order flow.
 Thus, it has sought to require disclosure of non-monetary payment for order flow similar to the disclosure requirements
established for monetary payment for order flow. This is intended to provide customers with equivalent information
to evaluate a broker-dealer's order routing arrangements, and to remove any regulatory disparity between monetary
and non-monetary payments. 




The Commission invites commenters to address whether the proposed amendments would accomplish these goals, and
whether there are other ways to accomplish these goals. The Commission specifically requests comment on the ability
of broker-dealers to determine whether a non-monetary payment is in return for order flow, and their ability to estimate
the value of the various forms of non-monetary payments. 


B. Internalized/Affiliate Practices 


Rule 11Ac1-3, as adopted, requires broker-dealers who receive payment for order flow to disclose their policies
for determining where to route orders that are subject to payment for order flow absent specific instructions from
customers. That Rule would not expressly require broker-dealers to provide information about their order routing
policies if instead of receiving payment for order flow in return for routing orders, they simply executed the orders
for their own account.





The Commission is concerned that internalized/affiliate practices may raise questions similar to payment for order
flow practices regarding the obligations of brokers to their customers, such as whether firms that internalize order
flow are providing best execution of customer orders.
 In proposing Rule 11Ac1-3 in October 1993, the Commission invited comment on the implications of these practices
and whether additional disclosure would be desirable.
 Seven commenters addressed internalization/affiliate practices; six favored a regulatory response
 and one opposed it.

The Commission is proposing to amend Rule 11Ac1-3 to require broker-dealers who choose to internalize or route
orders to affiliated organizations to provide information about this policy parallel to the information that Rule
11Ac1-3 requires them to provide concerning the routing of orders in return for payment for order flow. As defined
in proposed Rule 10b-10(e)(12), internalized/affiliate order routing practices shall mean the execution
of an order by a broker-dealer as principal, or the routing of an order by the broker-dealer to an affiliated broker-dealer
or exchange member. Specifically, the amendment to Rule 11Ac1-3(a)(2) would require firms to disclose their
policies for determining where to route customers' orders, absent specific instructions from customers, including
whether orders are executed as principal, orders are routed to an affiliated broker-dealer, or to an unaffiliated
broker-dealer or market center, including a description of the extent to which orders can be executed at prices superior
to the NBBO. 

The Commission also is proposing to extend the confirmation and account statement valuation requirements to internalized/affiliate
order flow practices. The Commission requests comment on this aspect of the proposed rule and the ability of broker-dealers
to estimate the value of internalized/affiliate order flow. The Commission realizes that, as in the case of non-monetary
payment for order flow, precision in this area may not be possible. Therefore, the Commission seeks the views of commenters
as to whether the value of internalized order flow may be reasonably approximated by reference to the monetary amount
per share that a broker-dealer could have received for such order flow from a competing market center, or by other methods,
such as by measuring the difference between the spread received by a broker-dealer engaging in internalized/affiliate
practices and the amount that the broker-dealer could have received for the order flow from another market center.

The Commission invites commenters to address whether the proposed amendment would provide customers with meaningful
information and would further the goals of section 11A of the Act. To the extent that they believe payment for order
flow and internalized/affiliate practices should be treated differently for regulatory purposes, commenters
are requested to indicate why concerns with respect to internalization are less compelling than those frequently
associated with payment for order flow practices. Similarly, the Commission recognizes that the unequal regulatory
treatment of internalized order flow may result in an increase in the amount of customer orders that are executed directly
by a broker-dealer or its affiliates. 



C. Order Routing Disclosure 



As proposed, Rule 11Ac1-3(a)(2) would require all broker-dealers to disclose their policies for determining
where to route customer orders absent specific instructions from the customer, as well as a description of the extent
to which orders may receive price improvement. If adopted, this disclosure currently required under Rule 11Ac1-2
would be required for all orders, regardless of whether the broker-dealer received payment for order flow or engaged
in internalized/affiliate order routing practices. 

The Commission believes that the proposed disclosure of order routing practices is consistent with its goal of providing
customers with information to enhance their ability to evaluate the quality of execution received, and to make informed
decisions with respect to the selection of broker-dealers. Under Rule 10b-10 of the Act, the Commission currently
requires broker-dealers to disclose their capacity as agent or principal with respect to customer transactions,
the agency commission received in connection with a particular transaction, and the source and amount of any additional
remuneration to be received in connection with a transaction, among other matters.

15

 As a result of these disclosures, investors have a better understanding of commissions and other costs associated
with the execution of a transaction. The Commission believes that proposed Rule 11Ac1-3(a)(2) will further
facilitate the ability of investors to understand order routing possibilities and the decisions made by broker-dealers
in this regard. The Commission believes that such information would be of significant benefit to investors.

For example, a broker-dealer's decision regarding the routing of orders involving securities listed for trading
on national securities exchanges raises the issue of price improvement. Orders in such securities that are routed
to certain exchange facilities typically will rec
