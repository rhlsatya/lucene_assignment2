<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Revocation of Antidumping Finding.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Commerce (the Department) is notifying the public of its revocation of the antidumping finding
on cadmium from Japan because it is no longer of any interest to domestic interested parties. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


The Department may revoke an antidumping finding if the Secretary concludes that the finding is no longer of any interest
to domestic interested parties. We conclude that there is no interest in an antidumping finding when no interested
party has requested an administrative review for five consecutive review periods and when no domestic interested
party objects to revocation (19 CFR 353.25(d)(4)(iii)). 
On August 1, 1994, the Department published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 38956) its notice of intent to revoke the antidumping finding on cadmium from Japan (August 4, 1972). 
Additionally, as required by 19 CFR 353.25(d)(4)(ii), the Department served written notice of its intent to revoke
this antidumping finding on each domestic interested party on the service list. Domestic interested parties who
might object to the revocation were provided the opportunity to submit their comments not later than the last day of
the anniversary month. 
In this case, we received no requests for review for five consecutive review periods. Furthermore, no domestic interested
party, as defined under  353.2 (k)(3), (k)(4), (k)(5), or (k)(6) of the Department's regulations, has expressed
opposition to revocation. Based on these facts, we have concluded that the antidumping finding on cadmium from Japan
is no longer of any interest to interested parties. Accordingly, we are revoking this antidumping finding in accordance
with 19 CFR 353.25(d)(4)(iii). 


Scope of the Order 


Imports covered by the revocation are shipments of cadmium from Japan. This merchandise is currently classifiable
under Harmonized Tariff Schedules (HTS) item number 8107.10.00. The HTS number is provided for convenience and customs
purposes. The written description remains dispositive. 

This revocation applies to all unliquidated entries of cadmium from Japan entered, or withdrawn from warehouse,
for consumption on or after August 1, 1994. Entries made during the period August 1, 1993, through July 30, 1994, will
be subject to automatic assessment in accordance with 19 CFR 353.22(e). The Department will instruct the Customs
Service to proceed with liquidation of all unliquidated entries of this merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse,
for consumption on or after August 1, 1994, without regard to antidumping duties, and to refund any estimated antidumping
duties collected with respect to those entries. This notice is in accordance with 19 CFR 353.25(d).

<DOCTITLE>Leather Wearing Apparel From Uruguay; Revocation of Countervailing Duty Order </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Commerce.


 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Revocation of Countervailing Duty Order.


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Commerce (the Department) is revoking the countervailing duty order on leather wearing apparel
from Uruguay because it is no longer of interest to interested parties. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Background 



On July 5, 1994, the Department of Commerce published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 34410) its intent to revoke the countervailing duty order on leather wearing apparel from Uruguay (47 FR 31032;
July 17, 1982). Additionally, as required by 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4)(ii), the Department served certified written notice
of its intent to revoke this countervailing duty order on each party listed on its most current service list. Domestic
interested parties who might object to the revocation were provided 30 days to submit their comments. 



Scope of the Order 



Imports covered by this order are shipments of Uruguayan leather wearing apparel and parts and pieces thereof. This
product is currently classified under item numbers 4203.10.4030, 4203.10.4060, 4203.10.4085, and 4203.10.4095
of the 

Harmonized Tariff Schedule

 of the United States. 



Determination To Revoke 



The Department may revoke a countervailing duty order if the Secretary of Commerce concludes that the order is no longer
of interest to interested parties. We conclude that there is no interest in a countervailing duty order when no interested
party has requested an administrative review for at least five consecutive review periods and when no domestic interested
party objects to the revocation (19 CFR 355.25(d)(4)(iii)). 

In this case, we received no request for review for five consecutive review periods. Furthermore, no domestic interested
party as defined under  355.2 (i)(3), (i)(4), (i)(5), or (i)(6) of the Department's regulations, has expressed
opposition to revocation. Therefore, we have concluded that the countervailing duty order covering leather wearing
apparel from Uruguay is no longer of interest to interested parties, and we are revoking this countervailing duty
order in accordance with 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4)(iii). 

This revocation applies to all shipments of leather wearing apparel from Uruguay exported on or after January 1, 1993.
Shipments of this merchandise exported during the period January 1, 1993 through December 31, 1993, will be subject
to automatic assessment in accordance with 19 CFR 355.22(g)(1). Further, as required by 19 CFR 355.25(d)(5), the
Department is terminating the suspension of liquidation on the subject merchandise as of the effective date of this
notice and will instruct the Customs Service to liquidate, without regard to countervailing duties, all unliquidated
entries of this merchandise exported on or after January 1, 1994. 



This notice is published in accordance with 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4)(iii).

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Certain Textile Mill Products from Argentina: Notice of Proposed Amendment to the Existing Conversion of the Scope
of the Order from the Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule.


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On January 1, 1989, the United States fully converted to the international harmonized system of tariff classification.
On January 11, 1989, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published the Conversion to Use of the Harmonized
Tariff Schedule of Classifications for Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Proceedings (54 FR 993; January 11,
1989) (1989 Conversion) for all antidumping and countervailing duty orders in effect or investigations in progress
as of January 1, 1989. The Department now proposes to amend the 1989 Conversion governing the countervailing duty
order on certain textile mill products from Argentina. Interested parties are invited to comment on this proposed
amended conversion. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background 



In 1985, the Department issued a countervailing duty order on Certain Textile Mill Products from Argentina (C-357-404)
(50 FR 9846; March 12, 1985). The scope of this order was originally defined solely in terms of the Tariff Schedules
of the United States Annotated (TSUSA) item numbers; no narrative product description was provided. On January 1,
1989, the United States fully converted from the TSUSA to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS). Section 1211 of the
Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 directed the Department to ``take whatever actions are necessary to
conform, to the fullest extent practicable, with the tariff classification system of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule
[for] all * * * orders * * *'' in effect at the time of the implementation of the HTS. 

Accordingly, on January 11, 1989, after reviewing comments received from the public, the Department published the
1989 Conversion for all antidumping and countervailing duty orders in effect or investigations in progress as of
January 1, 1989 (54 FR 993). The notice also included the conversion of the scope of the referenced textile mill product
order from TSUSA to HTS item numbers. The 1989 Conversion was based on a one-to-one correspondence of the TSUSA and
HTS item numbers. In the notice, the Department stated that the conversion could be amended, as warranted, at any time
during the applicable proceeding as a result of the submission of comments or new factual information. 

As a result of comments submitted to the Department by the importing public and advice received from the U.S. Customs
Service, the Department determined that the 1989 Conversion did not accurately reflect the scope of the countervailing
duty order on Certain Textile Mill Products from Argentina and, therefore, that the conversion should be amended.


To rectify the problems in the 1989 Conversion, the Department, with the assistance of the U.S. Customs Service and
the U.S. International Trade Commission, has once again compared the TSUSA-defined scope and the HTS-defined scope
provided by the 1989 Conversion, and identified those HTS numbers that more reasonably correspond with the TSUSA-defined
scope of the countervailing duty order on Certain Textile Mill Products from Argentina. A new proposed amended conversion
is found in the attached appendix. 



Request for Public Comments 



We invite interested parties to submit comments on the proposed amended conversion within 30 days of the publication
of this notice. All comments must be in writing (10 copies), addressed to the attention of the Director, Office of Countervailing
Compliance, International Trade Administration, Central Records Unit, Room B-099, 14th Street and Constitution
Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20230.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In accordance with Executive Order 11625 and 15 U.S.C. 1512, the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) is soliciting
competitive applications for its Columbia, South Carolina Minority Business Development Center (MBDC).





The purpose of the MBDC Program is to provide business development services to the minority business community to
help establish and maintain viable minority businesses. To this end, MBDA funds organizations to identify and coordinate
public and private sector resources on behalf of minority individuals and firms; to offer a full range of client services
to minority entrepreneurs; and to serve as a conduit of information and assistance regarding minority business.
the MBDC will provide service in the Columbia, South Carolina Metropolitan Area. The award number of the MBDC will
be 04-10-95003-01.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Contingent upon the availability of Federal funds, the cost of performance for the first budget period (12 months)
from April 1, 1995 to March 31, 1996, is estimated at $198,971. The total Federal amount is $169,125 and is composed
of $165,000 plus the Audit Fee amount of $4,125. The application must include a minimum cost share of 15% $29,846 in
non-federal (cost-sharing) contributions for a total project cost of $198,971. Cost-sharing contributions may
be in the form of cash, client fees, third party in-kind contributions, non-cash applicant contributions or combinations
thereof. 




The funding instrument for this project will be a cooperative agreement. Competition is open to individuals, non-profit
and for-profit organizations, state and local governments, American Indian tribes and educational institutions.

Applications will be evaluated on the following criteria: the knowledge, background and/or capabilities of the
firm and its staff in addressing the needs of the business community in general and, specifically, the special needs
of minority businesses, individuals and organizations (45 points), the resources available to the firm in providing
business development services (10 points); the firm's approach (techniques and methodologies) to performing the
work requirements included in the application (25 points); and the firm's estimated cost for providing such assistance
(20 points). An application must receive at least 70% of the points assigned to each evaluation criteria category
to be considered programmatically acceptable and responsive. Those applications determined to be acceptable and
responsive will then be evaluated by the Director of MBDA. Final award selections shall be based on the number of points
received, the demonstrated responsibility of the applicant, and the determination of those most likely to further
the purpose of the MBDA program. Negative audit findings and recommendations and unsatisfactory performance under
prior Federal awards may result in an application not being considered for award. The applicant with the highest point
score will not necessarily receive the award. Periodic reviews culminating in year-to-date evaluations will be
conducted to determine if funding for the project should continue. Continued funding will be at the total discretion
of MBDA based on such factors as the MBDC's performance, the availability of funds and Agency priorities.



The MBDC shall be required to contribute at least 15% of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions.
To assist in this effort, the MBDC may charge client fees for services rendered. Fees may range from $10 to $60 per hour
based on the gross receipts of the client's business.

Pre-Award Costs



Applicants are hereby notified that if they incur any costs prior to an award being made, they do so solely at their own
risk of not being reimbursed by the Government. Notwithstanding any verbal assurance that an applicant may have received,
there is no obligation on the part of the Department of Commerce to cover pre-award costs.



Outstanding Account Receivable



No award of Federal funds shall be made to an applicant who has an outstanding delinquent Federal debt until either
the delinquent account is paid in full, repayment schedule is established and at least one payment is received, or
other arrangements satisfactory to the Department of Commerce are made.



Name Check Policy



All non-profit and for-profit applicants are subject to a name check review process. Name checks are intended to reveal

such as fraud, theft, perjury or other matters which significantly reflect on the applicant's management honesty
or financial integrity.



Award Termination



The Departmental Grants Officer may terminate any grant/cooperative agreement in whole or in part at any time before
the date of completion whenever it is determined that the award recipient has failed to comply with the conditions
of the grant/cooperative agreement. Examples of some of the conditions which can cause termination are failure to
meet cost-sharing requirements; unsatisfactory performance of the MBDC work requirements; and reporting inaccurate
or inflated claims of client assistance. Such inaccurate or inflated claims may be deemed illegal and punishable
by law.

ACTION:

 Extension of comment period on draft stock assessments and Potential Biological Removal (PBR) workshop reports.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS is extending the comment period on its stock assessments and PBR workshop report in consideration of the complexity
of the issues surrounding both the stock assessments and the PBR workshop report.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On August 9, 1994, NMFS published a 

Federal Register

 notice announcing the availability of draft stock assessment reports and PBR workshop reports (59 FR 40527). The
stock assessment reports are required under the new section 117 of the Marine Mammal Protection Act Amendments of
1994 (Public Law 103-238). A summary of the stock assessment reports, specifying geographical range, regional
designation, minimum abundance estimate, PBR, and estimated human-caused mortality for each stock, was followed
by a designation of strategic or nonstrategic. The PBR workshop, consisting of NMFS and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
scientists, was convened to develop an initial approach for promoting consistent national interpretation of parameters
to be used in draft stock assessment reports, including the calculation of PBR. 


The initial comment period for NMFS draft stock assessment and PBR workshop reports was scheduled to end on November
7, 1994. In response to concern that the public comment period was inadequate, given the scope of the issues surrounding
the assessments and the workshop reports, NMFS extends the comment period and welcomes comments received by December
1, 1994. Comments must be received in the Office of Protected Resources by December 1 to be fully considered. Therefore,
those submitting comments close to that date should fax their comments or call to ensure their comments arrived via
mail.

Union and the Replacement of the Army Reserve Center at Fort Lawton, Seattle, WA



Pursuant to section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 as implemented by the Council on Environmental
Quality regulations (40 CFR Parts 1500-1508), the Department of the Navy and Department of Army announce their
intention to conduct a scoping meeting for the preparation of a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) for the
proposed relocation of Navy reservists from the Naval Reserve Readiness Center at Lake Union and the replacement
of the Army Reserve training facilities currently located in the 500 Area at Fort Lawton.

This notice augments the Notice of Intent to prepare a DEIS for this proposed action that was published in the October

The Chief of Naval Reserve and U.S. Army Reserve Command's preferred alternative is to construct and operate a 120,000
square foot Joint Use Reserve Center in the southwest corner of Fort Lawton, near the existing 124th Army Reserve Command
Headquarters. The DEIS will consider other sites on Fort Lawton, as well as other Federally-owned sites in the Seattle
area. The DEIS will also evaluate taking no action, and constructing separate as well as joint facilities.

A public scoping meeting has been scheduled to solicit comments about the issues that need to be addressed in the DEIS.
The meeting will be held at 7:00 PM on November 17, 1994 at the Blaine Elementary School auditorium, 2550 34th Ave. West,
Seattle, WA. A brief presentation identifying the proposed action and the EIS process will precede a request for public
comments. It is important that federal, state, and local agencies, and interested individuals take the opportunity
to identify environmental concerns that should be addressed in the DEIS.

Agencies and the public are also invited and encouraged to provide written comments on the scoping issues in addition
to, or in lieu of, oral comments at the coping meeting. Each speaker will be limited to five minutes at the meeting. Written
comments must be received by December 15, 1994. Comments should be sent to Engineering Field Activity Northwest,

ACTION: 

Notice of partially closed meeting.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice sets forth the schedule and proposed agenda of a forthcoming meeting of the National Advisory Council
on Indian Education. This notice also describes the functions of the Council. Notice of this meeting is required under
section 10(a)(2) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The National Advisory Council on Indian Education is established under section 5342 of the Indian Education Act of
1988 (25 U.S.C. 2642). The council is established to, among other things, assist the Secretary of Education in carrying
out responsibilities under the Indian Education Act of 1988 (Part C, Title V, Pub. L. 100-297) and to advise Congress
and the Secretary of Education with regard to federal education programs in which Indian children or adults participate
or from which they can benefit and submit a list on nominees for the position of Director, Office of Indian Education.




The Chairman of the National Advisory Council on Indian Education, Eddie L. Tullis, has called for a meeting of the
full Council, November 14-17, 1994. On Monday morning from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. the agenda will include a general
business session and the following activities: election of new officers for the 1995 fiscal year; committee development;
and an update of the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act which includes the Indian Education
Act.

The closed portion of the meeting will be held on Monday afternoon from 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. and will be devoted to discussing
personnel issues related to the search process for a director for the Office of Indian Education and the internal staffing
structure of the NACIE office. All discussions held in conjunction with the selection of a director for the Office
of Indian Education and NACIE's internal organization will involve matters which relate solely to the internal personnel
rules and practices of the Council and are likely to disclose information of a personal nature where disclosure would
constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy if conducted in open session. Such matters are protected
by exemptions (2) and (6) of section 552b(c) of the Government in the Sunshine Act (Pub. L. 94-409; 5 U.S.C. 552b(c).

Tuesday's agenda is open and will include any unfinished business from the previous day's morning session; work as
previously delegated by committee; and the development of a fiscal year 1995 workplan and future goals of the Council.
Wednesday and Thursday will be devoted to work group discussions that will further outline the work of the council
for the current fiscal year and beyond based on the recently reauthorized Elementary and Secondary Education Act
of 1994. Included also will be an opportunity for public participation in Council discussions. Interested individuals
may contact the NACIE office for a final agenda the week prior to the meeting date.

Records shall be kept of all Council proceedings and are available for public inspection at the office of the National
Advisory Council on Indian Education located at 330 C Streets SW., room, 4072, Washington, DC 20202-7556 from
the hours of 9:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday, except holidays.

17. The Wisconsin Public Power Incorporated System 



[Docket No. TX95-2-000]



Take notice that on October 17, 1994, The Wisconsin Public Power Incorporated System (WPPI) tendered for filing an
application requesting that the Commission order Wisconsin Electric Power Company (WEPCO), Wisconsin Power and
Light Company (WP&L), and Wisconsin Public Service Corporation (WPS) jointly, joint network tariff to provide
network transmission services on a joint, single-system basis to WPPI. The application was filed pursuant to Section
211 of the Federal Power Act, as amended by Energy Policy Act of 1992 (16 U.S.C. 824j). 

In its application, WPPI requests that network service be provided commencing on May 1, 1995, and continuing on a long-term
basis thereafter. The total transmission capacity requested would be sufficient for WPPI to integrate its load in
eastern Wisconsin (now approximately 482 MW) with WPPI's resources. The service requested is network service over
the integrated transmission grid of the EWU. The service requested includes both long and short-term firm and non-firm
use, comparable in all respects to the EWU's use of the EWU grid. WPPI seeks services that will allow it, subject to existing
power purchase contracts, (i) to schedule power and energy from a variety of sources within and outside of the EWU grid
to WPPI's loads within the control areas of WP&L, WEPCO and WPS on an economic dispatch basis and in response to
planned and unplanned outages and (ii) to engage in coordination purchases and sales using the EWU grid in the same
manner as the owners of that grid schedule their power and energy transactions. The service would be costed on single-system
basis for the EWU, with one joint rate for use of the integrated transmission system of three utilities. Revenues would
be shared by the EWU. WPPI also requested that the EWU unbundle their transmission services from power sales services.


Copies of the application have been served upon the affected parties, WEPCO, WP&L, WPS, the Public Service Commission
of Wisconsin, and upon Madison Gas & Electric Company. 



Comment date: 

November 9, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph E at the end of this notice.

<DOCTITLE>New England Power Co. Western Massachusetts Electric Co.; Notice of Intention To Prepare an Environmental Impact
Statement and Conduct Public Scoping Meetings</DOCTITLE>



October 27, 1994.



The Federal Regulatory Commission (FERC) has received applications for two new licenses for the continued operation
of the Deerfield River Project No. 2323, and the Gardners Falls Project No. 2334. The projects are located on the Deerfield
River, in Windham and Bennington Counties, Vermont, and Franklin and Berkshire Counties, Massachusetts.

The FERC staff has determined that licensing these projects would constitute a major federal action significantly
affecting the quality of the human environment. Therefore, the staff intends to prepare an environmental impact
statement (EIS) on the hydroelectric projects in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act. The staff's
EIS will objectively consider both site specific and cumulative environmental effects of the projects and reasonable
alternatives, and will include an economic, financial and engineering analysis.

A draft EIS will be issued and circulated for review by all interested parties. All comments filed on the draft EIS will
be analyzed by the staff and considered in a final EIS. The staff's conclusions and recommendations will then be presented
for the consideration of the Commission in reaching its final licensing decisions.



Scoping Meetings



FERC staff will conduct three scoping meetings. The two evening scoping meetings, one each in Massachusetts and Vermont,
are primarily for public input while the day-time meeting will focus on resource agency and non-governmental organization
(NGO) concerns. All interested individuals, organizations, and agencies are invited to attend and assist the staff
in identifying the scope of environmental issues that should be analyzed in the EIS.

To help focus discussions, a preliminary scoping document outlining subject areas to be addressed at the meeting
will be distributed by mail to interested parties on the FERC mailing list. Copies of the preliminary scoping document
will also be available at the scoping meetings.

The times and locations of the scoping meetings are as follows:



Massachusetts Public Scoping Meeting



Tuesday, November 15, 1994, 7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m., Mohawk Trail Regional High School, Buckland, Massachusetts



Vermont Public Scoping Meeting



Wednesday, November 16, 1994, 7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m., Wilmington High School, Wilmington, Vermont



Agency Scoping Meeting



Thursday, November 17, 1994, 9:00 a.m. to 12 noon, New England Power Company, Shelburne Falls, Massachusetts



Objectives



At the scoping meetings, the staff will: (1) Summarize the environmental issues tentatively identified for analysis
in the planned EIS; (2) solicit from the meeting participants all available information, especially quantifiable
data, on the resources at issue, (3) encourage statements from experts and the public on issues that should be analyzed
in the EIS, including viewpoints in opposition to, or in support of, the staff's preliminary views, (4) determine
the relative depth of analysis for issues to be addressed in the EIS, and (5) identify resource issues that are not important
and do not require detailed analysis.



Procedures



The meetings will be recorded by a stenographer and will become part of the formal record of the Commission proceeding
on the Deerfield River projects under consideration. Individuals presenting statements at the meetings will be
asked to sign in before the meeting starts and to clearly identify themselves for the record.

Individuals, organizations, and agencies with environmental expertise and concerns are encouraged to attend the
meetings and to assist the staff in defining and clarifying the issues to be addressed in the EIS.

Participants wishing to make oral comments in the public meeting are asked to keep them to five minutes to allow everyone
the opportunity to speak.

Persons choosing not to speak at the meetings, but who have views on the issues, may submit written statements for inclusion
in the public record at the meeting. In addition, written scoping comments may be filed with the Secretary, Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20426. All correspondence should
clearly show one or more of the following captions on the first page: Deerfield River Project No. 2323-012; and,
Gardners Falls Project No. 2334-001.

All those that are formally recognized by the Commission as intervenors in the Deerfield and Gardners Falls projects'
proceedings are asked to refrain from engaging the staff in discussions of the merits of the projects outside of any
announced meetings.

Further, parties are reminded of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, which require parties filing
documents with the Commission, to serve a copy of the document on each person whose name is on the official service list,
including agents of the applicants.

For further information, please contact Michael Dees at (202) 219-2807.

Application to Export Electricity Enron Power Marketing, Inc. 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of Fossil Energy, DOE.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of application.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Enron Power Marketing, Inc., (Enron) has requested authorization to export electric energy to Mexico. Enron is a
marketer of electric energy. It does not own or control any electric generation or transmission facilities.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Exports of electricity from the United States to a foreign country are regulated and require authorization under
section 202(e) of the Federal Power Act. 


On October 4, 1994, Enron filed an application with the Office of Fossil Energy (FE) of the Department of Energy (DOE)
for authorization to export electric energy to Mexico pursuant to section 202(e) of the Federal Power Act. Enron owns
no generation or transmission facilities but has been certified by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)
as a power marketer. Enron expects the majority of its transactions to be short-term sales of electricity for which
contracts have yet to be negotiated. 

This is the first application for export that FE has accepted from an individual entity that does not own or operate
physical facilities. The FE decision to accept an application from a power marketer, as opposed to the ``traditional''
electric power entities which own and/or operate physical facilities, is based on the marketer taking possession
of the electric energy inside the United States. This situation is distinguished from the power broker which simply
facilitates a sale of electric energy without ever taking ownership of the commodity.

The electric energy Enron proposes to transmit to Mexico would be purchased from electric utilities and Federal power
marketing agencies. Enron asserts that such energy would be surplus to the requirements of the entities from which
it would be purchased. Enron would arrange for the exported energy to be wheeled from the selling entities, over existing
domestic transmission facilities, and delivered to the foreign purchaser over one or more of the following international
transmission lines: San Diego Gas and Electric Company's (SDG&E) 230-kilovolt (kV), Miguel-Tijuana transmission
line (PP-68); the SDG&E 69-kV line at San Ysidro (PP-49); the SDG&E 230-kV, Imperial
Valley-La Rosita line (PP-79); El Paso Electric Company's 115-kV lines at Diablo, New Mexico (PP-92)
and Ascarate, Texas (PP-48-A); Central Power and Light Company's 138-kV and 69-kV transmission
lines at Brownsville, Texas (PP-94); and the 138-kV transmission lines permitted to Mexico's Comision
Federal de Electricidad at Eagle Pass (PP-50), Loredo (PP-57), and Falcon Dam (PP-57) in Texas.

Enron has suggested that the initial FE authorization be sufficient for all short-term exports of 90 days duration
or less, at unspecified rates of transmission, over any of the international transmission facilities identified
above. 
For exports over 90 days duration, Enron has suggested that it notify FE prior to commencing exports and that it provide
the following information: (1) The name of the purchaser(s); (2) the term of the agreement; (3) the contract transmission
route(s) and the name of the companies providing transmission wheeling services; (4) the related FERC Rate Schedule,
if applicable; and (5) the point(s) of exportation. Enron further suggests that FE publish a notice of the proposed
transaction in the 

Federal Register

, stating that the transaction would be deemed approved and allowed to commence unless, within 10 days of publication
of such notice, (1) a protest is filed, or (2) FE notifies Enron that the transaction is not approved. Subject to the
foregoing, Enron could commence exportation at the end of a 10-day comment period. In the case of either a protest or
notification of disapproval by FE, exports could not commence without specific authorization by FE. 
Before FE takes any final action on applications to export, it first must determine that the proposed action will not
impair the sufficiency of electric supply within the United States or will not impede or tend to impede the coordination
in the public interest of facilities in accordance with section 202(e) of the Federal Power Act. For applications
from ``traditional'' electric power systems, the standard procedure is for the applicant to submit various technical
studies which demonstrate the operation of the regional electric power supply system with the applicant exporting
specified levels of power over identified international transmission lines. The applicant also is required to demonstrate
that it would have sufficient generating capacity to sustain the proposed export under the terms and conditions of
its export agreement, while still complying with any established reserve criteria. 
Since marketers generally could not be seen as having any ``native load'' requirements, the latter criterion of maintaining
sufficient reserve margins appears inappropriate and unnecessary in this instance. Conversely, FE feels that the
issue of coordinated use of regional transmission (i.e., parallel path flow) becomes more critical in the case of
marketers because of the unspecified nature of the transactions, in terms of the magnitude and sources of the export,
and the export points. 
FE recognizes the right of the marketer to compete in the electric power arena, as well as the legitimate reliability/operating
concerns of the ``traditional'' electric power systems. Therefore, FE is proposing an alternative means for determining
the reliability impacts in the case of exports by marketers. In lieu of the technical studies (power flow, transient
stability, etc.) usually submitted in support of an export application, FE will consider accepting executed transmission
wheeling/access agreements between the marketer/applicant and the owners of the transmission systems reasonably
expected to be involved in providing transmission service to the export point. FE is considering requiring the submission
of these transmission access agreements prior to any exports (short- or long-term) occurring over any particular
export point. If an export order is granted, the applicant could ``activate'' any or all export points by submitting
appropriate transmission agreements. After submission of the agreement(s), the applicant would be permitted to
engage in short-term exports immediately, and long-term exports subject to the procedures discussed above. 
FE is soliciting comments particularly on the procedures it is considering for addressing electric reliability
concerns and the authorizing of exports of longer than 90 day duration. 


Procedural Matters


Any person desiring to be heard or to protest this application should file a petition to intervene or protest at the
address provided above in accordance with   385.211 or 385.214 of the Rules of Practice and Procedure
(18 CFR 385.211, 385.214). 
Any such petitions and protests should be filed with the DOE on or before the date listed above. Additional copies of
such petitions to intervene or protests also should be filed directly with: Steven J. Kean, Vice President, Regulatory
Affairs, Enron Power Marketing, Inc., PO Box 1188, Houston, Texas 77251-1188. (710) 853-1586. FAX (713)
646-3490 and David B. Ward, Flood & Ward, 1000 Potomac Street, NW, Suite 402, Washington, DC 20007. (202)

Pursuant to 18 CFR 385.211, protests and comments will be considered by the DOE in determining the appropriate action
to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must
file a petition to intervene under 18 CFR 385.214. Section 385.214 requires that a petition to intervene must state,
to the extent known, the position taken by the petitioner and the petitioner's interest in sufficient factual detail
to demonstrate either that the petitioner has a right to participate because it is a State Commission; that it has or
represents an interest which may be directly affected by the outcome of the proceeding, including any interest as
a consumer, customer, competitor, or a security holder of a party to the proceeding; or that the petitioner's participation
is in the public interest. 

A final decision will be made on this application after a determination is made by the DOE that the proposed action will
not impair the sufficiency of electric supply within the United States or will not impede or tend to impede the coordination
in the public interest of facilities in accordance with section 202(e) of the Federal Power Act. 

Before an export authorization may be issued, the environmental impacts of the proposed DOE action (i.e., granting
the export authorization, with any conditions and limitations, or denying it) must be evaluated pursuant to the National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969. 

Copies of this application will be made available, upon request, for public inspection and copying at the address
provided above.

<DOCTITLE>Ciba-Geigy Corp.; Approval of a Pesticide Product Registration </DOCTITLE>




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice announces Agency approval of an application submitted by Ciba-Geigy Corporation, to conditionally
register the pesticide product Irgarol 1051, containing an active ingredient not included in any previously registered
product pursuant to the provisions of section 3(c)(7)(C) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide
Act (FIFRA), as amended. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 EPA issued a notice, published in the 

Federal Register

 of June 10, 1993 (58 FR 32533), which announced that Ciba-Geigy Corp., Additives Division, Three Skyline Drive, Hawthorne,
NY 10532, had submitted an application to conditionally register the pesticide product Irgarol 1051, (EPA File Symbol
40810-RR), ~containing the active ingredient 

N

-cyclopropyl-

N

'-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-6-(methylthio)-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine at 96 percent, an active ingredient not
included in any previously registered product. 
~~


The application was approved on September 9, 1994, as Irgarol 1051 for use in formulating antifoulant paints in boats
and vessels only. The product was assigned (EPA Registration Number 40810-11). 

A conditional registration may be granted under section 3(c)(7)(C) of FIFRA for a new active ingredient where certain
data are lacking, on condition that such data are received by the end of the conditional registration period and do
not meet or exceed the risk criteria set forth in 40 CFR 154.7; that use of the pesticide during the conditional registration
period will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment; and that use of the pesticide is in the public
interest. 

The Agency has considered the available data on the risks associated with the proposed use of 

N

-cyclopropyl-

N

'-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-6-(methylthio)-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine,~~ and information on social, economic,
and environmental benefits to be derived from such use. Specifically, the Agency has considered the nature of the
chemical and its pattern of use, application methods and rates, and level and extent of potential exposure. Based
on these reviews, the Agency was able to make basic health and safety determinations which show that use of 

N

-cyclopropyl-

N

'-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-6-(methylthio)-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine ~~during the period of conditional registration
is not expected to cause any unreasonable adverse effect on the environment, and that use of the pesticide is in the
public interest. 

This product is conditionally registered in accordance with FIFRA section 3(c)(7)(A). Additional ecological effects
data and environmental fate data will be required from end-use formulators for antifoulant boat bottom paints. All
data, especially data which is currently held in reserve may be required to be submitted for review. If these conditions
are not complied with the registration will be subject to cancellation in accordance with FIFRA section 6(e).

Consistent with section 3(c)(7)(C), the Agency has determined that this conditional registration is in the public
interest. Use of the pesticides are of significance to the user community, and appropriate labeling, use directions,
and other measures have been taken to ensure that use of the pesticides will not result in unreasonable adverse effects
to man and the environment. 

~~~~More detailed information on this registration is contained in an EPA Pesticide Fact Sheet on ~

N

-cyclopropyl-

N

'-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-6-(methylthio)-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine.

on potatoes to control the Colorado potato beetle. This program has ended. (Libby Pemberton) 

EPA has denied a specific exemption request from the:

1. Georgia Department of Agriculture for the use of Pirate insecticide on cotton to control the sweet potato whitefly.
A notice of receipt published in the 

Federal Register

 of June 22, 1994 (59 FR 32207). The exemption was denied because the proposed use poses a risk of unreasonable adverse
effects on nontarget birds and aquatic organisms, including endangered species. Although some growers may incur
significant economic losses, the expected Statewide losses do not justify the use of this unregistered pesticide.
(Susan Stanton) 
2. Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry for the use of Pirate insecticide on cotton to control beet armyworms.
A notice of receipt published in the 

Federal Register

 of June 22, 1994 (59 FR 32205). The exemption was denied because the proposed use poses a risk of unreasonable adverse
effects on nontarget birds and aquatic organisms, including endangered species. An emergency condition does not
exist. (Susan Stanton)

<DOCTITLE>Linuron; Establishment of Temporary Tolerances </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency  (EPA). 


 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA has established temporary tolerances for residues of the herbicide linuron in or on certain raw agricultural
commodities. These temporary tolerances were requested by Resource Seeds, Inc. 


 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Interregional Research Project No. 4, State Agricultural Experimental Station, Rutgers University, P.O. Box 231,
New Brunswick, NJ 8903-0231, has requested in pesticide petition (PP) 4G4290, the establishment of temporary
tolerances for residues of the herbicide linuron [3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1-methoxy-1-methylurea] 
in or on the raw agricultural commodities lupine grain, lupine forage, and lupine hay at 1.0 part per million (ppm).
These temporary tolerances will permit the marketing of the above raw agricultural commodities when treated in accordance
with the provisions of the experimental use permit 67651-EUP-1, which is being issued under the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), as amended (Pub. L. 95-396, 92 Stat. 819; 7 U.S.C. 136). 


The scientific data reported and other relevant material were evaluated, and it was determined that establishment
of the temporary tolerances will protect the public health. Therefore, the temporary tolerances have been established
on the condition that the pesticide be used in accordance with the experimental use permit and with the following provisions:

1. The total amount of the active ingredient to be used must not exceed the quantity authorized by the experimental
use permit. 
2. Resource Seeds, Inc., must immediately notify the EPA of any findings from the experimental use that have a bearing
on safety. The company must also keep records of production, distribution, and performance and on request make the
records available to any authorized officer or employee of the EPA or the Food and Drug Administration. 

These tolerances expire September 1, 1996. Residues not in excess of these amounts remaining in or on the raw agricultural
commodities after this expiration date will not be considered actionable if the pesticide is legally applied during
the term of, and in accordance with, the provisions of the experimental use permit and temporary tolerances. These
tolerances may be revoked if the experimental use permit is revoked or if any experience with or scientific data on
this pesticide indicate that such revocation is necessary to protect the public health. 
The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this notice from the requirement of section 3 of Executive Order 12866.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice announces Agency approval of an application 
submitted by Rohm and Haas Company to conditionally register the pesticide product Anti-Foulant C-9211M containing
a new active ingredient not included in any previously registered product pursuant to the provisions of section 3(c)(7)(C)
of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), as amended. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 EPA issued a notice published in the 

Federal Register

 of November 16, 1983 (48 FR 52124), which announced that Rohm and Haas Co., Independence Mall West, Philadelphia,
PA 19105, had submitted an application to register the pesticide product Anti-Foulant C-9211M (EPA File Symbol 707-RTL)
containing the active ingredients 4,5-dichloro-2-

n

-octyl-3(2

H

)-isothiazolone~ at 35.0 percent and 4-chloro-2-

n

-octyl-3-(2

H

)-isothiazolone at 5.0 percent, active ingredients not included in any previously registered product. 

~

This application ~was approved on February 28, 1994, as Anti-Foulant C-9211M, containing the active ingredient
4,5-dichloro-2-

n

-octyl-3(2

H

)-isothiazolone~~ at 30.0 percent, (EPA Registration Number 707-175) for use in the formulation of marine
antifoulant paints. 
A conditional registration may be granted under section 3(c)(7)(C) of FIFRA for a new active ingredient where certain
data are lacking because a period reasonably sufficient for generation of the data has not elapsed since the Administrator
first imposed the data requirements, on condition that such data are received by the end of the conditional registration
period and do not meet or exceed the risk criteria set forth in 40 CFR 154.7; that use of the pesticide during the conditional
registration period will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment; and that use of the pesticide
is in the public interest. 

The Agency has considered the available data on the risks associated with the proposed use of 4,5-dichloro-2-

n

-octyl-3(2

H

)-isothiazolone~~,~~ and information on social, economic, and environmental benefits to be derived from such use.
Specifically, the Agency has considered the nature of the chemical and its pattern of use, application methods and
rates, and level and extent of potential exposure. Based on these reviews, the Agency was able to make basic health
and safety determinations which show that use of ~~~4,5-dichloro-2-

n

-octyl-3(2

H

)-isothiazolone during the period of conditional registration is not expected to cause any unreasonable adverse
effect on the environment, and that use of the pesticide is in the public interest. 

This conditional registration has been issued even though at this time, no additional ecological effects and environmental
fate data will be required for this manufacturing use product. However, additional requirements for environmental
fate and ecological effects data are being held in reserve pending the review of leaching studies and will be requested
for this manufacturing use product. The leaching from the matrix data will be required for end-use formulators. The
data only supports the formulation of marine antifloulant paints for boats and vessels only. If these conditions
are not complied with, the registration will be subject to cancellation in accordance with FIFRA section 6(e). 

Consistent with section 3(c)(7)(C), the Agency has determined that this conditional registration is in the public
interest. Use of the pesticides are of significance to the user community, and appropriate labeling, use directions,
and other measures have been taken to ensure that use of the pesticides will not result in unreasonable adverse effects
to man and the environment. 
More detailed information on this conditional registration is contained in an EPA Pesticide Fact Sheet on ~~~4,5-dichloro-2-

n

-octyl-3(2

H

)-isothiazolone~.

A copy of the fact sheet, which provides a summary description of the chemical, use patterns and formulations, science
findings, and the Agency's regulatory position and rationale, may be obtained from the National Technical Information
Service (NTIS), 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161. 

In accordance with section 3(c)(2) of FIFRA, a copy of the approved label and the list of data references used to support
registration are available for public inspection in the office of the Product Manager listed above. The data and other
scientific information used to support registration, except for material specifically protected by section 10
of FIFRA, are available for public inspection in the Public Response and Program Resources Branch, Field Operations
Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, Rm. 1132, CM #2, Arlington, VA
22202 (703-305-5805). Requests for data must be made in accordance with the provisions of the Freedom
of Information Act and must be addressed to the Freedom of Information Office (A-101), 401 M St., SW., Washington,

Public notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In order to facilitate the discharge of its responsibilities as a conservator and liquidator of insured depository
institutions, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) publishes the following notice. The publication
of this notice is intended to comply with Title 16, Section 20 of the Oklahoma Statutes (16 O.S. 20) which, in part, declares
Federal agencies that publish notices in the 

Federal Register

 concerning their promulgation of powers of attorney, to be exempt from the statutory requirement of having to record
such powers of attorney in every county in which the agencies wish to effect the conveyance or release of interests
in land.


Notice



Purusant to Section 11 of the Federal Deposit Insurance (FDI) Act (12 U.S.C. 1821), as amended by Section 212 of the
Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), the FDIC is empowered to act as conservator
or receiver of any state or federally chartered depository institution which it insures. Furthermore, under Section
11A of the FDI Act (12 U.S.C. 1821a), as enacted under Section 215 of FIRREA, the FDIC is also appointed to manage the
FSLIC Resolution Fund.

Upon appointment as a conservator or receiver, the FDIC by operation of law becomes successor in title to the assets
of the depository institutions on behalf of which it is appointed. As a Manager of the FSLIC Resolution Fund, the FDIC
became successor in title to both the corporate assets formerly owned by the now defunct Federal Savings and Loan Insurance
Corporation (FSLIC), as well as to the assets of the depository institutions for which the FSLIC was appointed receiver
prior to January 1, 1989. In addition, pursuant to Section 13(c) of the FDI Act (12 U.S.C. 1823(c)), the FDIC also acquires
legal title in its corporate capacity to assets acquired in furtherance of providing monetary assistance to prevent
the closing of insured depository institutions or to expedite the acquisition by assuming depository institutions
of assets and liabilities from closed depository institutions of which the FDIC is receiver.


In order to facilitate the conservation and liquidation of assets held by the FDIC in its aforementioned capacities,
the FDIC has provided powers of attorney to selected employees of its Southwest Service Center Office. These employees
include: Jeffrey C. Conwell, Lawrence O. Greer, John Sears, Tommy K. Sears and John Vernon.

Each employee to whom a power of attorney has been issued is authorized and empowered to: Sign, seal and deliver as the
act and deed of the FDIC any instrument in writing, and to do every other thing necessary and proper for the collection
and recovery of any and all monies and properties of every kind and nature whatsoever for and on behalf of the FDIC and
to give proper receipts and acquittances therefor in the name and on behalf of the FDIC; release, discharge or assign
any and all judgments, mortgages on real estate or personal property (including the release and discharge of the same
of record in the office of any Prothonotary or Register of Deeds wherever located where payments on account of the same
in redemption or otherwise may have been made by the debtor(s)), and to endorse receipt of such payment upon the records
in any appropriate public office; receipt, collect and give all proper acquittances for any other sums of money owing
to the FDIC for any acquired asset which the attorney-in-fact may sell or dispose of; execute any and all transfers
and assignments as may be necessary to assign any securities or other choses in action; sign, seal, acknowledge and
deliver any and all agreements as shall be deemed necessary or proper by the attorney-in-fact in the care and management
of acquired assets; sign, seal, acknowledge and delivery indemnity agreements and surety bonds in the name of and
on behalf of the FDIC; sign receipts for the payment of all rents and profits due or to become due on acquired assets;
execute, acknowledge and deliver deeds of real property in the name of the FDIC; extend, postpone, release and satisfy
or take such other action regarding any mortgage lien held in the name of the FDIC; execute, acknowledge and deliver
in the name of the FDIC a power or attorney wherever necessary or required by law to any attorney employed by the FDIC;
foreclosed any mortgage or other lien on either real or personal property, wherever located; do and perform every
act necessary for the use, liquidation or collection of acquired assets held in the name of the FDIC; and sign, seal,

Policy Statement on Payment System Risk


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board) has approved a modification to its Policy Statement on
Payment System Risk regarding net debit caps. Specifically, the Board has approved that the multiple associated
with the de minimis net debit cap be doubled from 20 to 40 percent of risk-based capital. In addition, the Board approved
administrative counseling flexibility for institutions that continue to exceed their net debit caps due to the posting
of non-Fedwire transactions. Under this flexibility, the Reserve Banks will work with affected institutions on
means of avoiding daylight overdrafts, but will not subject these institutions to routine counseling for daylight
overdrafts.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Board has established a Payment System Risk Policy Statement pursuant to its authority under the Federal Reserve
Act. 12 U.S.C. 221 

et seq. 

In October 1993, the Federal Reserve implemented a set of intraday posting rules for debits and credits affecting
depository institution accounts with Reserve Banks. The posting rules provide for the posting of non-Fedwire transactions
at specific times during the day, in addition to the posting of Fedwire funds and securities transfers as they occur
throughout the day. In contrast, according to the posting rules that were in effect prior to last October, non-Fedwire
payments for each depository institution were netted and, if a net credit resulted, the amount was posted to the institution's
Federal Reserve account as of the opening of business and, if a net debit, as of the close of business. 


Prior to implementation of the new posting rules, about 200 institutions, on average, exceeded their daylight overdraft
caps during any given two-week reserve maintenance period. Immediately following implementation of the new posting
rules, this number increased to between 1200 and 1500 institutions per period. In anticipation of this increase,
the Board adopted a ``transition period'' for routine administrative counseling in order to provide institutions
with a period of time to implement changes to their Federal Reserve account management procedures in order to reduce
the incidence of daylight overdrafts in excess of daylight overdraft caps. Following nearly one year of ``transition,''
about 750 to 800 institutions per period still typically exceed their caps. 
The new posting rules were intended, in large part, to support the assessment of daylight overdraft fees, which began
on April 14, 1994. The posting rules were developed by the Board over a three-year period and included two separate
requests for public comment. 
In developing the new posting rules, four general principles were established. First, the intraday posting rules
were designed not to generate intraday float. The old posting rules typically created approximately $30 billion
in intraday float. Second, the new posting rules were to permit depository institutions to anticipate precisely
when transactions would be posted to their account. Under the old posting rules, an institution would not know until
after the close of business whether the net of all non-Fedwire activity was a credit or a debit and, accordingly, whether
the netted amount would be posted as of the opening or closing of business. Third, the posting rules were designed to
be consistent with the legal rights and responsibilities of depository institutions. Under this principle, check
debits would not be posted to an institution's account prior to presentment of the checks. Finally, the new posting
rules were intended to be competitively neutral. That is, neither the Reserve Banks nor private sector providers
of correspondent banking services should be artificially advantaged by the new posting rules. 
Under these principles, the debit to an institution for any payment is posted at the same time as the credit is posted
to the account of the counterparty to the transaction. The exception to this guideline is for check transactions where,
by virtue of the nature of check processing, it is not possible to match debits and credits on a transaction-by-transaction
basis throughout the day. In addition, because checks should not be debited prior to presentment, a single time for
all check debits and credits would necessarily be later in the day than many depository institutions believed appropriate.
Therefore, debits for checks presented to depository institutions are posted on the next clock hour at least one hour
following presentment, beginning at 11:00 a.m., Eastern Time. Credits for check deposits are either posted (1) at
a single, float-weighted posting time or (2) at multiple times throughout the day, beginning at 11:00 a.m., Eastern
Time, using a set of fractions that are based upon Reserve Bank check collection experience. For check credits, depository
institutions are permitted to select either option, based upon which alternative best meets their needs. Currently,
the earliest float-weighted posting time (Option 1), which enables an institution to have full use of check deposit
credits, is 11:45 a.m. Eastern Time. 
On average over a day, these check posting rules result in a minimal amount of intraday check float. At specific points
in time during the day, however, the check posting rules appear to be giving rise to as much as $20 billion in ``credit
float,'' whereby the Reserve Banks have posted debits to depository institution accounts prior to providing corresponding
credits on check transactions to other institutions. The impact of this float, and the measured daylight overdrafts
it creates, appears to be falling primarily on smaller depository institutions.

Under the old posting rules, smaller institutions seldom incurred significant daylight overdrafts and, thus, were
able to make use of the ``exempt from filing'' or ``de minimis'' daylight overdraft caps without incurring a significant
number of cap breaches. Under the new posting rules, however, on average over four recent reserve maintenance periods,
600 of the 775 total institutions with daylight overdrafts in excess of their caps were institutions that had ``exempt
from filing'' or ``de minimis'' daylight overdraft caps. An additional 159 institutions with a zero net debit cap
had cap breaches. 
The ``exempt from filing'' cap permits an institution to incur daylight overdrafts up to the lesser of $10 million
or 20 percent of risk-based capital. The exempt cap does not require any action by the board of directors of the depository
institution or the filing of any documentation with its Reserve Bank. As additional flexibility, an exempt-from-filing
institution may incur up to two daylight overdrafts in two consecutive two-week reserve maintenance periods before
it is in violation of the Board's payments system risk (PSR) policy.

1

 In order to incur higher daylight overdrafts, an institution may file a resolution of its board of directors requesting
a de minimis cap, which permits daylight overdrafts up to 20 percent of risk-based capital. To be permitted even larger
amounts of intraday credit, up to 2.25 times risk-based capital on a single day, the institution must undertake a self-assessment
of creditworthiness, intraday funds management and control, and customer credit policies and controls to support
a higher daylight overdraft cap. 




An institution that regularly exceeds its cap is subject to progressively higher levels of administrative counseling
by its Reserve Bank. Under current guidelines, a depository institution that continues to exceed its daylight overdraft
cap ultimately may be assigned a zero cap and be placed on the real-time monitor. In this situation, a depository institution
will be prevented from originating Fedwire funds transfers that would cause, or increase, a daylight overdraft.

The Board's policy on daylight overdraft caps is intended to address intraday risk to the Federal Reserve arising
from daylight overdrafts. However, most non-Fedwire activity poses primarily interday, rather than intraday,
risk. Escalated counseling, including real-time monitoring, for non-Fedwire-caused daylight overdrafts may
be of limited usefulness in reducing these overdrafts. In addition, most of the daylight overdrafts caused by implementation
of the new posting rules would not result in the assessment of daylight overdraft charges, owing to the deductible
permitted in computing such charges. 
Current alternatives available to a depository institution to address the situation where it routinely exceeds
its daylight overdraft cap include: (1) filing for a ``self-assessment'' cap, (2) shifting funding patterns or delaying
the origination of funds transfers, (3) selecting the ``fractional'' check posting option in order to begin receiving
some check credits earlier than the single, float-weighted posting time, (4) having check debits posted to the account
of a correspondent bank, or (5) transferring payment processing business to a private correspondent bank. It should
be noted that filing for a self-assessment cap is an alternative available only to financially healthy institutions
and presents an increased administrative burden to these institutions. In addition, many of the small institutions
adversely affected by the posting rules have a limited amount of Fedwire funds transfer activity. Thus adjustments
to such Fedwire activity may have a minimal impact on such institutions' level of daylight overdrafts. Similarly,
a correspondent bank may be unable to provide funding to respondents earlier in the day without adversely affecting
its own daylight overdraft position. 


Alternatives 


 The Board considered three alternatives to address cap breaches attributable to the changes in the intraday posting
rules for non-Fedwire activity: (1) increasing the size of the multiples associated with daylight overdraft net
debit caps, (2) adopting, on a permanent basis, counseling flexibility for daylight overdrafts caused by non-Fedwire
activity, or (3) changing the posting rules. Each of these alternatives is discussed below. 


Caps 


The Board analyzed various scenarios to determine whether the level of exempt-from-filing or de minimis cap categories
could be increased without materially increasing risk to Reserve Banks. An increase in the exempt-from-filing daylight
overdraft cap category would require no action on the part of a depository institution, with a potentially substantial
percentage increase in intraday credit to be granted to that depository institution by the Federal Reserve. The Board
believes that any increase in the size of caps, without a self-assessment, should be made in the de minimis cap, which
requires the filing of a board of directors' resolution. This approach will ensure that senior bank management and
directors are aware of the potential amount of credit that may be obtained by the depository institution from the Federal
Reserve during the day.

In studying increases in cap levels, the Board was mindful of the existing structure of cap categories that require
a self-assessment. For example, an ``average'' cap permits daylight overdrafts, on average over a reserve maintenance
period, up to 75 percent of an institution's risk-based capital. In order not to diminish the relevance of an ``average''
cap, which can be obtained by an institution only after conducting a full self-assessment, the Board believes the
cap multiple for the de minimis cap should not approach 75 percent. 
At a level of 40 percent of risk-based capital, however, between 85 and 90 percent of cap breaches by institutions that
currently have exempt or de minimis caps would be eliminated, assuming certain exempt-from-filing institutions
file a board of directors' resolution adopting a de minimis cap. Diminishing reductions in cap breaches by institutions
with exempt and de minimis caps are achieved with cap levels beyond 40 percent, with an associated lessening of the
relative benefits of a self-assessed cap. Cap levels below 40 percent do not yield a sufficient reduction in cap breaches
to warrant any increase at all in the level of the de minimis cap. 
It should be noted that any increase in the size of net debit caps, in addition to providing capacity to cover current
cap breaches caused by the posting rules, would also increase the intraday capacity for daylight overdrafts resulting
from irrevocable Fedwire funds and book-entry securities transfers. The Board believes that, for the most part,
institutions with a de minimis net debit cap have a relatively limited amount of Fedwire activity and an increase in
daylight overdraft capacity will likely not increase significantly the risk exposure of the Reserve Banks. Moreover,
Reserve Banks have special procedures in place for dealing with risks posed by depository institutions in poor or
deteriorating financial condition. The Board has, therefore, approved an increase in the multiple associated with
the de minimis net debit cap from 20 percent to 40 percent of risk-based capital. 


Counseling 


As noted above, the Reserve Banks administratively counsel depository institutions that exceed their caps. For
cap categories other than the exempt-from-filing category, any daylight overdrafts in excess of a depository institution's
cap are subject to counseling by the Reserve Banks. For institutions with an exempt cap, however, only when an institution
incurs three or more daylight overdrafts in excess of its cap within a four-week period would it be subject to counseling.
The Board reviewed this frequency measure to determine whether an increase may be feasible. 
By increasing the number of permissible daylight overdrafts in excess of the exempt cap from two in two consecutive
two-week reserve maintenance periods to four in two consecutive two-week reserve maintenance periods, 79 percent
of the institutions with exempt-from-filing caps that had cap breaches would not be subject to counseling by their
Reserve Banks. A significant concern with increasing the permissible occurrences of cap breaches, however, is that
there is currently no size limitation on the size of those cap breaches. The Board also believes that increases in the
number of non-counselable daylight overdrafts effectively increases the amount of intraday credit that may be used
by an institution. Should the Federal Reserve decide to increase the amount of intraday credit to be extended to depository
institutions, the Board believes it would be preferable to identify such an increase clearly through an increase
in the size of a cap, rather than an increase in the number of permissible excess daylight overdrafts. 
Another approach to minimize the administrative burden of counseling on both depository institutions and the Reserve
Banks is to exempt daylight overdrafts caused either by check transactions or all non-Fedwire transactions from
counseling. The Board believes, however, that separate treatment under the PSR policy of different types of payment
transactions is not desirable. For example, daylight overdrafts caused by book-entry securities transfers and
ACH transactions were initially excluded from counseling under the PSR policy. The Board decided in 1992 that all
transactions should be treated alike for daylight overdraft measurement purposes. In addition, counseling institutions
for some daylight overdrafts and not for others may lead to confusion, both within the Reserve Banks and at depository
institutions. 
Nonetheless, some degree of counseling flexibility may be appropriate. As noted above, the Reserve Banks have had
in place since October 1993 a policy of administering daylight overdraft counseling on a flexible basis, depending
upon whether cap breaches were attributable to the new posting rules. Continued counseling flexibility appears
to be desirable largely in dealing with institutions that have a zero daylight overdraft net debit cap as well as relatively
small institutions that, by the nature of their business, will continue to exceed a positive net debit cap even after
appropriate adjustments have been made. These institutions may have few alternatives for eliminating non-Fedwire
daylight overdrafts. The institutions that have zero caps for reasons related to their financial condition are typically
already on the real-time monitor in reject or pend mode. In addition, in some cases, zero cap institutions are also
required by the Reserve Banks to prefund certain payments or collateralize any daylight overdrafts. Routinely counseling
such institutions for overdrafts caused by non-Fedwire transactions lessens the credibility of the daylight overdraft
counseling program and appears to do little to lessen the actual risk to Reserve Banks. The Board has approved such
administrative counseling flexibility on an on-going basis. 


Posting Procedures 


Modifications to the intraday posting procedures would be another way to address the frequency of cap breaches by
small depository institutions. The Board believes any such modifications should be carefully weighed. The check
posting rules were adopted by the Board following a lengthy process involving two requests for public comment and
many discussions with the banking industry, as noted above. For example, the principle of the elimination of intraday
float for checks was specifically addressed through public comment in 1989. The new posting rules have now been in
place about one year and it is possible that institutions may still be adapting to those rules. In addition, changes
to these rules after such a short period of time may impose unanticipated costs associated with changing computer
programs on a large number of depository institutions.

<TEXT>
 

Further changes to the check posting rules may also lead to the creation of intraday float. As an example, a scheme whereby
check credits are posted at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time and check debits continue to be posted on the clock hour at least
one hour following presentment would generate as much as $23 billion in debit float at 11:00 a.m., and an average of
$6 billion in float over the course of the day. However, even this radical a change to the posting rules would not eliminate
a significant fraction of cap breaches caused by the implementation of the new posting rules. Many non-Fedwire-caused
cap breaches would continue due to the posting of ACH debit transactions, at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time, and net settlement
entries from private clearing houses, as determined by the individual settlement arrangements. Many small depository
institutions may continue to encounter difficulties in funding these transactions on a timely basis during the day.

Another possible change to the check posting rules would be to shift the first check debiting time from 11:00 a.m.,
Eastern Time to 11:00 a.m., Local Time. It was initially believed that such an approach might make the fractional check
crediting option more feasible for many institutions in the Central, Mountain, and Pacific time zones. Upon further
analysis, however, the Board determined that because of the later debiting times in western time zones, the corresponding
crediting times would shift later in the day as well, thereby lessening any positive benefit of the delayed check debits.

A final alternative is to establish a new set of posting rules for cap administration different from the posting rules
for the assessment of daylight overdraft fees. The Board does not believe such an approach would be desirable, as it
would likely lead to more, rather than less, of an administrative burden on small institutions and could create a significant
amount of confusion in the banking industry about the focus of the PSR initiative. 
The Board has, therefore, not elected to make any changes to the established intraday posting procedures at this time.

Section 7A of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C.  18a, as added by Title II of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements
Act of 1976, requires persons contemplating certain mergers or acquisitions to give the Federal Trade Commission

The following transactions were granted early termination of the waiting period provided by law and the premerger
notification rules. The grants were made by the Federal Trade Commission and the Assistant Attorney General for the

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Intent To Repatriate Cultural Items in the Possession of the USDA Forest Service </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 


 


Notice is hereby given under provisions of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of the intent
to repatriate cultural items in the possession of the Cibola National Forest, USDA Forest Service, that meet the definition
of ``sacred object'' under Section 2 of the Act. 
The items consist of 30 essentially complete prayer sticks of aspen and willow, 5 fragments of prayer sticks, one red
flicker feather, one cornhusk, and a small amount of deteriorating organic matter. The items were reportedly gathered
in 1977 or 1978 by an anonymous collector from a cairn/shrine on Mt. Taylor, NM. The items were returned to the possession
of the USDA Forest Service in 1991 or 1992. The precise location of the cairn/shrine is not known. 
The objects in this collection resemble the prayer sticks described and illustrated in Leslie A. White's 

The Acoma Indians

 (Smithsonian Institution, 1932: 126-129). Representatives of the Pueblo of Acoma have inspected the items
and confirm their identification as prayer sticks. The representatives of the Pueblo of Acoma indicate that prayer
sticks are left as offerings at a cairn/shrine located on Mt. Taylor as part of their traditional religious practice.
Once left as an offering, the Acoma religion requires that such prayer sticks not be disturbed. 
Reginald T. Pasqual, governor of the Pueblo of Acoma, has claimed the prayer sticks and associated materials as sacred
objects and requested their repatriation to the Pueblo of Acoma. The Hopi Tribe and the Navajo Nation have been consulted
and both support the claim of the Pueblo of Acoma to this particular collection of prayer sticks from Mt. Taylor. 
Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the USDA Forest Service have determined, pursuant to 25 U.S.C.
3001 (3)(C), that these items are specific ceremonial objects needed by the traditional religious leaders of the
Pueblo of Acoma for the practice of their traditional religion by its present day adherents. Officials of the USDA
Forest Service have further determined, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), that there is a relationship of shared group
identity which can be reasonably traced between these items and the Pueblo of Acoma. 
This notice has been sent to officials of the Pueblo of Acoma. Representatives of any other Indian tribe which believes
itself to be culturally affiliated with these cultural items should contact Dr. Frank E. Wozniak, NAGPRA Coordinator,
Southwestern Region, USDA Forest Service, 517 Gold Avenue, SW., Albuquerque, NM 87102, telephone: (505) 842-3238,
before December 2, 1994. Repatriation of these sacred objects to the Pueblo of Acoma may begin after that date if no
additional claimants come forward.

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Inventory Completion for Native American Human Remains From Blossvale, NY, in the Possession of the Rome
Historical Society, Rome, NY </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 


 


Notice is hereby given in accordance with provisions of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act,
25 U.S.C. 3003(d), of completion of the inventory of human remains from a site near Blossvale, NY, that are presently
in the possession of the Rome Historical Society, Rome, NY. 
A detailed inventory and assessment of these human remains has been made by Historical Society curatorial staff,
a contracted specialist in physical anthropology, and representatives of the Oneida Indian Nation (of New York)
and the Oneida Tribe of Indians of Wisconsin. 
In 1958, Mr. Willard Teelin discovered the human remains along with some associated funerary objects following a
flash flood in Fish Creek near Blossvale, NY. The director of the Fort Stanwix Museum, operated by the Rome Historical
Society, identified the human remains and associated funerary objects as belonging to the Owasco culture. Mr. Teelin
donated the human remains to the Rome Historical Society and retained possession of the associated funerary objects.
Mr. Teelin's descendants are not aware of the whereabouts of the associated funerary objects. Osteological examination
by Dr. Richard G. Wilkinson, Department of Anthropology, State University of New York-Albany, revealed that two
individuals are represented by the human remains. The first individual was approximately 35-40 years old at
the time of death. The second individual was approximately 16-20 years old at the time of death. Both are Native
American males from the prehistoric period. 

Inventory of the human remains and review of the accompanying documentation indicates that no known individuals
were identifiable. The Owasco culture is generally recognized in the archeological literature as being ancestral
to the five historically known Indian tribes of the Iroquois Confederacy: Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, and
Seneca. The Blossvale, NY, area in which the human remains were discovered is well within the historical boundaries
of lands claimed as Oneida territory. The Oneida Indian Nation (of New York) considers itself to be the descendant
of Native Americans who occupied central New York since time immemorial. Oneida Tribe of Indians of Wisconsin has
declined to submit a claim for repatriation of these human remains. 

Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the Rome Historical Society have determined that, pursuant
to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity which can be reasonably traced between these
human remains and associated funerary objects and the Oneida Indian Nation (of New York). 

This notice has been sent to officials of the Oneida Indian Nation (of New York) and the Oneida Tribe of Indians of Wisconsin.
Representatives of any other Indian tribe which believes itself to be culturally affiliated with these human remains
should contact Jon Austin, Executive Director, Rome Historical Society, 200 Church Street, Rome, NY 13440, telephone:
(315) 336-5870, before December 2, 1994. Repatriation of these human remains to the Oneida Indian Nation (of
New York) may begin after that date if no additional claimants come forward.

<USBUREAU>Drug Enforcement Administration</USBUREAU>


John Thomas Morrison, D.P.M.; Revocation of Registration


On March 2, 1994, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA), issued an Order on Show Cause to John Thomas Morrison, D.P.M., of Port Orchard, Washington, proposing to revoke
his DEA Certificate of Registration, AM2446006, and to deny any pending applications for registration as a practitioner.
21 U.S.C. 823(f) (1992). The basis for the Order to Show Cause was that Dr. Morrison lacked authority to handle controlled
substances in the State of Washington. 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(3).
The Order to Show Cause was personally served on Dr. Morrison by DEA investigators on March 2, 1994. More than thirty
days have passed since the Order to Show Cause was served on Dr. Morrison. The Drug Enforcement Administration has
received no response from Dr. Morrison or anyone purporting to represent him. Therefore, pursuant to 21 CFR 1301.54(d),
the Deputy Administrator finds that Dr. Morrison has waived his opportunity for a hearing on the issues raised by the
Order to Show Cause. The Deputy Administrator has carefully considered the investigative file in this matter and
enters his final order based on the provisions of 21 CFR 1301.54(e) and 1301.57.
The Deputy Administrator finds that on May 7, 1993, the State of Washington Department of Health Podiatric Medical
Board (Podiatric Board) found that Dr. Morrison had engaged in unprofessional conduct. As a result the Podiatric
Board revoked Dr. Morrison's privilege to practice podiatric medicine and surgery in the State of Washington and
revoked his privilege to prescribe controlled substances. Accordingly, Dr. Morrison is not authorized to administer,
dispense, prescribe, or otherwise handle controlled substances in the State of Washington wherein he is registered
with the DEA.
The Deputy Administrator has consistently held that DEA cannot maintain the registration of a practitioner who is
without State authority to handle controlled substances. 

Nathaniel S. Lehrman, M.D.

Franz A. Arakaky, M.D.

see also Elliot Monroe, M.D., 

57 FR 23246 (1992) and 

Bobby Watts, M.D.

, 53 FR 11920 (1987).
Based on the foregoing, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration concludes that Dr. Morrison's
DEA registration must be revoked. 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(3). Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator, pursuant to the authority
vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104 (59 FR 23637), hereby orders that DEA Certificate
of Registration, AM2446006, previously issued to John Thomas Morrison, D.P.M., be, and it hereby is, revoked, and
that any pending applications for renewal of such registration, be, and they hereby are, denied.
This order is effective November 2, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 






NRC Generic Letter XXXX: Reconsideration of Nuclear Power Plant Requirements Associated With an Internal Threat.




Addressees




All holders of operating licenses or construction permits for nuclear power reactors.




Purpose



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing this generic letter to notify you that it is reconsidering
its positions concerning certain security measures to protect against an internal threat at nuclear power plants.
It is expected that recipients will review the information for applicability to their facilities and consider actions,
as appropriate. However, suggestions contained in this generic letter are not NRC requirements; therefore, no specific
action or written response is required.




Background





The fitness-for-duty rule (10 CFR Part 26) published on June 7, 1989, required power reactor licensees to implement
fitness-for-duty programs. The access authorization rule (10 CFR 73.56) published on April 25, 1991, required power
reactor licensees to implement access authorization programs. One objective of these regulations was to ensure
the reliability and trustworthiness of persons granted unescorted access to protected areas at power reactor facilities.
In light of these regulations, the NRC evaluated security requirements for protection against the insider threat
at nuclear power plants to verify that they remain appropriate. The staff discussed the initial results of this review
in SECY 92-272, ``Re-examination of Nuclear Power Plant Security Requirements Associated With the Internal
Threat,'' of August 4, 1992. The staff then recommended reducing or eliminating certain security requirements that
gave marginal protection against the insider threat.

The Commission reviewed SECY 92-292 and asked the staff to re-visit the subject and explore alternatives for
allowing reductions in unnecessary or marginally effective security measures. The staff discussed the results
of this re-evaluation in SECY 93-326, ``Reconsideration of Nuclear Power Plant Security Requirements Associated
with an Internal Threat,'' December 2, 1993.




Description of Circumstances




In a staff requirements memorandum of February 18, 1994, the Commission endorsed staff recommendations to (1) issue
generic correspondence informing licensees of the opportunity to revise certain commitments in their security
plan and (2) proceed with rulemaking regarding specific changes to reduce or eliminate certain security requirements.
This generic letter discusses those areas in which licensees may choose to revise their plans.




Discussion



NRC may accept changes to a licensee security plan in the following four areas:

<DOCNO> FR941102-2-00080 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941102-2-00061 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(I) Vital Area Access Control Measures


NRC may accept the changes to vital area (VA) access control measures in security plans discussed below upon confirmation
that (1) certain other site-specific measures are in place or will be implemented to demonstrate (e.g., through contingency
drills) a capability, including a protective strategy, to protect against an external adversary after making any
of the changes and (2) measures are in place to examine hand-carried packages for explosives using equipment specifically
designed for that purpose.


A. Compensatory Measures


1. Eliminate compensatory measures for failure of vital area mechanical lock hardware if the access control hardware
and alarms are operable.
2. Extend the timeliness requirements for implementing compensatory measures for 

any

 malfunctioning element of the vital area access control system from 10 minutes to a period similar to that which technical
specifications permit for safety equipment to be out of service while the plant is in Mode 1 until required to be in Mode
3.
The licensee could extend the time to implement compensatory measures only if either the VA door lock or alarms are
operable. The most restrictive limiting condition for the timeliness of the compensatory measure(s) would be the
most restrictive safety equipment in the vital areas accessed by the VA door needing compensatory measures.


B. Maintenance of Discrete Vital Area Access Lists


Eliminate separate access authorization lists for 

each 

vital area of the facility. As an alternative, maintain a single list of persons who have access to any vital area. This
list would have to be revised as status of persons changes in order to maintain its accuracy, especially for removing
vital area access authorization from individuals.


C. Alarm Response



Modify the response to vital area access control alarms (doors). Response would only be needed to vital area access
control alarms that coincide with an unresolved alarm at the protected area perimeter, a known intrusion, or a constant
alarm, such as that caused by an open door.


D. Locked Condition of Door 


Although locking mechanisms and access control systems, including door alarms, would be retained, doors to vital
areas could be left unlocked. A licensee choosing this option would be expected to have the capability to remotely
lock the door(s) from both alarm stations, as necessary, in response to an external threat. Licensees choosing this
option would be expected to demonstrate, as part of the demonstration of their capability to protect against an external
adversary, the ability to remotely lock doors in time to delay the adversary where delay was essential in the protective
strategy. Access control systems retained on vital area doors would continue to maintain a record of personnel access
and generate alarms if the door was open without a proper access.
The process for licensees to revise their security plans to implement the changes to security measures in vital areas
will depend on the content of their present security plans. Since these changes would reduce slightly the effectiveness
of the security program, most changes would need to be processed in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR 50.90.
Some of the changes may be processed by an exemption request or in accordance with 10 CFR 50.54(p). If appropriate,
changes in security plans should include commitments to the measures described in paragraph (I) above. To ensure
unrestricted emergency access, the NRC staff notes the advantages of (1) having the ability to remotely unlock doors
to vital areas from each alarm station, (2) ensuring that malfunctions result in doors failing unlocked rather than
locked, and (3) allowing all operators and auxiliary operators to carry metal keys that can override keycard-operated
lock mechanisms.


(II) Access Search of On-duty Armed Security Guards


NRC may accept changes to allow armed security officers who (1) are on duty and carry a weapon in accordance with assigned
duties, (2) have already been searched during their current shift, and (3) have left the protected area on official
business, to reenter the protected area without being subject to the metal detector searches (but still be subjected
to explosive searches). If search equipment is a single unit containing both metal and explosive detection equipment,
alarms from the metal detector may be disregarded. This change could be made to security plans in accordance with 10
CFR 50.54(p).


(III) Containment Access Control Measures


NRC may accept changes to allow persons other than security personnel, provided they are appropriately trained in
access control procedures in accordance with the security plan, to control access for personnel and materials entering
the containment any time frequent access is permitted to the containment. This change could be made to security plans
in accordance with 10 CFR 50.54(p).


(IV) Alternative Measures for Control of Security Badges


NRC may accept changes to allow for alternative approaches for accountability of picture badges used for unescorted
access so that certain types of badges may be taken outside the protected area. Alternative approaches need to include
the ability to ensure positive identification of individuals upon entry to the protected area and to ensure the badge
is disabled of its access function when taken out of the protected area. For employees, such changes can be made under
10 CFR 50.54(p) because the regulations currently allow licensee employees to take badges off site. Changes to security
plans to allow contractors to take security picture badges off site would require a request for exemption from the
provisions of 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5). Coincident with receiving approval of the exemption request, the licensee would
be able to implement the change in accordance with 10 CFR 50.54(p).
This generic letter requires no specific action or written response.

I. Background



The Proposed PRA Policy Statement



To establish top-level guidance on the use of PRA in nuclear regulatory activities and aid in development of a detailed
PRA Implementation Plan, the NRC staff proposed a policy statement regarding the use of PRA in regulatory activities.
The policy statement would articulate the Commission's position on the role of PRA in various regulatory programs
and would communicate that position to the NRC staff, the public, licensees, and applicants for licenses.

The NRC staff discussed its recommendations for a PRA policy statement in SECY-94-218, ``Proposed Policy
Statement on the Use of Probabilistic Risk Assessment Methods in Nuclear Regulatory Activities.'' In SECY-94-218,
the staff stated that an overall policy on the use of PRA in nuclear regulatory activities should be established so
that the many potential applications of PRA can be implemented in a consistent and predictable manner that promotes
regulatory stability and efficiency. In addition, the staff stated that the use of PRA technology in NRC regulatory
activities should be increased. The increased use of PRA methods and technology is intended to complement and enhance
deterministic-based regulations by using PRA technology in activities where methods and data are well understood.
The staff believes the increased use of PRA technology would lead to improved risk-effective safety decisions and
more focused and efficient use of NRC staff and industry resources.

The Commission concludes that increased use of PRA techniques as an integral part of the regulatory decision-making
process is now justified. Consequently, the Commission has proposed a policy to encourage the use of PRA and to expand
the scope of PRA applications in nuclear regulatory matters to the extent supported by the state-of-the-art methods
and data. An important aspect of the expanded use of PRA technology would be a strengthening of NRC's defense-in-depth
philosophy by helping to identify and address weaknesses or overly conservative regulatory requirements for the
physical and functional barriers. In its Staff Requirements Memorandum of October 4, 1994, the Commission directed
the staff to revise the proposed policy statement and publish the proposed policy statement for public comment. The
proposed PRA Policy Statement is scheduled to be published in the 

Federal Register 

in November 1994 for a 60-day public comment period.

The PRA Implementation Plan





The PRA Implementation Plan was developed in parallel with the Proposed PRA Policy Statement to ensure that the increased
use of PRA methods and technology in nuclear regulatory activities would be implemented in a consistent and predictable
manner that promotes regulatory stability and efficiency. This PRA Implementation Plan is a ``living'' document
that provides the framework for NRC management oversight of the use of PRA methods and technology in regulatory activities.



As previously discussed, PRA methods have been applied successfully in numerous nuclear regulatory activities
and have proven to be a valuable complement to deterministic engineering approaches. However, the increased use
of PRA in nuclear regulatory activities has broad implications and could result in changes in many areas associated
with our current regulatory framework. These areas, considered by the staff in developing the draft PRA Implementation
Plan, may include: Changes to regulations, guidance documents and inspection programs, a substantial shift in staff
resources including recruiting and training programs to provide the necessary PRA expertise, an increased emphasis
on continued development of PRA methods and decision-making tools, and enhanced reliability data collection. As
discussed in SECY-94-218, the expanded use of PRA in nuclear regulatory activities may raise additional
policy, technical, and legal issues that will be considered in subsequent modifications to the PRA Implementation
Plan.




Principal Issues Related to Increasing Use of Risk Assessment





Four principal issues associated with applying risk assessment methods and techniques to regulatory applications
are highlighted in the PRA Implementation Plan. These issues included development of regulatory decision-making
criteria, collection and analysis of equipment and human performance data, development and use of consistent PRA
models and methods, and development of a systemic PRA training program.



To ensure consistent and appropriate decision-making that incorporates PRA methods and results, it is crucial that
coherent and clear criteria are applied. As part of this plan, decision criteria will be established that address
the interdependence of probabilistic risk and deterministic engineering principles. The process of developing
these criteria will involve communications among the NRC, the nuclear industry, and the public to ensure an understanding
by all parties of the role of PRA methods and results in NRC's risk management efforts.



The NRC staff uses equipment performance data in the conduct of PRAs, reliability analyses, component failure studies,
plant aging studies, identification and resolution of generic issues, preparation for inspections, and reviews
of technical specifications change requests. For these purposes, the staff uses generic data supplemented with
a limited amount of plant-specific data. The use of the generic data can be problematic because the data have not been
verified or updated and do not differentiate between plant-to-plant variations in performance or changes in performance
as reactor plants age. The ad hoc collection of plant-specific data is costly and inefficient.

<PARENT> FR941102-2-00063 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The availability of human performance data is even more problematic. One reason is the lack of established and accepted
human performance analysis methods and models upon which to base the collection of human performance data. This is
particularly important in the analysis of operator performance in response to events during which both acts of omission
and commission may occur. Human reliability methods and data are currently the focus of research and limited evaluations
of human performance issues raised by analysis of operating reactor events.
As the NRC and the nuclear reactor industry move toward greater use of PRA, the need for better data on human performance,
plant-specific safety system availability data (at the system train level), and equipment reliability data will
be required to continue to increase the role of PRA in the regulatory decision-making process. Increased availability
of data on equipment and human performance is very important to implementing many risk-based regulation initiatives.
For example, this information is essential for implementing the maintenance rule and in supporting the development
of risk-based technical specifications.
The NRC staff recognizes the need to collect equipment and human performance data. This information, derived largely
from operating experience, will continue to provide a source of credible performance data for NRC use in the regulatory
process.
The NRC PRA Working Group identified the need for the development and use of consistent PRA models and methods. Several
tasks that are now being undertaken include the development of more user-friendly computer interfaces; the development
of low-power and shutdown models, external events models, and Level 2/3 PRA models compatible with the needs of NRC
events assessment staff; and the development of methods for consistently identifying the appropriate detailed
PRA model for use in the analysis of individual events or issues.
It is important to note that not all of the NRC's risk management activities lend themselves to a risk analysis approach
that uses a probabilistic, fault free methodology. The NRC recognizes that a single approach to risk management is
not appropriate. As part of the PRA Implementation Plan the NRC will develop and validate risk assessment models and
methods.
Another issue is the training of the staff who will not be directly working with PRA methods. As the NRC shifts to grater
use of, and reliance on, PRA methods and risk-based regulation, all technical staff members, including inspectors,
will need to develop an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of PRA methods and their use. The PRA Implementation
Plan includes an extensive training program. This training program is based on the systems approach to training,
which includes completing job task analyses, developing learning objectives, developing and delivering courses,
evaluating trainee mastery of objectives, and modifying the PRA training program as necessary. Because the number
of NRC staff members who will need training is large, a large resource commitment over the next several years will be
required.
The PRA Implementation Plan will require users and developers of the new methods to have significant experience in
PRA methods and statistics. It will take time for these staff members to gain the necessary experience. Some of the
knowledge and skills needed to do this work can be obtained though traditional training. However, on-the-job training,
classroom instruction, and industrial experience will be needed in order to acquire some of the required knowledge
and experience. Recruiting of outside experts and intensified development of current staff members will likely
be necessary to gain this staff experience. This process will take several years to accomplish and will be a major factor
in the success of the PRA Implementation Plan and in establishing the pace of its implementation.

time limits may be adjusted depending on the number of presentations and comments. The workshop will be transcribed,
and the transcript will be available in the NRC Public Document Room.
To foster meaningful discussions during this session and to aid participants in preparing their presentations and
comments, participants should consider the following set of questions:
 What additional areas should be considered regarding the increased use of PRA in regulatory applications?
 What areas currently in the PRA Implementation Plan require additional emphasis? What areas are emphasized
too much?
 Is the overall impact of the PRA Policy Statement on regulatory activities clearly evident by the activities
in the PRA Implementation Plan?
 What impact will the PRA Policy Statement and the PRA Implementation Plan have on those organizations that
the NRC regulates?

<DOCTITLE>Regulatory Guides; Issuance, Availability</DOCTITLE>


The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has issued revisions to three guides in its Regulatory Guide Series. This series
has been developed to describe and make available to the public such information as methods acceptable to the NRC staff
for implementing specific parts of the Commission's regulations, techniques used by the staff in evaluating specific
problems or postulated accidents, and data needed by the staff in its review of applications for permits and licenses.
Revision 30 of Regulatory Guide 1.84, ``Design and Fabrication code Case Acceptability, ASME Section III,'' and
Revision 30 of Regulatory Guide 1.85, ``materials Code Case Acceptability, ASME Section III, Division 1,'' list
those code cases that are generally acceptable to the NRC staff for implementation in the licensing of light-water-cooled
nuclear power plants. Revision 11 of Regulatory Guide 1.147, ``Inservice Inspection code Case Acceptability, ASME
Section XI, Division 1,'' lists those code cases that are generally acceptable to the NRC staff for implementation
in the inserve inspection of light-water-cooled nuclear power plants. These three guides are periodically revised
to update the listings of acceptable code cases and to include the results of public comment and additional staff review.

Comments and suggestions with items for inclusion in guides currently being developed or improvements in all published
guides are encouraged at any time. Written comments may be submitted to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division
of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,

<DOCTITLE>Florida Power and Light Company; Turkey Point Unit Nos. 3 and 4; Notice of Partial Denial of Amendment to Facility Operating
License and Opportunity for Hearing</DOCTITLE>


The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has denied a portion of an amendment request by the Florida Power and
Light Company (FPL or the licensee) for an amendment to Facility Operating License Nos. DPR-31 and DPR-41,
issued to the licensee for operation of the Turkey Point Plant, Units 3 and 4, located in Dade County, Florida. Notice
of Consideration of Issuance of this amendment was published in the 

Federal Register

 on March 30, 1994 (59 FR 14889).
The purpose of the licensee's amendment request was to revise the Technical Specification (TS) to delete the frequencies
from the audits performed under the cognizance of the Company Nuclear Review Board (CNRB) and remove the audit of the
emergency and security plans and implementing procedures from TS. The audits would be performed at the frequency
specified in the FPL Topical Quality Assurance Report (TQAR). Some audits would be performed less frequently (biennial
rather than annual in most cases).
The NRC staff has concluded that the portion of the licensee's request regarding audits of the Fire Protection Program
cannot be granted for the reasons stated in letter dated October 26, 1994. The licensee was notified of the Commission's
denial of the proposed change by letter dated October 26, 1994.
By December 2, 1994, the licensee may demand a hearing with respect to the denial described above. Any person affected
by this proceeding may file a written petition for leave to intervene.
A request for hearing or petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear
Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC, 20555, Attention: Docketing and Service Branch, or may be delivered to the
Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above date.
A copy of any petitions should also be sent to the office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to Harold F. Reis, Esquire, Newman and Holtzinger, P.C., 1615 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20036, attorney for the licensee.
For further details with respect to this action, see (1) the application for amendments dated February 18, 1994, as
supplemented by letter dated August 5, 1994, and (2) the Commission's letter to the licensee dated October 26, 1994.
These documents are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building,
2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555 and at the Florida International University, University Park, Miami, Florida
33199. A copy of Item (2) may be obtained upon request addressed to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington,
DC 20555, Attention: Document Control Desk.

Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc.,
Relating to Storage of Customer Account Records



October 26, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 on September 7, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') a proposal to amend paragraph (c) of CBOE Rule 9.8, ``Supervision
of Accounts,'' and Interpretation and Policy .03
 to CBOE Rule 9.8 to enable members' supervisory offices to maintain certain customer account information at off-site
locations as long as the records are readily accessible and promptly retrievable.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941102-2-00091 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941102-2-00067 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The proposal was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34711 (September 23, 1994), 59 FR 50304
(October 3, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal.
Currently, CBOE Rule 9.8(c) provides that background and financial information of customers who have been approved
for options transactions must be maintained at both the branch office servicing the customer's account and at the
principal supervisory office with jurisdiction over the branch office. In addition, copies of options customer
account statements over the most recent six months must be maintained at both the branch office supervising the accounts
and at the principal supervisory office with jurisdiction over that branch. The CBOE proposes to amend CBOE Rule 9.8(c)
and Interpretation and Policy .03 to enable members' supervisory offices to maintain certain customer account information
at off-site locations as long as the records are readily accessible and promptly retrievable.
The CBOE states that the substance of CBOE Rule 9.8(c) appears uniformly in the rules of the other options exchanges
and in the options account rules of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD''). According to
the CBOE, on-site storage in major financial centers is expensive, and, in today's market environment, automated
and secure facilities for data storage and retrieval make it unnecessary to require on-site storage. The CBOE states
that, given those realities, the Options Self-Regulatory Council (``OSRC'')
 has recommended that record retention requirements be relaxed and that the exchanges and the NASD amend their rules
to permit supervisory offices to store customer records off-premises as a matter of routine practice.
 The CBOE concurs with the OSRC's recommendation and believes that its proposal will provide the CBOE's members with
the opportunity to discharge their supervisory responsibilities more efficiently and more cost-effectively.





The CBOE believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and furthers
the objectives of Section 6(b)(5), in particular, in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts
and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, and to protect investors and the public interest.
The Commission believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements
of Section 6(b)(5) in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to facilitate
transactions in securities, and to protect investors and the public interest.





Specifically, by allowing off-site storage of customer account information maintained at supervisory offices,
the Commission believes that the proposal should provide the CBOE's members with a cost-effective means to utilize
computers, facsimile machines, optical disks, and other technology to store the required customer account information
off-site while ensuring that member firms will continue to have easy access to all of the customer account information
necessary to discharge their supervisory responsibilities. In this regard, the proposal provides that options
customer account information stored off-site must be ``readily accessible and promptly retrievable,''
 thereby preserving the Exchange's ability to access and investigate customer account records. The Commission notes
that the designated options examining authorities, including the CBOE, have agreed to make periodic examinations
of the document retention and supervisory practices of firms using off-site storage arrangements. Thus, the Commission
believes that the proposal strikes a reasonable balance between the CBOE's interest in allowing member organizations
to reduce the cost of storing customer account information and ensuring that the information continues to be available
for supervisory purposes.




In addition, the Commission believes that it is reasonable for the CBOE to allow off-site storage of customer account
information maintained at supervisory offices, but not of account information stored at branch offices, because
branch offices are responsible for the day-to-day administration of customer accounts and require immediate access
to account information. For example, by continuing to require branch offices to store customer account information
on-site, the proposal facilitates broker compliance with the suitability requirements applicable to options customers.


It is therefore ordered,

 Pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-CBOE-94-30) is approved.



For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Changes by the New York Stock
Exchange and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange and Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed
Rule Change by the American Stock Exchange Relating to an Extension of Certain Market-Wide Circuit Breaker Provisions</DOCTITLE>



October 26, 1994.



I. Introduction



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act),
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 on October 5, 1994, the American Stock Exchange, Inc., on September 22, 1994, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE''),
and on September 12, 1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx''), respectively (each individually referred
to herein as an ``Exchange'' and two or more collectively referred to as ``Exchanges''), submitted to the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') proposed rule changes relating to extending certain market-wide circuit
breaker provisions. On September 30, 1994, the NYSE and the Phlx each filed an Amendment No. 1 to their respective proposals.
 The NYSE proposal was published for comment in the 

Federal Register 

on October 14, 1994,
 and the Phlx proposal was published for comment in the 

Federal Register 

on October 14, 1994.
 No comments were received on either of these proposed rule changes. This order approves the Exchanges' proposals
and the Exchanges' Amendments.









II. Description of Proposals



In 1988, the Commission approved circuit breaker proposals by the Exchanges.
 In general, the Exchanges' circuit breaker rules provide that trading would halt for one hour if the Dow Jones Industrial
Average (DJIA'') were to decline 250 points from its previous day's closing level and, thereafter, trading would
halt for an additional two hours if the DJIA were to decline 400 points from its previous day's close.
 These circuit breaker mechanisms are an important part of the measures adopted by the Exchanges to address market
volatility concerns in the wake of the October 1987 Market Break.

<DOCNO> FR941102-2-00096 </DOCNO>

<TEXT>
 


The Commission approved the Amex, Boston Stock Exchange, Inc. (``BSE''), Midwest Stock Exchange, Inc. (``MSE''),
NYSE, Phlx and National Association of Securities Dealers' (``NASD'')
 circuit breaker proposals on a pilot program basis. Circuit breaker proposals by the Chicago Board Options Exchange,
Inc. (``CBOE''),
 the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PSE'')
 and the Cincinnati Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CSE'')
 were approved by the Commission on a permanent basis rather than as a pilot program. In 1989, the Exchanges and the NASD
filed, and the Commission approved, proposals to extend their respective pilot programs.
 Subsequently, in 1990, 1991, 1992, and 1993, the Amex, NYSE, and Phlx filed, and the Commission approved, proposals
to extend their respective pilot programs.
 In 1993, the BSE and Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CHX'') (formerly MSE) filed, and the Commission approved, proposals
to extend their respective pilot programs.
 In 1990, 1992, and 1993, the NASD filed, and the Commission approved, proposals to extend its pilot program.
 The proposals for the Exchanges are nearing their expiration dates and the Amex, NYSE, and Phlx have filed with the
Commission proposals to extend further their respective pilot program until October 31, 1995.














The circuit breaker mechanisms were enacted in the wake of the October 1987 Market Break. Both the Report of the Presidential
Task Force on Market Mechanisms (``Brady Report'') and the Working Group's Interim Report
 recommended that coordinated trading halts and reopening procedures be developed that would be implemented in all
U.S. markets for equity and equity related products during large, rapid market declines.
 In response, the SROs submitted proposals to implement circuit breaker procedures that are designed to substitute
planned trading halts for unplanned and destabilizing market closings. In addition, the stock index futures exchanges
have implemented parallel circuit breakers
that were approved by the CFTC on a permanent basis.

III. Discussion


The Commission believes that the Exchanges' proposed rule changes are consistent with the requirements of the Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to national securities exchanges. Specifically, the Commission
believes the Exchanges' proposals are consistent with the requirements of section 6(b)(5) of the Act
 in that they are designed to remove impediments to, and perfect the mechanism of, a free and open market, and to protect
investors and the public interest.




Since the Commission approved these proposals in October 1988, the DJIA has not experienced a one day, 250-point decline
that would trigger a market halt. Nevertheless, the Commission continues to believe that circuit breaker procedures
are desirable to deal with potential strains that may develop during periods of extreme market volatility, and, accordingly,
the Commission believes that the pilot programs should be extended. The Commission also believes that circuit breakers
represent a reasonable means to retard a rapid, one day market decline that can have a destabilizing effect on the nation's
financial markets and participants in these markets.
Accordingly, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change filed by the Exchanges, including NYSE Amendment
No. 1 and Phlx Amendment No. 1, are consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder
applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of section 6 and the rules and
regulations thereunder.
The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule changes prior to the thirtieth day after the date of
publication of notice of filing thereof in the 

Federal Register 

because there are no changes being made to the current provisions, which originally were subject to the full notice
and comment procedures, and accelerated approval would enable the pilots to continue on an uninterrupted basis.
Due to the importance of these circuit breakers for market confidence, soundness, and integrity, it is necessary
and appropriate that these procedures continue on an uninterrupted basis. Therefore, the Commission believes that
granting accelerated approval of the proposed rule changes is appropriate and consistent with sections 6 and 19(b)(2)
of the Act.


IV. Solicitation of Comments


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rules changes that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule changes between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Room. Copies of such filings also will be available for inspection and copying at the principal offices
of the above-mentioned exchanges. All submissions should refer to File Nos. SR-AMEX-94-40, SR-NYSE-94-33,
or SR-Phlx-94-44, and should be submitted by November 23, 1994.


V. Conclusion


It is therefore ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the Amex, NYSE, and Phlx proposed rule changes (SR-Amex-94-40, SR-NYSE-94-33
and SR-Phlx-94-44), including NYSE Amendment No. 1 and Phlx Amendment No. 1, are approved until
October 31, 1994.

4. Ottoman Bank would accept deposits of Assets in Turkey pursuant to a written, three-party agreement (the ``Agreement'').
The Agreement would be entered into by (a) Ottoman Bank, (b) Banque Paribas, and (c) an Investment Company or its custodian.
The Agreement would provide that Ottoman Bank would act as custodian or subcustodian, and Banque Paribas would be
liable for any loss to the same extent as if Banque Paribas had been required to provide custody services under such
agreement. Banque Paribas would not be liable for losses resulting from political risk (

e.g.,

 exchange control restrictions, confiscation, expropriation, nationalization, insurrection, civil strife,
or armed hostilities) and other risks of loss (excluding bankruptcy or insolvency of Ottoman Bank) for which neither
Banque Paribas nor Ottoman Bank would be liable (

e.g.,

 loss despite the exercise of reasonable care, due to an act of God, or resulting from a nuclear incident).


Applicants' Legal Analysis


1. Section 17(f) of the Act provides that a registered investment company may maintain securities and similar assets
in the custody of a bank meeting the requirements of section 26(a) of the Act, a member firm of a national securities
exchange, the investment company itself, or a system for the central handling of securities established by a national
securities exchange. Section 2(a)(5) of the Act defines ``bank'' to include banking institutions organized under
the laws of the United States, member banks of the Federal Reserve System, and certain banking institutions or trust
companies doing business under the laws of any state or of the United States. Ottoman Bank does not fall within the definition
of ``bank'' as defined in the Act and, under section 17(f), may not act as custodian for registered investment companies.
2. Rule 17f-5 under the Act permits certain entities located outside the United States to serve as custodian
for investment company assets. One such entity is a banking institution or trust company that is incoroprated or organized
under the laws of a country other than the United States, that is regulated as such by the country's government or an
agency thereof, and that has shareholders' equity in excess of U.S.$200 million. Banque Paribas qualifies as an eligible
foreign custodian under rule 17f-5. Ottoman Bank, however, does not qualify as an eligible foreign custodian
because it does not meet the minimum shareholders' equity requirement.
3. Applicants request an order under section 6(c) of the Act that would exempt them from the provisions of section 17(f)
to the extent necessary for Ottoman Bank to maintain custody of Investment Company Assets. Applicants believe that
the exemption should be granted because it is necessary and appropriate in the public interest and is consistent with
the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Applicants believe
that the Agreement provides Investment Companies with the safety and security of an eligible foreign custodian under
section 17(f) and rule 17f-5.


Applicants' Conditions


1. The foreign custody arrangements with Ottoman Bank will comply with the provisions of rule 17f-5 in all respects,
except those provisions relating to the minimum shareholders' equity requirement for eligible foreign custodians.
2. Banque Paribas currently satisfies and will continue to satisfy the minimum shareholders' equity requirement
set forth in rule 17f-5(c)(2)(i).
3. An Investment Company or a custodian for an Investment Company will deposit Securities with Ottoman Bank only in
accordance with a three-party contractual agreement that will remain in effect at all times during which Ottoman
Bank fails to meet the requirement of rule 17f-5 relating to minimum shareholders' equity. Each agreement will
be a three-party agreement among (a) Banque Paribas, (b) Ottoman Bank, and (c) the Investment Company or custodian
of the Securities of the Investment Company. Under the agreement, Ottoman Bank will undertake to provide specified
custodial or sub-custodial services. The agreement will further provide that Banque Paribas will be liable for any
loss, damage, cost, expense, liability, or claim arising out of or in connection with the performance by Ottoman Bank
of its responsibilities under the agreement to the same extent as if Banque Paribas had been required to provide custody
services under such agreement.

<DOCTITLE>Dean Witter Variable Investment Series, et al.</DOCTITLE>


October 27, 1994.


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of application for exemption under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``1940 Act'' or ``Applicants'').






APPLICANTS:

 Dean Witter Variable Investment Series (the ``Fund'') and Dean Witter Intercapital Inc. (together, ``Applicants'').





RELEVANT 1940 ACT SECTIONS: 

Order requested under Section 6(c) for exemptions from Sections 9(a), 13(a), 15(a), and 15(b) and Rules 6e-2(b)(15)
and 6e-3(T)(b)(15) thereunder. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION:

 Applicants seek an order of exemption to the extent necessary to permit shares of the Fund to be sold to and held by variable
annuity and variable life insurance separate accounts of both affiliated and unaffiliated life insurance companies.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Following is a summary of the application. The complete application is available for a fee from the Public Reference
Branch of the SEC.



Applicants' Representations



1. The Fund is a Massachusetts business trust registered under the Act as an open-end diversified management investment
company. The Fund is composed of eleven separate portfolios. Currently, shares of the Fund are sold only to Northbrook
Life Insurance Company and Allstate Life Insurance Company of New York (the ``Companies'') to fund flexible premium
variable annuity contracts issued through certain of their separate accounts. Dean Witter InterCapital Inc. (``InterCapital''),
a wholly owned subsidiary of Dean Witter, Discover & Co., is the investment manager for the Fund. InterCapital
and the Companies were previously under common control (ultimately owned by Sears, Roebuck and Co.). 

2. The Fund intends to offer its shares to separate accounts of various insurance companies to fund variable annuity
contracts and variable life insurance contracts (collectively, ``variable contracts''). Insurance companies
whose separate accounts do or will own shares of the Fund are referred to herein as ``participating insurance companies.''
It is anticipated that participating insurance companies will rely on rules 6e-2 or 6e-3(T) under the
Act, although some may rely on individual exemptive orders as well, in connection with variable life insurance contracts.

3. The use of a common management investment company as the underlying investment medium for variable annuity and
variable life insurance separate accounts is referred to as ``mixed funding.'' The use of a common management investment
company as the underlying investment medium for separate accounts of unaffiliated insurance companies is referred
to as ``shared funding.'' ``Mixed and shared funding'' denotes the use of a common management company to fund a variable
annuity separate account of one insurance company and the variable annuity separate accounts of other affiliated
and unaffiliated insurance companies. Rule 6e-2(b)(15) precludes mixed and shared funding while Rule 6e-3(T)(b)(15)
permits mixed funding but precludes shared funding. Applicants request an order of the Commission exempting variable
life insurance separate accounts (and, to the extent necessary, any principal underwriter and depositor of such
an account) from sections 9(a), 13(a), 15(a) and 15(b) of the Act, and Rules 6e-2(b)(15) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15)
thereunder, to the extent necessary to permit mixed and shared funding.


Applicants' Legal Analysis


1. In connection with scheduled premium variable life insurance contracts issued through a separate account registered
under the Act as a unit investment trust, Rule 6e-2(b)(15) provides partial exemption from sections 9(a), 13(a),
15(a) and 15(b) of the Act. The exemptions granted to a separate account (and any investment adviser, principal underwriter
and depositor thereof) by Rule 6e-2(b)(15), however, are not available with respect to a scheduled premium
variable life insurance separate account that owns shares of an investment company that also offers its shares to
a variable annuity separate account of the same or of any affiliated or unaffiliated insurance company (``mixed funding'').
In addition, the relief granted by Rule 6e-2(b)(15) is not available if shares of the underlying investment
company are offered to variable annuity or variable life insurance separate accounts of unaffiliated insurance
companies (``shared funding''). Accordingly, Applicants seek an order exempting scheduled premium variable life
insurance separate accounts (and, to the extent necessary, any investment adviser, principal underwriter and depositor
of such an account) from sections 9(a), 13(a), 15(a) and 15(b) of the Act, and Rule 6e-2(b)(15) thereunder, to
the extent necessary to permit shares of the Fund to be offered and sold in connection with both mixed funding and shared
funding.
2. In connection with flexible premium variable life insurance contracts issued through a separate account registered
under the Act as a unit investment trust, Rule 6e-3(T)(6)(15) provides partial exemptions from sections 9(a),
13(a), 15(a) and 15(b) of the Act. The exemptions granted to a separate account (and to any investment adviser, principal
underwriter and depositor thereof) by Rule 6e-3(T)(b)(15) permit mixed funding of flexible premium variable
life insurance but preclude shared funding. Accordingly, Applicants seek an order exempting flexible premium variable
life insurance separate accounts (and, to the extent necessary, any investment adviser, principal underwriter
and depositor of such an account from sections 9(a), 13(a), 15(a) and 15(b) of the Act, and Rule 6e-3(T)(b)(15)
thereunder, to the extent necessary to permit shares of the Fund to be offered and sold to separate accounts in connection
with shared funding.
3. Section 9(a) provides that it is unlawful for any company to serve as investment adviser or principal underwriter
of any registered open-end investment company if an affiliated person of that company is subject to a disqualification
enumerated in sections 9(a) (1) or (2). Rules 6e-2(b)(15) (i) and (ii), and 6e-3(T)(b)(15) (i) and (ii),
provide exemptions from section 9(a) under certain circumstances, subject to the limitations on mixed and shared
funding. These exemptions limit the application of the eligibility restrictions to affiliated individuals or companies
that directly participate in the management or administration of the underlying management company.
4. The application states that the partial relief granted in Rules 6e-2(b)(15) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15) from
the requirements of section 9 of the Act limits the amount of monitoring necessary to ensure compliance with section
9 of that which is appropriate in light of the policy and purposes of section 9. The Applicants state that those Rules
recognize that it is not necessary for the protection of investors or the purposes fairly intended by the policy and
provisions of the Act to apply the provisions of section 9(a) to individuals in a large insurance company complex,
most of whom will have no involvement in matters pertaining to investment companies in (or invested in by) that organization.
Applicants state that it is also unnecessary to apply section 9(a) to individuals in various unaffiliated insurance
companies (or affiliated companies of participating insurance companies) that may utilize the Fund as the funding
medium for variable contracts. Applicants argue that applying the requirements of section 9(a) because of investment
by other insurers' separate accounts would be unjustified and would not serve any regulatory purpose. The application
states that the participating insurers are not expected to play any role in the management or administration of the
Fund and that those individuals who participate in the management or administration of the Fund will remain the same
regardless of which separate accounts or insurance companies use the Fund. Furthermore, the increased monitoring
costs would reduce the net rates of return realized by contract owners.

5. Rules 6e-2(b)(15)(iii) and 6e-3(T)(b)(iii) assume the existence of a pass-through voting requirement
with respect to management investment company shares held by a separate account. Applicants state that pass-through
privileges will be provided with respect to all variable contract owners so long as the Commission interprets the
Act to require pass-through voting privileges for variable contract owners. However, Rules 6e-2(b)(15)(iii)
and 6e-3(T)(b)(15)(iii) provide exemptions from the pass-through voting requirement with respect to several
significant matters, assuming the limitations on mixed and shared funding are observed.

6. Rules 6e-2(b)(15)(iii) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15)(iii) provide that the insurance company may disregard
the voting instructions of its contract owners with respect to the investments of an underlying fund or any contract
between a fund and its investment adviser, when required to do so by an insurance regulatory authority. Voting instructions
may also be disregarded by the insurance company if the contract owners initiate any change in the investment company's
investment policies, principal underwriter or any investment adviser provided that disregarding such voting instructions
is reasonable and based on a specific good faith determination as required under the Rules. Applicants assert that
the rights of an insurance company or of a state insurance regulator to disregard contract owners' voting instructions
are not inconsistent with mixed or shared funding. According to the Applicants, there is no reason why the investment
policies of any portfolio of the Fund would or should be materially different from what it would or should be if it funded
only annuity contracts or only scheduled or flexible premium life contracts and that there is no reason to believe
that different features of various types of contracts will lead to different investment policies for different types
of variable contracts. Applicants represent that the Fund will not be managed to favor or disfavor any particular
insurer or type of insurance product.

7. The Application states that mixed and shared funding should provide several benefits to variable contract holders.
It would permit a greater amount of assets available for investment, thereby promoting economies of scale, permitting
a greater diversification, and making the addition of new portfolios more feasible. The Applicants believe that
making the Fund available for mixed and shared funding will encourage more insurance companies to offer variable
contracts, and this should result in increased competition with respect to both variable contract design and pricing,
which can be expected to result in more product variation and lower charges.

8. The Applicants see no significant legal impediment to permitting mixed and shared funding. Separate accounts
organized as unit investment trusts have historically been employed to accumulate shares of mutual funds which have
not been affiliated with the depositor or sponsor of the separate account. The Fund does not believe that mixed and
shared funding will have any adverse federal income tax consequences.



Applicants' Conditions



If the requested order is granted, Applicants consent to the following conditions:

1. A majority of the board of trustees of the Fund (the ``Board'') shall consist of persons who are not ``interested
persons'' of the Fund, as defined by section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act, and the rules thereunder, and as modified by any
applicable orders of the Commission, except that if this condition is not met by reason of the death, disqualification,
or bona-fide resignation of any trustee or trustees, then the operation of this condition shall be suspended: (a)
for a period of 45 days if the vacancy or vacancies may be filled by the Board; (b) for a period of 60 days if a vote of shareholders
is required to fill a vacancy or vacancies; or (c) for such longer period as the Commission may prescribe by order upon
Application.

2. The Board will monitor the Fund for the existence of any material irreconcilable conflict between the interests
of the life owners and annuity owners and any future owners in the Fund. An irreconcilable material conflict may arise
for a variety of reasons, including: (1) An action by any state insurance regulatory authority; (2) a change in applicable
federal or state insurance, tax, or securities laws or regulations, or a public ruling, private letter ruling, no-action
or interpretative letter, or any similar action by insurance, tax, or securities regulatory authorities; (3) an
administrative or judicial decision in any relevant proceeding; (4) the manner in which the investments of any portfolio
are being managed; (5) a difference in voting instructions given by variable annuity contract owners and variable
life insurance contract owners.

3. Participating insurance companies and InterCapital will report any potential or existing conflicts to the Board.
Participating insurance companies and InterCapital will be responsible for assisting the Board in carrying out
its responsibilities under these conditions by providing the Board with all information reasonably necessary for
the Board to consider any issues raised. This includes, but is not limited to, an obligation by each participating
insurance company to inform the Board whenever contract owner voting instructions are disregarded. The responsibility
to report such information and conflicts and to assist the Board will be a contractual obligation of all insurers investing
in the Fund under their agreements governing participation in the Fund and these responsibilities will be carried
out with the view only to interests of the contract owners.

4. If it is determined by a majority of the Board, or a majority of its disinterested Trustee, that a material irreconcilable
conflict exists, the relevant insurance companies shall, at their expense and to the extent reasonably practicable
(as determined by a majority of the disinterested trustees), take whatever steps are necessary to remedy or eliminate
the irreconcilable material conflict, up to and including: (1) Withdrawing the assets allocable to some or all of
the separate accounts from the Fund or any portfolio and reinvesting such assets in a different investment medium,
including another portfolio of the Fund, or submitting the question whether such segregation should be implemented
to a vote of all affected contract owners and as appropriate, segregating the assets of any appropriate group (i.e.,
annuity contract owners, life insurance contract owners, or variable contract owners of one or more participating
insurance companies) that votes in favor of such segregation, or offering to the affected contract owners the option
of making such a change; and (2) establishing a new registered management investment company or managed separate
account. If a material irreconcilable conflict arises because of an insurer's decision to disregard contract owner
voting instructions and that decision represents a minority position or would preclude a majority vote, the insurer
may be required, at the Fund's election, to withdraw its separate account's investment in the fund and no charge or
penalty will be imposed as a result of such withdrawal. The responsibility to take remedial action in the event of a
Board determination of an irreconcilable material conflict and to bear the cost of such remedial action shall be a
contractual obligation of all participating insurance companies under their agreements governing participation
in the Fund. 

For purposes of this condition 4, a majority of the disinterested members of the Board shall determine whether or not
any proposed action adequately remedies any irreconcilable material conflicts, but in no event will the Fund or InterCapital
be required to establish a new funding medium for any variable contract. No participating insurance company shall
be required by this condition 4 to establish a new funding medium for any variable contract if an offer to do so has been
declined by vote of a majority of contract owners materially adversely affected by the irreconcilable material conflict.


5. The Board's determination of the existence of an irreconcilable material conflict and its implications shall
be made known promptly to all participating insurance companies.

6. Participating insurance companies will pass through voting privileges to all variable contract owners so long
as the Commission continues to interpret the Act as requiring pass-through voting privileges for variable contract
owners. Accordingly, participating insurance companies will vote shares of the Fund held in their separate accounts
in a manner consistent with timely voting instructions received from contract owners. Each participating insurance
company will vote shares of the Fund held in its separate accounts for which no timely voting instructions from contract
holders are received, as well as shares it owns, in the same proportion as those shares for which voting instructions
are received. Participating insurance companies shall be responsible for assuring that each of their separate accounts
participating in the Fund calculates voting privileges in a manner consistent with other participating insurance
companies. The obligation to calculate voting privileges in a manner consistent with all other separate accounts
investing in the Fund shall be a contractual obligation of all participating insurance companies under their agreements
governing participation in the Fund.
7. The Fund will comply with all provisions of the Act requiring voting by Shareholders, and in particular the Fund
will either provide for annual meetings (except insofar as the Commission may interpret Section 16 not to require
such meetings), or comply with section 16(c) of the Act (although the Fund is not one of the trusts described in the section
16(c) of the Act) as well as with section 16(a) and, if and when applicable, 16(b). Further, the Fund will act in accordance
with the Commission's interpretation of the requirements of section 16(a) with respect to periodic elections of
trustees and with whatever rules the Commission may promulgate with respect thereto.
8. The Fund shall disclose in its prospectus that (1) the Fund is intended to be a funding vehicle for all types of variable
annuity and variable life insurance contracts offered by various insurance companies, (2) material irreconcilable
conflicts may possibly arise, and (3) the Board will monitor events in order to identify the existence of any material
irreconcilable conflicts and determine what action, if any, should be taken in response to such conflict. The Fund
will notify all participating insurance companies that separate account prospectus disclosure regarding potential
risks of mixed and shared funding may be appropriate.
9. If and to the extent that Rule 6e-2 and Rule 6e-3(T) are amended, or Rule 6e-3 is adopted, to provide
exemptive relief from any provision of the Act or the rules promulgated thereunder with respect to mixed or shared
funding on terms and conditions materially different from any exemptions granted in the order requested in this application,
then the Fund and/or participating insurance companies, as appropriate, shall take such steps as may be necessary
to comply with Rules 6e-2 and 6e-3(T), or Rule 6e-3, as such rules are applicable.
10. The participating insurance companies shall at least annually submit to the Board such reports, materials or
data as the Board may reasonably request so that the Board or the Fund may fully carry out the obligations imposed upon
them by the conditions contained in the application and said reports, materials and data shall be submitted more frequently
if deemed appropriate by the Board. The obligation of the participating insurance companies to provide these reports,
materials and data to the Board when it so reasonably requests, shall be a contractual obligation of all participating
insurance companies under their agreements governing participation in the Fund.
11. All reports received by the Board of potential or existing conflicts, and all Board action with regard to determining
the existence of a conflict, notifying participating insurance companies of a conflict, and determining whether
any proposed action adequately remedies a conflict, will be properly recorded in the minutes of the Board or other
appropriate records, and such minutes or other records shall be made available to the Commission upon request.


Applicants' Conclusion


For the reasons stated above, Applicants believe that the requested exemptions, in accordance with the standards
of section 6(c) of the 1940 Act, are appropriate in the pubic interest and are consistent with the protection of investors
and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and the provisions of the Act.

 Notice of application for exemption under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (``ACT''). 

 


APPLICANTS:

 Equity Securities Trust (Series 1, Signature Series, Gabelli Communications Income Trust and Subsequent Series),
Mortgage Securities Trust (CMO Series 1 and Subsequent Series), Municipal Securities Trust (Series 1 and Subsequent
Series) (including Insured Municipal Securities Trust, Series 1 and Subsequent Series, and 5th Discount Series

& Co., Incorporated (``Gruntal''). 



RELEVANT ACT SECTIONS:

 Sections 11(a) and 11(c). 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION:

 Applicants request an order to permit unitholders of the Trusts of exchange their units for units in other Trusts at
a reduced sales charge. The order would supersede a prior order and include the Equity Securities Trust in the exchange
program. 

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee from the SEC's Public
Reference Branch. 


Applicant's Representations 


1. The Trusts are registered under the Act as unit investment trust, and their units of interest are registered under
the Securities Act of 1933. Bear Stearns, one of the cosponsors of the Equity Securities Trust, sponsors the Trusts
and numerous other unit investment trusts. Gruntal, also a cosponsor of the Equity Securities Trust, sponsors various
other unit investment trusts with Bear Stearns (Bear Stearns and Gruntal are collectively referred to as the ``Sponsors'').
Each Trust is organized under a Trust Indenture and Agreement between the Trust, the Sponsors, and United States Trust
Company of New York or Bank of New York, as trustee, which varies from Trust to Trust. 
2. On August 28, 1991, the SEC issued an order (the ``Prior Order'')
 permitting unitholders of the Trusts, except the Equity Securities Trust, to exchange their units for units in another
available Trust or Trusts, except the Equity Securities Trust, upon payment of a reduced sales charge. The Prior order
also permits a conversion offer in which the unitholders of any registered unit investment trust for which there is
no active secondary market may redeem their units with their respective trustees and apply the proceeds to the purchase
of units of one or more of the Trusts, except the Equity Securities Trust, upon payment of the same reduced sales charge.

3. The Equity Securities Trust is a newly formed unit investment trust consisting of a portfolio of common stock, convertible
securities, American Depository Receipts, and contracts and funds for the purchase of such securities. The Equity
Securities Trust deposits its securities with the trustee, in exchange for certificates representing undivided
interests or units in the principal and net income of the Equity Securities Trust in the ratio of one hundred units for
the indicated initial aggregate value of securities of the Equity Securities Trust.

4. During the initial public offering period, units of the Trust are sold at a sales charge ranging from 3.5% to 5.5%,
depending on the Trust, subject to certain specified volume discounts for purchases exceeding a certain number of
units.

5. The Sponsors, although not obligated to do so, maintain a secondary market for the units of all the existing Trusts
after the initial public offering has been completed. The Sponsors also intend to maintain a secondary market for
any new Trusts after the initial public offering has been completed. The secondary market repurchase and reoffer
price, both during and after the initial public offering period, will be based on the bid prices of the Trust's portfolio
securities. Any units repurchased by the Sponsors in the secondary market may be redeemed by the Sponsors if the Sponsors
deem such redemption to be in their best interest. If a market for the units is not maintained, unitholders will be able
to redeem their units with the trustee at a price based on the aggregate bid side evaluation of the Trust's portfolio
securities.

6. Applicants propose to offer unitholders of the Trusts the ability to exchange any or all of their units for units
in one or more available series of the Trusts at a reduced sales charge (the ``Exchange Privilege''). Pursuant to the
Exchange Privilege, the Sponsors' repurchase price during the initial offering period of the units being surrendered
will be based on the aggregate offer price of the Trust's portfolio securities, and, if the initial offering period
has been completed, will be based on the aggregate bid price of the Trust's portfolio securities. Units in a Trust then
will be sold to the unitholder at a price based on the aggregate offer price of the securities in the Trust portfolio
during the initial public offering period of the Trust (or based on the aggregate bid price of the securities in the
Trust portfolio if the initial public offering period has been completed) plus accrued interest and a reduced sales
charge.

7. The Sponsors reserve the right to suspend, modify, or terminate the Exchange Privilege. The Sponsors will provide
unitholders with 60 days prior written notice of any termination or material amended to the Exchange Privilege, except
as provided in condition 3 below.

8. Applicants also propose to offer a conversion offer (the ``Conversion Offer'') to all unitholders of any registered
unit investment trust in which there is no active secondary market (a ``Redemption Trust''). Pursuant to the Conversion
Offer, unitholders may elect to redeem units of a Redemption Trust at the redemption drive determined as set forth
in the relevant Redemption Trust's prospectus and apply the proceeds of the redemption to the purchase of available
units of one or more series of the Trust. The purchase price for units of a series of a Trust will be based on the aggregate
offer of the Trust's portfolio securities during its initial offering period, or at a price based on the aggregate
bid price of the Trust's portfolio securities if the initial public offering period of the Trust has been completed,
and will include accrued interest and a reduced sales charge.

9. The Sponsors reserve the right to modify, suspend, or terminate the Conversion Offer at any time without prior notice
to unitholders of a Redemption Trust.

10. The Exchange Privilege and Conversion Offer are substantially similar in all respects to the exchange privilege
and conversion offer already approved by the SEC in the Prior Order, except the Equity Securities Trust, as a newly
formed Trust, was not in existence at the time that order was issued. The requested relief is necessary to enable the
Equity Securities Trust to offer the same exchange privilege to its unitholders as is already permitted to unitholders
of the other Trusts pursuant to the Prior Order, and to revise the reduced sales charge under the Exchange Privilege
and Conversion Offer to be an amount equal to a percentage of the public offering price for each unit (or per 1,000 units
for Mortgage Securities Trust or per 100 units for Equity Securities Trust). The requested relief will supersede
the Prior Order in its entirety.



Applicants' Legal Analysis



1. Section 11(a) of the Act requires SEC approval of an offer to exchange securities between open-end investment companies
of the exchange occurs on any basis other than the relative net asset values of the Securities to be exchanged. Section
11(c) of the Act makes section 11(a) applicable to any type of exchange offer of securities of registered unit investment
trusts for the securities of any other investment company, irrespective of the basis of exchange.

2. Applicants believe that the Exchange Privilege provides investors with a convenient means of transferring their
interests at a reduced sales charge, as their individual investment objectives change, into series of the Trust that
are better suited to meet these changing investment objectives. Applicants also state that the Conversion Offer
provides investors with a means by which unitholders of a unit investment trust in which there is no active secondary
market can redeem those units and invest the proceeds therefrom, at a reduced sales charge, into units of the trusts.



Applicants' Conditions



The Applicants agree to the following conditions in any order granting the requested relief:

1. Participants in the Exchange Privilege and Conversion Offer for the Trusts will, in the purchase and sale of units
of the Trusts, be subject to the same portfolio pricing terms as are set forth in the prospectus for each Trust and will
purchase and sell units of the Trusts based on the same portfolio pricing terms as all other investors who purchase
and sell units of the Trusts through the Sponsors or the underwriters in regular transactions.

2. The prospectus for each Trust and any sales literature or advertisement that mentions the existence of the Exchange
Privilege will disclose that the Exchange Privilege is subject to termination and that its terms are subject to change.

3. Whenever the Exchange Privilege is to be terminated or its terms are to be amended materially, any holder of a security
subject to that privilege will be given prominent notice of the impending termination or amendment at last 60 days
prior to the date of termination or the effective date of the amendment, 

provided that:

(a) No such notice need be given if the only material effect of an amendment is to reduce or eliminate the sales charge
payable at the time of an exchange, to add one or more new series eligible for the Exchange Privilege, or to delete a series
which has terminated, and

(b) No notice need be given if, under extraordinary circumstances, either_

(i) There is a suspension of the redemption of units of a Trust under section 22(e) of the Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder, or

(ii) A Trust temporarily delays or ceases the sale of its units because it is unable to invest amounts effectively in
accordance with applicable investment objectives, policies and restrictions.

4. During the 60 day period described in condition 3 above, the Sponsors will maintain a secondary market in units that
could be acquired by affected unitholders.

5. The applicable sales charge for the purchase of units of a Trust for Trust unitholders who wish to exercise the Exchange
Privilege within the first five months from the date of their purchase of units of a Trust, where the applicable public
offering price for the Trust units being purchased includes higher sales charges than the sales charges applicable
to the units being exchanged, will be the greater of the reduced sales charge (up to 1.5% of the public offering price
of each unit (or per 1,000 units for Mortgage Securities Trust or per 100 units for the Equity Securities Trust)), or
an amount which, when coupled with the sales charge actually paid on purchase of the units being exchanged, would equal
the sales charge applicable to direct purchases of the quantity of Trust units being acquired, determined as of the
date of the exchange.

6. The applicable sales charge for the purchase of units of a Trust for Redemption Trust unitholders who wish to exercise
the Conversion Offer within the first five months from the date of their purchase of units of a Redemption Trust, where
the applicable public offering price for the Trust units being purchased includes higher sales charges than the sales
charges applicable to the units being converted, will be the greater of the reduced sales charge (up to 1.5% of the price
of each unit (or per 1,000 units for Mortgage Securities Trust or per 100 units for the Equity Securities Trust)), or
an amount which, when coupled with the sales charge actually paid on purchase of the units being converted, would equal
the sales charge applicable to direct purchases of the quantity of Trusts units being acquired, determined as of the
date of the conversion.

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information:

 The following is a summary of the application. The complete application is available for a fee at the SEC's Public Reference
Branch.


Applicant's Representations


1. Applicant is registered as a closed-end management investment company that was incorporated under the laws of
the State of Delaware. On May 27, 1988, applicant filed a Notification of Registration on Form N-8A, pursuant
to section 8(a) of the Act. On June 8, 1988, applicant filed a registration statement on Form N-2 pursuant to both
the Securities Act of 1933 and section 8(b) of the Act. On August 11, 1988, this registration statement became effective
registering 700,000 shares of common stock, $.01 par value per share, and applicant commenced the initial public
offering of the stock as soon as practicable thereafter.
2. On March 29, 1991, the applicant's board of directors adopted a resolution recommending liquidation and dissolution
of applicant. On or about April 26, 1991, a proxy statement describing the proposed Plan of Complete Liquidation and
Dissolution (``the Plan'') and relating to the annual meeting of shareholders to be held on May 20, 1991, was mailed
to all shareholders of record. Applicant's shareholders approved the Plan at the annual meeting of shareholders.
3. On May 21, 1991, applicant commenced the sale of its portfolio securities, and sold all of its securities by June
30, 1991. Applicant's common stock ceased trading on the NASDAQ National Market System as of the close of business
on May 20, 1991, the date its shareholders approved the Plan.
4. As of May 20, 1991, applicant's 700,100 shares of common stock outstanding were held by 405 record shareholders.
As of May 17, 1991, applicant's common stock had a net asset value per share of $10.0365 ($7,026,553.65 in the aggregate).
5. On July 23, 1991, in accordance with the Plan, applicant's board of directors authorized, and applicant deposited
with AmSouth Bank N.A., of Birmingham, Alabama (``the Liquidating Agent''), the amount of $6,825,975.00 for payment,
at $9.75 per share, of the first liquidating distribution to all shareholders of record as of May 20, 1991. The Liquidating
Agent paid this first liquidating distribution to applicant's shareholders upon receipt of their respective stock
certificates or satisfactory lost share affidavits and indemnity agreements.
6. On November 4, 1991, applicant's board of directors authorized a final liquidating distribution in the amount
of $88,842.69, representing $.1269 per share, for payment to those shareholders entitled to receive the first distribution.
On November 8, 1991, the Liquidating Agent made this final distribution. Six shareholders, owning a total of 440.4062
shares delivered their stock certificates and properly executed letters of transmittal after November 8, 1991 and
received their distributions ($4,349.85 in the aggregate, $9.8769 per share) at various times after November 8,
1991.
7. Pursuant to a resolution of the board of directors, the Fund created a liquidating trust to pay off its creditors.
$67,340.55 was transferred to the trust shortly after its creation. All expenses of liquidation have been paid, however,
and no funds remain in the liquidating trust.
8. Applicant's expenses for liquidating were approximately $24,549 in legal fees and costs, $11,608 in accounting
fees and costs, $4,125 in printing fees and costs, and $4,000 in directors' fees, all of which expenses were allocated
to applicant.
9. Applicant paid $12,143.92 in brokerage commissions following approval of the Plan. Of that amount, $11,743.92
was paid to Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc. of Birmingham, Alabama. Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc. is an ``affiliated
person'' as that term is defined in section 2(a)(3) of the Act, of applicant and of Sterne, Agee & Leach Investment
Advisors, Inc., applicant's investment adviser. $400.00 in brokerage commissions was paid to Porter, White &
Yardley, Inc. which is not an ``affiliated person'' of applicant or Sterne, Agee & Leach Investment Advisors,
Inc. Applicant represents that the commissions charged by Sterne, Agee & Leach Investment Advisors, Inc. and
by Porter, White and Yardley, Inc. were competitive with the brokerage commissions and fees charged by other brokers
for similar transactions and were consistent with section 17(e) of the Act.
10. Applicant has no shareholders, assets or liabilities. Applicant is not a party to any litigation or administrative
proceeding. Applicant is not engaged, nor does it propose to engage, in any business activities other than those necessary
to wind up its affairs.

Narrative Statement for the Department of Transportation 


Office of the Secretary 



The Office of the Secretary of Transportation proposes to add the record system, DOT/ALL-10, Debt Collection
File. The purpose of the system is the administrative management and collection of delinquent debts. The debts include
past due loan payments, overpayments, fines, penalties, fees, damages, interest, leases, sales of real or personal
property, etc., due to the Department of Transportation and debts due to other Federal departments and agencies that
may be referred to the Department of Transportation for collection to the extent the Department of Transportation
controls funds due the debtor. 
The authority for the maintenance of this system is the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, Pub. L. 89-508;
Debt Collection Act of 1982, Pub. L. 97-365; and Executive Orders 9397 and 11222. 

Individuals receiving benefits in the form of salary and/or other forms of compensation already have disclosed the
subject information to a federal agency; therefore this system presents no undue threat to privacy rights of individuals.

A description of the steps taken to safeguard these records is given under the appropriate heading of the 

Federal Register

 system of records notice. 
No changes to existing procedural or exemption rules are required for this proposed new system. 
The purpose of this report is to comply with the Office of Management and Budget Circular, A-130, Appendix I,
dated 
June 25, 1993.

 DOT/ALL-10 


System name: 


Debt Collection File 


System location: 


Federal Aviation Administration, General Ledger Branch, 
Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center, 6500 S. MacArthur Blvd., 
Oklahoma City, OK 73125. 


Categories of individuals covered by the system: 


Persons currently or formerly associated with the Department of Transportation (DOT) who are financially indebted
to the U.S. Government under some particular service or program of the DOT other than under a contract. Individuals
may include current, retired, or formerly employed DOT personnel or personnel from other Federal agencies. 


Categories of records in the system: 


Information varies depending on the individual debtor, and includes the history of debt collection activity on the
individual. Normally, the name, Social Security Number (SSN), address, amount of debt or delinquent amount, basis
of the debt, date debt arose, office referring debt, collection efforts, credit reports, debt collection letters
and correspondence to or from the debtor relating to the debt. Correspondence with employing agencies of debtors
or Office of Personnel Management or Department of Defense, as appropriate, requesting that action begin to collect
the delinquent debt through voluntary or involuntary offset procedures against the employee's salary or compensation
due a retiree. 


Authority for maintenance of the system: 



Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966 (Pub.L. 89-508), 31 U.S.C. Chapter 37, Subchapter I (General), and Subchapter
II (Claims of the United States Government); Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub.L. 97-365); 5 U.S.C. 5514, Installment
Deduction for Indebtedness (salary offset); section 206 of Executive Order 11222; Executive Order 9397; and 49 CFR
part 92, Salary Offset (DOT). 


Purposes: 


For the administrative management and collection of all delinquent debts, including past due loan payments, overpayments,
fines, penalties, fees, damages, interest, leases, sales of real or personal property, etc., due to the DOT and debts
due to other Federal departments and agencies that may be referred to the DOT for collection to the extent DOT controls
funds due the debtor. 
This system provides for the implementation of the salary offset provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5514, the administrative
offset provisions of 31 U.S.C. 3716 and the provisions of the Federal Claims Collection Standards (FCCS). It applies
to personal rather than contract debts. Guidance regarding contract debts is contained in the Federal Acquisition
Regulation. Records in this record system are subject to use in authorized and approved computer matching programs
regulated under the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), as amended, for debt collection purposes. 


Routine uses of records maintained in the system, including 
categories of users and the purposes of such uses:  


a. To the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO), Department of Justice, United States Attorney, or other Federal agencies
for further collection action on any delinquent account when circumstances warrant. 
b. To a debt collection agency for the purpose of collection services to recover monies owed to the U.S. Government
under certain programs or services administered by the DOT. 
c. Debtor's name, Social Security Number, the amount of debt, and the history of the debt may be disclosed to any Federal
agency where the individual debtor is employed or receiving some form of remuneration for the purpose of enabling
that agency to collect a debt owed the U.S. Government on DOT's behalf by counseling the debtor for voluntary repayment
or by initiating administrative or salary offset procedures under the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982
(Pub.L. 97-365). 
d. To the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) by computer matching to obtain the mailing address of a taxpayer for the purpose
of locating such taxpayer to collect or to compromise a Federal claim by DOT against the taxpayer pursuant to 26 U.S.C.
6103(m)(2) and in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3711, 3217, and 3718.

Note: 

Redisclosure of a mailing address from the IRS may be made only for the purpose of debt collection, including to a debt
collection agency in order to facilitate the collection or compromise of a Federal claim under the Debt Collection
Act of 1982, except that a mailing address to a consumer reporting agency is for the limited purpose of obtaining a commercial
credit report on the particular taxpayer. Any such address information obtained from the IRS will not be used or shared
for any other DOT purpose or disclosed to another Federal, state, or local agency which seeks to locate the same individual
for its own debt collection purpose.



e. Data base information consisting of debtor's name, Social Security Number, and amount owed may be disclosed to
the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC), Department of Defense, the U.S. Postal Service or to any other Federal, state,
or local agency for the purpose of conducting an authorized computer matching program in compliance with the Privacy
Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), as amended, so as to identify and locate delinquent debtors in order to start a recoupment
process on an individual basis of any debt owed DOT by the debtor arising out of any administrative or program activities
or services administered by DOT. 
f. Disclosure of personal and financial information from this system on current, retired, or former employees of
DOT or U.S. Coast Guard members may be made to any creditor Federal agency seeking assistance for the purpose of that
agency requesting voluntary repayment or implementing administrative or salary offset procedures in the collection
of unpaid financial obligations owed the U.S. Government from an individual affiliated with the DOT. An exception
to this routine use is an individual's mailing address obtained from the IRS pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 6103(m)(2). 


Disclosure to consumer reporting agencies: 

Disclosure pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(12) may be made from this record system to consumer reporting agencies as
defined in the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681a(f)) or the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966 (31 U.S.C.
3701(a)(3)). The disclosure, once determined to be valid and overdue, is limited to information necessary to establish
the identity of the individual, including name, address, and taxpayer identification number (Social Security Number);
the amount, status, and history of the claim; and the agency or program under which the claim arose for the sole purpose
of allowing the consumer reporting agency to prepare a commercial credit report. 


Policies and practices for storing, retrieving, accessing, retaining, and disposing of records in the system: 
Storage: 

The storage for records on personal computers is kept on floppy disks. Storage on microcomputers is first downloaded
onto a floppy disk and then locked in a file cabinet. Data kept in paper file folders are locked in file cabinets. 


Retrievability: 

Records are retrieved by name or Social Security Number. 


Safeguards: 

Computers provide privacy and access limitation by requiring a user name and password match. These records are available
only to those persons whose official duties require such access. Records are kept in limited access areas during duty
hours and in locked cabinets at all other times. 



Retention and disposal: 

Records are disposed of when ten years old except documents needed for an ongoing investigation in which case the record
will be retained until no longer needed for the investigation. Data tracks on floppy disks are overwritten a minimum
of three times. 


System manager(s) and address: 


Department of Transportation, Director, Office of Financial Management (B-30), 400 Seventh Street, SW.,
Washington, DC 20590. 


Notification procedure: 

Individuals seeking to determine whether information about themselves is contained in this system should address
written inquiries to the particular DOT operating administration or component in care of the ``system location''
above. Individual should furnish full name, Social Security Number, current address and telephone number. 


Record access procedures: 

Same as above. 


Contesting record procedures: 

Same as above. 


Record source categories: 

Information in this system of records is obtained from the individual, creditor agencies, Federal employing agency
of debtor, collection agencies, Federal, state or local agencies furnishing identifying information and/or address
of debtor, as well as other internal DOT records such as payroll information. 


Exemptions claimed for the system: 

None.

Receipt of Petition for Decision That Nonconforming 1993 BMW 840Ci Passenger Cars Are Eligible for Importation


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of receipt of petition for decision that nonconforming 1993 BMW 840Ci passenger cars are eligible for importation.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice announces receipt by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) of a petition for a decision
that a 1993 BMW 840Ci that was not originally manufactured to comply with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety
standards is eligible for importation into the United States because (1) it is substantially similar to a vehicle
that was originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the United States and that was certified by its manufacturer
as complying with the safety standards, and (2) it is capable of being readily altered to conform to the standards.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



Background



Under 49 U.S.C. 30141(a)(1)(A) (formerly section 108(c)(3)(A)(i)(I) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle
Safety Act (the Act)), a motor vehicle that was not originally manufactured to conform to all applicable Federal motor
vehicle safety standards shall be refused admission into the United States unless NHTSA has decided that the motor
vehicle is substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the
United States, certified under 49 U.S.C. 30115 (formerly section 114 of the Act), and of the same model year as the model
of the motor vehicle to be compared, and is capable of being readily altered to conform to all applicable Federal motor
vehicle safety standards.
Petitions for eligibility decisions may be submitted by either manufacturers or importers who have registered with
NHTSA pursuant to 49 CFR Part 592. As specified in 49 CFR 593.7, NHTSA publishes notice in the 

Federal Register

 of each petition that it receives, and affords interested persons an opportunity to comment on the petition. At the
close of the comment period, NHTSA decides, on the basis of the petition and any comments that it has received, whether
the vehicle is eligible for importation. The agency then publishes this decision in the 

Federal Register

.
Champagne Imports, Inc. of Lansdale, Pennsylvania (Registered Importer No. R-90-009) has petitioned
NHTSA to decide whether 1993 BMW 840Ci passenger cars are eligible for importation into the United States. The vehicle
which Champagne believes is substantially similar is the 1993 BMW 850Ci. Champagne has submitted information indicating
that Bayerische-Motoren Werke A.G., the company that manufactured the 1993 BMW 850Ci, certified that vehicle as
conforming to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards and offered it for sale in the United States.
The petitioner contends that it carefully compared the 840Ci to the 850Ci, and found the two models to be substantially
similar with respect to compliance with most applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards.
Champagne submitted information with its petition intended to demonstrate that the 1993 model 840Ci, as originally
manufactured, conforms to many Federal motor vehicle safety standards in the same manner as the 1993 model 850Ci that
was offered for sale in the United States, or is capable of being readily altered to conform to those standards.
Specifically, the petitioner claims that the 1993 model 840Ci is identical to the certified 1993 model 850Ci with
respect to compliance with Standards Nos. 102

Petitioner also contends that the vehicle is capable of being readily altered to meet the following standards, in
the manner indicated:
Standard No. 101 Controls and Displays: 

(a) Substitution of a lens marked ``Brake'' for a lens with an ECE symbol on the brake failure indicator lamp; (b) installation

Background


Under 49 U.S.C. 30141(a)(1)(A) (formerly section 108(c)(3)(i)(I) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety
Act (the Act)), a motor vehicle that was not originally manufactured to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle
safety standards shall be refused admission into the United States unless NHTSA has decided that the motor vehicle
is substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the United States,
certified under 49 U.S.C. 30115 (formerly section 114 of the Act), and of the same model year as the model of the motor
vehicle to be compared, and is capable of being readily altered to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle
safety standards.
Petitions for eligibility decisions may be submitted by either manufacturers or importers who have registered with
NHTSA pursuant to 49 CFR Part 592. As specified in 49 CFR 593.7, NHTSA publishes notice in the 

Federal Register

 of each petition that it receives, and affords interested persons an opportunity to comment on the petition. At the
close of the comment period, NHTSA decides, on the basis of the petition and any comments that it has received, whether
the vehicle is eligible for importation. The agency then publishes this decision in the 

Federal Register.


Champagne Imports, Inc. of Lansdale, Pennsylvania (``Champagne'') (Registered Importer 90-009) has petitioned
NHTSA to decide whether 1993 Mercedes-Benz 300CE convertible passenger cars (Model ID 124.061) are eligible for
importation into the United States. The vehicle which Champagne believes is substantially similar is the 1993 Mercedes-Benz
300CE convertible that was manufactured for importation into, and sale in, the United States and certified by its
manufacturer, Daimler Benz A.G., as conforming to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards.
The petitioner claims that it carefully compared the non-U.S. certified 1993 Mercedes-Benz 300CE convertible to
its U.S. certified counterpart, and found the two vehicle to be substantially similar with respect to compliance
with most Federal motor vehicle safety standards.
Champagne submitted information with its petition intended to demonstrate that the non-U.S. certified 1993 Mercedes-Benz
300CE convertible, as originally manufactured, conforms to many Federal motor vehicle safety standards in the same
manner as its U.S. certified counterpart, or is capable of being readily altered to conform to those standards.
Specifically, the petitioner claims that the non-U.S. certified 1993 Mercedes-Benz 300CE convertible is identical
to its U.S. certified counterpart with respect to compliance with Standards Nos. 102
